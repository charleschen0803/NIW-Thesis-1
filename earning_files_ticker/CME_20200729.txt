CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the CME Group Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, I would like to
turn the conference over to John Peschier, please go ahead, sir.

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'm going to start with the safe harbor language, and I'm
going to turn it over to Terry, Julie and John for brief remarks followed by questions. Other members of
our management team will also participate in the Q&A. Statements made on this call and in the other
reference documents on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions
that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our
performance can be found on our website. Also on the last page of the earnings release, you will find a
reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

With that, I'll turn it over to Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us today. My comments today will be brief so we can spend
the majority of our time, directly addressing your questions. We released our executive commentary this
morning, which provided extensive details on the second quarter. As John mentioned, Sean -- John, Sean,
Derek and Julie Winkler have joined me today. In Q2, we averaged 17.6 million contracts per day, which is
down from 21 million contracts per day a year ago and down from our strong start to the year in Q1. The
global exchange-traded market has been challenged in many different product areas since the beginning
of the pandemic, impacting us and many others in the trading industry. Clearly, the front end of the U.S.
rate curve has become impacted from a trading perspective. Also with the recovery of the price of oil back
to the $40 range, the global crude oil market has stabilized with a fairly flat forward curve, leading to a
reduction in the volatility back to more normalized levels as the market balances supply and demand.
While in the near term, that reduces the need for some participants to manage risk with us and others,
the competitive dynamic of trading volumes across different markets has not changed. However, with the
global crude oil demand still depressed due to the COVID-19, which we believe is a temporary situation,
we expect to see market conditions improve as global oil demand returns.

We are very fortunate to have a highly diversified business. We are looking forward to the integration of
BrokerTec coming onto Globex by year-end. We remain committed to achieving capital and operational
efficiencies for our clients. Through all of this, I assure you, we remain very disciplined as it relates to
expenses. What I'd like to do is turn the call over to Julie Winkler to provide some context on our sales
outreach, what we are hearing from our customers, and she will touch briefly upon our data business. And
then I look forward to answering your questions. Julie?

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Thank you, Terry. Despite challenging circumstances, we are continuing to see positive momentum in our
global client engagement. Similar to last quarter, many of our clients continue to work from home, and
our sales organization has excelled at their virtual outreach. During Q2, client engagement by our sales
organization was up 66% versus the same period last year. And year-to-date, sales activity is up 81%.
We are actively engaging with clients via virtual meetings, webinars, online events, e-mail communication
and chat to support the execution of our sales and go-to-market strategy. Clients continue to express their
appreciation for how highly responsive we have been through the peak of the crisis and our continued

CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

focus on delivering value-added solutions across product lines. Clients in some areas are beginning to
return to the office, which means we will take appropriate steps to adjust our coverage model where safe
and appropriate.

In Q2, we also saw an acceleration of our cross-introduction and cross-sell efforts to capitalize on the
next acquisition. May represented a record high month with more than 300 cross-introductions across our
sales organization, which is more than the entire first quarter combined. A total of 500 cross-introductions
were made throughout Q2. Additionally, we reinvigorated campaign selling to help bring key products and
services to market. We are seeing great success with those campaigns, including the relaunch of our 3-
year treasury product, which had more than 40 clients participating on day 1 of trading. Our active trader
retail segment performance was strong in Q2 and year-to-date, ADV is up over 70%, driven by an overall
increase in retail trading resulting from the lockdown. CME was well positioned prior to these events and
its product mix, particularly the E-micros, allowed it to take advantage of strong macro factors.

Lastly, our market data business had a strong quarter. Through the first half of 2020, consolidated revenue
was up 3%. The CME market data professional subscribers count was solid due to increased subscriptions
as traders were migrating to work-from-home environments. We continue to see success with our data
services strategy, which confirms the value of our data to our global customer base. I will now turn things
over to John.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Julie. In the first half of the year, in addition to navigating the challenging environment, we've
been very active with the ongoing NEX integration. We remain on track to migrate from the legacy NEX
trading systems to our Globex technology. We recently announced to our clients the cutover dates for
BrokerTec. BrokerTec EU clients will begin trading on November 16, and BrokerTec Americas trading
will commence on December 7. With our progress on the integration, the remote working environment
and our overall strong expense discipline, we finished the second quarter with adjusted operating
expenses, excluding license fees, of $380 million. We are extremely focused on actively managing our
costs. Based on our outlook for expenses for the rest of the year, our guidance for adjusted operating
expenses, excluding license fees for 2020 is being reduced from a range of $1.64 billion to $1.65 billion
to approximately $1.595 billion. This level of spending reflects the reality of the current operating
environment, and we would expect a higher level of spending next year, assuming that conditions improve
from here.
With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Based on the number of
analysts covering us, please limit yourself to one question, and then feel free to jump back into the queue.
Thank you.

CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.

Richard Henry Repetto
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I guess the first -- my question is on expenses, and you made a solid reduction, John, in the expense
guidance. But I guess the question is, the first half run rate is -- you're averaging somewhere around $383
million in expenses ex licensing fees. If you back into that full year guidance, it'd be an 8.5% increase
in the back half. And you got -- hopefully, you got the $15 million of P&L expenses coming from the NEX
synergies. So I guess the question is, can we go -- if the current environment didn't rebound, say, in
2020, is there more room to cut expenses? Because I know there's some events that have already been
canceled and so forth.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thank you, Rich. Thanks for the question. In terms of the first half versus the back half of the year,
we do expect to have some increase in costs in the back half of the year, as, for example, in depreciation
as we migrate on to Globex. And also we're in the process of data center consolidation effort, and we
have a build-out of a data center in the New York, New Jersey area as part of the integration efforts that
we're doing with NEX. Also, we do have planned for the back half of the year, some opening of the --
some economies around the world where we would expect to see some more travel and marketing efforts
as those economies open up. So that is planned for sort of in the back half of the year. If that doesn't
happen, obviously, we wouldn't expect those costs to come through. But in terms of our guidance, we did
make some assumption that there would be a modest opening in Asia, in particular, for example.

In terms of our overall expense discipline, we are, as a management team, very focused on our expenses
for this year and in planning for next year. So we have a laser-like focus on our expenses. And we're -- the
entire organization is making sure that we spend every dollar as efficiently as we possibly could spend it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

My question is on market data. Julie, you mentioned some of the strength. If you could kind of elaborate
on the outlook for that business and how we should think about growth in the broader market data
business for the remainder of this year and then the next?

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Sure. Thank you, Dan. Yes, as mentioned, we had a great Q2 with consolidated revenue in the market
data business of $135 million, which is up about 5% over the second quarter of 2019. And the majority
of that was driven by those increased professional subscriber counts. So what has happened, right, is
that in this work-from-home configuration, we're seeing modest demand in display devices. And it's also
just coupled with other licensing that we're doing across the business. And so we're continuing to closely
consult with our data vendors and our clients to gather input. We have a really great channel partner base
for our data distribution, which gives us really a wide range of very flexible ways to deliver our data and
new products.

As we kind of look at the outlook and what else we see, we still see increased need for our data in terms
of automated trading solutions, and we also are seeing that in terms of using our data into product

creation. So that comes through as both nondisplay license revenue as well as derived data revenue.
We are certainly focused on the NEX data integration, along with what we're doing on the Globex side,
there also is a lot of NEX data that needs to be integrated. As well as continuing to create more flexible
distribution channels in terms of what you saw us announce with our CME SmartStream and other new
products. So this last quarter, we did the successful addition of the new 10-year treasury bond as well
in our NEX data product. And that just coupled with continued strength in our policy, our pricing and our
audit functions. And really making sure that our clients have that level playing field and access to our
data, I think, is contributing and as well as the outlook for our market data business.

Operator

We will next go to Alex Kramm with UBS.

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. I know this is a difficult question to answer on the rate side, but everybody can obviously see the
volume and open interest trends. But curious if there are any other data points you guys are looking at
anything in conversations with clients that gives you some confidence that we may have troughed here
and that things can improve when certain events happen or if maybe people will start putting more risk
on, et cetera. Like what are you looking for to get comfort?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Why don't we -- Alex, thank you for that question. I'm going to ask Sean Tully to give you his take on
that, which he's been obviously briefing all of us, his thoughts with his team. So Sean?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Thanks very much for the question. A really good question. During the March time frame, we saw a
very high volatility in interest rates. And if we look more recently in the month of July, we've seen
unprecedented low volatility across the entire yield curve from our Eurodollar futures all the way out to our
Ultra Bond futures. In fact, if you look at our 8 Eurodollar futures, this is the lowest volatility we have seen
since the inception of the contract in 1987. Nonetheless, the level of uncertainty in economic numbers has
never been higher when seen from the perspective of the range of possible outcomes for numbers such as
unemployment and GDP. While the Fed is currently doing everything possible to support the economy in
the short run. And during the month of March and April, bought as much as $300 billion a week worth of
securities. And in fact, increased the size of its balance sheet from $4.2 trillion to $7.2 trillion or plus 2.9
-- sorry, or up $2.9 trillion in a period of just over 3 months, including the purchase of $1.7 trillion with
our securities, those actions obviously have dampened volatility tremendously. Nonetheless, if you look at
what happens post the financial crisis, when the federal reserve between 2008 and 2014, purchased $3.6
trillion. They then later on, proactively reduced the size of their balance sheet, in particular, they reduced
the size of their balance sheet from $4.5 trillion to $3.7 trillion from January of 2018 to September of
2019, from which we did get additional volumes and volatility.

If you look at the unprecedented deficit this year, estimated at $3.7 trillion. Now estimated potentially $2
trillion of deficit next year, you're going to see the highest debt-to-GDP ratios that U.S. government has
seen, certainly since World War II and possibly ever. You're going to see the highest levels of debt in the
U.S. ever. If you look at the refunding announcements, so if you look at the refunding announcements
we had in the quarterly refunding announcement by the U.S. treasury in February versus the quarterly
refunding announcement that we had in May. The growth in coupon issuance was 24% by the U.S.
government in order to address that huge debt and deficits need. Next week, we're at the -- next August,
the August quarterly refunding announcement. The growth in coupon securities, the growth in debt and
deficits, once the Federal Reserve reduces its intervention in the market. And once the pandemic recedes,
the needs for hedging, the needs for our products are going to be much, much larger, I think, than ever
before in history. So yes, July is very low volatility. However, the unprecedented debt and deficits and
issuance of coupon securities means that the risk that is going to need to be managed on a go-forward

basis is going to be much larger than ever. I said earlier that the Federal Reserve was buying as much as
$300 billion plus a week in securities. It's now reduced that to $20 billion a week. So we're already seeing
significantly reduced activity by the Fed. I hope that helps.

Operator

Next, we will go to Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just wanted to, Sean, maybe a follow-on on those comments. I guess it is an interesting dynamic of
the potential, like you said, in terms of the hedgeability or the hedgeable assets that can -- hedgeable
treasury outstanding stock that will need to be hedged and speculated on. I guess what's your view on if
the Fed stays in an intervention mode for a prolonged period of time, is there anything you can do on your
end at CME to stimulate those rate volumes? Or really -- we're kind of dependent on that environment.
And then maybe just a second question tied to that. Maybe you can also talk about the equity index
franchise. You've got a lot of new products coming on. In terms of the options and the TACO offering as
well, if you can talk about your efforts there and outlook for volume growth in those areas?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Sean?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes, of course. Thanks very much. I really appreciate the question. We're very excited, as you know,
innovation has been one of our mantras over the last several years, has always been part of CME Group's
DNA. But our innovation continues unabated. And the results so far this year are extremely strong. If
you look at the first half of 2020, products launched since 2010, this is data that we frequently update
for you. Anyway, the first half of this year, we achieved 3.2 million contracts, ADV, a new product launch
since 2010. You'll recall that last year, those same products were just 2.1 million ADV. So we've seen 52%
growth year-over-year in the ADV of those products launched since 2010. In addition to that, in the first
half this year, we earned $193 million in revenues. Likewise, up annualized about 25% year-over-year. So
the innovation continues on an extremely strong basis across all of our asset classes and is definitely a
driver of growth. The single greatest product launch in CME Group history, as you will be aware by now, is
our Micro E-mini. The Micro E-mini have achieved 1.6 million contract ADV so far this year. And if you look
at the second quarter, they achieved a 1.9 million.

If you look at other -- actually, in addition to that, we have recently announced on August 31, we will
be launching micro options. So these are the smaller options that are the option equivalent of the Micro
E-mini futures, which we're very excited about relative to the very significant uptake that we've had in
micros. If you look at the micro and another thing regarding the micros that we've talked about through
time is their RPC. When we launch a new product, we typically have higher incentives. So that net RPC is
going to be lower. As you know, in the second quarter of 2019, the RPC on the Micro E-mini was $0.068.
We told you at the time that we would be reducing those incentives over time and that, that RPC would
increase. We're very happy to say that in the second quarter of 2020, they're about $0.125 per Micro E-
mini, so nearly double the RPC of a year ago.

In addition to that, we recently launched the new 3-year treasury future, relaunched the new 3-year
treasury futures. We did it as we always do in terms of having a product that delivers a lower total cost
with, in fact, half of the minimum price increment of the previous contract that existed. We're very excited
about our traction in the new 3-year future. On the first day of that contract, we had 40 participants. We
had more than 50 participants in total since launch as of today. We're achieving over 3,000 ADV a day. On
the first day, we achieved more volume on Globex in that contract than we did in our Ultra 10 Year future.
So we are very excited about participants there from banks, asset managers, hedge funds and about
5,500 contracts open interest, which shows that it's real end users that are trading the product. That gets

CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

me back to the previous, I guess, all-time great launch of CME Group history with the Ultra 10 Year future.
I'm very happy to say that the Ultra 10 Year future, even in this environment, the ADV is 262,000 a day,
we're up about 21% year-over-year. And its open interest is 977,000 contracts, likewise, up well over 20%
year-over-year.

So we continue to see in the -- innovation. So during COVID, we launched a very successful new 3-
year treasury. We've seen extremely strong growth in our Micro E-minis. And products like our recently
launched Ultra 10 Year continue to thrive. I might mention our SOFR futures. SOFR futures, volumes are
up 58% year-over-year. 45,000 contracts a day. ADV, we had a record open interest in March of 612,000
contracts. And again, huge growth with 3.2 million contracts a day in ADV from the financials unit coming
this year from innovative products. Thanks for the question.

Operator

Next, we will move to Ari Ghosh with CME Group (sic) [ Crédit Suisse ].

Arinash Ghosh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Maybe just a quick one for Sean on the metals complex. Smaller revenue piece here, but could be facing
some nice tailwinds given Fed intervention and the rounds of stimulus. And you've also launched a new
flex delivery gold contract so just curious, the level of interest you're seeing here, are you seeing interest
build? And then any color on broader customer trends out of Asia, where you've typically seen strong
demand for both your metals and equity index products?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

All right. We're going to have Derek Sammann answer that, who heads up our metals complex. So Derek?

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes, thanks for the question. It's Derek here. Yes, metals continues to be a big area of growth for us, not
only just coming off the overall macro environment that's very positive for gold and the points that you've
made. The -- we just recently have revisited the highs and come back to the highs of a little over $1,900
that we just -- last week it has -- back in March. The business this year has been spectacular. And to be
honest, it's actually seen significant market share gains relative to the broader OTC market in the bullion
market in London over the last 5 years as well. From a client perspective, we put up record numbers in
Q1, actually record first half numbers as well. And what's really interesting, what we like about the metals
business and the precious, particularly, is the point you just made, our international growth continues to
set the pace for the overall participation in our markets.

When you look at the first half business this year, overall, the business is up 18%. Our Asian business is
up 30% and -- from APAC. What we like about the non-U.S. business, as I think you're aware, is that our
rate per contract associated with our non-U.S. customer base comes at a substantially higher rate than
our U.S. franchise, primarily because they tend to be a lower percent of members, and we also see folks in
the retail bucket and kind of the buy side participants come in at higher RPC. So the overall macro trends
for gold have been and continue to be very positive. The non-U.S. business continues to set the pace. And
I think one of the really interesting things that we've seen, not only in the volume growth and participation
from Europe and Asia, is -- and not a lot of people pay attention to this. We are at all-time record stocks
of gold in our depositories. If you go back to February, March of this year, we had about 8.5 million, 9
million ounces of gold in our COMEX warehouses. We're up to a little bit north of 30 million ounces right
now. And that tells you not only the volume trends, the global participation and the growth in the non-
U.S. business, but it also means when the depositories grow like that, clearly, the market is voting with its
feet to determine that COMEX-branded warehouse depositories is the place where they want to have their
metals, and that's been driving broader participation.

CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

So it becomes a virtuous cycle of volume growth, international participation, adding more materials into
the warehouse. And that's been one of the major reasons why we've seen not just growth in the metals
volumes overall, but continued high strong growth in our rate per contract as well. I think our total rate
per contract in our overall metals complex is the highest RPC contract we have at about $1.46 despite the
fact that business is up 17%, 18% volume wise. We actually have an RPC that's drifting a little bit higher.
I think it's about 1% up year-on-year. So strong growth in the non-U.S. participant, strong vote in terms
of the metals flowing into depositories. And that's reflected both in the volumes, revenues and the higher
rate per contract despite higher volumes.

We will next go to Chris Allen of Compass Point.

Christopher John Allen
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

I appreciate the incremental color on the cross-selling efforts. Wonder if you could give us any numbers in
terms of how that's translating in to whether it's volumes or open interest? And also if you can provide an
update, whether there's been any progress on the clearing front, in terms of realizing any synergies would
change -- for customers who change CME and DTCC. And maybe just to refresh on what expectations are
in terms of the benefits once the technology migrations over to Globex are completed?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

I want to ask Julie Winkler to talk a little bit about the cross-selling and then on clearing with DTCC on the
margin benefits. Sean can address that question. So Julie, why don't you start?

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. Yes. We're really making outstanding progress as we think about
how we've been able to integrate the sales team to support cross-selling as we kind of expected, right,
there was a natural dip in those cross-introductions in late March and April is really the sales reps were
focused on supporting those clients through this unprecedented volatility. But now what we're seeing is
those efforts are really accelerating at a record pace. So you looked at Q2, and I mentioned it earlier, the
500 cross-introductions. May was a new monthly high for us, where we did 300 across our respective
businesses, a little more insight on that. So nearly 70% of the cross-introductions that have been made
have occurred for the transactional-based businesses in Q2.

The FX franchise is really a cornerstone of that and is at the forefront of the cross-introduction efforts. So
that would be optimization or EBS or BrokerTec clients that are being referred into our futures and options
or our core business. And kind of right after the FX, the other introductions have been happening with EBS
as well as interest rates. So for futures and options as well as Traiana end market data. I'd say, the other
probably standout client segment that we're seeing momentum with cross-selling is for our commercial
clientele. And that's really happening across EBS as well as our optimization product suite. And so this
is really kind of based on the investment that we're making in our global sales force and providing them
with the training and the tools that they need to effectively cross-sell this holistic suite of products. So still
early days for specifics in terms of the revenue that those items are generating. Obviously, as we go into
these clients going live with these products, we'll have more information on that. Thanks for the question.
I'll turn it back to you, Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Julie. Sean, do you want to address the clearing benefits with DTCC that we're working on?

CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Yes, absolutely. So as you mentioned, we are working very closely with DTCC on creating benefits or
working on increasing our benefits and the potential to cross-margin between our treasury futures and
cash treasuries. Those benefits today for the handful of clients to take advantage of them, typically at
20% or 30% worth of offsets. We do expect to get those offset percentages closer to 70% plus. Once the
agreements are finalized and approved by the regulators, we are working very closely with them on that.
We don't have any announcements in that regard yet though. I would like to mention, nonetheless, that
in terms of delivering margin capital total cost efficiencies to our customers, this is something we work on
every day, and we have several initiatives.

So for example, with the increased volatility this year and with therefore, the significant increases in
margins that are required in order to cover the more volatile product. And we have seen a significant
uptick in portfolio margining between our OTC swaps and our interest rate futures. We added 7 new clients
this year. So up to 55 clients and 2 clients who had stopped using the service have started using it once
again. So this year, on average, we've achieved $5.4 billion worth of margin savings for our clients. And
that's an all to -- all-time record new high in terms of the average for the year-to-date. In addition to
that, we are working hard. The clearinghouse is working hard on creating portfolio margining between our
listed interest rate options and interest rate swaps as well. And that is another efficiency that we hope
to launch in the next several months, which will also add unique efficiencies to the marketplace. So yes,
we're working on the efficiencies of the DTCC. We're getting greater traction in our portfolio margining
against OTC swaps. And we're also looking to add portfolio margin against our listed interest rate options.

We will next go to Mike Carrier with Bank of America.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a bigger picture question. But given the rate backdrop, I just wanted to get your take on this cycle
versus the prior one. So the last time rates were here you guys worked with clients, and you were fairly
innovative in creating new products, which eventually played out, but it did take some time. So in this
backdrop, are you seeing similar trends in terms of demand for some of those contracts or even product
innovation or is it too early? And is the low rate backdrop impacting other product areas, look similarly or
not versus last cycle?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Sean, do you want to go ahead and address that and then I'll jump in as well?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Sure. If you look at volatility, they're very different across the different markets. And you can see that
in our volume numbers, right? So that's -- obviously, volatility is something that is out of our control.
The product innovation, the interaction with clients, delivering additional value. That's all in our control,
and we do that every day, the volatility is outside of our control. As I said earlier, the month of July, all-
time record low volatilities across the curve from Eurodollars all the way out to the Ultra Bond. If you
look at the 8 Eurodollar future, the last time we've seen something like this, not surprisingly, the month
of July looks to me a lot like October of 2012. And if you think about it, as I said earlier, the Federal
Reserve has intervened by buying $2.9 trillion worth of securities, so increasing their balance sheet by
$2.9 trillion right in a period of 3 or 4 months. That is almost as much intervention as they did during
the entire financial crisis. During the entire financial crisis, their balance sheet grew by instead of $2.9
trillion, about $3.6 trillion. So they've already bought almost as many securities as they did back then. So
unprecedented speed. And I think that's why the July volumes look similar, again, to October 2012.

In terms of innovation, we're very excited about the 3-year treasury future that I mentioned earlier. We're
also very excited about growth that we've seen in our long end with the additional coupons, even with
the intervention by the Federal Reserve. If you look at, as I said earlier, the ADV of the Ultra 10 Year up

more than 20% year-over-year. The bond future ADV, if you look at the full year, ADV is up 13%, and the
-- that's the bond future and the Ultra Bond up about 16%. So we continue to see more trading further
out the curve. We had an e-mail announcement out to our clients today, reminding that -- about the great
use of our bond and Ultra Bond futures in regards to the new 20-year issue. As you'll recall during that
May refunding, there was the announcement of the new 20-year bond by the U.S. Treasury. During the
quarterly auction series, the 3 months, the treasury did issue $50 billion worth of those bonds. And we
have seen very good growth in our Ultra Bond and our bond futures, where those are being used as a
hedge against that new 20-year issue.

If you look at, for example, intercommodity spreads, the single most popular intercommodity spread
in our rates complex today is now what we call the BoB spread or bond versus Ultra Bond. And this is
specifically around that new 20-year issue and the dynamics there. Where during the WI period, when
the new 20-year started trading. The new 20-year bond sits right at the center of the deliverable basket
of our bonds future. And the marketplace shows that it would trade in WI as a spread to the cheapest to
deliver to our Ultra Bond future. So we are seeing increasing use of our products further out the curve as
the treasury is issuing more securities. We're constantly looking as well at things like lower minimum price
increments. So you know that we had great success in lowering the minimum price increment on cash 2-
year notes as well as 2-year note futures.

You'll recall, we did that at the beginning of 2019. And we saw approximately an extra 160,000 contracts
a day, additional volume in our 2-year note futures. That was one of the things that caused us to work the
3-year with a lower minimum price increment, matching the minimum on price increment on the 2-year
and half of the minimum price increment that, that contract had previously. And again, with a successful
start. Whether it is in the cash treasury bond market where we now have BrokerTec, we are definitely
looking there at the innovation, the possibility for lowering minimum price increments and what we can
do there. And I'll also answer your question with BrokerTec. We are moving on very well in terms of the
migration of BrokerTec from the BrokerTec existing platform today over to CME Globex. And we -- as
John mentioned earlier, we do expect that cutover later this year. Next year, we will migrate EBS from its
existing platform over to Globex.

ESG. I'll turn it over to Julie because she can talk a little bit about some of the work that her research
team is doing regarding product development on the ESG space.

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. Thanks, John, and thanks for the question, Owen. We did introduce our first ESG report just a few
weeks ago on our website, which talks a little bit more broadly about CME Group's ESG strategy. And a
key part of that is definitely our product-related strategy and where the progress that we've been making
in terms of cross-functional ESG product committee has really been looking at this across our product
suite. And we believe there are some great opportunities to adjust some of our existing products as well
as some new product introduction, and we are looking to get some of those rolled out before the balance
of the year. There is a lot of interest from our client base, particularly in Europe, I would say, a lot of
investor interest, and that's been a key part of the success of our ESG 500 S&P index futures contracts.
And we believe that, that will also help drive some of the interest in these other benchmarks that we look
to introduce later this year.

Operator

We will move to our next question. That comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.

Jeremy Edward Campbell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And Sean, thanks for the macro color around the rates and the puts and takes of the outlook from here.
I'm just wondering about the rates activity impacts once we control for the number of users. You guys
have hooked into the CME futures ecosystem. Like I think over the past like 6 to 8 years since the prior
year is your right environment, your user base has grown in both the U.S. and abroad, but you have ADVs
excluding the first quarter here that are kind of tracking more in line with 2012 to 2014 level. So I know
volatility is crazy low, and maybe it's the Fed crowding everybody out a bit. But I would have thought even
materially lower activity levels per user might have yielded a better overall activity level than the prior
cycle.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Sean?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes, I think that's a very good question. And I think your supposition is a good one. The challenge that
we're facing is that the volatility we're seeing in July is, in fact, lower than we saw in October of 2012, for
example, which was the all-time low for the 8 Eurodollar future. So as I said earlier, the volatility in that 8
Eurodollar future, if you look at a continuous contract, is, in fact, the lowest it's ever been since the launch
of the product. So I agree with your supposition. The volatility environment is more challenging now than
it was in 2012, in fact, from that metric perspective. But again, with the unprecedented increase in the
size of the debt and deficit as well as the unprecedented uncertainty around the unemployment numbers
and the GDP numbers, for example, I do believe that on a go-forward basis, that there's going to be more
hedging than ever before needed in the future once the pandemic recedes.

believe there's a decent amount of NEX synergies that should flow through next year. So maybe you can
flesh out why spending would exceed the synergies next year?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

John?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, Chris, this is John. Thank you for the question. In terms of our expense outlook, you're correct.
It is early days to be able to provide you some guidance. We're all very hopeful that we can have the
economies around the world open up safely. Should the environment improve you would see, for example,
a higher level of travel and marketing spend as we look to intensify our client outreach. So that would
mean that our expenses might be higher than the low single digits as we are growing off an artificially low
base. And when I say low single digits, that's really our core expense growth base, growth rates. So if you
look over the last several years, our expense growth rate on the core side has been about 2.5% to 3%.
And as you can imagine, with sales and our in-person marketing has been really curtailed the sales efforts
in terms of travel and entertainment and marketing has really been curtailed during the pandemic. And
hopefully, as the economies open up, we'll see a more intensified in person where we can experience for
our clients.

In terms of synergies, you're right. The bulk of the synergies, run rate synergy capture is in front of us.
We targeted $50 million last year. We exceeded that target and hit $64 million. We're targeting $110
million in run rate synergies for this year, and we're well on our way to achieving that $110 million run
rate. When you take a look at the amount of realized synergies that we have in our income statement in
2020, we anticipated that being approximately $15 million, and we've been able to accelerate that realized
synergies to $25 million, and that was also something that was -- that we were able to use to help reduce
our overall expense guidance for 2020. So really, when you think about our expense growth going into
next year, similar to the model that we used this year, we've got a core expense growth rate of 2.5%
to 3%. And we would make any adjustments for any additional spending relative to coming out of the
COVID. We would obviously reduce that for the amount of realized synergies in 2021 that we would get
through the migration of EBS towards the back half of 2021. So we'd see synergy capture there.

We'd also see a full year impact of the synergy capture when we migrate off of -- migrate BrokerTec off
the legacy platforms onto Globex. So the puts and takes are, in general, a core expense growth rate, any
adjustments related to coming out of the COVID, and that's going to be offset by our synergy capture as
we migrate off of the legacy NEX systems into our Globex platform. But I mean, I think the long and short
of it, though, is we, as a management team, are laser-focused on our expenses going into this year and
going into next year. This is something that we are going to have a strong eye on throughout the rest of
this year and as we plan for 2021. So thank you -- thanks for the question, Chris.

during the second quarter?

CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Yes. So I haven't seen that, actually. So if you -- and let me actually clarify that, right? So if you look
at the central limit order book share of the dealer-to-dealer market, our market share over the last 12
months has actually increased. When we look at market share, we look at the dealer-to-dealer market.
You may be looking at the dealer, the customer market plus the dealer-to-dealer market, which we don't
compete in the dealer to customer market. So that may be a difference there. We have seen a small drop
in the overall -- and our share of the overall dealer-to-dealer market. And what I mean in that regard is
there is some traction in dealer-to-dealer space coming from relationship-based trading platforms. On
that front, we are working hard on a few things. First, we have launched BrokerTec stream which is our
BrokerTec dealer-to-dealer relationship-based trading platform, and we are making progress on that front.
We also look to enhance that technology. So we are investing in technology that's already been planned to
improve that technology, so that becomes more competitive relative to alternative platforms.

We also will offer unique benefits because we have the most significant central limit order book and
dealer-to-dealer space. And once we have that better technology in the dealer to dealer -- in the direct
trading dealer-to-dealer space. So again, main messages. First, I think you may be looking at the overall
treasury market, which would include dealer to customer, which we don't compete in. Dealer to customer
has grown relative to dealer to dealer. Within the dealer-to-dealer space, our share of market in terms of
central limit order books has actually grown over the last 12 months. If you look at the overall dealer-to-
dealer market, it has receded -- by my calculations by about 5 percentage points, maybe 6. And again,
relative to the direct trading platforms. And we are building our own and looking to grow. Thanks for the
question.

We will go next to Kyle Voigt with KBW.

Kyle Kenneth Voigt
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Maybe just a cleanup question for John on net investment income. I think 2Q revenues there imply a bit
higher than the 2 basis point yield you mentioned last quarter. Just wondering if you could give the 2Q
average cash balances and the yield on that in 2Q and maybe how those balances and the yield on those
have trended into the third quarter.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

John?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Terry. Thanks, Kyle. Thanks for your question. Yes. When you take a look at our
nonoperating income and expense portion of our income statement, sequentially, it's down about $15
million, and that's made of primarily 3 items. One, you're correct. When you look at the returns we earn
on cash held by clients at the clearinghouse, it came down. As we mentioned last quarter, the interest
on excess reserves came down to about 10 basis points in the middle of March. And with that move, we
adjusted our rates accordingly. That reduced our net returns from net 19 basis points in Q1 to 4 basis
points in Q2, and that was partially offset by higher average cash balances, which more than doubled to
$83 billion. So that's what drove the sequential reduction. Now we did have a higher investment returns
from the 2 basis points to approximately 4 basis points. And that's because we were able to leverage some
or -- I shouldn't say leverage, but invest in higher-yielding instruments, than at the Fed. So we were able
to take advantage of some of that, which allowed us to increase our yield from about 2 to 4.

In terms of the other items in that section, we did see a reduction in the earnings from the JV of about $2
million. It's important to note that year-to-date, this line is up about 18.6% compared to last year. And
then we saw a small reduction in our corporate investing activities of about $1 million. In terms of our
leverage, again, as I mentioned last quarter, we did hit our 1x debt-to-EBITDA target, and we paid off the
balance of $100 million in commercial paper this quarter. So we have no commercial paper outstanding.

CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

So that would impact our interest expense, which would roll into this line. In terms of activity going into
the third quarter. When you take a look at the average so far in July, our cash -- average cash balance
is about $71.5 billion that compares to the average in Q2 of $83.1 billion. So that's -- that should break
down, Kyle.

Kyle Kenneth Voigt
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And should that 4 basis point yield be sustainable?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

It's really that -- I would anticipate higher than the 2 basis points at this point. I don't have a forecast in
terms of interest rates getting to the 4 basis points. But right now, I would say it's going to be higher than
the 2.

We will take our next question from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt.

Kenneth William Hill
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask on the international front here in 1Q, I think the growth was pretty strong out of Asia
and Europe, up 73% and 54%. It looks like Asia in 2Q was still slightly positive, but I didn't see a number
for Europe. So I was hoping you could provide that number for what Europe looked like in 2Q? And then
maybe more broadly comment on how the environment trended throughout the quarter? Did you see
people coming back into the market as the pandemic might have eased in those areas? Or what are you
seeing in the region today as well?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

John, you want to start and I'll ask Julie to join in as well.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thank you. Thanks, Terry. Yes. Thanks, Ken. So in terms of our international activity, year-to-date,
it continues to outpace U.S. performance. For the quarter, our international business faced really tough
comparables. As you know, Q2 of 2019 was the second-highest quarter for international activity behind
Q1 of this year. For the quarter, APAC grew about 1% year-over-year. Six out of our top 10 countries,
including our top 3 of Singapore, Korea and Hong Kong were up and 4 out of the top 10 were up double
digits. Looking at EMEA, it was down about 11% year-over-year. But what we did see is we saw 5 out
of the top 10 countries there were up and 3 of those top 10 countries were up double digits. And the
Netherlands which is our second-largest country by volume was up triple digits. Now we did see some
migration from the U.K. to the Netherlands in anticipation of Brexit, but we also saw very strong growth
there as well. So our overall international activity for the quarter was in line with full year 2019 ADV, which
is a strong year for us in 2019. So I'll turn it over to Julie in terms of the customer experience.

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. As you know, much of our international activity is driven by that active trader retail client segment,
equities and metals being products that were significantly transacted by those clients. And when we're
looking across the space, Q2 was very strong in revenue for that segment. We saw over 130,000 new
accounts coming into our market through that active trader segment. That was up more than 100% year-
on-year. So obviously, the volatility is there, but also just this work-from-home and lockdown environment
is really making that particular segment trade even more with us. And also just point out, as we think

about those new customers, so over 50% of those new customers that I just spoke about, again, most of
those being international traded at least 1 of our 4 E-micro equity index products. And 20% of those new
customers had only traded an E-micro. And so we continue to see that being a great new client acquisition
driver for us in terms of the product suite. And that we believe is also going to lend well to that E-micro
options launch that we have coming up in Q3. Of those new clients that came in from over 166 different
countries around the world. So while the U.S. was strong, as John pointed out, out as well, Taiwan, South
Korea, Hong Kong, China, we're definitely seeing those countries and participants within those countries
work, trade more with us as well as the work that we're doing with our broker partners is really helping to
drive some of those numbers. I hope that helps.

We will go to our next question from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe just wrapping up on oil and gas trading. So what is your perspective on the impact, if any, from
the negative WTI pricing during the April delivery and has there been any lasting impact on trading
behavior or participation? And then why do you think there might have not been greater acceptance of
the Houston-based products? They seem like a great product, but they really haven't taken off any views
there.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Derek?

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Ken, thanks for the question. Yes, good question. The -- when you look at the impacts of both the extreme
levels of high volatility and the price uncertainty driven by the huge demand destruction by the supply
concerns as created by the Saudis. And then some of the questions around storage, what we saw from
the primary output from the negative pricing on April 20 was for those firms that had problems with their
systems being able to handle negative pricing, we've seen brokers and intermediaries largely update their
systems in the anticipation that they need to be able to handle both pricing, but frankly, margining for
their clients in case negative pricing happens again going forward. We did see some brokers initially pull
out of allowing customers, primarily in the retail side from being able to trade stock trading in both WTI
and Brent and that did impact some of the self-directed trading volumes, but we're seeing some of that
business come back online now that most of those brokers, if not all, have updated their systems.

Really, the biggest change that we've seen from April, high degrees of volatility. I think we saw frontline
WTI spike up to close to 160% volatility. And the biggest change over the last 3 months as we've actually
seen the normalization of the overall supply and the band dynamics in the global crude market. You
certainly saw OPEC out there announcing their decisions to the rollout of agreed cuts. We've seen that
roll into addressing at least some of the concerns around the supply side of the equation. The demand
side of the equation is still in flux right now. What we actually see is with the price of crude oil globally
rebounding to kind of the current $40 level on or thereabouts. We're actually seeing a fairly flat forward
curve in both WTI and Brent, with a fairly static $2 to $2.5 Brent-TI spread. So this has frankly created
a less-interesting market for some financial players, and we're seeing that in the reduced volumes and
volatility in both June and July. You look at the year-to-date results overall, we did deliver both record Q1
and first half energy revenues as a whole. And we talked about the strength in some of the business we're
seeing out of Europe and Asia. And if you actually look at the European revenues, European revenues first
half were up 25%. So we continue to expand our non-U.S. customer base, and that's really helped us
maintain healthy overall growth.

If you look at the energy revenue, despite the overall volumes being up 20%, our rate per contract in
energy as a whole has been almost static, I think, down maybe $0.005 despite the 20% growth overall.

CME GROUP INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

One of the really interesting parts of the overall energy franchise. We don't talk about nearly as much is
natural gas. Natural gas is a business that has been following that same globalization path that we've been
seen and been talking about and been investing in, both in crude oil and in what we've seen in the natural
gas market. Year-to-date, our natural gas futures business is up 46%. Natural gas options are up 71%.
And that continues to be a huge part of our overall energy story. And this is a market also that we need
to remember, we've maintained that 82% market share. And this has been a boost to our overall energy
business because our rate per contract in nat gas futures and options is higher than what we see in crude
oil. So that's helping the upward pressure on MVP -- or excuse me, on the overall RPC as a whole.

Very quickly, on the Houston contract. It's a great point. We launched that contract back in November
of 2018, explicitly focused on those folks involved in the export chain. So remember what that Houston
fiscal contract references, it's to allow customers that if you're involved in the export chain, you need to
price for on the water, Houston-based delivery as oil flows out of Cushing down to Houston goes on barges
and ships out to Europe and U.S. Well, what we saw in the first half of this year was overall continued
production ramps up in the U.S. up until about February. We were producing, I think, in the U.S. about
13 million barrels a day, of which about 3 million were going to export. And we did see that business in
HCL, the Houston-based sale contract grow, but it's in the maybe 500 to 800 contracts a day sort of a
volume. What we saw following the implosion of the -- both supply and demand story was not only U.S.
production pulled back to about 10, 10.5 millions of barrels a day. We're actually seeing exports out of the
U.S. decline as well. So as exports decline, demand for an export-focused product had declined. So it's still
out there. We're actually continuing to still innovate it, talk to our commercial customers about what we
can do to enhance that contract, and they've got some conversations going into how to make that more
interesting. But that will really be a function, Ken, of what the export situation in the U.S. looks like.

The other point that I probably want to touch on very briefly is we continue to see strong growth in the
August assessed contracts, primarily in Midland and in Houston. And as you remember, trade, about 7,000
to 8,000 contracts a day but have close to 350,000 contracts open interest. And those are additional
contracts that allow customers involved in both the domestic market, but also the export market, to use
those contracts. They trade as a basis against WTI, and those are contracts that allow physical participants
to manage their risk out into Midland out into Houston. And so those contracts we've had that for a
number of years. But it takes a long period of time for customers to adapt, particularly the commercial
customers to using those products, and we see that strong continued growth and significant holdings in OI
as potentially path for how we see that Houston HCL contract evolve. But that will be a function of how we
see the export market regain its footing here as the COVID demand impacts start to level out. We start to
see miles flown and miles driven increase again. So I hope that answers your questions, Ken.

Sorry for dragging out the call. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, coming back to the rates franchise.
Any updated thoughts on the floor? I know you're reopening, I think the Eurodollar pit in August, but --
on a couple of weeks or so. Any updated thoughts on how that may impact the overall trading markets
again? I mean have you looked at data a little bit more closely how -- maybe the floor being closed has
had a negative impact on the trading markets overall? And then different topic, and I guess it's coming
back to the oil question just now, but just one quick follow-up. I mean I keep on reading more headlines
around oil production in the U.S. may never see peaks like we had in the past. So with that backdrop and
kind of like that underlying commodity, really not growing anymore long term, can you still grow your oil
franchise? Or is this -- outside of what you just said, Derek?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Why don't I go ahead and start and then Derek can talk a little bit about oil, but I don't believe the demise
of oil is here just yet. So I would say, Alex, that we've heard this before, and then we saw prices either

drop precipitously or rise exponentially. So every time someone counts out any particular product or an
asset class that seems to move. So I would not just count it out this yet. There's still -- I think what we're
seeing right now is just so much uncertainty on the supply-demand equation as it relates to the COVID
because it's not in one central location, it's around the world. So I would not, again, count that asset class
out as not being able to move up or down. And Derek can give you more color in just a second. But on
the trading floor, I don't believe that not having the floor has impacted the trading business. As you know,
we've been able -- we've spent many of years with our technology being able to replicate transactions
that have been done historically on the trading floor. So I don't see that as anything that's inhibited our
business growth, especially as it relates to the Eurodollar contract.

I think what Sean referenced, is really the most important component of the fundamentals of the
Eurodollar contract, which is the levels of volatility are at not just historicals but at contract low since
inception. That is -- that's a big statement that could have the impact. We are excited to have the floor
come back. That being said, on August 10, as you referenced. So the business, as you know, was still
roughly 50-50 as it relates to the floor and the screen. So we'll see if the participants when they come
back, if they can be able to continue to facilitate that business in the world that we live in today. But we
don't believe it's been impacted just by the floor closure. So with that being said, I'll turn it over to Sean
or to Derek.

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes. Thanks, Alex. Great question on the oil side. Listen, I think Terry is exactly right. I think there is
cyclicality to the oil market, people are calling for the demise of this market, and Terry knows because he
was sitting in front of a senate talking about. The market $1 4 -- $140 a barrel and there were a lot of
prognostications as to what that would lead to. And we then have seen the other end of the spectrum over
the last couple of months. So I think there is significant fluctuations and a lot of diverse opinions out there
about what OPEC is going to do, what Russia is going to do, the U.S. capability, what certainly the U.S.
has done, having lifted the export ban back in 2,000 -- end of '14, '15. And what we've seen that mean to
U.S. energy independence has been nothing but positive in terms of job creation. And certainly, in terms
of the U.S.'s ability to ramp up production from 4 million to 5 million barrels a day up to that 13 peak that
we hit earlier this year and exporting in excess of 3 million barrels a day.

We expect that, that will continue to come back. That is a pure function of the demand side of the
equation. The more shut-ins we have, the more states that are walking down, the more countries that
are disallowing travel. That's just a cap on demand right now. So once we start to move into economies
opening, once you start to move into vaccines, for us, we see that the lever of growth that we have pulled
hard working in conjunction with Julie's team on the international sales side is continuing to grow our non-
U.S. participation. It has been the hallmark of our growth. We are early markets penetration into Europe
and Asia right now. And I think the numbers you see that we continue to talk about certainly validate that.
And the growth in our sales organization that Julie has built over the last couple of years, with our focus
in Europe and Asia continues to unlock opportunities for us. So we don't see this as a static market that
has to be split up based on kind of who's in the market and what product they're choosing. We see this
very much as our ability to access a growing demand customer base in Europe and Asia. And I think it's
far too early to call sort of a peak oil conversation here in 2020, when I think you've got the significantly
artificial cap on global demand really coming from the COVID situation and coming from economic growth.
So that's how we think about it.

And Alex, the way we continue to invest in the business as a whole, internationalizing our business,
expanding WTI as a global benchmark, growing our options business and then expanded education
out into Europe and Asia for those customers to continue to grow that high margin business for us. So
hopefully, that puts a little extra color on top of what Terry was talking about earlier.

We will now go to our final question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just 2 quick follow-ups. Just John back on the expenses on the synergies. Just wanted to verify, we're
exiting at $110 million of synergies at year-end after the BrokerTec conversion. Should that be -- should
we be considering that like an $85 million tailwind to the expenses and reducing expenses given the $25
million, I think you talked about for 2020? That's the first question. And the second question was just
to go back to what Julie said about retail. I'm not sure if I missed it, but the proportion of volumes from
retail in the second quarter versus the first quarter? And do you see -- is it just -- is it all concentrated in
equities and metals? Are you seeing any in energy and then just along those lines, the RPC dynamic going
into the third quarter, obviously, it's a headwind on the equity side, but we've also seen really good RPC
build in energy. Do you see that sustainable into 3Q?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Brian, this is John. I will -- I'll take the integration question, and then I'll mention kind of what we're
seeing in the equities RPC, which I think will be helpful for you as you think about the third quarter. So in
terms of our integration, we had a target of $50 million in terms of run rate synergies at the end of last
year. We hit $64 million. We've got a target of $110 million at the end of this year, and we're on track to
meet that $110 million. Obviously, the organization is focused on exceeding it, but we're well on our way
to achieving the $110 million. So going into next year, we would have a $46 million reduction in our cost
base. The difference between the $64 million that we ended last year and the $110 million that we've got
targeted this year. That $46 million would be what would allow us to reduce our costs going into next year,
and that would give us $110 million run rate synergies based on what we had projected or forecasted with
the acquisition of NEX. So that's on the integration side.

Then when you look at the RPC side, I think it's really important on the equities to really understand the
product mix. So it's a product mix story for equities this quarter. As you guys know, our micros products
are tremendous success. And sequentially, the trading is up 30%. Now it's a premium-priced product
from a risk-adjusted perspective, but has a lower RPC than our E-minis. In Q1, micros were 22% of our
total volume. And in Q2, they were 34% of our total volume. Now a couple of things to note. And Sean
touched on this a little earlier, but I'll reiterate it. The micros RPC increased from $0.112 in Q1 to $0.125
in Q2, and they're up from $0.068 the same quarter last year. When you look at the equity RPC, excluding
micros, that RPC increased from $0.76 in Q1 to $0.804 in Q2, and it's up from $0.73 from the same
quarter last year. That's increasing because we did make some pricing adjustments in our equity complex.
But also, we find our clients are using higher-priced products like BTIC, like our dividend futures and like
the total return futures. So the equity -- in our equity complex, the RPCs are increasing, it's really -- it's
just -- it's a mix shift story in our equities. So that -- those were the two. And I think I'll turn it over to
Julie for your third question.

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Sure. So on the product mix with our active trader segment, you are correct that we did see some
declines, as Derek pointed out earlier, given the access on the brokers to that -- providing to clients for
the WTI. We saw some declines. Year-to-date, we're still up on energy as well as up significantly with
our equity index and our metals business as well as FX and our ag and interest rate is pretty flat. We've
also seen a trend, particularly from our APAC clients of transitioning from WTI into nat gas. And that is
something that is definitely positive across the energy product mix for this segment. So that's something
that we are watching as well.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And then just the overall mix of retail within your ADVs for 2Q versus 1Q across the franchise?

Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Duffy, at this time, I will turn the
conference to you for any final remarks.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thank you. And thank you all. I appreciate it very much, and I know the team does as well. We live in
very interesting times, and we truly believe that managing risk will be critically important as we continue
to evolve, not only from COVID, but other issues that are affecting the entire world. For all the reasons
that Sean and Derek and Julie and John explained, we will feel very optimistic about our position. We
-- as a team, I will tell you that we remain laser-focused on innovation, client outreach, the things we
talked about, capital efficiencies, the integration of NEX and I'll stress this again, we are laser-focused on
expense discipline. We will continue to be disciplined as we continue to run this business on everyone's
behalf. So we thank you for your time this morning. We appreciate your questions, and we look forward to
talking to you soon, and we wish you and your families all health and safety. And thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you, and thank you all for your attention. This concludes today's conference. You may now
