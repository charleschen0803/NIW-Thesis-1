Sarah, thank you
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our performance for the third quarter of this year
Now, before we dive into our update this afternoon, I'd like to take just a moment to thank you for the incredible outpouring of prayers and support and good wishes for Allen Leverett following his stroke earlier this month
I can tell you that Allen has been released from the hospital and is making progress in his recovery
I will continue to serve as Interim Chief Executive for as long as necessary, but the ultimate goal is obviously to bring Allen back
But again, your kindness and concern have meant a great deal to Allen and his family and a great deal to all of us as well
Now, I'd like to introduce the members of our senior team who are here with me today
We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations
We'll begin with our third quarter results
As I am sure you saw from our new release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.68 a share
We delivered a solid third quarter, largely driven by effective cost controls
Our focus on cost management and efficiency gains was a major factor in offsetting the impact of mild summer weather compared to last year's third quarter
Those cool temperatures were particularly noticeable during August, which is normally one of the two warmest months in the Midwest
Next, I'd like to brief you on several developments on the regulatory front and on our capital investments
On August 10, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement
We received our final written order on September 8. Under the approved settlement, base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and for 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for four years and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place will be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism will now be in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service
Now, just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return
Anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely to customers
Now as part of the agreement, we've also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers
These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs
Turning to Michigan
I'm pleased to report that we obtained final regulatory approval just yesterday for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula
We also received all local approvals that are needed to move forward with the project
Our plan is to bring those facilities into commercial service in 2019 and at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle
The approved project calls for a $265 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines
They will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity
These units, which will be owned by our utility subsidiary in Michigan, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, provide a long-term generation solution for customers in the Upper Peninsula and that includes the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland Cliffs
And now, for an update on Illinois
We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program
Since we acquired Peoples Gas, we've made significant improvements in a number of important metrics
We've lowered contractor construction cost by 15%
We've achieved a 70% decline in customer complaints
Construction timelines have been reduced by more than 25% and I'm pleased to say that our working relationship with the City of Chicago is greatly improved
Our system modernization program, as you've heard, is designed to make the gas distribution network in Chicago safer, more reliable, less expensive to maintain
As you may recall, we still have an open docket (5:54) on the preferred approach to this long-term project
We expect a decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission by year-end
And consistent with our 2017 plan, we're on track to invest approximately $300 million on the effort in Chicago this year
Turning now to our operations in Minnesota
On October 13, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission
We're seeking to increase natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%
We've also requested under the procedures available in Minnesota, to self-implement an increase of $9.5 million or 3.8%, effective January 1 of 2018. A final decision on new permanent rates is not expected until the first quarter of 2019. I'd also like to update you on a recent FERC decision related to the System Support Resource payments for the Presque Isle power plant in Michigan
In its decision, FERC ordered a refund of $22.6 million associated with the payments that we received for the period February of 2014 through January of 2015. As you may recall, this is very close to the amount that the administrative law judge recommended last year
So consistent with our previous statements, the amount of the refund will not result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in net income and we have taken the FERC decision into account for our year-end guidance
Next, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be rolling out our new five-year capital forecast at the EEI Finance Conference in early November
Over the past few months, Allen shared the developing plan with me in my role as Chairman of the board
In the past few weeks, I've of course reviewed the capital plan in great detail and I share Allen's optimism about the direction of the plan
Now, one piece of that new five-year plan has just been put in place
Our Wisconsin Public Service Utility in Green Bay, along with Wisconsin Power and Light and Madison Gas and Electric have purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center from Invenergy
The total purchase price is approximately $174 million
We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million
Forward consists of 86 GE wind turbines with a capacity of about 130 megawatts
The wind farm is located 10 miles south of Fond du Lac in the eastern part of the state
If approved, Wisconsin Public Service customers will see real savings, because we will be able to eliminate the existing power purchase agreement
Pending regulatory approvals, closing on the Forward Wind Center could take place next spring
Again, we look forward to sharing more about our new five-year capital plan at EEI and we really look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead
And speaking of opportunity, you may have heard about the blockbuster announcement this summer, the announcement that Foxconn has chosen Wisconsin for one of the largest economic development projects in American history
Based on revenue, Foxconn is the fourth largest tech company in the world
And Foxconn has decided to bring a brand-new technology called 8K to the United States
The company plans to invest $10 billion to build a massive production plant that could employ as many as 13,000 people in Racine County just south of Milwaukee
We expect the electric demand from this Foxconn campus to be more than 200 megawatts, that's approximately three times the size of our current largest Wisconsin customer
And that does not include the demand that will develop from the suppliers that will also need to locate near the Foxconn facility
Foxconn has chosen a site in southeastern Wisconsin that is perfectly situated on our transmission network
We will not need to build any new generation
Our state-of-the-art network is well-equipped today to provide reliable, low-cost energy to Foxconn
Now, on top of that, folks, if you like gummy bears, and you know who doesn't, I have more news for you
The German candymaker, Haribo, has also selected Wisconsin for its first-ever manufacturing facility in North America
So, as you can see, the manufacturing economy in Wisconsin is alive and well
And now, with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, here's our esteemed Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber
Scott, thank you very much
We're on track and, as always, focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders
And operator, I believe we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call
Question-and-Answer Session
Shar, how are you?
We're doing well
Well, I can tell you that we have a generation restructuring plan under review, and we'll be able to provide you with a lot more detail when we roll out our five-year capital forecast at EEI
We appreciate it
Hi, Julien
Well, I'll frame the answer for you and will let Scott provide some additional detail
But in terms of the – and the team has done a great job on O&M reduction, much of the O&M reduction that we're seeing here is from efficiency gains, not just one-time cost controls
And a lot of what we're seeing is really enabled by the fact that at the end of June of 2015 we acquired Integrys and we're ahead of plan clearly in terms of cost savings resulting from the acquisition
Most all of the cost savings that we've seen so far through the first nine months of this year, Scott, are really from our Wisconsin operations
And we're seeing – Scott is exactly right
I think you're going to continue to see efficiency gains and cost reductions going forward
A lot of it, I think, is going to come from the generation side of our business and we'll talk a lot more about that as we roll out the new five-year capital plan
But we see continuing good opportunity, really strong opportunity for ongoing cost reduction, Julien
So rather than an O&M expense that flows through fuel, basically, we've converted that or will convert that upon closing, as Scott said, to an earning assets that will actually reduce cost for customers
Well, why don't we just say this, stay tuned, Julien
Thank you so much
Afternoon, Michael
Well, it's a good question, Michael
Let me try to give you two or three thoughts on that
First of all, I really can only speak about our utilities, which would be We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay
But when you look at the broader picture, remember, we have set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by essentially 40% by the year 2030 off 2005 levels
We believe we can do that without significant rate pressure because of what's occurred with the improvement and the efficiency and the cost of some renewables
Believe it or not, I mean when you when you look at just what's happened with the efficiency of the utility scale solar, I mean, even three or four years ago for Wisconsin, you might see, oh gosh, $4,000 a megawatt installed – cost of $4,000 a megawatt installed for a large utility scale solar plant in Wisconsin
That's today down to circa $1,300. So, what's going to be driving the restructuring of generation portfolios, not just in our state, but elsewhere, particularly where they're coal heavy, is really economics
And we're seeing significant economic changes that will allow us to add more renewables to our fleet
In part we're able to do that and not put pressure on rates, because we already have a state-of-the-art backbone, if you will, from the Power the Future units that we've already built and are in place
So, I think we're very well-positioned to continue to take costs out, to continue to reduce carbon emissions
But at the end of the day, I mean the company's goal is really to maintain a diverse fuel supply, less of coal – clearly, less of coal
But at the end of the day, we probably, 10 or 15 years from now, will look like a third, a third, a third
Basically, a third coal or a third fossil fuel, a third renewables, third natural gas
Does that help at all, Michael?
Take care, Michael
Dan, you're back?
About that life coach stuff I was offering you, now that I'm sitting in for Allen, be happy to try to guide you, because I know you probably got a little off-track in the last year or so
Exactly
So, any help I can give you, just let me know
Thank you, Dan
We'll certainly pass your goodwill along
Dan, we thought, first of all, you might buy up all the non-deductible stuff
No, that's not true
Let me say this, that the whole picture related to interest deductibility, bonus depreciation, the whole picture is pretty murky right now
I mean, we've obviously had some very good discussions with the tax writing people in the House
Of course, Paul Ryan is very involved in the crafting of the legislation
But it is just way too early to think about a pre-funding or think about any change in our plan
We're going to have to see, first of all, whether tax reform actually gets completed and then what the real details are
And there's some thought that there might be an optional election on interest deductibility with a trade-off on another tax deduction item
We just have to see
At this point, I think anything that – I mean we're obviously looking at the landscape, but anything that I might tell you would be pure speculation until we really understand the details, I understand the House passed a budget today which raises the percentage possibility that tax reform will actually take place
But we're just going to have to see the details and then we'll figure out where to go
We'll be happy to do that
And I'll ask Scott to chime in as well
Let me just say this – and you've heard me say this before
On a very short-term basis, I'm quite skeptical of our ability to weather normalize accurately
And you are correct, industrial demand should be less weather sensitive than any other group of customers, but there's still some weather sensitivity
So, I think we need to look over a much longer period of time than just one quarter versus a comparison to another quarter where it was 43% warmer than normal
So, I wouldn't be overly-concerned, one way or another, about one quarter's results
But we are seeing some, what Scott calls, green shoots in three or four specific industry sectors and we'll let Scott tell you about those
And for what it's worth, and Scott and I have talked about this, the Foxconn demand growth – the demand growth we'll see from Foxconn and demand growth we'll see from Haribo and several of the other really good economic development projects that have come to fruition, we haven't yet put those in our numbers
So, for example, Foxconn, I wouldn't think, would affect our industrial sales until probably 2020. And then, they'll ramp up, obviously, from the start
But our projections today really do not include any of those recent developments
Correct, Scott?
And it wouldn't surprise you that Scott and Allen are being very conservative
You're welcome, Dan
All right
Thank you very much
That concludes our conference call for today
We really appreciate you participating
