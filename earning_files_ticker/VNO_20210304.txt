VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Vornado Realty Trust First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name
is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes.
[Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Catherine C. Creswell
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust First Quarter Earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued
our first quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are
available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and
during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures
to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-Q and
financial supplement.

Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and
actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and
other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information regarding these
risks and uncertainties. The call may include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of
today's date. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.

On the call today from management for our opening comments are: Steven Roth, Chairman and Executive
Officer; and Michael Franco, President and Chief Financial Officer. Our senior team is also present and
available for questions.

I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Cathy, and good morning to everyone. I hope al5l of you continue to be safe and healthy and
that you're all vaccinated or on your way to being vaccinated. We are full speed ahead on the Penn District
and are confident of its success. Farley as well along, we delivered half of Facebook 730,000 square feet
on January 1, and we will deliver the second half on June 1, just 1 month from that. At PENN1, we will
deliver the 34th Street lobby in July, the building's enormous amenity package in October and the 33rd
Street lobby at year-end. And PENN2 and the Long Island Railroad concourse developments are now under
full-scale construction. This transformation will take over a couple of years to complete.

The decision to permanently close the Hotel Pennsylvania will allow us to get this site ready for
development in less than 2 years from now, which is perfect timing for the next phase of our Penn District
mega project. I believe that the Hotel Penn site will be the best development site in town. Notwithstanding
that we will be delivering for tenants the most robust and unique amenitized offering in the city, with the
aided convenience of being directly on top of New York's main transportation hub, our strategy here is to
price PENN1 and PENN2 below our neighbors to the West under their price umbrella. Since we are coming
off $60 rents, this will be an outstanding outcome. Over time, as we continue to remake the Penn District,
I fully expect rents will aggressively rise to the premium that they deserve.

Over the summer and into the early fall, we will be reopening and returning to normal. All of our tenants
are telling us that they are anxious to bring their employees back to the office, and we are anxious to
welcome them back. We remain strong in our belief that working from the office will be the preferred

mode of work for companies and their employees post-pandemic. The kitchen table may be a place for
some, but I continue to believe the urban office is the workplace of the future.

As I have said, I believe we will come out of this difficult year in an economic boom, fueled by a tsunami
of government stimulus, of which New York is a very major beneficiary. The financial sector is now
booming. Tech is now booming. Health care is now booming. Retailers like Walmart, Target and Home
Depot are now booming, and there is enormous pent-up demand from consumers eager to travel,
meaning tourists returning to New York and spend on all manner of goods and services. This is beginning
to happen all across the country. Importantly, the major tech companies are telling us that they intend to
continue growing their office footprints in New York's deep and diverse talent pool is unrivaled anywhere.
As you can tell, we are very bullish on New York.

Finally, a word about ESG. We filed our 2020 ESG report on Form 8-K in April -- on April 12. We continue
to demonstrate our leadership here, and we're proud of the many awards and recognitions we have
received. This is an important topic that we believe in. Please do take a look at this important report.

Now over to Michael for comment on our numbers and our businesses.

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I too hope you're all safe and healthy and look forward to
seeing you again in person soon. Let me start with our first quarter financial results, and I'll end with a
few comments on the leasing and capital markets.

First quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.65 per share compared to $0.77 for last year's first
quarter. A decrease of $0.12, primarily due to the effects of the COVID shutdown. One change you will
note is that the Hotel Pennsylvania results removed to noncomparable given our decision to permanently
close the hotel. The decrease this quarter is reconciled for you in our earnings release on Page 4 and
in our financial supplement on Page 6 and was driven by the following items: $0.04 of our variable
businesses, trade shows, signage, garages and BMS still being offline, $0.07 from tenant vacancies and
bad debts, primarily the JCPenney and New York and Company lease rejections last year; $0.03 from Penn
District space taken out of service; $0.03 from Macy's lease cancellation income in last year's first quarter,
partially offset by $0.05 from G&A and interest savings. These items are not new news and are right in
line with our statements over the past few quarters. Most of these are temporary, and the income will
return over time.

Furthermore, the first quarter results are consistent with the sequential fourth quarter run rate we
discussed last quarter, adjusted for the accelerated vesting of equity awards, for retirement age executives
in the first quarter.

With respect to rent collections in the first quarter, overall rent collections were 96%, a continued
improvement from the prior quarters. We collected 97% of office rents and 90% of retail rents. April
collections ran at the same level.

While the aggregate headline same-store cash NOI numbers for the first quarter are negative on their
face, excluding the variable businesses, our core New York office business actually was positive 3.9%.
Blending in Chicago and San Francisco, our office business overall was a positive 1.9%. The big takeaway
here is that our core office business, representing over 80% of the company is continuing to hold on its
own in this challenging environment, protected by long-term leases with credit tenants. And while the
retail same-store numbers are down, overall retail NOI is flat quarter-over-quarter, again, consistent with
our recent guidance.

Finally, we have planned to see us for significant growth as the pandemic recedes and the city returns to
normal level of activity. In addition to the savings we will realize from the previously announced overhead
reduction program, we expect significant growth from the return of our variable businesses. From the
Farley Buildings fully coming online in 2022, followed by the delivery of PENN1 and PENN2, and reduced
interest costs as we roll over our debt. One of the analysts even predicted the Vornado will have the
highest growth rate in our sector over the next several years.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Now turning to leasing markets. We are seeing improved conditions in the office leasing market with
the pace of activity up nicely in the past 60 days. The phones are rinning, tour volume is up, proposals
are coming in and leases are being signed with the flight to quality trend accelerating. According to the
brokerage houses, leasing volume is certainly up versus 2020 numbers. The first quarter had the most
activity of any since the fourth quarter of 2019, with most of the actions occurring in Midtown. At the
same time, we are realistic and recognize that availability across all submarkets remains high. But an
encouraging sign, sublease space has recently come down some. Almost 600,000 square feet of sublease
space has been removed from the market by occupiers who plan to reoccupy the space. Moreover, a
substantial portion of the sublease inventory is challenged space, either physically, by way of the over
tenant having poor credit quality or turn constrained, roughly a 1/4 of the sublease space in the market
today has less than 3 years of term.

During the first quarter, we completed 12 office leases totaling 208,000 square feet. The 2 largest leases
of the quarter were both new to our portfolio. Young Adult Institute for 74,000 square feet at 825 7th
Avenue for the new state-of-the-art schooling facility; and FuboTV Inc. a new world content streaming
platform coming off their successful IPO launch for 55,000 square feet in the base of 1290 Avenue of
the Americas. Both of these leases represented expansions from their prior locations. We are currently
negotiating paper on 300,000 square feet, of which 200,000 square feet is with new tenants. And in
addition, we have a growing pipeline of 1.4 million square feet, which is up meaningfully from recent
quarters.

Last year, we completed the 2 largest leases in the year, Facebook and NYU. The current sweet spot for
deal-making in the market is with small to midsized firms looking to relocate into new or redeveloped
assets. Remember, all of our space is redeveloped, only the Penn District, which is under redevelopment.
This dynamic matches up well with our current vacancy, where our largest available blocks are only
180,000 square feet at 330 West 34th Street and 117,000 square feet at share at 85 Tenth Avenue.

As a reminder, our office expirations in 2021 and 2022 are very modest, with less than 5% of our space
rolling each year and a portion of this in PENN1. Our leasing team is now in full stride in the Penn District
with multiple presentations, tours and meetings each day with brokers and tenants across all industry
types. Using our new Penn District Experience center to showcase PENN1, PENN2 and our grand plans for
the Penn District really brings everything to life. The reception to our vision for the district and our best
market differentiated project offerings has been nothing short of phenomenon.

Turning now to Chicago and San Francisco. In Chicago, we are also seeing more activity at the market.
During the first quarter, we completed 85,000 square feet of leases including a 45,000 square foot office
renewal, along with 18 showroom transactions totaling 40,000 square feet, of which 15 were renewals. We
currently have a 90,000 square foot renewal lease in negotiation. And a pipeline of 500,000 square feet
showing real interest in the property. Importantly, we will be restarting the trade show business in October
this year with the NeoCon show, beginning to bring back that income stream.

In San Francisco, 555 California continues to be in a league of its own coming off the heels of our recent
large renewals with both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. In April, we executed a lease renewal with
KKR in the triple digits for its 50,000 square feet in the tower. Our occupancy here is 98% with minimal
expirations until 2023.

Turning to retail now. Retail leasing in New York City is beginning to come out of a period of inactivity to
a phase of retailers who are succeeding and even thriving are now looking for opportunities. All current
leasing activity is very price driven. The tourists driven higher rent markets of Fifth Avenue and Times
Square have seen the least activity as retailers remain on pause until there is greater visibility and when
the 60-plus million tourists will return.

During the quarter, we completed 11 retail leases for 46,000 square feet. These included 2 long-term
renewals at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, including a lease with JPMorgan Chase for a flagship branch,
and a 7-year extension with the luxury retailer Tods at 650 Madison Avenue. Our leasing also included
another 6 leases assigned at the Farley concourse, where demand remains strong, and we are in
negotiations with tenants to fill the balance of the concourse space. Overall, we are upbeat about the
future of our markets, our leading position in them and our prospects for creating value.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Turning to the capital markets now. First, let me congratulate Jan LaChapelle on her promotion to
Executive Vice President, Head of Capital Markets. The real estate financing markets continue to improve
with both the CMBS market-wide open and banks beginning to lend again a high quality office. Spreads in
all-in coupons are at very attractive levels as evidenced by our recent strong refinancings of One Park and
909 Third Avenue, both of which were at significantly reduced rates. The unsecured market for real estate
companies also continues to be very strong, and it is likely that we may shift over time to a more balanced
approach between unsecured and secured debt.

Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $3.94 billion, including $1.76 billion of cash and restricted cash and
$2.18 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Michael, I was wondering if you could just spend a little more time -- detail there. Maybe talk about the
terms that you're seeing in terms of TI, free rent, and then length of lease that tenants are sort of looking
for today in the market?

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

You want to take that one?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Steve, can you just repeat, you cut out for about 10 seconds?

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Sorry. I guess the question was really around lease term, TIs, leasing commissions, free rent, how are you
seeing some of the impact, not just in face rents, but some of the concessionary items? And then what are
tenants looking for from a length of lease term?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I mean the first thing I'll tell you is lease term, we're seeing a lot of long-term lease commitments, 10
years, 15 years. We actually completed a lease this quarter for 30 years with the school at 825 7th. So
we're seeing lease terms long. We're seeing commitments for sure. We've seen no change in that as we go
quarter-to-quarter.

TIs are elevated and free rents are elevated net effectives were off, but I think they stabilized at this point.
But right now, if you want to lease space in the market, you have to give the TIs to fill the space, and
that's what we're doing. But they have stabilized over the past, I'd say, 2 to 3 months, for sure.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, I don't know if this is for Michael or somebody else. I know there's been
some discussion around the refinancing of 555 California, and there was an article recently about a north
of $1 billion new mortgage there. To the extent that you did refinance at that level, how do you think
about the excess proceeds? And what would that be used for?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I don't think we're going to -- Steve, it's Steve. I don't think we're going to comment on that other
than just to tell you that, generally speaking, where there is smoke, there is fire. We won't comment on
anything about that transaction at the current time.

Operator

We have our next question from Manny Korchman with Citi.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Emmanuel Korchman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just wondering what your -- sort of how progressive conversations are with tenants are at Penn, both for
the large blocks available at the current Penn buildings as well as PENN15 and if that drove your decision
to take the hotel off-line and move forward with the larger redevelopment there?

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

It's Glen. So I'll tell you, we're in this experience center down at PENN1 multiple times a day, showing all
the projects. I will tell you the action at PENN1 from a leasing standpoint is absolutely on fire. We do not
have any real large blocks there. But in the tower, we have some single and 2-floor deals happening at
rents that are at or underwriting. So we're performing very well there. The reception has been excellent.
We are also beginning to showcase PENN2 into the market also daily a lot of great presentations and
incoming, but we're going to go slow with PENN2. We just started up on the physical construction and as
this thing keeps going on a construction standpoint and the tenants can see it physically, it will just get
better and better in terms of the incomings and people's reception.

And yes, on PENN15, we are beginning to show people our plans. The announcement of knocking on the
Hotel Penn has brought a lot of incoming calls and emails. We're starting to talk to folks about PENN15 as
well as we get into it.

Emmanuel Korchman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And I don't know if this one's for you or for Michael. But if we think about the occupancy trajectory
through the rest of the year here, do you anticipate that this is sort of the bottom for New York City office
occupancy or vacancy? Or do you think there's a little bit more to come from a net absorption perspective?

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, Manny. Manny, I can't tell you it may move around a little
bit here or there. I don't -- I think we're pretty close to the bottom. Again, I'm not going to play or tick a
little bit, but I think we're basically there.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Manny, anecdotally, I would tell you that Glen told me that several of the brokerage houses have told their
folks and their clients to get into the market now that this is the bottom. And that they expect a turn from
a tenant market to landlord's market to happen over the next 6 months. So that's anecdotal information,
but it's important information.

Operator

Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

The announcements and the news flow of New York City reopening is very fluid and even this morning
Goldman Sachs announced plans to come back next month. Are there any more details that you could
share as far as what's happening in your portfolio today as far as more details on lease proposals? What
do you expect to be signed as far as leases in the second and third quarter? And potentially also traffic in
your Street retail portfolio?

Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

I will take the office, it's Glen. Michael remarked in this script, in his opening remarks, our pipeline is
robust. We have over 300,000 feet of leases in negotiation. We have another 1.4 million feet of deals that
are in discussion. I'll tell you, things are picking up a lot, not a little. So tenants are coming out of the
woodwork. Many are looking for new space to better quality products. So we're seeing a huge uptick in
office leasing activity as we sit here right now.

In terms of the utilization of the building, that's also upticking week-to-week. On a percentage basis, we're
now in the teens at all the buildings. Most of our tenants are telling us returning starting in June through
Labor Day. But certainly, the narrative is unwinding quickly. We're feeling it, we're seeing it, and we're
hearing it.

Haim H. Chera
Executive VP & Head of Retail

In retail, we're seeing a major uptick in conversations that's primarily due to the fact that the survivors
of the pandemic in retail have actually been thriving. New York City is probably the last on the list to be
opportunistic because the rest of the country has been booming, the New York City is suffering from the
lack of our 60 million tourists being in the street. But the smart retailers are now in the market, being
opportunistic. And I don't think New York retail has ever offered a better value than it's offering today in
terms of the prime spaces at better rent.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

That's very helpful. My second question is on the tracking stock that Steve, you mentioned in the
Chairman's letter, are there any more details you could share at this time as far as the timing, whether
or not you plan to raise capital through it? And will you be stripping out the financials of the Penn
redevelopments from Vornado going forward?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I really don't think it's appropriate to comment on this. We're working very hard on it. It's a very, very
exciting project that we're very excited about. I mean, we're targeting, hopefully, year-end. Other than
that, I don't think it would be premature to get into any details. But I'll give you a little bit of what
our thinking is. And by the way, attracting stock is something that has been used very successfully by
folks like John Malone at Liberty and his sidekick Greg Maffei and Barry Diller and -- for example. And
generally, what it's used is when you have a business inside of your core, which is different, and which has
a different rate of growth and different characteristics.

And so we feel that the Penn District mega project that we have is different than our core assets. And
so we feel that investors would benefit enormously by being able to invest in the Penn District and its
characteristics. By the way, we do remember it's a development company for better or for worse and our
core assets.

So the differentiating aspects of the Penn District is at what we consider to be the epicenter of the new
New York. It's directly on top of the major transportation hub, which means all of the subways at all of
the railroads, all of them come into that hub. And that's an extraordinary statement because you can get
in and out of Penn station no matter where you are in the New York City region on one ride. The most
important part of it is -- and by the way, it's enormous. When you look at the number of assets and the
scale of the assets and the number of blocks that we accomplish is pretty much enormous.

The most interesting part of it, I think from my point of view, and Glen's point of view is it's a cluster of
buildings that are interconnected generally underground. So what that means is that a tenant who has a
300,000 square foot required, and I have written about this, who goes into a 500,000 square-foot building
is locked in, there's no place to go. But a 300,000 square foot tenant in our 5 million growing to 10 million
growing to 15 million square foot complex has enormous opportunities to grow should they want in the
same building or in adjacent buildings. So I believe that a strategy, which involves a cluster of buildings in

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

a campus, which also will allow for an enormous series of amenities that somebody who has even a giant
million foot building can't afford to do makes us totally unique.

We're seeing very much the same thing down in Northern Virginia, where our SpinCo, JBG Smith, has
this enormous concentration of buildings and land, et cetera, in the Crystal City Complex that Vornado
contributed to that company when we did the spin in 2015. We've now attracted Amazon HQ2 there,
mainly because of the concentration of assets that we have and obviously, because it's a great labor
market. The same is true of our New York Penn District. So what we're trying to do and the objective is to
take businesses which are different, meaning the Penn District is different than a core office building on
even Park Avenue and allow investors to have the choice.

So we're very excited about it. It's a very important work in process, and more details will be coming as
we advance it and when we announce it. I think somebody said in their reports last night that it was not
well received by investors, which is troublesome to me. Because that's totally contrary to my feelings
about it and our company feelings about it. And so if that's the case, then we have some work to do to
talk to our investors and make everybody understand exactly what we're thinking about. But we couldn't
be more excited. And I think that's it for now.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

When you list the key attributes to investment Vornado, arguably Penn District would come up as #1. So
have you gotten feedback that this really isn't that different to the reason to invest in the company?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I don't understand the question, John.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I guess your point that this -- you're stripping out something that's different. Where in reality, it's just
a redevelopment of your existing assets that is the key reason to invest in Vornado today. I'm just
wondering why you think it's different?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, I can say what I said for the last 5 minutes over again. But the answer is that it's totally different in
many, many different ways. It's real estate, but it's totally different.

The other thing is when you think about stock performance, we don't think that our stock can go with or
without -- we're getting no credit in the Vornado stock and trading price. For the Penn District or basically
anything else. So what will happen is that we think that the corpus of Vornado -- the price of Vornado will
be unaffected or maybe even rise, hopefully, whereas the Penn District stock will get to its true value. But
we think -- we don't agree with you. We think it's totally different.

Operator

And we have our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So I'm going to take a different tack with my questioning this quarter. So I'm going to focus on two, what
I perceived to be positive in your portfolio. Steve, in your news -- in your Chairman's letter, you outlined
your Netflix binging and the fact that studios are now on your radar. It would seem with the JCPenney
space at Manhattan Mall and the Penn Station, Penn District redevelopment, both of those assets have
huge loading docks, huge amounts of potential space that can be carved out. And obviously, being in the
city is incredibly convenient for studios versus people having to truck out to Queens or some of the outer

boroughs. What are your thoughts on converting either those 2 assets or some of your other existing that
have those sorts of attributes to studios?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

This all began with 2 things: Number one, all of us have become network -- Netflix addicts; and number
two, we have got incomings from entities that are in the soundstage business or that new sound stages.
And so what's happened is, is that the streaming business and the entertainment business has become an
unbelievably powerful, dynamically growing business and it's consolidating. And so the companies that are
in that business are huge financial entities. And they all have a hankering and I mean a very strong desire
to be in New York. Apparently, there is a significant, maybe even dominant concentration of talent in New
York. And so it's really basically, they stay in 3 places: New York, Southern California and, I guess, in one
of the European cities.

But -- so the point being is that there is a tremendous amount of unserved demand. And so we're
responding to incoming. And so we have assets that could service that demand. Now I could take a way
too aggressive statement that says the Penn District could become Hollywood east. So I don't take that
to the bank, by the way. But there's a great deal of interest in some of our assets that we are working on.
Nothing imminent. We're just responding to where we see pockets of unique demand in the marketplace.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Look, that's good. And it's obviously something new, and it would seem to be something that's good to
repurpose, especially large blocks of space that have come back to your recently.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

And we feel we have assets that could be adapted to those kinds of uses.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. The second question, Steve, is going back to Penn Station, you guys for over 2 decades, I've been
talking about Penn Station. We all know the issues about the streetscape and the neighborhood and the
desire to see that improve. When you look at Grand Central, that area is already there. East side access
is clearly going to frighten away a huge chunk of long Island commuters, and you guys have 350 Park. It
would seem that 350 is almost a better site than Hotel Penn, just given that the neighborhood is already
there, and there are a lot more people being excited by the commuter hub and you have East side access
coming in the next few years. So what are your thoughts on accelerating 350? And where does that fit in
your pipeline as you guys or Glen market anchoring a Hotel Penn versus getting tenants anchor at 350?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

We're an equal opportunity employer wherever the tenants want to go, and that's where we want to put
them. We have -- obviously, we have an enormous amount of respect for our 350 Park Avenue asset. It's
a great asset. And it's kind of like bite size. It's a 500,000 square foot asset. It's obviously a candidate
for a teardown and rebuild. But in teardown and rebuild is a combination, and we can grow the site too,
by the way, as speculated in the press. So we could grow in something that's 200 million square foot
building if we wanted to. Just focus on our own site without growing it, which will be a million square foot
building. So that is an immense financial undertaking, which would require record rents, which we have
talked several tenants about. And we may do that, but the likelihood is we will not do that. The more
likely outcome is that we will rent up the existing 350 Park Avenue at a very favorable rent and sort of like
post loan interest cycle and retain the option of doing a new build on it or continuing to rent the existing
building over time.

So it's more likely that we will not do a teardown on that site and rent it out for one more cycle and focus
our efforts on the Penn Station district. That's the more likely outcome. Although we couldn't be more
delighted. By the way, if we decided that we wanted to sell that asset, with all of its optionality, in terms
of a new build or whatever, we think we could get an extraordinary price for it. But that's not something
that's high on our agenda right now.

We have our next question from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Securities, Research Division

Steven, I want to go back to a comment you made at the outset of the call, where you said major tech
companies plan to continue growing their office footprint in New York City. Can you talk more about
exactly what you're seeing? I think our understanding is that a lot of the big leases have been signed, but
I'm curious if there's a lot more behind it.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

The answer is, I'm really not going to comment on our sort of confidential conversations with our
customers, whom we cherish and we respect their confidences. We deal with all of these folks. We
obviously have them all in our portfolio, all the way from Facebook to Apple to Amazon, et cetera. We can
only tell you that they -- this is firsthand information. They love New York and for most of these folks,
New York is their second largest outpost and center. What they love about New York is, first of all, their
employees love New York. There is a very, very large and very importantly, a diverse workforce and that's
very important to these clients. So they have their fingers on the pulse of New York. They follow the real
estate in New York as closely as we do. They all have very professional real estate organizations that we
are in contact with frequently, almost daily. And they -- so the answer is, is that I stand by my statement.
They are very aggressively interested in New York. Their interest in New York continues unabated, and we
think that's a very exciting thing.

By the way, their interest in New York is basically almost exclusively to the west side of New York. That's
where their employees want to be, and that's where their culture says they want to be. So that's -- so we
think we're very well positioned for that, and we think that bodes very well for the future of New York and
for the future of Vornado.

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

Maybe if you think about the tech business, right, you start with the big 4 or 5. I mean, it's stunning
the earnings that they recently posted, the growth rates they continue to have and the aspirations they
continue to have. Then you have an entire segment of companies that have now either gone public and
graduate at a point where there are mid-cap companies or large cap companies in New York. These
companies have got significant ambition. They need people to execute on those ambitions. They need to
be in person, right? Huge amount of engineering talent, collaborations required, et cetera. And so both
from our own tenants and others that are in the market that are continuing to expand obviously, we just
bought, for example, FuboTV who just went public into our portfolio. These companies have significant
aspirations on growing their business. And as Steve said, New York is a central aspect of that. And I think
that's very positive for this marketplace.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Just -- Michael brings up a very important point, and that is the newbies and the aspirants, who are high-
growth people they want to be in the same cluster and in the same neighborhood as the established huge
tech tenants are. And what Glen likes the best about the new tenants is they are enormous growers. And

they look to locate in clusters in buildings, which have the potential where they can add 50,000 feet, add
100,000 feet. When we started with Facebook -- when we started FaceBook 7, 8 years ago?

Glen J. Weiss

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

They started with a couple of hundred thousand feet, and then they grew to 700,000 feet over a 3- or 4-
year period. That's the kind of client that Glen loves, and that's why we're trying to -- that's the kind of
occupancy that we expect to see.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's very helpful. The 1.4 million square feet pipeline, like can you -- how would you divide that up by
those types of growing tech tenants versus kind of upgrade relocations? Or if there's any other meaningful
category you'd split that into?

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

Yes. I'll tell you, Jamie, it's a very diverse industry sector mix and a very mix of -- good mix of renewal,
important renewal transactions as we look towards our expirations in the next 3 to 4 years, along with
very good new tenant activity, a lot in the Penn District, but also throughout our other assets. So it's a
very healthy mix of new renewals, some expansions and really every type of industry sector. The one
industry that's really leading the chart right now is the financial tenants. They're busy as I've ever seen
it. So our financial oriented buildings are really busy, with -- we have backed up deals on deals at 888
Seventh, 280 Park, [indiscernible] Fifth. They're leading the charge, but in terms of the mix, we feel really
good about really covering everyone out there right now in that pipeline we talked about.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Can you quantify how much of that's renewals of the $1.4 billion?

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

I'd rather not get into the exact sense of the numbers.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. That's fair. And then, I guess, another question for you, Steve. You had commented on the boom.
I'm just curious what your thoughts are on the benefit to New York City from the Biden plan and the
outcome, I know it's still early, but the mayoral race, kind of what should we be thinking about either the
risk or the rewards based on who's in the game?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

So let's see, your question is, how will New York benefit from the boom? And then what's going on with
the mayoral race, is that correct?

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Well, just what are your thoughts on the Biden plan? And how you think that really could trickle through
to New York? And then how should we be thinking about either the risk or the benefits from the mayoral
race?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

So first of all, I mean, I think it's pretty clear the country is in a boom. The only thing that I'm
uncomfortable about talking about is that the consensus feeling amongst almost everybody. So consensus
is something to be concerned about. Normally, I'd like to be on the other side of that, but it is the
consensus, and that is also what I believe. And I think it's happening. If you go to other places around the
country, which have not been as shut down as New York. It's happening now. You go to Texas, et cetera,
where they have different, where they have been more lenient in the restrictions. You can't -- you go into
a Target store and the shelves are empty. You go into some of the luxury retailers across the country and
the shelves are empty. The demand is amazing. They can't build enough houses, et cetera. So I think
that's pretty clear.

The Biden's policies, together with the fact that the majority leader of the Senate is from New York,
there is a significant and fair, by the way, in terms of when you look at distribution of these programs
across the nation. There is a significant amount of benefit -- financial benefit that's coming to New York in
terms of the stimulus package. First, in terms of closing the budget deficits for the city and state, which
is a universal program across the country, but it's good that we're getting in, and other benefits to our
population. So we think that the stimulus will be an enormous benefit to New York, and I think that's
proving out.

With respect to the mayoral race, that's a different kind of a fish. The oddity about politics in New York is
that more than 2/3 -- more than 75% of the registered voters are Democrat in the city. And so therefore,
the mayor race is not the election, it's the primary, so almost invariably whoever wins the Democrat
primary is elected mayor in the general election. There are -- double-digit number of candidates. And
interestingly, there's really no candidate, which has a defining lead. We also have ranked choice voting
for the first time, so nobody really quite knows how that works. So the first -- the 2 or 3 or 4 leading
candidates are certainly all in the race.

I'm hopeful that the candidates will all believe in a couple of principles that I think we believe in. First,
that the quality of life is if not the single biggest issue, the biggest issue, and that is safe streets, clean
streets. For example, the homeless situation has to be handled. And so quality of life issues are very
important that they're #1 on my list. On my list, the second is that we need to be a growing city with
growing -- with employment growing, which I think everybody subscribes to, which means we have to be
a business-friendly city. And so every once in a while, we have plugged on that. The Amazon disaster a
couple of years ago in Long Island city is probably the #1 example of that. So quality of life, safe cities,
the homeless situation, being business-friendly are my -- the #1 and 2. We then have income inequality,
racial inequality, we have to be a fair city. And so those are the major issues, I think, in the campaign. And
I believe that the 3 or 4 candidates who are -- look like they have the best chance of being elected are all
well-qualified with respect to that.

I think one of the very interesting things about elections is that this is a time when the political leadership
or the political aspirants actually listen to the population. And I think that the message that I just said,
and I think is the universal message that's going from the voters to the politicians. It may be -- some
groups of voters may say, income inequality and racial inequality is more important. Others may say
business-friendly and quality of life. But those 4 major points are the issues, I think, in our city at every
other great city, probably in the world right now. And I'm very hopeful that we will get a mayor one of the
2 or 3 or 4 leading candidates that will be well-qualified in that regard.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe just first one, Steve, you talked -- obviously, there's a lot of activity on the development front and
future development. I'm just wondering, in the past, you've made comments about the right time to buy
and I know the stress has not been plentiful. But given the bullish view on office over a multiyear period,
can you maybe walk us through how you're thinking about value-added opportunities in the New York
area?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

As you -- as I think you have heard today and over the years, we are extremely bullish on New York. We
are, as they say, loaded up on New York, and we think we like our position. I am disappointed that there
has not been in this period, unique opportunities to add value by buying distress, which is something that
we have been able to do in past cycles. But that's not the way this has worked out. So this has kind of
been a weird period. We've gone through a recession, a COVID-caused recession. It really didn't hurt our
main businesses, in terms of our occupancies, but it did nick our income by $200 million because certain
of our businesses were shut down like signage and garages, et cetera.

On the other hand, interest -- and the other benefit of that is interest rates are historically low, chronically
low. It looks like they're going to be low forever, which is something I think we have to be a little bit
thoughtful about before we subscribe to that. But there really hasn't been very much in terms of distress
that we've been able to buy, although we've been looking very hard. So I'm disappointed in that, but what
is, is. I do believe that the best opportunity that we have for capital in our business, by far and away, is
investing in the Penn District, which I think if one has a 5- and even a 10-year view, is going to be one of
the great investments and one of the great developments in -- out there. So that's my view.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Two more real quick ones. Just on street retail and particularly the vacancies on fifth Avenue. Can
you maybe talk to us about where are we specifically on fifth and just more premium corridors, where are
we in terms of rent levels that are low enough to attract retailers to really come back and start signing
leases? Just wondering how do you start to fill up some of the vacancies that you have in the portfolio?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

As Haim said a couple of minutes ago, this is a market cycle that we've been through many times, and
I think we can almost predict how these cycles go. There is a -- and by the way, this is a very difficult
cycle because, in addition to everything else, we have the secular change from brick-and-mortar retailer to
internet shopping, which is a secular change, which sort of makes this cycle much deeper. Nonetheless, it's
the cycle. So there's lots of vacancies.

The first thing that happens is that the vacancies are scooped up by a group of tenants who realize the
value and who have business models that can operate and thrive with reasonable rents. When the vacancy
starts to get to be absorbed, the rents rise. And during the whole process, the highest quality space
demand -- commands the highest rents and the highest demand. So that's beginning to happen now.

And as Haim said a few moments ago, the retailers that have thrived are beginning to recognize that this
is the bottom and are beginning to recognize that they want to add and even in New York aggressively
add at this price point, the unique, important scarce site. So an example the that is that we did a deal
with Fendi on Madison Avenue 57th Street recently. We extended a lease with Tods on Madison Avenue at
60th Street recently. And there's multiple other examples of that. So what's going to happen is, I wouldn't
focus on the spot rent today, that's meaningless. That's the rent that is -- that rent will disappear in a
year. And so what's happening is the smart players, the players who have a business model that works are
beginning to absorb the good space and that will cause the market to shift. And in a year or 18 months
or so, you'll see a totally different market. And in 3 years from now, you'll see a monumentally different
market, which will be thriving with much higher rents.

Great. And then just one quick clarification on Facebook. Can you maybe remind us the contribution -- the
GAAP contribution that's there this year? Is some of that already recognized in the numbers? And just how
does that ramp over the next 6 to 12 months?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

We're not going to comment on the details of the Facebook lease other than to say, we are so pleased
with our relationship, and they are pleased with us. The most recent deal that we did with Facebook was
730,000 square feet in a very height of the pandemic to give you a feel for the courage that it takes for
even somebody at Facebook scale to sign a lease, multi, multi, multi-hundred million dollar commit --
financial commitment. In the last summer, if you remember, the Facebook lease, which covers 730,000
square feet in Moynihan and in Farley is totally unique space that we believe and I think they believe is
unique across the country for where it is in the city of New York. And the scale of it being a low-rise with
150,000 square foot floor plate. So we anecdotally talk to their -- some of their occupiers, their engineers.
They are very excited. They can't wait to get into the space. And other than that, we're not going to
comment on the financial details.

We have our next question from Daniel Ismail with Green Street.

Daniel Ismail
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Great. Glen, I believe you mentioned the stabilization in office concessions. I was just curious, is that a
reference to concessions maintaining their current level or a return to pre-COVID amounts?

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

I'm referring to stabilizing as of during pandemic, not pre, we're not back to pre for sure. The goal is to
get back to pre, we're not there yet, but they have stopped rising for sure. I'm talking about in the current
environment during the pandemic.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Dan, the same comment about markets. The market has to tighten up a little bit when the market tightens
up, the concessions will tighten up as well.

Daniel Ismail

Got it. And then just a quick question for me on Penn. Any update on the ground lease at PENN1?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

No.

Daniel Ismail
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then a bigger picture question on a few of the non-office assets you mentioned in the annual
letter. How do you view non-office opportunities like studios, gaming, et cetera, as a percentage of the
overall company? How big can some of these non-office opportunities be?

Steven Roth

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Chairman of the Board & CEO

That's an unanswerable question. The reason I put that in there was, I think that our shareholders have
a -- would like to know some of the things that are parking below the surface, even though they may not
be that imminent. So for example, gaming is an interesting thing. There are -- everybody that follows New
York knows that there are 3 gaming licenses that are yet to be issued in the New York, in the New York
Enabling Legislation and that they are targeted for down state. And there's been a fair amount of news
about that recently, where some people who are following not our company, but following the basic ebb
and flow of stuff in New York knows about this.

Now those 3 licenses are scheduled to be released in 2023, but there has been a great deal of speculation
and press that, that may be accelerated earlier because of the budget deficits, et cetera. The urgency
may be offset a little bit because the general governments close those deficits, but who knows. So we
have probably the largest portfolio, and we have been receiving multiple incomings from the gaming
industry operators who will be applying for those licenses and competing for those licenses. And so the
inquiries that we have gotten have been for Manhattan properties. And it turns out that if consensus that
our potential assets are probably the best. We have multiple assets, and they're probably the best suited
for this kind of activity.

So now, I mean, we have -- we realize that there is in the enabling legislation, which was passed 4, 5 or
6 years ago, there's a prohibition against gaming in Manhattan. So that's sort of a disconnect. Why are
the operators coming in, in multiple inquiries about our assets when there's a prohibition? So the market
is sort of saying, well, maybe that prohibition doesn't make a lot of sense, et cetera. So when you think
about it, there's going to be 3 licenses issued. It does make sense that one would be to the east of the
Long Island region. One would be to the Westchester region, and then there is the third.

Well, and as I wrote about this, fairly short was it doesn't make a lot of sense for that third license to be
issued in direct competition, the one on Long Island or one in Westchester, and that leaves Manhattan,
which may be the golden goose in terms of getting revenue for our school systems and what have you.
So it's impossible to predict how this comes out. We have multiple assets that are of high interest to these
folks. This is a complicated political process. And all I can say is we're just satisfying incoming interest and
we'll see where that goes. But you can discount that to 0 in your spreadsheet. Although if it did happen,
it would be financially interesting. We have no, no, no interest in being in the gaming industry or being an
operator or anything like that. We are a real estate vendor. That's what we do.

With respect to the sound space business, it's exactly the same story. We are a real estate vendor. We
are not going Hollywood. Although I think some of us would like to have a bit part somewhere, whatever.
And we are responding to incomings from an industry, which is a streaming industry, which is unbelievably
hot. They have a quick deal of interest in being in Manhattan because that's where the talent is. So these
are nascent ideas, which I put into the letter because I think our shareholders are entitled to know some
of the things that are going on in the background. These will undoubtedly not become large parts of our
business, but who knows.

Just remember, I said, you can look at -- the Penn District, it could be Hollywood, Hollywood East. It
won't, for sure, but it's an interesting thing that sort of fantasize about.

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

Daniel, all these things that Steve referenced are -- and I think to me, the key point for you guys,
shareholders, et cetera, is our job is to maximize the value of our assets, right? We look under every
rock, how to do that. And you got the streaming business, which is booming. Steve, just talked about the
gaming dynamics. And so our objective every day we come to work is how do we maximize the value of
our assets and look every different direction. And so anything we may do here would be accretive to what
we have today. And that's what we do on every asset, right? A lot can't be repurposed, but some things
can be.

Great. I appreciate the color. And then just a very quick follow-up, if I may. You mentioned the budget
deficit, Steve. Is there any potential given the fiscal concerns to potentially getting further density at or
around Penn District?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

There is a GPP, a general positive plan, which was introduced by the State Economic Development
Commission, which would take the assets that circle, Penn Station and supply more density and that is
a pending initiative which has been promulgated by the state. And there are 2 things sort of involved in
that: The first is, is that everybody, everybody is in favor of improving Penn Station from a logistic point
of view, from a traffic point of view, from a usability point of view and from an aesthetic point of view.
And so the state government and the railroads are actively involved in multiple attempts to do that, which
involves public money.

In addition, it's a totally accepted land planning principle that the most density in any city should be
at and surrounding the transit hub, and that's us. So that's in process now. The -- it's going through
community comment periods, et cetera. And so there's a lot going on in that regard.

We have our last question in queue. It is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I just want to go back. You mentioned about Penn Station and the mayoral, I think it was Jamie who
asked about the mayoral situation. But when you look to Albany, they just passed $4 billion in taxes on
the wealthy, which are really the business leaders. And those are the people who are leaving at the same
time, SALT repeal doesn't look likely. So Steve, how do you -- as you think about Penn Station and you
mentioned that there's some pushbacks on the tracking stock. How do you think about you're putting
billions of dollars of investment into the Penn Station area when Albany seems to be -- and you couple it
with the Amazon fiasco a few years ago seems to almost be encouraging people to relocate. How do you
sort of reconcile those two?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

My children want me to go to Puerto Rico. Look, New York, there will always be New York. New York will
always be great. New York will always be a high tax place to live and it will be -- it will continue to be the
center of commerce. And it will continue to be the business capital of the United States. Now I agree with
you that the folks in various governments. By the way, the price may come out of Washington in terms
of taxation, Albany maybe a second runner here. But the point of it is, is that the loss of some very high
earners who are at retirement age, by the way, is something that is happening. It's happening all around
the country. It's more -- it's happening more aggressively in California, by the way. And California folks
they flee to Texas, and New York folks flee to Florida.

What I'm saying basically is the backbone of New York is not the 20 or 30 hedge funds trillionaires or
billionaires who are going to Florida or wherever. The backbone of New York is the $300,000, $500,000,
even $1 million earning management people in their prime, in their 40s who are raising families, et cetera,
whose jobs can -- who are not the heads of their businesses and can live anywhere, whose jobs and future
depends upon being in New York, where they can do 3x better than they can do anywhere else. As

long as that -- as long as that holds, New York will be fine. And as we see it, people like JPMorgan Chase
building, their new headquarters building, et cetera. The businesses that are -- I'm not talking about the
entrepreneurs who can live anywhere. And there are a very small number of people, although they're very
exponentially important. The mass of the talent that New York has pretty much is staying in New York, has

to stay in New York, wants to stay in New York, loves to stay -- loves to live in New York, and has to live in
New York because that's where these unique jobs are.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes. But Steve, you look at New York share of GDP, it was 11% 2 decades ago. Now it's down to 7. So it's
clear that the economic growth elsewhere is outpacing, and that just seems to be something where New
York depends on its historic laurels. That seems to be the biggest risk here?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, the answer to that is that New York is not growing as fast as some of these other smaller places are
growing, but it's still not contracting. And we still think there will be a demand for our product. I'm going
to set you up and get you a date to go up to Albany and talk to all my friends at Albany because I think
you have a lot to say.
