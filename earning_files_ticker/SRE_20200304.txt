ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being
recorded. At this time,

I'd like to turn the conference over to Faisel Khan. Please go ahead.

Faisel H. Khan
Senior Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this
teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Several
members of our management team are on the line with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief
Executive Officer of Sempra LNG; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Allen
Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of San Diego
Gas & Electric; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.

Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And as we continue to monitor the
potential impacts from the ongoing pandemic, it's important to keep in mind that actual results may differ
materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially
are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.

All of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we'll be
discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany
this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements
contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 4, 2020, and the company does not assume any
obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.

With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks a lot, Faisel, and thank you all for joining us today. We hope everyone's staying safe and well
during this public health crisis, and our hearts certainly go out to all of those who have been impacted by
this pandemic.

In the midst of all of this, we're reminded that our employees face health risks in their daily lives and
unique challenges in performing their jobs. That's why our first principle here at Sempra has been and
continues to be keeping them safe. On this slide, we provide a few examples of some of the health
and safety initiatives that we've implemented, all while providing critical services to our customers and
supporting our communities. Specifically, we've issued additional personal protective equipment for our
field employees and implemented revised protocols for customer engagement. We've hired an infectious
disease expert to assist us in implementing safety procedures for all employees. We've instituted travel
bans and limited building access. Employees that can work from home continue to do so. We've rolled out
enhanced resources for employees, such as technology reimbursements, revised sick and emergency leave
policies and expanded mental health services, and we've invested in our communities by committing over
$8 million across the Sempra family of companies to help those providing critical services to those in need.

I cannot be more proud of the commitment and dedication of all of our employees during this period. It
is one of those times of great challenge, where, notwithstanding the fact that many of us are working
remotely, it is our values and mission that continues to unite us. We're actively monitoring the situation
and will revise our protocols as necessary to continue providing safe and reliable service to over 35 million
consumers each day.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Please turn to the next slide. Before discussing the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and thank everyone
who joined us for our virtual Investor Day just over a month ago. We certainly appreciated having the
opportunity to provide you with important business updates and highlight our overarching strategy.
You'll recall that at the core of that strategy is our mission, where we've made a commitment to build
North America's premier energy infrastructure company. And one of the important takeaways from this
call, we believe, is that we're continuing to make great progress on that mission. Most recently, we've
completed the sale of our Peruvian businesses and expect to close the sale of our Chilean businesses later
this month. We also achieved mechanical completion and began the start-up of the third and final train
at Cameron LNG Phase I. And at ECA Phase I, we just recently finalized 2 sell and purchase agreements
totaling 2.5 million tons per annum. These 20-year agreements with high creditworthy counterparties
highlights a strategic advantage of being able to offer liquefaction capacity to our customers from facilities
on both the West Coast and Gulf Coast. Again, the execution of these 2 new agreements speaks to the
market need, particularly right here in North America, for critical new export infrastructure. We'll be
discussing these developments in more detail later in today's presentation.

In combination, our strategy, capital rotation program, improved capital discipline and effective execution
have improved the earnings power of our company, and this can be seen in our strong first quarter results.
Giving these positive developments, I'm pleased to say that we're reaffirming, and more importantly,
guiding to the upper end of our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance range. We are also reaffirming
our 2021 EPS guidance range.

Please turn now to Slide 6. Two years ago, we laid out a strategic plan to reposition our business and
improve our financial performance with 3 key objectives in mind: first, to focus our portfolio in the most
attractive markets in North America; second, to utilize our scale and strong operating history to create
a Tier 1 leadership position in those markets; and finally, to position our business in that portion of the
energy value chain where we believe we can produce the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Looking at our portfolio today, we've made great progress, focusing our geographic footprint on leading
energy markets in North America, while further improving the quality and strength of our earnings.
This approach has helped create a higher growth and more resilient infrastructure platform that is well
positioned to compete through different market cycles and deliver long-term value to our stakeholders.

Please now turn to Slide 7, where I'll provide an overview of our South American business sales. As
many of you saw, we recently completed the sale of our equity interest in our Peruvian businesses to an
affiliate of China Yangtze Power international for total cash consideration of approximately $3.6 billion.
Additionally, we continue to advance the announced sale of our equity interest in our Chilean businesses
to China State Grid International Development for an anticipated sales price of approximately $2.2 billion.
I'd like to emphasize that all parties remain quite motivated to complete the Chilean transaction and we're
targeted to close later this month.

I also think it's important to mention that closing the Peruvian transaction is yet another example of our
ability to execute our strategy even in a challenging business environment.

Please turn to the next slide. Our management team continues to strive to be prudent stewards of your
capital. Our recent efforts over the last couple of years have resulted in approximately $8.3 billion of
announced proceeds from completed and pending asset sales. This capital recycling has provided us with
the level of capital efficiency as we expanded our utility footprint in Texas with Oncor, and as a follow-on,
grew that platform with the subsequent acquisition of InfraREIT.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Trevor to review our current liquidity position and credit profile as well
as to discuss our operational and financial results. Please turn to the next slide.

Trevor Ian Mihalik
CFO & Executive VP

Thanks, Jeff. Many of you saw a similar slide at our recent Investor Day. But here, we've revised it to
reflect our updated liquidity position. I want to call out the largest change, which is the incorporation of
the proceeds received from the sale of our Peruvian businesses. As of Friday, Sempra parent's liquidity

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

is over $6 billion, up significantly from the $3.3 billion at the Investor Day. Combined, Sempra parent,
SDG&E and SoCalGas have $6.7 billion of revolving credit capacity. Those facilities are currently undrawn
other than support for the approximate $600 million of commercial paper that's outstanding at parent.
As this slide illustrates, the combined Sempra family of companies have a very strong liquidity position.
We currently have nearly $10 billion of liquidity, including cash on hand and undrawn committed credit
facility. This is before the sale of our Chilean assets, which we expect to conclude later this month. It also
excludes Oncor, which has a strong liquidity position, with roughly $2.5 billion.

When we talk about the resilience of our business, liquidity is an important part of that because it helps us
ensure that we can safely operate our businesses, fund our capital plan and support a growing dividend.

Please turn to Slide 10. Now I would like to discuss the steps we're taking to improve our credit profile.
Our Board of Directors and management team have taken a series of disciplined steps to allocate capital
more efficiently, while improving our credit metrics. Specifically, we've diversified our U.S. utility rate base
into the pure-play T&D assets in the Texas market, divested U.S. renewables generation and nonutility
natural gas storage assets, issued $6.5 billion of common equity and mandatory convertible preferred
stock as part of the $9.45 billion acquisition of Oncor and moved 2 of the 3 trains of Cameron LNG Phase 1
into operations, with the third only months away, and optimized project economics and cash flows through
refinancing nearly half of its project debt.

When in full operation, this will provide a valuable and recurring stream of cash flows. In combination,
the result has been a continuous decrease in the ratio of our holding company debt to total debt, while
improving the quality of our earnings mix and business risk profile. With this in mind, we also continue to
target approximately 16% FFO to debt and 50% debt to total capitalization by year-end. We do not plan to
issue any common equity to fund our current capital plan.

Please turn to Slide 11. This quarter, we had several positive developments at our U.S. utility
infrastructure businesses. First, at SDG&E, we had our FERC cost of capital all party settlement approved.
Notably, our FERC authorized ROE will now be 10.6%, including the continuation of the 50 basis point
CAISO adder. This is an increase of 55 basis points over our previously authorized ROE of 10.05%. As
a reminder, SDG&E's FERC rate base is approximately 40% of its total rate base. We're pleased with
this decision and believe it benefits all stakeholders. Second, at both SDG&E and SoCalGas, we recently
filed a joint petition for modification related to the 2019 general rate case. Per the CPUC's direction,
we requested attrition rates for our fourth and fifth years. At SDG&E, we requested 4.77% and 4.64%
for 2022 and 2023, respectively. At SoCalGas we requested 4.95% and 4.16% for 2022 and 2023,
respectively.

In support of a 5-year rate case outcome, we believe these attrition rates are reasonable and should
enable us to continue investing in critical infrastructure designed to deliver safe and reliable energy to our
customers and the communities we serve. We requested a final decision on this matter by year-end.

Shifting to Texas. Oncor continues to execute on its capital plan. About 90% of the projects in Oncor's
transmission budget through 2021 do not need further approvals before commencing construction. On the
distribution side, Oncor connected approximately 18,000 new customers in the first quarter. Furthermore,
overall demand in ERCOT actually increased in the first quarter of 2020 over the first quarter of last year.
The increase was roughly 1%, but it's still notable given the market backdrop. In addition, Governor
Abbott has announced a phased reopening of businesses to help restart the Texas economy.

Please turn to Slide 12, where I will discuss developments at Sempra LNG and Sempra Mexico. Starting at
Cameron LNG Phase I, we've achieved mechanical completion, introduced feed gas and initiated the start-
up process for Train 3. Importantly, this keeps us on track to produce LNG in the second quarter and to
place Train 3 into service early in the third quarter. At this point, construction is essentially complete, and
we look forward to bringing the entire facility into operation soon. As a reminder, we expect this project to
generate full run rate earnings of $400 million to $450 million annually and nearly $12 billion of after debt
service cash flows back to us during the 20-year contract period.

Shifting to the LNG market and our development project. We've had a long-held belief that new LNG
infrastructure will be needed by the middle part of this decade to support increasing demand. With fewer

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

projects expected to take FID as a result of reduced capital spending in the oil and gas sector and some
LNG developers being financially constrained, we believe there will be an even greater need for our
projects. Our financial strength and advantaged locations on the West Coast and Gulf Coast help provide
us with a competitive advantage to continue to grow our LNG infrastructure platform.

Along these lines, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we recently signed 20-year sale and purchase agreements
with Total and Mitsui for a total of 2.5 million tons per annum at ECA LNG Phase I. We continue to work
closely with the Mexican government to secure the final SENER permit and to reach FID. We continue to
target FID this quarter, and we're optimistic the permit can be issued in a timely manner to support that.

Shifting to Port Arthur LNG Phase I. This past quarter, we announced a fixed price turnkey EPC agreement
with Bechtel. However, given the current market environment, we've updated the FID timing for the
project to 2021. We continue to work with our current and potential customers on the optimal timing of
the project and will continue to be disciplined on how we allocate capital to the project. Turning to Sempra
Mexico. We're continuing to develop projects that provide cleaner, more reliable energy as well as energy
accessibility for the people of Mexico. We're continuing to monitor the situation, but as a result of the
current pandemic, it's reasonable to expect that some of the construction capital will be deferred from
2020 to 2021.

Nevertheless, we believe demand for our existing network of pipelines and power assets remain strong
and are critical to the people of Mexico.

Please turn to Slide 13. Looking at our financial results, this was a really excellent quarter. Earlier this
morning, we reported strong first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $760 million or $2.53 per share. This
compares to first quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $441 million or $1.59 per share.

In our ongoing effort to build resiliency and continuing to resolve legacy matters, we recorded 2 charges in
the first quarter. First, we recorded a charge of $100 million related to our previous ownership of the RBS
Sempra Commodities trading business. This charge represents an estimate to settle certain tax-related
legal matters associated with activities of more than a decade ago.

Second, we recorded a $72 million after-tax charge related to the 2015 Aliso Canyon incident. We have
recently engaged in settlement discussions with private plaintiffs related to the civil litigation. As you may
recall, we settled with the government plaintiffs in 2019 for $120 million. For more information regarding
Aliso Canyon, please refer to our 10-Q.

Shifting back to the consolidated earnings. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2020 earnings were $932
million or $3.08 per share. This compares favorably to our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of $534
million or $1.92 per share.

Please turn to Slide 14. The variance in first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings when compared to last
year was affected by the following key items: $66 million of income tax benefit in 2019 at the California
Utilities resulting from the January 2019 regulatory decision that provided direction on how to allocate
certain excess deferred income tax balances, this was offset by $174 million of higher earnings at the
California Utilities from higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, including $120
million of lower CPUC base operating margin in 2019 due to the delay in the issuance of the 2019 GRC
final decision; a $136 million variance at Sempra Mexico due to the impacts from foreign currency and
inflation effects net of foreign currency hedges; $85 million of higher earnings at Sempra LNG from higher
equity earnings from Cameron, primarily due to Train 1 and Train 2 commencing commercial operations
under their tolling agreements in August 2019 and February 2020, respectively; as well as higher earnings
from Sempra LNG marketing operations, primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices; $38 million of
higher earnings from higher electric transmission margin at SDG& E, including impacts from the March
2020 FERC-approved TO5 settlement proceeding; and $11 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra
Texas Utilities, driven primarily by the impact of Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT in May of 2019 and higher
revenues due to rates being updated to reflect increases in investor transmission capital. This was partially
offset by higher operating costs and lower consumption due to weather.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Please turn to the final slide. Our management team is very pleased with the progress we've made so far
this year. The accomplishments discussed are a direct result of the successful execution of our strategic
mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company, and we feel well positioned for
success going forward. The key for us is to stay focused on executing our capital plan, which is primarily
focused on our California and Texas Utilities. We also are committed to ensuring the delivery of safe
and reliable energy to our customers and the communities we serve, enabling energy security and
diversification locally and globally and expanding energy accessibility. In combination, our strategy, well-
executed capital rotation and disciplined execution of our CapEx program are all designed to improve our
business resiliency and overall financial performance.

Finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees, particularly those on the front lines, who have continued to
work diligently in pursuing our mission and safely serving our customers and communities. We're fortunate
to have such a talented and dedicated workforce, one that has maintained a culture of high performance
during this challenging period, which has impacted us all in various ways.
With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to first just touch on ECA and the process from here in terms of the export permit. Could you
just talk in a little more detail in terms of just what the steps are to get through that process, the review
by SENER and sort of just where we stand just so we can try to follow that a little more closely?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Stephen, for that question. I'll provide a little bit of context on where we're at from the LNG
standpoint, and then I'll pass it to Dennis, who's been following that closely, both on the U.S. government
side as well as the Mexican side.

I think one of the things that I would just like to call out for purposes of this call is we've long talked
about the competitive advantages of our company, Stephen, around scale and financial strength in the
LNG space, our long history in the natural gas space dating back to the middle part of the 1800s, the
geographically advantaged nature of our projects and the fact that 4 out of 5 of them are brownfield
projects, which we believe gives us a cost advantage. So by signing 3 contracts in the last 3 weeks, I
think, it speaks to the importance of these advantages. And we talked about it a little bit in our prepared
remarks. We've been very, very clear and consistent about our view of there being a deficit and needed
export infrastructure all around the world in the middle part of the decade. And I think as you think about
the market dislocation that's occurring in the oil and gas markets, this is the time where we think that
the need in the middle part of the decade will only become more acute because the low prices of today
are allowing for greater market penetration for LNG, both in new markets in Europe, and particularly East
Asia, by the way. And I think that the same market is challenging many of the other less well-capitalized
developers. So to get 2 new contracts essentially to sell-out the capacity at ECA is a big positive. And
I would also mention this is the first time ever in the history of our company that we've had all of our
customers at Cameron sign up for Phase 2. So that's a nice step forward as we look to continue the
development there. But the next big step in terms of FID is the heart of your question, which is the SENER
permit, and I'll pass that to Dennis for additional commentary.

Dennis Victor Arriola
Executive VP & Group President

Thanks, Jeff. And Stephen. Yes, look, there's no doubt that what's going on in Mexico with the pandemic
has the government focused on that. And it is impacting the timing of the SENER approval. But I think
that one of the other things that we've taken into consideration is that this is the first time that SENER
has had to approve an LNG export facility in Mexico. So it's a different animal for them. But having said
that, the discussions our teams have had with various members of the administration in Mexico, including
the President of -- himself, that gives us great confidence that the SENER permit is going to get approved.
It's just a matter of timing. I mean when you look at what's going on in Mexico and specifically in Baja,
California, this project is extremely important to that region, given the number of jobs it's going to bring,
the economic stimulus and just the impact it's going to have on the municipality. So we've been having
conversation with the governor of the state, and he's extremely supportive of this project and has spoken
out on that.

The other thing I'd mention is, when you look at this project, it's not only good for the U.S. and our
natural gas producers, but it brings badly needed foreign direct investment to Mexico, it brings natural
gas to customers and businesses in the region, and it also provides offtake customers in Asia with a highly
competitive and strategic access point on the West Coast. So this is a winner. It's just a matter of timing.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. So if I'm sort of hearing that correctly, certainly, COVID can cause delays, but it's not as if
there's some sort of change either politically or policy-wise, just that would drive a different outcome or
more challenge than we've seen before.

Dennis Victor Arriola
Executive VP & Group President

No, we don't believe so. Again. I think everyone understands the economic impact and what this does, not
just to export gas through Mexico, but it actually brings natural gas to that region, which badly needs it.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

I would also add to Dennis' point, Stephen, too, is the level of support we've had from the Secretary of
Energy, Secretary of State, the entire administration here in the United States has also been quite helpful.
So I mean, our forecast remains that we'll get the SENER permit in the second quarter. We've got the right
team in place to do it. But I think we have to be sensitive to the fact that everyone, not just in the United
States, but in Mexico is taking the COVID challenge very seriously, and that's certainly impacting the delay
as the agencies are currently shut down.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's really helpful color. And if I could just follow up separately on Oncor. We've always liked the growth
outlook in Texas. I wonder if you could just refresh us in terms of just potential areas for additional
spending, other policy objectives in the state or just any other areas of upside as you look at your Texas
business.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I'll tackle that at a high level. We've got the benefit of having Allen online, and I'll pass it to Allen.
And I'll go back to kind of the fundamentals that Sempra has. I think if you've followed, Stephen, for a
long time, we've really been trying to strategically reposition the company more around utility investments
in the United States; and secondly, specifically T&D investments. So California really is an infrastructure
opportunity because we're decoupled here. This is all about deploying capital for safety and reliability in
the state of California. Very, very similar in Texas. Not only is Oncor not commodity exposed, they don't
own generation. So we're very attracted to that T&D business model. So Allen laid out at our Investor
Day, $11.9 billion record 5-year capital program for his business. And you may recall, he had a separate
slide on additional capital opportunities. So even though they're seeing some impacts from the pandemic
in Texas, like a lot of other places, number one, Governor Abbott is reopening the state; and number
two, really interesting feedback on the demand. Even in ERCOT, year-over-year demand in Q1 was up,
not down, which is interesting. And one of the things I've been intrigued by is, even as you think about
impacts in the Delaware Basin or the Permian, you still have a very high percentage of drillers that are
using standby generation, and there's a huge price discount that allows them to lower the marginal cost of
production if they can connect to the grid. So the activity in Allen's team remains quite high. But I'll stop.
And Allen, if you can provide some more commentary about the diversity of your load and the diversity of
your growth, I think that might be helpful to Stephen.

E. Allen Nye
CEO & Director

You bet, Jeff, and thanks, Stephen, for the question. I think Jeff covered most of it. But just to reiterate,
our $11.9 billion over 5 years, we still feel good about the $2.5 billion based on what we know right
now for this year. We actually have a little upward pressure. You may have seen, we spent a little more
in Q1 than we had anticipated. But we still have -- we have, for example, increase in generation and

10

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

interconnection requests. I think the last time we talked, we had about 10 at the analyst conference.
We're up to 13 now for this year's plan. We are continuing to see some pressure in West Texas with our
transmission projects out there, both on the construction clearances and on the [indiscernible] side. So
we're seeing some increased CapEx there. And while West Texas, certainly, we're going to see some offset
with some customers delaying projects and things like that. Just as a data point, as of last week, we
did receive 22 additional requests for new oil and gas load in West Texas. So we have our transmission
projects that we're working on, 3-year project in West Texas.

To Jeff's point, a report filed with ERCOT last week identifies approximately 40% of the load in that region,
oil and gas load, is self-generating right now. So we continue to build to those operators. I mentioned the
renewable generation uptick. And we're continuing to invest in reliability projects and congestion relief in
the area.

So we feel good based on what we know right now about our $2.5 billion this year, as Jeff also mentioned
in the analyst conference, we had a better part of $1 billion identified as additional incremental. We'll just
see how that goes, what the needs are. Some of that is deferred maintenance based on the significant
growth we've had over the last few years. But that's where we are right now. We feel good based on what
we know about the $2.5 billion. There are still opportunities on our system to invest. We connected 18,000
new premises in Q1. Some of those certainly will be deferred and delayed depending on how long this
goes. But overall, right now, we feel good about our $2.5 billion, and plus we have the incremental capital
available, if necessary.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Allen.

Operator

And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a couple of questions here. On the credit metrics, there's obviously a review that's outstanding, but
you obviously have a very good capital recycling story with the South America assets and delevering.
How patient sort of are the rating agencies on seeing the sell-through and the plan that you highlighted
today, including a noticeable reduction in the Holdco debt? It'sa 90-day review period. So how are the
conversations going? And how do we sort of think about taking the downgrade -- the potential downgrade
versus incremental equity that could satisfy their balance sheet concerns? You're obviously [indiscernible]
LNG and regulated CapEx opportunities.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Shar, appreciate the question. And I think I'll start back in 2017, in the summer, we were looking at
making the investment in EFH. We spent a lot of time with the agencies in and around how we would
finance the transaction. You may recall, we even increased the amount of equity to be used in that
transaction to accommodate kind of our goals. At that time, we set out goals that would support an
investment-grade plus rating to acquire that business. And one of the things you recall we did was, we
actually laid out a broader strategic reposition of the business about how we were moving from being
South America invested to be an North American focused, and not just in North America, but around a
different quality of assets around T&D, which, I think, lowered our business risk profile. At that point in
time, we laid out some goals with the agencies through 2030 -- I mean, through 2020, I'm sorry. And I
think part of the discussion we had at Investor Day and on this call really is the progress we're making
towards those goals. So I think our business today, with Cameron coming online, with us more invested
in North America and with us more invested with regulatory diversity into Texas and particularly pure-play
T&D, we've made a lot of progress. I think Trevor, perhaps, you can update us on the metrics that we're
tracking to and how you think we're doing for the rest of the year with the agencies.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Trevor Ian Mihalik
CFO & Executive VP

Sure, Jeff. Thanks for the question, Shar. As Jeff said, we are continuing to target our FFO-to-debt metric
of 16% by the end of the year. And what we are also doing with the recycling of the capital, targeting our
debt-to-cap ratio of around 50%, and we brought our parent debt down to about 26% by the end of this
year. So look, we continue to work with the agencies around our plan, help them understand how we've
significantly derisked this business. And as I said at the analyst conference and reiterate it today, we don't
have to issue equity to to reach these metrics. I will say that our high BBB+ rating is important to us, but
we also need to balance that with what's also important to our shareholders.

And then the last thing, I would also point out that we have pushed Port Arthur into 2021. And this is one
of the areas that the rating agencies have raised that, if you get into LNG in a big way, they would look at
this. And so we believe this is a very strong credit profile.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just on Slide 8, when you talk about sort of capital allocation, there's some language,
obviously, there where you referenced further expanding your utility footprint in Texas,

and I know Allen touched a little bit on the capital opportunities. Can you just maybe a little bit elaborate
further on this? Is this organic? Is it inorganic? Are you kind of referring to the remaining ownership stake
you don't own with Oncor, with TTI? Or do you see other opportunities there? Just trying to get a sense?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Shar, I appreciate giving us the opportunity to clarify that. If you go back and look at the prepared
remarks, what we're really talking about was the level of capital efficiency that we could generate from
a relatively ambitious capital rotation program that we announced in the first half of 2018. Because
as you see on that slide, it talks about announced and pending proceeds of about $8.3 billion, and we
bought Oncor for $9.45 billion, I mean, the EFH portion of Oncor as well as spending about another $1
billion on InfraREIT. What's effectively taken place is, we've taken noncore assets, or assets in South
America, and in the process of selling those, we've effectively rotated them into Oncor and InfraREIT. And
this really goes to the heart of your credit question because you're getting higher quality earnings, and
you're getting a lower risk profile. And I think that's reflected in the original commitments we made to the
agency back in 2017. And then I would just go on to say that we're opening up the center of excellence
in the second half of this year in Houston at the Galleria. That's really to support the growth in Justin's
business in LNG as we look to continue to support both Cameron Phase II and Port Arthur from that
Houston office. So look, it is a market of strategic significance to us. And I think the purpose of that slide,
Shar, was to really highlight the capital efficiency of rotating from those businesses into a new market for
us.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. So nothing inorganic for you within the state.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Mainly just follow-ups here. So just on the Texas Business Oncor, do you have any data yet for the month
of April since that was really when we had the kind of...

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it's interesting. We talked a little bit about that the overall growth profile in ERCOT was up year-over-
year. And then Allen has some data for April 1. I think, as you'd expect, it's going to be different by asset
class. But I think at least -- and Allen, you can speak to this. I think your overall distribution revenues are
up in April compared to last year, but I'll let you speak to the -- what you're seeing on the system. Allen,
are you there?

E. Allen Nye
CEO & Director

Sorry, sorry. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I hit the wrong button. Thanks for the question, Steve. Here's
what we've got for April. Overall distribution based revenues were up 1% versus April '19. That includes
residential revenue increased by about 10% versus April of last year, C&I is down about 5.5% versus
last April. Weather normalized about 1.7% lower, with distribution rate base revenues about $4 million,
coming off a quarter of $150 million in revenues. So that's what we've got. That's what we're seeing so
far in April. We're continuing to expect weather to be the largest driver for the remainder of the year. As
we talked about before, weather typically goes plus or minus $25 million in revenues and plus or minus
$20 million in net income. 16 of the last 21 years have been positive in that regard. So we'll see what's
going to happen there. And then as someone mentioned earlier on the call, I think, it was Trevor, with the
governor phasing the opening of Texas, we expect to see some positives there as well. But we'll just have
to see how it goes as it opens. But those are the numbers we have for April so far.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And just one follow-up on that. So we're obviously seeing a continued shut-in of a very meaningful
amount of Texas, oil rigs, in particular, That, when we think of -- given the self-generation that a lot of
them do and your mix, that is not going to be kind of a big overall driver to your margin? Or how should
we think about that?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Go ahead Allen.

E. Allen Nye
CEO & Director

Yes. Let me try to -- sorry, go ahead. Let me try to address it this way. Approximately 12% of our overall
revenues come from West Texas. Of that amount, approximately 38% to 40% are on the industrial side.
So the rest are residential or commercial. So that's probably some guidance on what the exposure is
there. Jeff, I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Oh, that's okay. I think that's very helpful. And the other thing I was going to say, Steve, is that Allen's
team continues to update us on, I think, something in the neighborhood of 30% or 40%, Allen, and
correct me if I'm wrong, still you standby generation at the 25%, 30% level. So there's still a clamoring
for people who are producing to move to the grid So most of Allen's capital program is -- laid out for this
year and next year is pretty much locked in, Steve, not really on incremental new growth, but catching up
for growth that's already been registered on the system. But is that a fair way to characterize it, Allen?

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

That's correct, Jeff, both on the CapEx over the next couple of years as well as the report that we cited
has 40% of oil and gas load basically in the region on self-gen.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Thank you.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. One other general question. So just the -- was nice to see you point to the high end of your 2020
range, given everything that's going on. So just some of the things that happened this quarter, like FX can
move around. So just -- when you think about -- when we think about what's driving you to the high end
of that range, could you just kind of give a simple view of what the drivers are for that?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, Steve. I'll be glad to. I'll provide a little bit context about how I'm thinking about it, and Trevor can
speak to some of the drivers in the quarter and why I think we feel fairly confident going forward.

One of the things we've done as a team, Steve, is to think back to what we tried to accomplish in 2019.
You may recall, having followed us, that we had our original guidance of $5.70 to $6.30. And in the second
half of the year, we raised last year's guidance to $6 to $6 50 and still exceeded that. You may recall, just
in our Q4 call, we reported full year adjusted earnings of $6.78. So we had a banner year yet last year
with record earnings of $1.91 billion on an adjusted basis. So to put that in perspective, in the first quarter
of this year, we have produced and recorded roughly 1/2 of the earnings from full year 2019, right?

So even though it's early in the year, we have a pretty robust view of what we think we can accomplish.
And a lot of it, Steve, is driven by the fact that across our utilities, we remain on track with our capital
programs, which are fairly aggressive.

And now I conclude before passing to Trevor that one of the things we've agreed to do in our team is, as
we go into the summer, we're going to do a full bottoms-up on our 2020 and our 2021 guidance range and
make sure that we're in a position to make the appropriate adjustments as we go into our Q2 call. So we
are quite bullish on our forecast for 2020, and we're going to try to update that and take a second look at
2021 as we get closer to our August call. But Trevor, perhaps you can talk about some of the things that
you're seeing from the quarter that causes our confidence level to be high for the remainder of the year.

Trevor Ian Mihalik
CFO & Executive VP

Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Steve, Jeff really did cover a lot of this. But again, I would direct you maybe to Slide
14 of the deck, where we did the waterfall up from last year. And again, if you take a look at some
of the big drivers, you certainly are seeing the numbers at the California Utilities with the CPUC base
operating margin up by $174 million, very constructive rate case that we're now seeing the impact as
we're implementing the rate case and providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Also, we had a
good result as -- from the FERC around the TO5. And so that also is in the transmission margin at SDG&E
of $38 million as we implemented that. And then again, Cameron, we saw Train 2 come on a little early,
and we're hopeful that maybe Train 3 could come on a couple of weeks early, and that will also give us
a great deal of surety around where we're going to end up for the year. And then Oncor continues, as
Allen said, to implement their capital plan. So we feel very, very good about the 3 utilities executing on
this robust capital plan during the year. And then of course, we do have mechanisms that are being put in
place at the 3 utilities to protect from any potential downside associated with the pandemic. So again, I
think that's why we felt pretty good about guiding to the upper end of the range.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Okay. And I apologize. I just want to ask one clarification, Jeff. Just the review of 2020, '21, as you go
into the middle of the year, are you kind of saying with a bias to the upside given what you did last year
and same thing happened as opposed to kind of dealing with pandemic-type risks. I just wanted to inquire
that.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

One of the things you remember, Steve, was in our June Analyst Day, which was in New York in 2018, we
went ahead and talked about our '18 guidance and our '19 guidance and actually put out and published
our 2020 guidance, right? The $6.70 to $7.50. So we put out that $0.80 range back in June of 2018. And
that's even as we were just starting the sales process for our solar and wind. We hadn't made a decision
at that point to sell South America. We've executed across a relatively sweeping capital rotation program
at the same time that we've been rotating capital back into California and Texas.

So I think what you're seeing is, we had strong momentum last year, while we were executing our capital
rotation program, and then that -- you're seeing that carry through into this year. And we go through a
pretty bottoms-up process to keep an evergreen plan. But look, I think what you're hearing is, we had a
remarkable first quarter in 2020. We're guiding to the high end of the range. We typically don't change our
guidance this early in the year, but we're certainly going to be positively inclined as we review both 2020
and 2021 as we go into the summer.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just on the Mexico FX gain in the quarter. Obviously, on the 20% devaluation, your rule of thumb would
have pointed to a bigger number, but you tell us that there are colors and other reasons, it wouldn't be
linear. But I'm just curious, is there anything embedded in Q1, where you -- any hedging cost that we
tried to lock some of this in perhaps? Or are we still open going into the rest of the year?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks a lot, Jonathan. I'll start with some context and pass it to Trevor, and he'll review the rule of thumb
and go through the financial statement impacts. But I always want to go back to first principles, which is,
we've been in this business for about 20 years in Mexico. And one of the things, I think, has really been
a critical advantage for us has been that our contract portfolio is U.S. dollar-denominated, which is a big
plus in that market. And we've got contract tenure in that portfolio of over 20 years. So we have a great
long-term contracted portfolio, it's U.S. dollar based, and that comes with the obligation that at year-end,
you remit your tax liability in pesos. So Trevor's team has traditionally done a very good job of having a
hedging strategy that allows us to lock in and support our plans. And I'll pass it to Trevor to review the
rule of thumb and the impact in the Q1 financial statement. And I think this is one of the things that was
always important for us to talk about when we talk about Mexico.

Trevor Ian Mihalik
CFO & Executive VP

Perfect. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. So Jonathan, again, I would direct you to our rule of thumb that basically says
for every 5% move in the peso, it's roughly about a $45 million of earnings impact. And again, I want
to emphasize that this earnings impact is really a noncash impact until you, ultimately, have to pay the
taxes. And as Jeff said, we're U.S. dollar-denominated in Mexico, but we pay taxes in the peso. So when
you actually look at Table F, Table F is the detailed financials that we show by each of the businesses that
we put out in the morning with regards to our press release, you'll see that there's 3 big line items that
are being impacted by FX. It's really other income that was $283 million negative in the current period.
And then you have the income tax line item, that's $307 million to -- a benefit. And that's really kind of

15

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

where all of the depreciating peso manifests itself on the P&L. And then there's also a line item equity
earnings. And there's -- the equity earnings really is the intercompany loan that we have with the marine
pipeline, and that's offset really -- the FX impact there is offset in the other income and expense line
item. So quite a few moving pieces. But as Jeff said, we do look to put a hedge strategy in place really to
protect ourselves from very large moves on the upside or the downside. And we're really kind of at that,
bumping up against that right now with regards to any further P&L benefit.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

So can I but let me just to restate my question, have you locked in any of the benefit at this point of the
year?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Jonathan, we take roughly the same approach every year. It's largely based on a costless collar. And we
don't typically lock it in. We have a range that we guide to, and the whole goal really is to minimize impact
to the plan. And I think we're comfortable with where our plan is today and what we've recognized. I think
Trevor is basically saying that, it's skewed basically to protect you more on the downside than the upside.
So you usually have a little bit more openness to a positive movement than a negative movement, but we
don't spend a lot of dollars to lock in a plan at any number like this.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And then just can I ask for a little -- on Chile, I think you said you're expecting to get it done yet this
month. And back on in Investor Day, I think you said that you were sort of waiting on, still making the
NDRC filing in China as the last step, and that was, hopefully, going to be days away. So I am just -- can
you give us -- has that now been made? Or do you -- is that statement about this month sort of based on
expectations of when we reopen to be able to get that last piece.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you. Very similar to what we're experiencing in Mexico. Obviously, the health care crisis is impacting
the -- it's a global issue, right? But we talked about this a little bit when we talked about our capital
recycling program and current liquidity in the -- in my prepared remarks. But certainly, Jonathan, we feel
like we've got momentum coming out of the Peru deal. The conversations now are really around closing
mechanics. Dennis, perhaps you can provide some additional color about our confidence level for May.

Dennis Victor Arriola
Executive VP & Group President

Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Jonathan. Yes, basically, as Jeff mentioned, we're focused on getting this thing done.
I think given the fact that China really was closed down in March and April, there's some backup in
some of the approvals that have been taking place. But I'll point you to one important fact here. SASAC,
which is the commission in China that approves M&A-type investments outside the country has already
approved State Grid International's investment in Chile. So that's really important. Everything that we're
hearing from the State Grid International executives and their advisers and conversations that I've had --
personally had with the Chairman Hu of State Grid International is they want to get this thing closed as
soon as possible. This is very strategic to their company going forward. And as Jeff mentioned, we're now
focused really on the details and the logistics related to the closing. As you'll recall, in Peru, we were able
to do this virtually, and we're trying to get everything done, even though there's limited travel in and out
of Chile. But given where we're at and the commitment and the motivation buy State Grid to get this thing
done, we're expecting to get it done before the end of the month.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a couple clarifications. Apologies to come back on this, but just with respect to credit, I just want
to clearly understand your expectations both in respect to what are the current minimums the rating
agencies are looking for versus the numbers, I think, Trevor, you articulated just now as to your year-
end targets? And then related to that, how do you think about ECA going FID, some of the other IEnova
spending moving out, how does that all filter into what the rating agencies are looking for? And again, I'm
just looking to understand this relative to the Moody's moves of late.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

So I would just say that, as I articulated earlier in today's call, Julien, is that we've spent a tremendous
amount of time with all 3 agencies going back to the summer of 2017. As we started a strategic
repositioning of the company, we laid out a set of metrics that we would guide to. And that set of metrics
was designed to do a couple of things. Number one, we wanted on the qualitative side to make sure
that we were taking steps to improve our business risk profile at the same time that we made firm
commitments around a balanced capital structure and moving to a 16% FFO to debt. So over the last 3
years, our targeted metrics have come down. We feel very comfortable about the commitments we've
made. And what you're hearing Trevor say is, we're tracking to the commitments we've made in 2017
that we're designed to make sure that we can maintain an investment-grade plus credit rating. I do think
Trevor's raised a good point. Some of the agencies have been more focused on whether the LNG business
has a different risk profile. And I think what we point to there is, in contrast to 2017, where we were in
construction mode, we're now in operating mode at Cameron and proceeding quite well toward Train 3
being online. That also will be very important.

So I think what the agencies are looking for is: number one, can you complete your capital recycling
program, and we're on track to do that in May of this year by closing Chile; number two, can you
commission Train 3 on time. And then as you may recall, there are some guarantees related to the
construction lending that falls away in the period of time after that. So we're tracking toward a basket of
metrics that we laid out going back to the summer of 2017. And we're also, operationally, trying to hit our
capital program, produce high-quality financial results and stick to our commitments around the capital
recycling program. So Trevor made this comment that there's always a balance of interest. Even having
Port Arthur pushed into 2021 will take some pressure off those discussions. But each of the agencies, they
have their own metrics that they evaluate. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to hit the ball right
down the middle of the field around the metrics that we committed to in 2017. We think our progress has
been quite good.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Said differently, you all articulated to the rating agencies back then and are still committed to
the same path, and they're taking whatever actions they maybe seem verbally, but at least from your
perspective, you work on doing exactly what you told them a couple years ago?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

That's right. And look, we have great relationships with all of them. I mean, this is a tough time for all of
us, given the current market environment. I'm sure they're doing with a lot of stuff, too. We have very
constructive relationships. And what we're trying to do is make sure, in a very earnest way, Julien, that we
stick to the commitments we've made regarding maintaining our investment-grade plus ratings.

And our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Can you just help us understand what -- how much of the year-over-year uptick in the California Utilities
is driven by the delay in the rate case? And how much was driven by what would have already been
recognized in the case in this year and if you could break it out for each of the 2 utilities, would be great.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

So Michael, you recall that we got our rate case approved in Q4 of last year, and this was the first ramp-
based decision that the commission had faced where Kevin and Bret laid out all the different type of
spending requirements relative to the risk that they were encountering in their operating environment.
And in round figures, you saw an approved revenue requirement for SDG&E that was a CAGR of about
5.7% annually across the 3 years of the rate case and closer to 8.5% for SoCalGas. So these were very,
very robust spending requirements around robust needs on the capital side. So we knew in Q4, and you
saw the recognition as that's related back to January 1, 2019. It was a very robust decision for us, and it
gave us a lot more certainty around the spending we needed to have for safety and reliability. And as you
come into this year, you're seeing that spending take place. The one catch-up piece that you're referring
to is the FERC decision. That decision relates back to June 1, 2019. I think the key takeaway, as you
think about the guidance discussion we've had in our prepared remarks and during the Q&A is that our
3 utilities, in general, are right on track on their capital program and they're doing a great job of making
sure that they're managing a very, very safe workplace and a safe environment for the community. So
a lot of what you're hearing us talk about is, we have a very constructive view of the rate decision. So
think about this, we got not only a 3-year rate decision, we got our cost of capital confirmed, then we got
our transmission cost of capital at FERC confirmed, and now we're filing for the attrition mechanisms for
years 4 and 5. So effectively, you've got a 5-year runway for your California utilities on this rate case, you
have a constructive attrition mechanism, you've locked in your cost of capital in the state of California, and
just in the last 6 weeks, you've locked in your FERC cost of capital. So the level of visibility we have to a
constructive regulatory environment in California is probably as high as it's ever been since I've been at
the company.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. I just want to make sure, though, I'm just -- if I'm looking at the Slide 14 that Trevor noted on, of
that $174 million in year-over-year earnings at the utilities at the California Utilities, $120 million of that
should have been recognized in the first quarter of '19, and so only $54 million of that is really kind of
incremental to first quarter of '20. Am I thinking about that right?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Let me let Trevor speak to the specifics of that slide for you, Michael.

Trevor Ian Mihalik
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, generally, Michael, if you look at that, the $174 million is the uplift from the rate case across the 2
utilities. But again, because we got the rate case late in 2019, a piece of that is retroactive back. And the
piece that's retroactive of the $174 million, it's roughly 2/3 retroactive and then 1/3 is the continuing uplift
from that number. So again, the $174 million is the full impact of the rate case. But if we had gotten the
rate case on a timely basis, you could assume that roughly 2/3 of that $174 million would have been kind
of not in that variance number.

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Just all that is, I mean, because the Q1 of 2019 did not have the rate case in it.

you remind us how much of that debt is bullet debt? And how much of the debt is the amortizing debt?

Is it beyond the lifetime in the contract? How does that work?

Yes, there's -- Michael, there's 4 maturities and all these bonds are traded in the public market, but it's
roughly $3 billion of bonds, 3 of those are bullet maturities in '35 -- '19 -- sorry, in 2035 and 2038 and
2031, the last one, the 2039 bond is an amortizing bond. All of those bonds mature before the end of our

Hope that I could ask one question, one follow-up. Just I guess specific to Port Arthur, the decision gets
pushed until next year. Is the challenges related to that decision more on the demand side, the supply side
or just the global economic overhang right now because of the virus?

Anthony, this is Jeff. I appreciate the question. We certainly think that what's unique about Port Archer,
you recall that, that's the one greenfield project we have in our portfolio. The other 4 are brownfield and
have a cost advantage. And the real value of Port Arthur is at scale. So there's really 3 mega projects on
the drawing board globally today: Arctic LNG, which is going forward in North Russia; the Qatari project,
which is the delayed; and the Port Arthur project. And I think we've got the benefit of having Justin with
us here today. And maybe, Justin, you can talk about where we're at on the marketing side and what
you're doing to actually make that project more competitive.

Justin Christopher Bird
President

Yes. Thank you, Jeff. And thanks for the question, Anthony. So again, I think our premise of the LNG
business is that we saw a need for additional infrastructure in the LNG space in the mid-2020s. We think
North America will play a critical role in that. And frankly, we at Sempra think, on a risk-adjusted basis,
we can return in excess of those of our utility side. So at Port Arthur, we see, again, a great opportunity,
really, as Jeff said, about the size and scale of that project. We are currently working with Aramco and
with PGNIG as the optimal timing for this project.

To the heart of your question, I think there's really 3 things. One would be the state of the financial
markets. I think the ability to go out and project finance Port Arthur in the current market is somewhat
limited. Second, to your point, is a bit of the marketing. I think in the short term, we see some uncertainty
and unpredictability, given what we're seeing in the oil prices. And the third thing I'd say is that we,
at Sempra, in partnership with Bechtel, see some opportunity to potentially decrease the cost of the
construction, given that we're seeing a global slowdown on large capital projects. So we think, frankly,
this project can be stronger, although delayed. We think it will bring a better return to our investors and,
frankly, be a better project for our customers.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. And my follow-up. This is kind of, I guess, following up on Shar's question. The company's done a
great job of recycling capital on the transition to more core assets. The LNG gets pushed out potentially
a year, potentially longer. There's some dislocation in market values right now. Does the company look
to replicate their success maybe of what's gone on in the last 2 years with buying their Texas assets and
looking at other assets in the U.S.?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

It's a good question. I think that we have tried to be very, very disciplined on the management team
and with our Board of Directors at laying out a strategic reposition of the company, right? So we've
had a pretty sweeping program over the last 2-plus years. I think the team has executed very well. I
think Dennis and Trevor and Kevin Sagara and others have all been part of that program. So we're very
pleased with the fact that we've gone from being a western hemisphere-focused company to being a North
American-focused company. And specifically, in North America, becoming much more weighted toward
U.S. utilities, with less focus on California, more going toward Texas. I think one of the things I would
take away from your question is, Oncor is a very unique opportunity, right? You had an 80% position in a
pure-play T&D company, probably the #1 asset in America, that had some distress around it. And it was
something we looked at for a long period of time. So it was an opportunity, as part of capital recycling,
to go into Texas with a marquee purchase. But look, we don't talk about future M&A, really. I think what
we're really focused on is we have a very attractive capital program, and we're going to execute it with a
lot of discipline and focus.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JpMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just want to kind of turn back. We've had a couple of conversations here. And just given the conversations
that we've been having with regards to the Moody's outlook and kind of maybe their impression of the
LNG side, just wondering if that -- if this goes into how you think about future LNG expansion FIDs going
forward? Or how you go about financing it? Any thoughts that you could share there?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

No. I would just say that I think we're really excited about the progress we've made at Cameron, right? So
as we bring the third train of Cameroon on in Q3 of this year, that is a really valuable asset to us. We're
going to be very, very disciplined. We talked about this at our Investor Day. Certainly, we've made a great
step forward with ECA. Now ECA is a smaller project of about 2.5 million tons per annum. But I'd also
note that the tolling structure at Cameron was fairly unique. And having now, for the first time, all 3 MOUs
in place is a positive signal for Cameron. So yes, Port Archer is slipping a little bit. But as we go into the
future, what you should expect us to do is look at all sources of capital. There's a tremendous amount of
low-cost private equity capital out there today, and we'll look to basically approach this business model as
an adjacency with a very disciplined approach.

And we've said before, we think that we'll either get a much significantly higher equity return than we do
on our utilities, or we will not proceed on a project. So by seeing us announce the contracts that you've
seen at ECA, that should be validating to you that we're seeing the opportunity to proceed in a disciplined
way that returns a lot of value to our shareholders.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

That's helpful. And then just a cleanup, if I could. With regards to the Mexican CapEx, I think you said
it could be delayed. And I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what type of
CapEx that is? And granted it's a smaller part of the portfolio, but any sensitivities to EPS this year or
next?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Look, obviously, Mexico is a little bit further behind the United States relative to the pandemic, and I think,
very similar to the path you saw us take at Sempra, where we want to make sure that we preserved our
liquidity and our balance sheet strength as we headed into this environment. I think they're doing the
same thing. They're making all the prudent moves you expect them to make at IEnova. Perhaps, Dennis,
you could comment on the steps they've taken to strengthen their balance sheet or liquidity, and how
you're thinking about the CapEx program for 2020.

Dennis Victor Arriola
Executive VP & Group President

Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And Jeremy, yes, from an IEnova standpoint, I think they're doing all the right things,
as Jeff said, .Number one was they strengthened their overall liquidity position and cash and available
credit lines close to $1 billion as of right now. They've been focused on operating expenses, those things
that don't need to be spent are not being spent. And from a CapEx perspective, what I'd tell you is that
the company -- the management team in Mexico has really been focused on getting done those projects
that are near completion. If you think about the storage terminals and some of the other projects that we
have that are nearly done, those are going to be completed.

In other cases, we're looking at other projects where we don't have all the full approvals or permits and
talking with our customers to see if it makes sense for both parties to potentially push off or delay CapEx.
So no major announcements to be made there today other than, I think, we're taking a very prudent look
at what's happening in Mexico. I think we continue to believe that the energy picture in Mexico, over the
long term, is a really positive one, and IEnova is better positioned than anyone to take advantage of that.
But I think the management team there has been very prudent about its resources.

Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Given the extensive cost-cutting review that Sempra has completed over the last few years, does
COVID-19 bring to light any additional opportunities across the business portfolio?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it's interesting that you ask that question. I think that we're all learning about flexible work schedules
and the value of working remotely. I mean the building that I'm in currently we've had almost practically
all of our corporate staff working from home. So one of the things we're doing in the leadership of our
Chief Human Resources Officer is part of the task force that Dennis heads up is, we're going to do an
enterprise-wide look at how we think about workspace relative to people that can work from home, even
in our utilities today, which have been deemed essential workers. We have a large workforce in the field.
We also have a lot -- several thousand people working from home as well. So you're absolutely right.
We've had 2 different cost initiatives over the last 2 years led by the parent company. And we will review,
as we transition folks back to work, what office space is needed and what type of changes we make to
flexible working. But this is probably something that almost every business will be reviewing as they try to
find ways to support their employees, improve productivity and perhaps find ways to take more costs out
of their business. But thank you for asking that question.

ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY COMPANY LLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And then one related to Texas. Thank you for the disclosure around the 90% pre-approved CapEx
spending through 2021 within Oncor. Is there any color you're able to share for 2022 and beyond in terms
of the CapEx that already has pre-approval with [ the city ]?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

We laid out at our Investor Day kind of the 5-year numbers for each of our businesses, at least around
the utilities. And their total number there is $11.9 billion. And what he was speaking to is obviously the
certainty he had in '20 and '21. And we haven't provided forward guidance relative to the certainty of the
2023 through 2024 numbers. But we feel very good about the capital program. And I think one thing that
would make you feel a little bit better, Ryan, is in the Investor Day presentation, Allen laid out another
roughly $1 billion of capital in addition to $11.9 billion and the provide that we made at Investor Day was,
don't think about that as incremental capital to the $11.9 billion. It really gave Allen and Jim Greer and
the team the opportunity that if one project slipped, they had plenty of other projects, whether it was
maintenance CapEx or otherwise, that they could slip in there. So I think it was our perspective that, that
incremental capital slide really was intended to give us confidence that there's an $11.9 billion capital
program there over 5 years.

Our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Most of my questions have been answered. Just wanted to have a quick follow-up on Texas. Not to beat
this horse to death, I guess, but I think the perception has been, historically, that you like Texas and you
wanted to get potentially bigger in Texas. Is that wrong? Or is it just the timing is not right, you've been
more cautious on that? Could you maybe comment on that a little bit?

Jeffrey Walker Martin
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I think if you went back to our 2017 numbers, roughly 70% -- or just over 70% of the earnings
composition of Sempra came from our California Utilities. And we think California is a very constructive
regulatory environment. We felt like, longer term, we were looking for opportunities to get more
regulatory diversity. We also think that Texas is a good role model having their retail market separate, and
they have a pure T&D model. So as we thought about our strategy, our desire to have more of a bond like
portfolio, where we were not exposed to as much downstream consumer risk, nor exposed to upstream
commodity or generation risk, the Texas marketplace very much reflects how we think about the best risk
reward for our stakeholders. So we certainly -- we like the marketplace. We like it even in today's climate.
I think as you heard Allen and the team talk about the certainty they have around their capital program
and their earnings forecast, it's really all the reasons why we want to be in that marketplace. And you saw
us add to that portfolio with InfraREIT, and we've announced the opening of a Houston office to support
our LNG growth. Even though Justin's team has delayed Port Arthur. Were Port Arthur to go forward, that
would be the largest civil works project in North America, right? So Texas really is a market of priority for
us. I think it achieves a lot -- it checks a lot of boxes we think about strategically.
