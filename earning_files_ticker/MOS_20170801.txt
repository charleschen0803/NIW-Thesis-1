Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you all
This morning I'll briefly review our segment performance and guidance, and I will address some other factors that influenced our results for the quarter
Starting with phosphates, shipment volumes and prices both came in near the top of our guidance ranges
Our phosphates gross margin rate at 8% was in the range of our updated guidance, taking into account the mechanical issue that occurred in March at our Faustina, Louisiana plant and the resulting impact on our cost of ammonia
The major turnaround at Faustina is completed
The final costs associated with the turnaround and ancillary startup issues are expected to have an immaterial impact on results for the third quarter and are included in our guidance
During the quarter, MAP product premiums compressed against global benchmarks
Additionally, the North American market traded at a steep discount to global prices due to a high level of imports at New Orleans
While the MicroEssentials sales price relationships to MAP remain consistent, the decline in MAP prices negatively impacted expected MicroEssentials margins in the period
We expect this margin compression for both MAP and MicroEssentials to be transitory in nature
Going forward, we expect to continue to generate higher margins on sales of MicroEssentials and to capture an additional margin when we sell through our own distribution channel in Brazil
I would like to point out a few other points of interest related to our phosphates business
First, the new ammonia vessel constructed for our use has been launched and is expected to begin regular trips across the Gulf of Mexico in the very near future
The vessel gives us logistics certainty and strategic flexibility, with deliveries of ammonia from CF Industries in Louisiana to a port near our operations in central Florida
Our ammonia contract with CF is now in effect and expected to increase our ammonia costs in the fourth quarter
While the contract is under water at today's spot ammonia and natural gas prices, the contract was intended to provide us with shared producer economics, and we continue to see this contract as accomplishing that goal
We have also increased our estimate of costs to repair the sinkhole at New Wales by $14 million because we determined that the void is larger than originally estimated
I want to note that the confining layer beneath the gyp stack has already been substantially sealed, and we are working to fill the remaining void to stabilize the existing plug
For the third quarter, we expect phosphate shipment volumes to be in the range of 2.2 million to 2.5 million tonnes, and we expect prices to be in the range of $310 to $330 per tonne
In order to meet robust global demand, our operating rate is expected to remain high, in the mid-80% range
We expect the segment's margin rate to be in the range of 7% to 9%, primarily as a result of the temporary compression in MAP and MicroEssentials margins, as previously noted
We are also narrowing the full-year volume guidance from 9.5 million to 10.25 million tonnes to 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes for the year
While we continue to expect that Chinese phosphate exports will be down this year compared with 2016, they remain a wildcard
Volumes are difficult to predict, but our estimate is that China will export around 9 million tonnes, down from 9.5 million tonnes last year and down from 11.6 million tonnes in 2015. Year to date, exports are up 26%, which we believe is driven by a combination of factors, including a poor domestic season, a jump in phosphate prices, and a desire to take what little cash margin is available before newly implemented export taxes and costs increase
Starting in 2018, we continue to expect that additional compliance costs related to the new environmental standards in China will put further pressure on Chinese phosphate exports
Moving on to the potash segment, sales volumes and prices were in the middle of our guidance ranges, while our margin rate was slightly higher than guidance as a result of our ongoing cost control efforts
Market dynamics continue to strengthen, and the recent settling of a Canpotex contract with Chinese customers provided additional stability
While the contract price was at the low end of our expectations, it is good to have resolution because it helps demand emerge in other parts of the world
In addition to driving costs out of our production operations, we are also reducing brine management costs as a result of investments we have made over the past several years
Our brine management processes are more efficient today, and we have been able to reduce spending as we look ahead to the K3 Esterhazy transition
We now expect full-year brine cost to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million, down from prior guidance of $160 million to $180 million
For the third quarter, we expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.9 million to 2.2 million tonnes
We expect average realized prices to dip slightly to a range of $165 to $180 per tonne, primarily as a result of a shift in product mix as we recognize higher volumes of sales of standard-grade tonnes shipped to China
We expect the segment's gross margin rate to be in the range of 15% to 18%, which reflects both the anticipated low 80% utilization rate and the stronger Canadian dollar
We expect to operate at lower rates in the fourth quarter after deferring some of the planned annual maintenance at our Esterhazy mine until October
For the full year, we are narrowing our Canadian resource tax guidance to $90 million to $110 million from $85 million to $135 million, and we are also narrowing our full-year potash volume guidance to 8.1 million to 8.6 million tonnes, from 8.0 million to 8.75 million tonnes
In the International Distribution segment, our volumes were within our guidance range, despite some deferred demand in Brazil
Our margins of $24 per tonne exceeded guidance as a result of a higher mix of our premium MicroEssentials products and price appreciation on inventories
For the third quarter, we expect international distribution volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, and we expect a margin to be in the low $20 per tonne range, assuming a Brazilian reais at current levels
Our full-year volume guidance is now 6.75 million to 7.25 million tonnes
In the corporate segment, I want to note that the loss we recorded in the second quarter is primarily due to higher profit in inventory eliminations, which is largely the result of our own manufactured products sold to our distribution business to build up inventory in Brazil ahead of an anticipated strong third quarter
Profits are recognized in the manufacturing segment and eliminated in the corporate segment
Once that inventory is sold to a third party, we will recognize the profit in the corporate segment, so this is purely a matter of timing
As this inventory is being sold in the third quarter, we expect almost all of the negative adjustment to unwind and benefit consolidated gross margins
This swing reflects the normal seasonality in our business, combined with the fact that we only recognize revenue and profits when our products are sold to third parties
Our tax guidance has also changed
We now expect our effective annual tax rate to be zero to slightly negative as a result of an increase in expected foreign earnings and a lower proportion of domestic earnings, as well as relatively constant depletion deductions
There is a high level of variability in our expected tax rate as a result of potential fluctuations in pre-tax earnings and mix of global income sources
Before I conclude, I would like to note that we recorded $12 million in equity earnings from our Ma'aden Wa'ad Al-Shamal joint venture during the quarter
The earnings came in earlier than expected and resulted from strong sales of ammonia during a seasonally high period for ammonia prices
In addition, the Wa'ad Al-Shamal project has produced its first test tonnes of finished phosphate product, and we expect production to begin in earnest later this month
The project is likely to produce approximately 0.5 million tonnes of product later this year, with potential modest upside depending on how the ramp-up of the mega-project occurs
To summarize, we remain focused on the things that we can control at Mosaic
We have driven major costs out of our system, and we are making prudent capital decisions so that we can succeed across the cycle and deliver shareholder value for the longer term
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks
Joc?
Sure, thanks, Joc, and good morning, Chris, nice to hear from you
A couple of things I would say on Vale Fertilizantes is first of all, strategically I think this is in the center of the play for Mosaic
It's a very important transaction for us
It gives us a very significant interest in the Americas, North and South America
It has lots of interconnectivity with our phosphate operations globally
And so we view this to be certainly a very strategic transaction that otherwise probably wouldn't have been available had we not taken advantage of the opportunity to enter into this agreement with Vale
The second thing I would say is, if you take a look at the historical financial performance of this business, it's been very volatile, up and down
There are years where it significantly outperforms, and there are years where it can underperform, and I think 2017 is one of those years
You referenced a financial metric which I'm not sure that I can verify concretely on the call here, but what I can say is there were a number of things that Vale needs to do before we close this transaction, which is likely expenditures of cash that they probably weren't otherwise planning for
And secondly, you have seen a near-record strengthening of the Brazilian reais, at least in the last two or three years
If you go back 12 months, the reais was at BRL 3.8 â€“ BRL 3.9, pushing BRL 4 to a dollar, and here we are today at BRL 3.1. And so that movement has got significant implication for the financial performance for Vale
And long term, if you take a look at what the prognostications are and what the fiscal condition is of Brazil, I think that I would take the bet that the reais likely is going to weaken, which should improve the financial performance for that business
And then finally on synergies, what I would say is this
We've communicated $95 million in operational and tax-related synergies on an annual basis
We have been hard at it planning the integration activities
We have got a list of synergy opportunities that go on for many, many pages, and we are going to be driving that synergy capture very aggressively once we close this transaction
And so I think that we've got a high degree of confidence that we're going to be able to not only deliver on what we communicated publicly but hopefully some good upside to that
I think it's a fair question
As Joc noted, we do have a split rating with S&P and Moody's
And so the fact that Moody's has put us under review for a potential one notch downgrade to what would match S&P is not particularly surprising, I guess point number one
We're in very close communications and have been for a long time
Several times a year we'll meet with all of the rating agencies and keep them posted on what's happening with our business
One of the pillars that we have communicated is our intent of maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating, and that still holds
And so I think you need to view this through the lens of a cyclical company
There are going to be times when you're stretched and you're outside of what your targeted leverage ratios are
So what we're focused on are the levers that we can control, our costs, our SG&A, our capital
And you heard earlier in our prepared remarks, we've revised downward a number of things
CRT is coming down
Our brine expenditures for the year is coming down
We've lowered our CapEx
Our tax rate is either flat to negative for the year
Our operating costs I think have demonstrated over the past couple of years that we have taken significant costs out of the system
We've restructured the company, and our SG&A is at levels that are very different than where they were at two or three years ago
And so there are number of levers that we have that we continue to look at and manage the performance of that will help us achieve the objectives that I just stated
Additionally, periodically there are opportunities to generate cash on miscellaneous asset sales
I think you saw or heard earlier that in the quarter we sold a basically unused parcel of land for in excess of $50 million
So things like that help
And then finally, in the end, it also ties into ultimately what our forecasts are, which we routinely are revising our forecasts and what our outlooks look like based on the global S&D, farmer economics, and ultimately how that also interconnects with our dividend policy
And so we have a number of levers to pull at Mosaic to maintain our investment-grade status
That's what we intend to do
And then the final thing that I would point out for you is the ample liquidity buffer that we have, $2.5 billion
I think we ended the quarter with nearly $700 million of cash on balance sheet and a $2 billion revolver
And so I hope that's responsive to your question
