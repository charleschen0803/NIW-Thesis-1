Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zions Bancorporation's Second Quarter 2021
Earnings Results Webcast. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Paul Abbott, Director of Investor Relations.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP and Director of Investor Relations & External Communications

Thank you very much, Christian. It's actually James Abbott, but thank you again. I appreciate it. Good
evening, everyone. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2021 second quarter earnings.

I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although
actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or
the slide deck on Slide 2, dealing with forward-looking information and the presentation of the non-GAAP
measures, which apply equally to the statements made during this call. A copy of the earnings release as
well as the slide deck we will use on this call are available at zionsbancorporation.com.

For our agenda today, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Harris Simmons, will provide opening
remarks; followed by comments from Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Paul
Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will conclude by providing additional detail on Zions' financial condition.
With us also today are Keith Maio, our Chief Risk Officer; and Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer.

We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]

With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you who've joined our call this evening. I'm going to
start on Slide 3. We are really pleased with the overall results for the quarter, particularly on the credit
quality front where we experienced net recoveries of previously charged-off loans. We saw loan activity,
excluding PPP loans, that was more encouraging, and we've become somewhat more optimistic about the
loan growth prospects for the future.

We accelerated the purchases of securities during the quarter, resulting in linked-quarter growth. That
portfolio on an amount was roughly double that of the prior quarter. We plan to continue that pace in the
near term. Deposit growth was strong with essentially all of the growth coming from noninterest-bearing
deposits. And despite the increase in securities purchases, our money market investments increased
relative to total assets. We continue to streamline the organization, allowing operational expense to
remain relatively flat.

Finally, we are very pleased with the advancement in our technology platform, having rolled out a new
consumer interface, both mobile and online banking, which has materially increased the functionality of
our consumer digital banking platform.

Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.08 per share from $1.90 in the prior quarter. More than $120
million of our allowance for credit loss was released due to improved confidence in the economic outlook.
The strong credit quality outperformance relative to expectations boosted returns -- or boosted earnings,
rather, and in turn, boosted our capital ratios. Those capital ratios are now particularly strong relative to
our risk profile.

Earnings were also bolstered by a substantial net unrealized gain on an SBIC investment that went public
during the quarter. We were encouraged with the relative stability of our non-PPP loans, which declined
only 0.1% from the prior quarter. Examining the 3 major loan categories, our non-PPP commercial loans

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

increased about 0.8%, which is roughly in line with the Federal Reserve's H8 data on commercial loans
when excluding PPP loans.

We continue to exercise cautions with commercial real estate loans and several other property types. As
such, that category only increased 0.4%. Our consumer portfolio equals about 20% of total loans and
is made up primarily of residential mortgages, which declined 3.1% from the prior quarter, although it's
notable that the rate of attrition in that portfolio slowed as the quarter progressed.

Period-end deposits increased 3% or $2.3 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for a remarkable
99.7% of that increase. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our deposits have increased more than
$16 billion, which is equivalent to the deposits held at our largest affiliate bank prior to the pandemic.
Appropriately managing that magnitude of influx in just 18 months has been one of our highest priorities,
which Paul will be addressing in his remarks.

Going to Slide 4. It reflects recent earnings per share results, along with some notable items on the
right that may be of interest. As previously noted, $0.25 per share in the current quarter is the after-
tax recognized net gain from an investment in a small business investment company fund. One of the
companies within the fund, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, underwent an IPO in April, which we described in
our first quarter 10-Q. Additionally, although not shown on the page, the per share value of the reserve
release was $0.56.

On Slide 5, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. The very strong results were attributable
to items that I previously described.

As previously noted, another significant highlight for the quarter was the credit quality of the loan
portfolio, as illustrated on Slide 6. We continue to see improvements in nonperforming loans and net
charge-offs when compared with the prior quarter. Although not shown, special mention loans declined
26% from the comparable quarter, and the classified loan balance declined 6%. Overall, we experienced
net loan recoveries of 2 basis points of non-PPP loans in the second quarter, declining from 7 basis points
of net loan charge-offs in the first quarter.

Shown in the chart on the bottom right, one can see the volatility of the provision contrasted with the
relative stability of net charge-offs.

Turning to Slide 7. Our capital levels increased significantly during the pandemic. Our Common Equity
Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 11.3% from 10% at the beginning of the pandemic. We suspended share
repurchases during the most uncertain period of the pandemic while maintaining our common stock cash
dividend.

We resumed buybacks in the first quarter, repurchasing $50 million of our stock. We increased the amount
of buybacks to $100 million in the second quarter. Although it's premature to announce anything today,
the company is well positioned to be more active in our capital management.

I'm now going to turn the time over to Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who's
going to update you on the PP Program and our technology initiatives. Scott?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Thank you, Harris, and good evening to everyone. Turning to Slide 8. As a precursor to discussing the
Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loans, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $290 million in
the second quarter. This is net of the effects of the previously noted IPO. You'll notice that the bar is split
into 2 portions. The bottom portion of the bar represents what we think of as generally recurring income,
while the top portion of the bar denotes the PPNR we've received from PPP loans.

Of course, we recognize that income from this source will decline. Nevertheless, our ability to outperform
by a factor of 3x the industry origination of PPP loans has resulted in significant benefits to our
communities as well as hundreds of thousands of individuals and families. Of course, our earnings from
the PPP program have bolstered profitability during the pandemic and produced capital that ultimately

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

benefits our shareholders. PPNR from the program has equaled $262 million so far, and there remains
$137 million in capitalized income that will be realized over time.

Turning to Slides 9 and 10, these highlight our oversized performance, noting that we ranked tenth overall
in origination volume of PPP loans when combining both years' results. Zions colleagues were energized to
rise to the challenge of making a difference in our communities during the pandemic.

Regarding forgiveness, we're well into the process with $6 billion of applications received and $5.3 billion
approved by the SBA. That leaves $4.5 billion of PPP loans on our balance sheet at quarter end. During
the second quarter, an additional $2.4 billion was forgiven by the SBA, a moderate increase over the prior
quarter's rate, leading to a moderate increase in the yield of the PPP loans.

Turning to Slide 10. Having noted the positive earnings impact a moment ago, this slide reflects the
longer-term lasting benefit. Specifically, as a result of the laser focus of our bankers calling efforts,
you see growing relationships with all 77,000 PPP recipients. These customers collectively have also
contributed significantly to our deposit growth during the pandemic. More specifically, of the Round 1
14,000 new-to-bank customers, over 50% now appear to be utilizing us for their operating accounts, a
percentage that is growing nicely each quarter.

Turning to Slide 11. For those of you who have followed us for a long time, and I believe at least a handful
of you on this call have followed us for more than 2 decades, you'll know that we are committed to
complementing our competitive advantage as a relationship-oriented bank by enabling our customers to
do business faster and more simply through technology. Many years ago, Zions pioneered remote deposit
capture, which literally required an active Congress to enable us to provide the service to customers.

Today, we continue to be encouraged with the progress made on the technology front. This year, we rolled
out our new online and mobile banking system to 650,000 consumers, which was very well received by
customers. And this implementation went quite well given the size of it.

By early 2022, we will do the same: roll out online and mobile capabilities, additional capabilities to
150,000 of our business customers. In 2023, we expect to complete the multiphase transition to our
modern core system.

As of February 2019, you'll recall that we completed the replacement of our 3 core loan systems and now
have virtually all of our loans on our modern core utilizing 1 data model. While we will continue to provide
more details on this competitive advantage, very simply, this means that unlike all other U.S. banks, we
will have a modern core operating system that greatly reduces the complexity of aging legacy industry
infrastructure.

Specifically, let me just highlight a few things that you really need to know. This core's architecture is real-
time, parameter-driven, API-enabled, cloud compatible, includes higher degrees of cyber resiliency and
will be far more agile as we create new products and capabilities in the future. It operates with 1 data
model, a key to being successful in the digital world. It is capable of 7-day processing. So when the U.S.
market adopts this international capability and standard, it will dramatically improve how we protect and
utilize customer attribute data. Additionally, it will unify the customer account opening process at our
branches and online as well as being far more user-friendly for our employees.

As you know, this core transformation journey has been the catalyst for simplification and modernization
throughout the company and sets us up to optimize our investment as we further automate the interface
between systems in the back and front office -- and back- and front-office processes.

I'll now turn the time over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail on our
financial condition. Paul?

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone. More than 3/4 of our revenue is net interest income, which
is significantly influenced by loan and deposit balances and growth. As such, I'll begin my comments on
Slide 12 with a review of those 2 categories.

While average loans were down in the second quarter by nearly 2% when compared to the first quarter,
we are starting to see slight improvement in our C&I, owner-occupied, home equity and our bank card
portfolios. Excluding PPP loans, average loans were down 1% from the prior quarter and down $2.4 billion
or approximately 5% from the prior year period. As Harris noted earlier, and it's worth repeating, period-
end loans, excluding PPP loans, were essentially flat from the first quarter.

Within the loan portfolio, average non-PPP commercial loans were down $172 million or less than 1%
from the prior quarter, while period-end commercial loans increased nearly 1%. Within the commercial
real estate category, construction and land development loans increased on a period-end basis by 5.4%
compared to the prior quarter and term CRE declined less than 1%. Overall, the total commercial real
estate portfolio grew 0.4% when compared to the prior quarter.

Average consumer loans declined $437 million or 4.1% from the prior quarter. Unlike last quarter when
consumer loans were down in each category, in the second quarter, we saw growth in 3 categories: home
equity, construction and other commercial real estate and bank card. We saw a 5.4% decline in residential
mortgages when compared to the prior quarter due to continued refinancing activity, although the attrition
rate slowed as the quarter progressed. And in the PPP loan portfolio, we continue to see paydowns and
process forgiveness totaling $2.4 billion in the quarter. The average balance of PPP loans decreased 3%
compared to the prior quarter.

One final note on loan growth. Relative to periods prior to the pandemic, revolving line of credit utilization
has declined several percentage points to about 34% from about 39%. Based upon the amount of
revolving loan commitments, that difference explains about $1.7 billion or nearly all of the decline in non-
PPP loan balances during the last 18 months. After several quarters of decline in utilization, we did see a
slight uptick in utilization in the second quarter relative to the first quarter.

Deposits have been the driver of the growth of the balance sheet over the past several quarters. On the
right side of this page, average deposits increased 4.5% from the prior quarter, while period-end deposits
increased 3%. Relative to the year ago period, average deposits increased 18%. Average noninterest-
bearing deposits increased 8% over the prior quarter and 26% compared to the prior year period. Our
average noninterest-bearing deposits are now 49% of average total deposits, and at period end, they had
reached 50%.

The yield on average total loans increased slightly from the prior quarter, which is attributable to the
4.56% yield on the PPP loan portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, the yield declined 2 basis points to 3.67% from
3.69% as we continue to see some pressure on pricing in most of our markets, attributable, we believe,
to the surplus liquidity in the marketplace. Deposit costs are low. Our cost of total deposits fell to 4 basis
points in the second quarter.

On Slide 13, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. The
size of the period-end securities portfolio increased by about $4 billion over the past year to $19 billion,
while money market investments increased $10 billion to $11.8 billion, which is now 14% of earning
assets. As Harris noted earlier, we accelerated the growth of the securities portfolio in the second quarter,
adding just under $1.2 billion on average to the available-for-sale portfolio.

We continue to exercise caution regarding duration extension risk by purchasing bonds with relatively
short final maturities and keeping an eye on the duration in an upward shock scenario. In fact, we
estimate that the duration of our available-for-sale securities book would extend by less than 1/2 a year in
a parallel 200-basis-point upward shock.

Slide 14 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left shows
the recent 5-quarter trend for both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has declined over the past
year, reflecting the rise in excess liquidity. Average deposit growth has exceeded average loan growth
by $13 billion over the past year. For the second quarter, this growth in excess liquidity is referenced in

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

the chart on the right, as the strong growth in deposits has impacted the composition of earning assets
through a larger concentration in lower-yielding money market and securities investments.

In the current quarter, the effect of a greater concentration of money market investments drove 7 basis
points of linked-quarter net interest margin compression, with the slightly dilutive effects from securities
being offset by a lower cost from interest-bearing deposits.

Slide 15 shows information about our interest rate sensitivity. Focusing on the upper left-hand quadrant,
our asset sensitivity has increased as noninterest-bearing demand deposit growth is funding an increase
in short-term investments. We are generally comfortable with the increase in rate sensitivity because we
still believe the risk to lower rates is limited. The duration of recent deposit growth remains uncertain,
and adding asset duration is less appealing relative to the interest rate risk profile. As we previously
mentioned, we are marginally adding duration by increasing the size of the investment securities in
interest rate swaps portfolio. The $2.7 billion of securities purchases for the quarter had an average yield
of 1.65%.

On Slide 16, customer-related fees increased 5% in the quarter to $139 million. Notably, activity-based
fees such as card fee and merchant services, did well. Card income increased 15% over the prior quarter
due to increased customer activity and spending. Additionally, capital markets activity was stronger,
principally from loan syndication fees, and wealth management fees maintained their strong pace when
compared to the prior year.

Noninterest expense shown on Slide 17 was down 2% to $428 million in the second quarter compared to
the prior quarter. Adjusted noninterest expense was down 5% or $21 million to $419 million. The decrease
in adjusted noninterest expense was primarily from lower seasonal employee compensation and benefits
expense and lower professional services associated with PPP loan forgiveness. Adjusted noninterest
expense also excludes the $9 million success fee accrual associated with the Recursion Pharmaceuticals'
IPO.

Slide 18 details our allowance for credit losses or ACL. In the upper left, we show the recent declining
trend in the ACL to $574 million at the end of the second quarter or 1.22% of non-PPP loans. The chart on
the lower right of this page shows that $103 million of the $122 million decline in the ACL was driven by
an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast.

Updated outlook can be found on Slide 19. As a reminder, this is our outlook for financial performance
in the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2021. The quarters in between are
subject to normal seasonality, and my comments are subject to our earlier reference to the forward-
looking statements on Slide 2. Due to the degree of uncertainty and the timing of customers submitting
requests and the SBA approving those requests, our outlook for loan growth excludes PPP loans.

On the commercial loan front, our bankers are expressing optimism, and we are just starting to see green
shoots of loan growth. However, loan payoff activity is also increasing as relatively strong valuations are
leading to increased business sale activity. We are not expecting a lot of growth in commercial real estate.
And consumer loans, again, dominated by mortgages, are likely to be slow to grow as long as the yield
curve remains flat and the 30-year conforming mortgages are more appealing and adjustable jumbo
mortgages.

Putting it all together, we are somewhat more optimistic about loan growth now than we were in April.
And as such, we are modestly increasing our outlook to slightly -- to moderately increasing from slightly
increasing.

We expect net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, to increase moderately over the next
year. We expect this to be the result of continued slight compression of loan and securities yields, which
will be more than offset by continued deployment of cash into term securities and a somewhat more
favorable outlook for growth in non-PPP loans.

We reiterate our outlook for customer-related fees at moderately increasing. We have started to see an
improvement in economic activity, translating to increases in card and small business-related fees as
well as loan syndication and other commercial lending-related fees. We expect that wealth management

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

revenue will continue its double-digit growth trend and mortgage banking revenue should remain
generally stable.

Adjusted noninterest expense improved from the prior quarter. And we expect that noninterest expense
will increase slightly by the second quarter of 2022 from the $419 million reported in the quarter just
ended. We remain disciplined on expense control. But as business activity and profitability increases,
expenses may increase. Reiterating my disclaimer from our April call, this outlook does not reflect a
significant change in inflation from what we've observed over the past several years, which we believe is
an emerging and increasingly important risk to our outlook.

Finally, regarding capital management, echoing Harris' comments, we have a very strong Common Equity
Tier 1 ratio now at 11.3%, particularly in the context of excellent credit performance and the results of our
internal stress testing. As we consider the balance between capital ratios and our risk profile, we believe
there is room for more active capital management in the near to medium term, along with the current
macroeconomic and credit trends continue to be favorable.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Christian, would you please open the line for questions?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I guess maybe just starting off in terms of the security investments. I know you said you obviously
stepped up security investments this quarter and you plan to continue at sort of this elevated pace going
forward. Now you obviously know you don't invest in the 10-year treasury. But with yields around 1.2%
on the treasury side, like can you just talk -- I worry that the securities that you're buying are also
kind of falling in yield. Can you just talk about like what you could -- I guess, I'm saying, what are the
investments that you're investing in today? Or where are they yielding today versus kind of what your
average purchase yield was on in 2Q?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Hey, Ken, I'll start on that. The -- you're right, I mean, obviously, there's been a big rally in the 10-year.
We've seen rates fall. We don't invest in the 10-year, as you said. Our duration is kind of in the 3- to 5-
year sort of bucket. And we put securities on there, and that's generally where we've been investing in
swaps as well.

I will say that we -- the ALCO, our Asset/Liability Management Committee, tries to be somewhat
thoughtful around timing. So it's not like we've got an automated program where we're buying x million
dollars per day or per week. And so in the face of dramatically falling yields, I think you'll see us kind of
slow down with the hopes that we'll be able to make that up later on in the quarter.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Okay. I think that helps a little bit. Maybe just as a related follow-up. Obviously, your guidance
on net interest income becoming sort of moderately increasing from here seems to be the most positive
change in your guidance. Is that driven by your, I guess, change in stance on investing in securities? Like
because you're -- is it going up because you're investing more in securities? Or is it going up because of, I
don't know, a change in things like your outlook for loan yields or something else?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. There's a lot -- again, I'll start on that. There's a lot mixed into that. As you know, the balance sheet
is a pretty complicated thing. But one of the things that we are observing, and I would say, particularly
versus a year ago, gaining confidence in is sort of the stickiness of the deposits that are showing up on our
balance sheet and all of the relationships that go along with those. Scott did a nice job of explaining how
the new depositors that are coming into the bank were really trying to integrate them and make them as
sticky as possible.

And as a result, it feels like this balance sheet growth is a little more permanent than I would have
speculated a year ago. And what all of that means is that, yes, we can be a little more confident in how
we're investing that cash. So that's part of it. But the other is, as I said, there are some green shoots to
loan growth, which is highly speculative, and a lot of things can change in the next year. But generally
speaking, the optimism in our footprint really feels like it's improving. And so there's an element of a little
bit of kind of core balance sheet growth in that outlook as well.

Operator

Your next question is from Dave Rochester from Compass Point.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Just on your NII guidance, was just curious how much of that moderate growth is going to be driven by
securities purchases versus loan growth. It sounds like you're starting to see some green shoots on the
loan growth side. If rates continue to sit here or fall further, you decide not to allocate cash to securities,
what's the risk to that NII guide is basically what I'm asking.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Dave, I'll start on that. You're right, it is maybe a little rate-dependent. And so as we say, there's a lot of
things that can change the outlook. But our -- we've got -- as I think I said in my prepared remarks, we
got over $10 billion in cash that's basically earning the overnight rate. And so we've got a lot of capacity to
continue to invest.

And as I said, we're keeping duration pretty short. And so the yield might not be fantastic, but it's more
than 10 or 15 basis points if we go out to 3 or 5 years. So we're trying to be really thoughtful about how
we do that. There is some rate risk attached to it, and there is risk of loan growth attached to it. What
we're trying to provide with this 4-quarter outlook is sort of our best estimate based on where we stand
and based on what we see of where we think things are going to be a year from now.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Appreciate that. Maybe just one quick follow-up on the capital side. You guys spoke to this already.
It seems like you've got all kinds of capacity to accelerate that buyback going into the back half of the
year. I'm just curious with peer capital ratios were targeted to actually decline over time, was wondering
where roughly you guys see your targeted CET1 ratio now. And how quickly do you think you're going to
get there? I know you'll cite some capital offer to support loan growth, but in terms of -- it just seems like
you got a lot there for buybacks. And just curious how quickly you could reduce that to your new target.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I'll start on that, and Harris will provide his perspective as well. We have been saying for some time
that we expect to have a sort of a slightly better than median capital position and a slightly lower than
median risk profile. And that continues to be our goal. And so as you point out, to the extent that the
economy reemerges and folks kind of get back to business and capital ratios adjust, I would expect to
adjust ours accordingly, although that's going to be -- the speed at which we do that is going to be subject
to the Board and other approval.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

I'd agree with that. And I -- one thing I would note is, I think that we've got quite a lot of room right now,
but I also think that as others continue to adjust targets downward, I don't expect that we're going to be
involved in a race to the bottom in terms of how low can we take these ratios.

Among other things, I look at what's happening in the world. Commercial real estate, I think, is not at the
moment. But I think as leases run off and this world kind of adjusts, I think that's an area we're all going
to be watching really carefully. I mean I think there's a whole lot of risk in the world despite the fact that
we're not seeing it emerging as losses today. So I mean I expect that we'll be -- we're going to want to be
a little bit conservative relative to the crowd. But there is, indeed, a fair amount of room there today, and
we're going to be working on that.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess just one first question on loan growth. You've heard from your peers as well around green shoots
on loan growth. Obviously, you guys had flat balances quarter-over-quarter. Just give us some color in
terms of what gives you optimism that this trend that you've seen recently is sustainable. And would
appreciate if you could put some numbers around what modest slight loan growth for the back half means.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

This is Scott McLean. I'm happy to take that. One of the things we said throughout the last couple of
quarters is when your portfolio is declining, you need to first reach a couple of flat quarters before you can
start to project increases. Even though a lot of our peers project increases in the second half of the year,
I think we're just pleased that here in the second quarter, we've seen a flattening. We're not experiencing
the same declines, and I think that gives us optimism that we can start to move from that with growth.

We're clearly seeing more greater -- greater activity in all of our client bases. One of the biggest things
that I think will drive loan growth will just be as our small- and medium-sized businesses rebuild their
working capital positions. They all collectively pulled back really hard on their investment in inventory
and certainly, receivables. And with the inflationary pressures, supply chain pressures, you're seeing
businesses lean heavily into rebuilding inventory again as their sales are increasing. And so this should
lead to some additional utilization -- increase in utilization, which we are at historic levels -- historically
low levels, as Paul noted.

The other thing I would comment on is that we are very actively positioning our owner-occupied financings
and HELOC financings throughout the late spring and the summer months and fall months here because
those 2 products are directly aimed at our primary client base, and we think with the right structure,
there's a lot of potential demand there.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

I just -- just to add a footnote to that. I mean what we're using is some reasonably aggressive
introductory kind of teaser rate pricing. And that should produce some growth in those couple of
portfolios, which are really important portfolios for us. So it may -- in the very short term, the volume
impact will be offset by some of the rate impact. But the rates we'll be getting are a lot better than the
rates we're getting on cash at the Fed, so.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And just as a follow-up to that, like the 2 things that we've heard from other banks, pressure in
loan growth with customer liquidity and supply chain constraints impact on inventories. Are either of those
easing? Like if you could give an update based on your customers where liquidity stands and are they
seeing some easing of supply chain constraints?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes. Our customer base just as it is for most banks and throughout the economy, they have a lot of
liquidity. It's reflected in the low utilization rates. But there is no softening in the concerns about supply
chain or concerns about inflation. Those concerns are real. They're certainly remaining steady, if not
building, in terms of the minds of business owners.

Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Nice to see the ongoing control of core expenses and I heard continuing to -- putting forward the systems
and heading towards Phase 3. As you deal with this current environment move past hopefully, the COVID
spend and then on to the last legs of FutureCore, are we any closer to kind of seeing that you're turning
over of expenses where you might start to net benefit? Or we still have a little bit more of the kind
of build-out going underneath the surface until we get to that point where we really start to see the
productivity enhancement?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes. It's Scott. I'll...

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Yes. Excellent.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes, happy to address that. We -- we'll see a slight increase this year on our expenses related to our
FutureCore project over last year, about $3 million or $4 million built into our forecast. And then next year,
we'll actually see some softening. But in 2023, when we go live with our deposit application, that's where
we'll see a little bit of a bump-up to be followed quickly on '24 by a pretty nice drop-off.

So all in all, expenses related to technology and FutureCore specifically should be very manageable in
2022. And the only reason there's an increase in '23 is that when you put a major system into production,
it pulls forward a lot of expenses in that year. And then there's about a 20% falloff in that related cost in
the following year. So there'll be a 1-year kind of increase in '23.

And then just the question is, how do we divert those now available technology dollars to other
technologies? I'm not sure we'll have to divert all of them to other technologies, but the demand for
technology spend will probably always continue to be very high. But we certainly will be passed the
elephant in the room, which is paying for a completely new core system, something the rest of the
industry in its entirety has in front of it.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes. Got it, Scott. And just one follow-up, Paul. You mentioned that there's an ebb and flow between your
rate sensitivity kind of moving higher because of the noninterest-bearing deposits, but then we have the
current burden of just the lower near-term rates. Has anything changed with regards to your hedging
strategy? And have you -- do you -- have you added any or terminated any to kind of bring forward some
of that? Or you just kind of let it play out according to schedule even amidst this volatility we're having
now?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Well, thanks for the question. The -- we haven't terminated anything yet. We have done that in the
past, as you know. We haven't done that. But given the recent rally, it's certainly something we'll be
paying attention to.

In terms of adding, as I noted, we added, I think, pretty significantly in the securities portfolio. We have
been growing that over the course of last year by several billion dollars. I think we're going to continue
to grow that. And then, we're also paying a lot of attention to swaps. We've put on $0.5 billion of notional
value of swaps in the last quarter. These are forward-starting swaps, and the yield curve has got to kind of
a level that we are a little more comfortable with. It's backed off away from that now. But we're certainly

paying attention to kind of both of those duration-adding products that is the investment portfolio in
swaps as we think about managing our interest rate sensitivity position, which, as you correctly pointed
out, is really being driven by some pretty great deposit growth and particularly demand deposit more
growth.

Your next question is from John Pancari from Evercore ISI.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just on the loan growth, I heard you in terms of noting some flattening that you saw on balances in
the second quarter. And I get your expectation for slightly to moderately increasing over the next 12
months. Just in terms of that inflection in terms of how should we think about loan growth resume, are
you implying that next quarter is when we should see some growth and you expect a steady strengthening
from that point? Or is it still something that's kind of back end-loaded on your next 12-month outlook?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

If I could start on that one, I -- John, as you know, we don't -- we try really hard to -- not to make
sort of quarter-by-quarter outlook, which is why we do our sort of 4 quarters out. And so I don't want
to get overly precise on timing. But as we said, we sort of saw a flattening of period-end balances this
quarter. That felt pretty good. We saw an uptick in utilization. That felt pretty good. So we need some
more affirming evidence, right? But I would stay focused on where we're going to be a year from now as
opposed to trying to speculate on what's going to happen in the third quarter.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then on the -- I guess, 2 quick things on the expense front, 2-part question.
One, just in terms of the completion of the core project in 2023, do you just have the timing in 2023 when
do you expect that to complete? If you can give us an update there. And then separately, because I know
this obviously dovetails into your expense expectations, can you give us your updated thoughts on your
long-term efficiency ratio level? I know you're running around the 59 range this quarter. Where do you see
the longer-term trend for the bank as you look out?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

This is Scott. Let me put a finer point on this core transformation expense thought. I was talking about it
kind of elliptically, and I'll put a finer point on it and then toss the ball to Paul or Harris, if they want to talk
a longer-term efficiency ratio. But what I basically said was that our expenses for FutureCore, our core
transformation project, basically, would be -- they're in the range of about $45 million in 2020, 2021, and
they'll be a little less than that in 2022. So around that number, in terms of P&L impact. And that number
will go up into the low 50s in 2023 when we bring the system online. And then in the following year, it will
drop by about $7 million, $8 million. So those are the kind of swings we're talking about. They're not big,
dramatic swings, but they do free up dollars once we get past 2023.

And in terms of the timing in 2023, it's not one big conversion as we bring all of our affiliates on to the
deposit system. It's multiple conversions, and it will take place throughout the year. But by the time we
get to the second half of '23, we should be clear saving.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

And then with respect to longer-term efficiency ratios, I'd say you got to tell me what the rate
environment looks like, right? Yes, 25 basis points of margin is worth a couple of hundred million dollars
a year to us. And that had just so changes the picture in terms of efficiency ratio that -- I think in the

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

current rate environment, M&A remains what we've seen over the last 3 months, 6 months, for a very long
period of time. I think it's going to be tough to be under -- we're probably kind of low 60s. I hope really
low 60s. But with some movement, I personally believe that this inflation is not just transitory. I mean
we're seeing it in -- and it also gets an efficiency ratio. I mean we're seeing it in terms of wage pressures.
So we're trying to fill up in positions. I mean it's a really competitive labor market right now.

And -- we're seeing -- I heard this morning an employee that got a call was hired without an interview
for about a 50% increase in pay, and stuff like that are starting to go on. I think that what we're going to
see personally is sustained -- a sustained period of inflation that's going to lead to higher rates, and it's
going to produce better margins, kind of produce other kinds of problems along with it. But I think that
it's, in my mind, unlikely that we're going to see this rate environment last for a very long time. But I -- if
it does, I think it's going to be tough. If it doesn't, I think we'll see ourselves back into the 50s. And in a
sort of a more normal rate environment, I think we'd be down probably in the mid- to low 50s. But it's just
so dependent on the rate environment. It's hard to say.

Your next question is from Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

I wanted to talk about credit quality, which is excellent, and it's probably some of the best in the peer
group. But as you look out next year, what is a new normal for net charge-offs through the cycle with all
the derisking that you guys have done?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Well, I'll take a stab at it. We've -- what we've tried to say is the last 2 or 3 years, our aspiration is to
be kind of in the best -- in the top or best quartile in the industry in terms of charge-offs. And I expect
that, that will be the case. I mean I -- it's hard to know exactly what that number is, although -- I mean,
because we've seen this -- like this before, where we've had -- we're down to kind of no charge-offs or net
recoveries. And you can't do that. I'm not sure you want to do that forever. But I would expect that we're
probably going to be in the 15-, 20-basis-point kind of range would be something that is sort of more
normal and probably kind of reflects what we've done with the balance sheet.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up to that. Just the allowance for credit losses dropped to
1.22% ex-PPP. And I look to the CECL day 1. I think it was about 1.08%. But just given more confidence
in the economic outlook and the changes to the credit risk profile, do you think that the allowance for
credit losses could go below that January 1 level?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Let's see. Paul, do you have any thoughts about that? It looks like you're...

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. This is Paul. I'll start with that. The -- under CECL, the allowance for credit losses is so heavily
dependent on the economic outlook that -- you've got the 2 main factors of the size and underlying risk in
the portfolio and then the economic outlook. And what we saw this quarter was another release that was
based largely on a very quickly improving economic outlook. And it is a kind of a complicated STU that we
have to build every quarter. So it would be very, very speculative, I think, to say that we could get a lot
lower or even go up from here just because we just don't know. There are so many assumptions that go
into it.

It's -- I know it's a really weak probably answer relative to what you're looking for. But the honest answer
is, is that from quarter-to-quarter, we don't know until we get there. And then we assess the risk at the
end of the quarter, and we fill the allowance sort of loan by loan from the bottom up.

Your next question is from Chris McGratty from KBW.

Christopher Edward McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I want to go back to a comment earlier in the call about the degree of confidence in the size of the balance
sheet versus a year ago. I wonder if you could elaborate that specific to the deposits. We've heard some of
your peers talk about some of the transitory deposits that may or may not burn down over time. But just
looking for a few comments to build on your comments before about the confidence of the balance sheet.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll start. The -- well, there are a couple of things there. One, I would say our deposit growth relative
to average deposit growth looks pretty good. That is to say it feels like our deposit growth is a little
stronger. Some of that's from new customers. Some of it's from existing customers. But we do a lot of
analytics. We were a part of the sort of the CCAR and LCR world for a while. And so all of those things that
we developed, we still utilize to run the business and run the bank.

And so part of that development on liquidity stress testing was really good insights into the operating
nature of our customer accounts. And what we're seeing is new customers are using their accounts in an
operating way, and existing customers are continuing and are building their use of their deposit accounts
in an operating way.

And what that means is that they just feel more sticky. So I would have guessed and did a year ago that
deposits that were generated through the PPP program because, as a reminder, all of those PPP fundings
had to occur on our balance sheet, right? We put them into a deposit account drawn on our bank. And I
expected that those funds would be largely spent in a relatively short amount of time.

But what we found is that our customers are far more resilient, frankly, than I gave them credit for. And
that's been a really great credit story as they've learned to balance out their cash flows in the way they
run their business. But it's also been a really good liquidity story because all of this money that I expected
to be utilized in the business ended up sort of staying on the balance sheet.

And as a result, over time, here we are a year later and deposits are much higher than they were when
I was originally kind of speculating on that. So it's a long way of saying that sort of over time and
experience and with some real analytics on -- looking at the sort of operating statistics that are underlying
the deposits, we are just gaining more confidence that those deposits are going to be around longer than
we originally thought.

Christopher Edward McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Maybe just one housekeeping on the tax rate. Is this a good tax rate going forward, Q2?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, that's highly speculative, I would say. Based on the current law, I think we're in pretty good shape,
but that could change, as you know.

So we're going to switch gears into the lightning round, as we call it. So we'll just go to 1 question from
each questioner at this point.

Operator

And your next question is from Gary Tenner from D.A. Davidson.

Gary Peter Tenner
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

I had a question just with regard to the energy portfolio, further decline this quarter, which I suppose isn't
really a surprise. But I'm curious how the increase in commodity prices is maybe starting to show itself,
if at all, among your E&P borrowers from an exploration perspective and whether the expectation would
be that cash flows are so strong at this point as they've delevered that they would actually draw down on
lines for that purpose or that they would fund it more out of cash flow.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes. Thank you for the question. This is Scott McLean again. Clearly, the strengthening in commodity
prices has helped the entire energy sector. And our balances, excluding PPP loans, are basically flat. We do
think we'll see some growth there. And -- but basically upstream companies, you see them going back into
the field. You see drilling increasing. And that -- most of that will be funded -- it will be funded partially by
cash flow but also utilization. So the sector is strengthening.

There still is not available capital, whether equity or debt, fundamentally. About half the banks that used
to be in the energy lending industry have exited. So it will basically be bank revolvers and cash flow that
they'll fund out of. But I think you'll -- we'll see over time increases in revolving balances for upstream
companies. Credit quality has obviously been improving as well. We're seeing that and should continue to
see that, so.

Operator

Your next question is from Brad Milsaps from Piper Sandler.

Bradley Jason Milsaps
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

You just addressed my question on energy. But maybe kind of looking at the portfolio more holistically, are
there other areas that you guys are emphasizing or deemphasizing more than others? Harris mentioned
some concern around CRE. Maybe some teaser rates around HELOC. You mentioned municipal finance in
the past. Are there other areas of the loan book that you guys are maybe more or less bullish on as we
kind of contemplate your loan growth guidance over the next 12 months?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

I guess one thing I talked a little bit about CRE, and I mean, I expect that probably continues to grow
but very, very modestly. The municipal portfolio, we're seeing a more competitive environment out there,
and that's probably slowed us down a little bit. And so we'll see what happens with that, but that's been
a growth driver, which I think will probably be growing at a slower pace. I think that owner-occupied
commercial real estate is likely to see some decent growth. It's something that we're really promoting, as
I mentioned before. And...

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

I might just add to that, that I -- we've seen multi-quarters where our 1- to 4-family mortgages on
balance sheet have declined. These are basically jump mortgages. And we're starting to see a mix change,
again, back to originating more held for investment. I don't know if that line will flatten this quarter or

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 19, 2021

next quarter, but if you look back over the last 5 or 6 years, 25% of our loan growth has come from 1 to
4 family. It's a great product for us. It's a great business. And I think you'll see -- we'll see growth there
again. It just may be another quarter or 2 before it flattens and starts to turn.

Bradley Jason Milsaps
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes. Yes. So those are -- I was going to say just fundamentally just commercial C&I more generally as
companies. I think as Scott aptly pointed out that there are a lot of opportunities for companies to be
building inventory and kind of getting back to something closer to normal. And I think that's going to
result in some loan demand.

Operator

Your next question is from David Long from Raymond James.

David Joseph Long
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

As it relates to C&I loan growth, you discussed several external factors that may help in seeing some
green shoots. But is there anything you can do internally to try to get loan growth to pick up? Is there an
opportunity for you to adjust your underwriting, be more aggressive on price? Anything that Zions itself
can do to try to help reaccelerate that C&I loan growth?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Well, yes, I mean, as mentioned, we're using some kind of reasonably aggressive introductory rates. What
we're trying to really take advantage of is the fact that we have a lot of very, very low-cost money. And
so we're trying to really build a book of business that will be more normally priced as we get out of a
year. But we'll start to build balances earlier than that and give us a real income pickup even at a lower
introductory rate than we're getting on cash.

So that's probably the main thing we're doing. We're not really relaxing underwriting. I don't -- we think
that, that needs to remain reasonably constant. But we are seeing opportunities to put some -- to try
more aggressively price in the near term.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

I would just add, too, that the secret sauce always is the amount of time your bankers spend out of their
office, calling on clients and our bankers are out -- they're out calling. They've been doing it virtually.
They're doing it more physically now. And at the end of the day, you can't really write about it much in an
analyst report. But that's fundamentally what drives loan growth.

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

This is Michael. I might add that we've reduced our -- kind of our temporary guidance around underwriting
from COVID at its peak to now something that looks more like pre-COVID underwriting. So we're back to
kind of a pre-COVID view of how to underwrite new risk.

Operator

Your next question is from Steve Moss from B. Riley.

Stephen M. Moss

willing to go on that ratio? With the buybacks potentially -- would the low to mid-7% range be acceptable
to you guys?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Sorry, the question was on the leverage ratio?

Stephen M. Moss
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Would you be willing to go down to like the low to mid-7% range?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I'm going to give an answer that's more complicated than your question. And the answer is
that it's a little bit dependent upon the nature of the risk of the assets that we're putting on. So for
example, right now, we've got a lot of PPP loans, which we see as having little to no credit risk and a
lot of, basically, overnight investments, which have little to no credit risk. And as a result, I think our
philosophy around capitalization is that we have to hold capital that's commensurate with the risk in the
balance sheet. That's true for the risk-adjusted ratios, and it's true for the leverage ratio. So long as
there's not a lot of incremental risk being added, I don't think -- organizationally, I don't think we're overly
concerned with the leverage ratio ticking down a little bit from here.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I don't think that's likely to become a binding constraint for us. We'll worry about other things before
we do that.

Your last question is from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'm curious, as it relates to COVID, is the Delta variant having any impact on confidence levels of your
commercial customers yet, right? Are they just starting to pay attention to this or not? And maybe for
Michael, as it relates to your reserve, is the potential impact from Delta embedded in the economic outlook
that you used this quarter to establish the reserve?

These are good questions. And likely...

Yes. I was just going to say it might be a little too early to understand the impact to our borrowing
community. But we did have a discussion about the Delta variant. We will probably have a discussion in Q3
about it. It would end up in the qualitative area of the ACL.

Yes. And I would just say, I'm not sure that it's -- we can yet discern any real concern on our customers'
part about the Delta variant. Its infection rates today are still about 10% or something if where they were
at the very peak. So it's -- I think with a big portion of the population vaccinated, as it starts to pick up,
I think it's going to create a real inducement for younger people to get vaccinated, I hope. And then our
hope has got to be that as we start to understand what you need to do in terms of boosters, et cetera,
that everybody is kind of playing ball. But I don't think it's showing any signs at the moment of slowing
down our commercial customers' confidence in the recovery.
