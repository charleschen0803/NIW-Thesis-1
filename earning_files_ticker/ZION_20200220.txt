Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Zions Bancorporation's First Quarter
2020 Earnings Results Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may
be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today,
Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott. Sir, please go ahead.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP of Investor Relations & External Communications

Good evening, and thank you, Latif. We welcome all of you to this conference call to discuss our 2020
first quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will
provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial performance; after which, Ed Schreiber, our Chief
Risk Officer, will review the condition of the loan portfolio, the allowance for credit losses and the way in
which we are engaging with our customers during this period of disruption. After Ed's comments, Paul
Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions' financial condition. Finally, Scott
McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer, will provide some brief detail regarding our SBA lending
activities, progress on our technology initiatives and other areas of progress. Additional executives with us
on the broadcast today include Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer.

Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking
statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in
the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to the
statements made during this call. A copy of the full earnings release as well as a supplemental slide deck
are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to these slides during this call.

The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to
non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue, the efficiency ratio and other terms which
are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-
GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these
disclosures and are used prominently throughout the materials. A full reconciliation of the difference
between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants
are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.

We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour during the question-and-answer session of the call after
our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Thanks very much, James, and we want to welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our first quarter
results. I would like to just start by making a brief comment about the extraordinary employees we have
in this organization. Throughout the course of the past month, as we've all been across the industry,
working from home, et cetera, we've had some employees, particularly over the last couple of weeks, with
this Paycheck Protection Program, who have been working nearly around the clock and delivering great
results. We'll talk about this a little later, but we've -- in this first round of $349 billion of funding, we were
able to receive approvals for $4.4 billion of these Paycheck Protection loans for our clients and for others.
And it's over 14,000 loans that we have approved, and we have more to go in what we anticipate will be
another round of funding.

And it's been a herculean effort. We've ranked ninth in the industry in terms of the volume of these
deals that we've delivered, and that's way outsized to our size in the industry, as you know. But I think it
reflects just a great team, and I want to publicly congratulate them for what they have accomplished and
what they yet will.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20,
2020

So with that, Slide 3 is a summary of several key highlights for the quarter. We've anticipated that the
usual items such as loan-to-deposit growth are of lesser concern to most of you today, while credit and
other issues related to the pandemic are of greater concern and interest, and we'll cover those in the next
few slides. We -- I mentioned that we have processed over 14,000 of these Paycheck Protection loans. I
expect that we'll roughly double that, and we have a lot of volume ready to go when the window opens
back up, which we hope will be later this week, assuming that Congress takes action. But it's been a very,
very busy quarter responding to customer needs.

Slide 4 shows a time series of the bottom line earnings per share results. We reported earnings per
share of $0.04. As noted in the first quarter of 2020, there are 3 items that stand out that significantly
and adversely affected the earnings per share, namely the large provision for credit losses, a mark-to-
market adjustment on the value of customer-related swaps and a mark-to-model investment on our SBIC
investment portfolio. Some of the prior quarters also had some notable items as noted on the slide and in
prior presentation materials.

Turning to Slide 5. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $299 million. This is adjusted primarily for the
unfavorable impact of the derivative valuation gain on client-related interest rate swaps of $11 million
and the SBIC securities portfolio loss of $6 million. You can see the outsized provision's relative effect on
profitability in the chart on the right, especially when compared with prior quarter provisions. Paul will be
addressing our provision and allowance in more detail later in his prepared remarks.

On Slide 6, we highlight our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, which is strong relative to regulatory
minimums and also healthy compared to our peers. When combined with the allowance for credit losses,
Zions ranks stronger than most peers. Of course, several of our peers have not yet released earnings, and
this may move around somewhat. Nevertheless, the point is that we have entered this economic downturn
with a robust capital position.

Advancing to Slide 7. Charge-offs remained low in the quarter, although we are expecting an increase in
subsequent quarters as a result of the effects of COVID-19. Any historical figures on problem loans and
losses are less relevant given the sudden and sharp downward shift in the economy due to the pandemic.
And it's worth noting that we headed into this downturn with relatively pristine credit ratios, both on an
absolute and a relative basis, a result of what we believe are really strong risk management practices.

Moving to Slide 8. We've presented this slide at various conferences over the years, but I felt it was
important at this time to reiterate the fact that Zions has generally experienced a much lower loss rate
relative to nonaccrual loans than most of our peers. Like most other banks, we underwrite loans based
upon stressed cash flow assumptions, but as is more common with small business lending, we most often
secure the loan with an alternative source of collateral, such as real estate or other business and personal
assets. We also ask for and often receive personal guarantees on many of our loans, and many borrowers
have external sources of capital that is available to support their investment during a period of difficulty,
particularly if the problem is considered to be transitory.

We saw a great deal of sponsor support, for example, during the 2015, '16 downturn in the oil and gas
industry as well as in the construction segment a decade ago. While each cycle is different, the secured
nature of our loan portfolio may once again reduce our loss content relative to some other lenders.

With that brief summary, I'll turn the time over to Ed Schreiber, our Chief Risk Officer, to provide some
additional detail about our credit portfolio. Ed?

Edward P. Schreiber
Executive VP & Chief Risk Officer

Thank you, Harris. I'll begin my prepared remarks on Slide 9. Shown on this slide is a selected list of
industries that in our estimation have elevated risk than most other categories. In total, these industries
account for $5.6 billion of total loan balances outstanding or approximately 11% of loans. Some of these
industries are intuitive, such as airlines, where card spend data of our customers shows a drop of more
than 95% in early April relative to early March.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20,
2020

Other categories have some mixed qualities, with restaurants being a good example. Again, using card
spending data and looking at early April relative to early March, we can see that fast food restaurants are
holding up much better than fine dining, although both segments are stressed. Not surprisingly, payment
deferral or loan modification requests have been somewhat elevated within these industries relative to
other portfolios, although as of the end of last week, more than 95% of the loans within these industries
are not currently deferring payment. Notably, line utilization increased only modestly within this group
relative to the level at December 31, '19.

Slide 10 is a brief overview of our loan deferral request and line utilization. The loan deferral request
information is as of mid-April. The line utilization data is through March 31, largely because we have seen
general stability since the end of March.

I will note some key takeaways here. First, on portfolio deferrals, only about 2% of the total portfolio
has requested and been approved for deferral or modification. The request for such action has slowed
significantly. With regard to line utilization rates, the overall increase in line utilization has been very
modest, up only about 2 percentage points. The ranking of industries that have drawn on their lines
both with the COVID-elevated risk grouping and the rest of the portfolio are shown on the slide, along
with some industries that may be surprising to see that have not, at least for now, increased their line
utilization to a material degree.

Advancing to Slide 11. In addition to our COVID-elevated risk list, we have an additional $2.6 billion of
oil and gas-related loans. The credit ratios look reasonably healthy, but as Harris noted earlier, historical
credit ratios are not indicative of our expectations given the significant supply and demand and shocks to
this industry. Notwithstanding, there are several risk mitigants to keep in mind, including the presence
of hedges on about 3/5 of the total 2020 production that is in the mid-$50 per barrel of oil and a high of
$2 MMcf for natural gas. The futures curve has the prices in the mid- to high 30s and a strong allowance
for credit losses approaching 6%. On the bottom of the slide, we've noticed key differences between the
downturn and the prior 2014 through '16 downturn.

Slide 12 continues with additional detail about the oil and gas portfolio. Notably, in the bottom-right chart,
you can see the remixing of the portfolio away from the services, which had a net loss rate of 9.4% during
the last cycle, and towards the midstream, downstream companies that had a much lower loss experience.
As indicated in the second bullet on the top left, if we were to apply the sub portfolio loss rate from the
prior cycle to the current portfolio mix, the loss would be about $90 million or roughly half the amount we
experienced. Our allowance today is $145 million, a reflection of the uncertainty during this time frame or
period.

Slide 13 speaks to some of the actions we are taking actively to manage and mitigate the risk within the
portfolio. We are approaching the process holistically, with a proactive effort to provide the needed and
temporary relief to customers while their cash flows are low and in some cases, negative. We are adjusting
our staffing and asking our bankers to work closely with their customers to help find a good solution.
The long hours our employees are working to help the customers base of more than 1 million is truly an
amazing thing to watch. We're requiring borrowers and sponsors each to contribute to the solution so that
we are not the only party making adjustments. And finally, we've tightened our underwriting at this time,
in part, so that we are able to focus on our existing customer needs.

That concludes my prepared remarks. Paul, I would like to turn the call over to you for commentary on
certain financial performance measures.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Ed, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 14 with a discussion of net interest income.
The chart on the left shows the trend in net interest income. While average earning assets increased by
2% when compared to the year ago quarter, the 27 basis point compression in net interest margin led to
a 5% decrease in net interest income. The year-over-year net interest margin change was driven by a 44
basis point lower yield on earning assets, partially offset by a 31 basis point decline in the cost of interest-
bearing liability. The resulting 13 basis point decline in rate spread was accompanied by a 14 basis point

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20,
2020

decline in the contribution of noninterest-bearing sources of funds due to the overall decline in the value of
money.

The waterfall chart on the right depicts the element that resulted in a linked-quarter 5 basis point
compression in the net interest margin. The lower interest rate environment was reflected in lower asset
yields and liability costs. A 13 basis point decline in earning asset yield was more than offset by the 16
basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing funds. The resulting 3 basis point improvement in the
rate spread was offset by an 8 basis point decline in the value of noninterest-bearing funds. The decline
in the cost of funds was largely attributable to the 13 basis point decline in the cost of interest-bearing
deposits and less reliance on wholesale borrowings.

By way of update for the second quarter of 2020, we expect the yield on earning assets to decline,
reflecting the reduction in interest rates observed in March. As a result, we are continuing to work to
reduce our cost of funds. For example, the current cost of interest-bearing deposits is about 32 basis
points. This is a 30 basis point reduction from the 62 basis point average reported in the first quarter. The
combination of these changes will likely result in further compression of the net interest margin over the
course of 2020 as the dramatically lower interest rate environment will result in a decline in earning asset
yield, which is expected to exceed the decline in our cost of funds.

The one caveat I would attach to this outlook is related to loans generated through the Paycheck
Protection Program. The fees generated through that program, which will flow into revenue through the
net interest income and the length of time those loans will remain outstanding, could introduce notable
volatility in the net interest margin as we consider the 1% yield on the loans and the fees attached to the
loan.

Slide 15 highlights the key components of net interest income, loan and deposit growth and breaks them
down by both rate and volume. The chart on the left shows average loans grew 3% over the year ago
period, and average loans in the first quarter were essentially flat to the prior quarter. As we have noted
previously, it is not unusual to observe a quarterly ebb and flow to balance sheet growth due to several
factors, including customer demand, the balance of loan growth and payoffs and seasonality. The first 2
months of the quarter saw very little loan growth, followed by draws on existing lines of credit in March, as
Ed has just discussed. Loans generated through the Paycheck Protection Program and the possibility of the
Main Street lending program are expected to positively impact average loan growth in the second quarter.

Shifting to the chart on the right and funding, average total deposits increased 6% over the prior year
period and 1% annualized growth rate when compared to the prior quarter. As I have noted in previous
quarters, we do not expect to maintain deposit growth rates in the high single digits.

Turning to Slide 16. Our interest rate sensitivity has increased relative to the prior quarter. This change is
primarily due to lower-assumed deposit betas as rates have fallen. Asset sensitivity was also impacted by
the cancellation of $1 billion of interest rate swaps. Those swaps effectively converted our fixed rate senior
notes to variable rate. We have essentially taken advantage of the very low and flat yield curve to fix the
cost of those senior notes at the current market rate. Our interest rate sensitivity continues to be driven
by a relatively large portfolio of noninterest-bearing deposits.

On Slide 17, customer-related fees were up 17% from the year ago period as the low interest rate
environment is contributing to improved sales of interest rate-sensitive products. Most notably, we have
seen strength in loan-related fees and income of more than 60% from the prior year primarily from
residential mortgage-related revenue, which is up more than 300% from the trailing 4-quarter average.
We also saw strength in capital markets product sales, which were up 19% from the prior year, and wealth
management and trust fees, which were up 14% from the prior period -- prior year period.

As shown on Slide 18, the decline in interest-bearing expense -- noninterest -- I'm sorry, the decline
in noninterest expense reflects our ongoing efforts to reduce expenses and streamline operations.
Noninterest expense was down $22 million or 5% to $408 million from $430 million in the year ago period.
The most notable reductions versus the prior year period were in salaries and employee benefits due, in
large part, to the reduction in positions announced in the fourth quarter of last year and lower expected

2020

incentive compensation payouts in 2020 versus 2019. As previously reported, we adopted the new Current
Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL, accounting standard on January 1.

Slide 19 highlights the components of growth in our allowance for credit losses this quarter, which has
gone from 1.08% of loans at January 1, to 1.56% of loans at March 31. The provision for credit losses of
$258 million, combined with $7 million in net charge-offs, grew our allowance for credit losses to $777
million. The 50% increase in the allowance for credit losses reflects a prolonged recession due to the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and includes prolonged stress in energy prices. When triangulating
on the appropriate allowance for credit losses in this very uncertain environment, we considered a wide
variety of economic scenarios and also incorporated our own stress test results.

Importantly, we use a 12-month reasonable and supportable period to construct our allowance and a 12-
month reversion period. We readily acknowledge that the great cessation of economic activity followed by
unprecedented government intervention, deferrals and modifications designed to help customers through
this difficult environment and substantial activity by the Federal Reserve to support liquidity has made life
of loan credit losses, and therefore the allowance for credit losses, difficult to establish.

In addition, we have also adopted the interim final rule which allows a transition adjustment related to
the change in the allowance for credit losses to be applied to the regulatory capital ratio calculation. The
impact on our common equity Tier 1 ratio in the first quarter of 2020 is an improvement of 8 basis points.
The complexity and nonstandard nature of the CECL accounting standard makes meaningful disclosures
regarding underlying assumptions difficult.

Given this, we are providing the information on Slide 20 to be a helpful framework when considering the
adequacy of our allowance for credit losses. This chart compared data in the left-hand set of columns,
which were the annualized net charge-off rates by major product type during the 2009 to 2010 great
recession, comparing those to the updated composition of a loan portfolio at March 31, 2020. Circled
in red are some of the major changes in loan portfolio components. If one were to assume that the
current economic downturn is equally severe to the 2009 to 2010 time frame in each of these component
categories, our loss rate would be lower by about 30%, which would have resulted in net charge-offs of
about $890 million.

This simplified analysis considers only changes in portfolio concentration and does not give any credit for
the changes we've made to upgrade our risk management, including the use of stress testing to identify
industries or borrowers that contribute disproportionately to credit losses in times of economic stress. We
are not claiming that the upcoming economic environment will be worse, the same or better than the last
recession. But we do believe this framework is helpful to understand the adequacy of our allowance for
credit losses.

On Slide 21, the impact on diluted share count of the 29 million warrants outstanding is shown. As a
reminder, these warrants expire on May 22, 2020. The warrants are a key determinant of the difference
between basic shares and diluted shares. This chart shows the dilution relative to the share price. At
the current stock price, in the high 20s, there is no dilutive effect on shares outstanding. By way of
comparison, in the first quarter of 2020, the warrants increased diluted shares by about 5.5 million shares.
Ultimately, the Zions common share price in the month of May will determine the permanent dilutive effect
from the ZIONW warrant.

Lastly, given the uncertainty in the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily
withdrawn our financial outlook. We look forward to reinstating the outlook as economic conditions,
including the impact of government intervention, becomes more clear.

I will now turn the call over to Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will report on
the status of a few key programs and initiatives.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Thank you, Paul, and good evening to everybody. I would like to highlight some of the successes we
have experienced in 2020. At the top of Slide 22, as Harris noted in his opening remarks, we highlight

gaining SBA approval of approximately $4.4 billion of SBA Paycheck Protection loans for more than 14,000
customers. Zions ranked ninth by dollar volume of all the participating financial institutions as cited by the
SBA late last week. Our volume represented about 1/3 to 1/2 of the unit and dollar volume of the top 3
banks. Consistent with our small business customer base, a median-sized loan was a bit below $80,000,
and about 20% of the loans were less than $25,000, with our smallest loan being $500.

Additionally, our share of the $350 billion SBA PPP program was approximately 3x our share of deposits
in the country. To put this volume in perspective, processing 14,000 small business loans in less than 30
days is a significant multiple of what we would normally process. To make this possible, we redirected the
efforts of over 2,000 colleagues, combined with the outstanding work of our automation and technology
teams, to respond to this unprecedented volume. Our colleagues welcomed this unique opportunity to help
our small business customers with this much needed liquidity.

We've also been putting in some serious overtime in mortgage. You can see the numbers on Slide 22.
I won't read them to you. But the production statistics there are quite meaningful. Certainly, much of
this is the result of the decline in interest rates, but another very important key to this volume is the
development of our digital customer-facing technology that takes the largest customer pain points out
of the application process as we have automated the IRS tax information requirements, employment
verification and bank statement retrieval. Our residential mortgage financing products continue to be
strategically important to our role as a community bank, serving small business customers and consumers
on a local basis.

Regarding the status of our technology initiatives, we continue to make progress on many fronts. Our
FutureCore Phase 3, the replacement of our deposit system, has experienced some delays related
to COVID-19, although we remain confident in the rollout of Phase 3 beginning in 2022. While we
continue to have a solid reputation with our business customers regarding their perception of our digital
customer-facing technologies, we anticipate the replacement of our online and mobile banking platform
for consumer customers later this year and small businesses in 2021. This system is a workhorse for our
company as it is utilized by about 60% of our consumers and 60% of our business customers.

Finally, the investments we have made in robotic process automation are continuing to have a meaningful
impact on improving the customer experience and creating operational efficiency. The institutional
knowledge we have developed on this topic in the last couple of years has proven to be especially helpful
as we have ramped up to handle the significant volume of loans associated with the SBA program.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take your questions. Latif, I'll throw it back to you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps of Piper Sandler.

Bradley Jason Milsaps
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Paul, I was curious. I appreciate the detail you gave around the spot rate on the deposit side or the
interest-bearing deposit. I think you said 32 basis points. I would be curious if you might also have the
spot rate on the other side of the balance sheet, the yield on earning assets, if you would be so kind to
disclose that.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as you know, as it relates to deposits, especially the nonspecific maturity deposits, we have the
ability to control those pretty readily. On the earning assets side, largely apart from the fixed rate pieces,
the variable rate stuff floats, as you know, largely with prime or LIBOR. And so given the different times of
the month that they change and things like that, I just -- I don't have that figure, nor do I think it would
be particularly meaningful today.

I think the key takeaway is that just by way of review, on February 29, the Fed Funds target rate was 150
to 175 basis points. And so it really wasn't that long ago and just within the last kind of 30 to 45 days
that we've seen interest rates fall so much. And so it's going to take a little bit of time for that to flow
through the earning asset yields, which is why I said I fully expect the earning asset yields to fall pretty
significantly in the second quarter, but I didn't quantify that.

Bradley Jason Milsaps
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. Understood. And just as my follow-up, I think you mentioned that -- Ed mentioned that
3/5 of the E&P book is hedged through the end of 2020. I would be curious if you had the number that's
hedged through the end of '21. And then to the extent that you are hedged, will you require those
customers to pay down principal? Or will you allow them to use the excess cash flow to potentially do
other things? I'm just kind of curious what your plans are around some of that excess income, maybe half
from the hedging they have in place?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Brad, this is Scott. I'll -- Scott McLean. I'll take that question. The hedging in '21 is, both for oil and gas,
is about at kind of the 30%, plus or minus, level, a little higher for gas, right about 30% for oil. And the
way that that borrowing base is redetermined, I mean it's very, very much dependent. Hedging has a lot
to do with it. And so we anticipate that our borrowing bases here in the spring redetermination, which
we're very early into, may decline in the 10% to 20% range. But that -- given the amount of discounting
that we do and the math behind calculating a borrowing base, it should be manageable. We will certainly
see some reserve-based credits experience stress, but we do anticipate this spring redetermination to be
pretty manageable.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. We'll go to the next question. It comes from Ken
Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.

I guess maybe starting, in terms of corporate line drawdowns, it looks like yours were a lot lower than
other banks. Can you just talk about sort of the characteristics of your borrowing -- your customer base?
Like are they -- why are they borrowing or drawing down their lines less than some of the larger banks?
I'm sure it has to do with the large versus smaller customers, but I'm just trying to understand the
dynamics.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Michael, do you want to?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Sure. I'll take that one, Harris. Thanks for the question. We have been in a high state of monitoring for
mostly defensive draws. And so the bigger drawdowns that we've seen, we understand them well. But the
profile of our wholesale clients is more operating utilization than it is. Obviously, CapEx is down, so there
isn't a lot of spending and borrowing on revolvers today with respect to our wholesale customers. Our
small business customers have drawn down quite a bit here and there. As you would expect, we have a
reasonable restaurant portfolio, dentists, other kind of critical industries, where they have completely shut
down. We've seen higher utilization.

But I think it's the fact that we aren't a huge wholesale lender. We have some private equity firms that
have asked their portfolio companies to draw down. But oil and gas is really one of the larger PE subsets
of our portfolio. And we have seen higher utilization there, but we don't have a lot of private equity,
where we're seeing the portfolio of companies do more of a defensive draw kind of a scenario. Hope that's
helpful.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. No, it is. It is. And then just maybe as a follow-up question. In terms of expenses, obviously,
you guys did a really good job keeping expenses low this quarter. Is this the level of expenses that is
sustainable on a go-forward basis? Or were there any adjustments that may kind of bounce back in 2Q or
the rest of the year?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Ken, the -- sorry. Ken, the -- we specifically withdrew guidance because the environment is making
sort of the trend lines in all of the key categories so difficult to predict. We're really proud of the first
quarter. But given everything that's happening over the course of the year, you've got a range of offsets.
For example, travel expense is down. But we've also got additional expenses, for example, related to the
Paycheck Protection Program that will be up. And so it's very difficult at this point to net all of those things
out as we think about the next several quarters.

Our next question comes from Dave Rochester of Compass Point.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

I appreciate all the detail on the COVID-exposed loans. Was just wondering if you could speak to the
reserve ratios perhaps on some of those portfolio segments as you did on the energy book. And then just
real quick on energy, I know you said you were early in that borrowing redetermination process, but you
still bumped up that reserve pretty materially. And I was just wondering if you finish those or as you finish
those, if you're expecting to see another pretty hefty bump-up or if you feel like you've already captured
that because of your CECL assumptions.

2020

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Maybe I'll take the energy question first. And naturally, the answer is we'll watch the spring
redetermination closely. But just as we did in early -- late 2014, the fourth quarter, and the first quarter
and the second quarter of '15, we've demonstrated a willingness to be very conservative about this
portfolio. And we think by increasing it the way we did, we've taken that into account. I would say,
though, just in general about energy, I mean these are unprecedented market conditions, that over the
short run are going to be driven by totally unseen-before shifts in demand. And so there's going to be
grading risk for the next 6 to 12 months in the energy portfolio. And then there will be a new normal for
supply and demand on a global basis, probably down, certainly down from where it's been at about 101
million barrels a day.

But I think it is, and despite what we saw today in prices, it is important to note the NYMEX still in the low
20s, ramping up into the 30s and 40s. And as you think about our portfolio, again, the most vulnerable
part before was our energy services portfolio, which is now less than 20% of the total, and term loans
there less -- well less than $200 million. So the most vulnerable part is really quite small now. The
reserve-based portfolio, which we talk about frequently and was asked about a bit ago, it's built to expand
and contract. Happy to talk about that more later if you have a question about it, but it is absolutely built
to expand and contract.

And the midstream portfolio, you'll read more about midstream being under stress, I believe, between
now and the end of the year, but they have some really big cash flow levers, both related to distributions
and the capital expenditures that they can pull and generally allows them to keep their debt service
coverage ratios in pretty good shape.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

And this is Paul -- oh, sorry. Go ahead.

Edward P. Schreiber
Executive VP & Chief Risk Officer

Go ahead, Paul.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

As it relates to the allowance for credit loss on the rest of the portfolio, we provided a little incremental
disclosure on the part of the portfolio that we think will be particularly adversely impacted by the COVID
pandemic. But as you can imagine, going back to the end of March, you will recall that economic forecasts
were changing very rapidly. And so there is a very large part of our allowance for credit losses that's
qualitative. Keep in mind, this is a 50%, 5-0, 50% increase in our allowance for credit losses. And so
outside of energy, we have not disclosed kind of the specific components and where they belong. But we
do believe and as evidenced by that incremental page that we showed comparing the composition of our
portfolio to the last economic downturn, we do believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate.

And so we haven't disclosed a lot beyond that. But I guess the point is, is that we considered a lot of
economic scenarios and we considered kind of different breakdowns and cross-sections of our portfolio to
come up with that allowance for credit loss of $777 million.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up. I know you said that you considered a lot of different
scenarios and whatnot. Maybe if you could just talk about a couple of the key drivers, I would imagine
unemployment and GDP growth or contraction. And then maybe just in terms of those 2 key factors, what
you guys factored into the CECL mark in the first quarter.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20,
2020

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

The reason that we provided that view of our portfolio composition was specifically because I don't think
it's super meaningful for us to get into the details around what our path for unemployment or GDP growth
might have been. What I can say is that, as many banks have, we've taken the stress test models that
we've developed and applied those to the CECL allowance. And in so doing, we looked very closely at
Moody's S3 and S4 economic scenarios, which I think everyone is sort of familiar with now, and overlaid
on top of that kind of multiple model runs related to the COVID pandemic scenarios that were coming out
about once a week at the time.

So those are the economic forecasts and the model that we used to develop the ACL. And then I would
also ask you to remember, as I said in my prepared remarks, our reasonable supportable period is 12
months and our reversion period is 12 months. And so you've got kind of effectively an 18-month forecast
before our allowance process reverts to the average long-term losses. Hopefully, that's helpful.

Operator

Our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So for Paul, I know you just said you reiterated again that you just view the reserve as adequate. And I
just want to get a little bit more into the through-cycle loss assumption that you baked in and arriving
at it. I know your latest company-run stress scenario that you performed resulted in about a $2.5 billion
through-cycle loss content. I think that was for your 2018 company run. And that's about 5.8%. But your
reserve now is around $730 million or 1.6%. So could you talk to me about, at that level, about 30% of
that level, how you view that right now as being the fair amount given that context?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, John, I think we'll have to compare notes on the $2.3 billion or the number that you quoted. That
wasn't my recollection of the published stress test results for the bank's stress test last year, which, by my
recollection, were about $1.1 billion. So I'm going to have to go back and check the number that you're
referring to because that isn't at the top of my head.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Yes. No problem. So I guess in terms of the adequacy of the reserve at the $730 million level, you
mentioned you factored in the Moody's data. That does reflect the latest version of the Moody's data that
came out towards the end of the quarter as well?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

What we did was we used the Moody's scenarios from earlier in the quarter and then overlaid those
scenarios with results that came out of the subsequent scenarios. So in other words, we didn't use
one scenario and say, "This is what we're basing our allowance on." We used a series of scenarios and
compared those results to try to again triangulate on a number that we thought made sense for the
portfolio.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. All right. Got it. And then lastly, from a capital perspective, I just want to get the, and sorry if I
missed it earlier, thoughts around the dividend here given I know there's some questions around that.

Chairman & CEO

Yes. Maybe -- this is Harris. I can maybe speak to that. I think we expect that given what we know now,
we think the dividend is pure. We come into this with a very healthy capital position and as we've said,
a highly collateralized portfolio. And so -- and we also think that the -- all the government stimulus, the
Paycheck Protection Program is going to help a lot of the small businesses that are important to us. And
so it's obviously quarter-to-quarter or something that the Board is going to be looking at. We will not be
expecting to be repurchasing any shares in this kind of environment, but we believe that the dividend at
its current level is sustainable at the present time.

Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.

Jennifer Haskew Demba
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Harris, a question for you. Harris, what do you think about the reopening of your Zions' footprint relative
to the rest of the U.S. based on the statistics of cases and deaths so far? And what do you think the long-
term implications of the shutdown are going to be on the bank?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Well, it's a great question. It's the big question. I think it's -- as a general statement, that I think is
probably true, is that for the most part, the west has fared probably a little better than the east has. I
mean the state of Utah, which is still a really important -- the largest single piece of our business, as
markets go, has come through this and in quite a lot better shape so far. And so in terms of the death
rate, the -- just the number of cases, et cetera, I think Utah has been kind of the head of the pack, and I
think that positions the state reasonably well.

But I -- well, and the same is true in a variety of other markets in Arizona. Colorado has been hit a little
harder and certainly up in the -- on the West Coast, they started off reasonably heavy, but they seemingly
have dealt with this in probably a more effective way than we've seen, say, in New York. I'm hopeful that
that will offer some opportunity to maybe get a little ahead of the game. But I clearly also think -- what
I know is what we all know and it's what's coming from the people we're all watching as we are here at
home all day with TVs in the background, it's going to be a function of testing and contact tracing and
probably still quite a lot of the social distancing that's going to be part of the background of how we all
operate in some way or another for the next perhaps few quarters. And I tend to believe that until we
have a vaccine, nothing will get quite back to normal. Although clearly, I think we'll probably learn as a
society to deal with this in a way that allows more normalcy but not quite what we all have been used
to until we see a vaccine and people, and particularly older populations, comfortable in getting out and
about. So your guess may be as good as mine, but that's kind of how I would read it.

Jennifer Haskew Demba
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Do you think that the banking industry will end up having more employees working from home on a
permanent basis?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think that it's probably going to train us all to be more flexible in how we think about this. But
I was on this -- I was in a little video conference with one of our employees a couple of hours ago,
and he was asking me, "When are we going to get back to work?" He said, "I miss being in the office
with everybody." I think that it will probably teach us all some new skills in terms of being able to work
remotely. But I do think there's a lot that you gain from being face-to-face with people and meetings and
the hallways, et cetera. So -- and I don't think we're going to turn into a hermit economy here, all of us
working from home. But it will certainly change our ability to do so if not our determination to do so.

Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question's for Ed. I wanted to follow up on the distressed sectors that you're calling on, on Slide 9.
And specific, Ed, to your exposures, what do you see as the most vulnerable portfolios that you're calling
out? Maybe can you comment on where you see collateral protection being the strongest?

Edward P. Schreiber
Executive VP & Chief Risk Officer

Well, with that, thanks for the question. And without going into great detail on that, and we could do that
as an additional discussion, but that aside, I mean most of the industries that you've seen in the press,
whether that's airline industry, hotels, et cetera, are the ones that you would think of come to mind,
anything to do with travel and tourism, et cetera. So our exposures, and we've talked about that before,
and Michael, I'll probably have you add any additional comments in here, but the restaurants seem to be
hit pretty hard and our exposures to that. We divided those up between full-service restaurants and fast
food, if you will, restaurants, and those are all reasonably managed without going into great detail on the
exacts. But we've identified, as you can tell on 9, some very key ones that are there. And at this point,
we're not seeing anything out of the normal, but I do believe, and most people would that, right now,
you're seeing stress, but it won't be until a couple more months before you actually see some things really
fall out or come to fruition.

Michael, you want to add any additional comments?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Well, I would add commercial real estate in the retail sector is getting hit pretty hard with renegotiated
leases by small tenants, and even some of the credit national tenants now are retrading or trying to
retrade lease agreements. So CRE retail yet to come. But as far as commercial real estate investment
property, that's #2 behind hospitality and hotels, but it is a secured asset class.

Dental is getting hit hard as are physicians who are the ones that provide elective surgery and elective
operations. Hopefully, that gets stood up. So medical office buildings are starting to see a little stress.
But those would be the primary. Consumers, obviously as unemployment goes up, we expect our deferral
activity to increase. We expect default rates to increase, secured and unsecured. But it's just a matter of
the shape of the recovery to see those rightsized. As Harris said, the secured portfolio across the company
and every industry should give us additional protection, albeit at discounted loan to values for the time
being. And nobody really expects net operating income in investor CRE to come back quickly, especially
the hospitality sector in convention and leisure and business.

So there are a lot of different speculations around recovery for all the various industries that are on our
watch list. Who comes out first? When do they get back to close to historical EBITDA and NOI? Those will
be the real challenges, really trying to predict specific recoveries by industry.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's very helpful. And maybe as a follow-up for Paul. What's the funding strategy for the PPP loans
because the balance is fairly substantial? And then how do you think about a net yield, including the fees
you'll receive, and then obviously, you need to fund these?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20,
2020

Yes. Thanks for the question. As it relates to funding, we -- our deposits have continued to grow nicely.
We don't anticipate funding stress due to PPP. The Federal Reserve has set up the PPP liquidity facility
or lending facility, which we could use and we may test, but probably won't use as a matter of course
because we have enough on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity to be able to support continued
growth in that PPP program.

As we think about the yield, as you know, all the loans are set at 1%. And then the fees are basically
capitalized against the loan and taken into net interest income over the life of the loan, which is 2 years.
To the extent the guarantee is realized on those or they prepay, then that capitalized fee would be taken
into revenue. So when you think about the all-in sort of yield, if you will, attached to the loan, it's going to
be heavily dependent on, a, the size of the loan because as you know, it's a sort of a metered fee program
starting at 5% and declining to 1%, but also the length of the loan, the amount of time that the loans
outstanding will determine the speed with which that fee rolls into revenue and therefore would impact the
yield. So there's so many variables to it. I wouldn't want to venture a guess as to what the ultimate yield
will be. But I think hopefully I've provided at least a little insider flavor into the key components of what
will drive the yield.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP of Investor Relations & External Communications

This is James. We are close to the end of our time. So we're going to go, what we call, the lightning

Operator

Our next question comes from David Long of Raymond James.

David Joseph Long
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So just as a follow-up to Steve's question, can you share with us the level of fees that you will generate
through this initial $4.4 billion or maybe the initial percentage of fees based on that $4.4 billion of loans?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I can -- this is Harris Simmons. I'll tackle that. The initial phase of this is about $118 million. But
there's also as has been noted, I mean there's going to be some cost attendant to that and including some
overtime and some bonuses that we're going to pay for people who are working 7 days a week, 18 hours a
day kind of schedule. So there are going to be some costs there.

And we have not determined the amount yet, but I expect that we're going to take a piece of this and
turn it back toward the community through a donation to our charitable foundation. So I mean we have
another round of this to go. And we don't know quite how that's going to play out. But I expect that the
$118 million becomes a larger number, and we do expect we'll take a piece of that. But I sort of expect it
will be between 10% and 15% of it and turn it into a charitable contribution. So I just do that heads up for
you.

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Scott, this one's for you. You talked earlier about the redetermination process. The dropping of the

that goes through the redetermination. Midstream and energy services that don't have those kind of --
those portfolios do not have that kind of calculation. And one of the reasons, again, why it doesn't drop
as much as you might think is because of the hedging, certainly has a meaningful impact on it. There are

Erika Najarian

Just one last question for me. I just wanted to confirm that the data that you presented on Slide 20, when
you're applying the global financial crisis loss rate to your current portfolio, that 1.8% is over 9 quarters,
so it's a cumulative loss?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

That was a cumulative loss rate, right.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP of Investor Relations & External Communications

That 1.8% -- actually, I was going to say, the 1.8% is an annualized loss rate, just to be clear. So in the
global financial crisis, it was the 2.5% on the left-hand side is you would have to more than double that to
get to the -- our worst 9 quarters. And then you would do the same thing with the 1.8%. But because of
the way...

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

It was a loss rate over that 9 quarters, so divided by 9 and multiplied by 4, I think, is what you're saying,
James?
