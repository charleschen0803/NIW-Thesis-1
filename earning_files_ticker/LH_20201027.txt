Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the LabCorp Third Quarter 2020
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being
recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Clarissa Willett, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Clarissa Willett
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. As
detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and
Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of
our website we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional
information on our business and operations, which includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial
measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.

Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements with respect to expectations for 2020 and the related assumptions,
including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's businesses, operating results,
cash flows and/or financial conditions; our responses to and the expected future impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business more generally as well as on general economic, business and market conditions.

Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change based
upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. Some
of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to
provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.

Now I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered strong
results in the third quarter as our base business continued to recover and significant progress was
achieved to fight the global pandemic. Clinical trial activity is improving, and we've had important wins in
both COVID and non-COVID-related clinical trials.

The Diagnostics business has recovered well as people resume their routine preventive visits, actively care
for their chronic conditions and move ahead with elective surgeries and other procedures. Non-COVID-
related volume was down approximately 9% for the quarter. As a result, we reported growth in the third
quarter versus the prior year with revenue of $3.9 billion, adjusted EPS of $8.41 and free cash flow of
$709 million. Throughout the year, our COVID-19 testing has helped to offset the pressure experienced
in our base business. This is the first quarter where both the Diagnostics and Drug Development total
businesses grew versus prior year.

Based on the current and expected strength of our business, we have decided to return the CARES Act
Provider Relief Funds. We greatly appreciate the support that CARES Act funding afforded us in the early
days of the pandemic when our base business was significantly impacted and the future was uncertain. We
are pleased we can take this action now. Glenn will expand on this in a few moments.

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27,
2020

Importantly, our strategy extends beyond COVID-19. What LabCorp did prior to the pandemic and
what we will do after the pandemic remains important to the country and to the world. Our strategy
is based on the following long-term priorities: first, leveraging the power of our combined capabilities
across Diagnostics and Drug Development; second, advancing our leadership position in oncology;
third, integrating AI, data, digitalization and analytics across our business; fourth, putting customers
at the center of all that we do; and finally, we will continue to evaluate and execute on high growth
opportunities.

I'll now move to the third quarter. We made significant progress in the fight against COVID, which
highlights our Diagnostic and Drug Development capabilities. To date, we performed approximately 22
million COVID-19 tests, which represents about 19 million PCR tests and over 3 million antibody tests. We
are performing COVID testing in more than 20 laboratories across the United States, and our capacity is
greater than 210,000 PCR tests and over 300,000 antibody tests per day.

We also continue to increase our capacity. Thus far this month, we're performing approximately 120,000
COVID PCR tests per day with an average time to result of about 1 day. During the quarter, we also
launched a series of innovations. We were the first laboratory to offer physicians the ability to order a
combined test for respiratory infections, including COVID-19, RSV and flu. The combined test will help
quickly and accurately determine appropriate treatment during flu season.

We also filed an Emergency Use Authorization to make the combined test available to individuals through
our at-home collection kits, Pixel by LabCorp and LabCorp At Home. In July, we received an EUA to utilize
a matrix pools testing method, which test multiple patient samples at once and requires fewer supplies.
We also recently received an EUA for a new heat extraction technology that improves the speed and the
efficiency of our PCR testing and reduces the reliance on certain reagents. We will continue to work on
innovations to help respond to the pandemic and to grow our core business.

Moving now to Drug Development. We continue to see strong momentum in our Drug Development
business. The backlog grew to nearly $12.5 billion, and our trailing 12 months book-to-bill was 1.31.
For the second consecutive quarter, we won a disproportionate share of COVID vaccine and therapeutic
studies. To date, we have won approximately 350 opportunities from small programs in the nonclinical
business through late-stage clinical trials. These opportunities represented roughly 13% of our net orders
in each of the past 2 quarters. The capabilities, the insights and the data from our Diagnostic business
have been a differentiating factor in winning many of these studies, which once again demonstrates the
power of our combined businesses.

Now let's turn to several important highlights outside of COVID-19 for the quarter. In oncology, we
accelerated our leadership position with several advancements, including a significant award to be the
partner of choice for late-stage oncology studies from a major pharmaceutical company; the launch of
Resolution ctDx Lung, a new noninvasive liquid biopsy test, for patients with non-small cell lung cancer;
and the collaboration with Tempus to accelerate clinical trial patient participation. Our leadership in
companion diagnostics, combined with our successful track record in executing clinical trials, are helping to
develop future breakthroughs in cancer therapies, including precision medicine treatments.

During the quarter, we also made several other announcements to advance our strategy, including the
extension of an agreement with BML to further the development of companion diagnostics in Japan, and
an agreement with GENFIT to commercialize a noninvasive blood-based diagnostic test for NASH. We
acquired [ Paramount ] Health Outreach Laboratory business and have several new laboratory service
collaborations to broaden our hospital system footprint, such as Infirmary Health, Rush University System
for Health and the University of Miami Health System. We also renewed our long-standing relationship with
Swedish.

Strategic acquisitions were made during the quarter to increase decentralized clinical trial capabilities,
including the acquisition of GlobalCare Clinical Trials and in early October, snapIoT. In closing, we delivered
strong results amid continuing uncertain times. We're encouraged that people are returning to the
routine care and that drug development trials continue to ramp-up in the fourth quarter. It is anticipated
that there will be continued outbreaks as we move into the fall and flu season, and we are preparing
accordingly.

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27,
2020

Finally, before I turn the call over to Glenn, I want to thank all of our employees around the world. Our
70,000 colleagues across every part of our business have worked tirelessly to serve our customers and our
patients at a time when the world has needed us most. I cannot thank them enough for their sustained
commitment and passion, and I'm inspired by the countless stories of their great work. I'm confident that
we have the right team in place and are executing against the right strategy to continue LabCorp's strong
performance on its course of a global health care leader.

Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by
a discussion of our performance in each segment and end with some comments on our outlook.

For third quarter results, we have quantified the revenue associated with the COVID-19 PCR and antibody
tests, so that you can see the change in the base business. Also during the quarter, we received $76
million in CARES Act Provider Relief Funding, which is excluded from earnings but included in cash flow. As
Adam mentioned, we decided to return the funds in the fourth quarter, as well as the $56 million of funds
we received in the second quarter. As a result, we have reversed the $56 million CARES Act funds from
our earnings in the third quarter.

Now I'll review our third quarter performance. Revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion, an increase of
33% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 31.5%, acquisitions of 1% and favorable foreign
currency translation of 50 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID-19 testing
of 32.6%, partially offset by a reduction in our organic base business of 1.1%, which includes the negative
impact from PAMA of 0.7%.

Operating income for the quarter was $1 billion or 26.9% of revenue compared to $340 million or 11.6%
last year. During the quarter, we had $47 million of restructuring charges, impairments and special
items, primarily related to LaunchPad initiatives, acquisition integration, COVID-19-related costs and an
impairment to intangible assets from an acquisition. Adjusted operating income, which excludes these
items and amortization of $62 million, was $1.2 billion or 29.7% of revenue compared to $431 million or
14.7% last year.

The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID-19 testing and
LaunchPad savings, partially offset by PAMA, higher personnel costs and the funding of the LabCorp
charitable foundation. The tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared to 23.1% last year. The adjusted
tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 25.7% compared to 23.9%
last year. The higher adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings.

Net earnings for the quarter were $703 million or $7.17 per diluted share and includes the reversal of
the CARES Act funds we received in the second quarter, which reduced third quarter net earnings by
$41 million and diluted EPS by $0.42 per share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring
charges and special items, were $8.41 in the quarter, up from $2.90 last year. Operating cash flow was
$786 million in the quarter compared to $456 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was
due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by higher working capital to support revenue growth.

Capital expenditures totaled $77 million in the quarter or 2% of revenue, and included investments to
increase our COVID-19 testing capacity. This compares to $93 million or 3.2% of revenue in the same
period last year. As a result, free cash flow was $709 million in the quarter compared to $363 million last
year.

During the quarter, we invested $204 million in acquisitions and paid down $412 million of debt. At quarter
end, our cash balance was $667 million, up from $557 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt
at quarter end was $5.8 billion, and our leverage was 2.2x gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA. Given
the company's improved financial performance, we are reinstating our share repurchase program.

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27,
2020

Now I'll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter
was $2.7 billion, an increase of 53.7% compared to last year due to organic growth of 52.3% and
acquisitions of 1.4%. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID-19 testing of 54.2%, which
was partially offset by the decline in the base business of 1.9%, which includes the negative impact from
PAMA of 1.1%.

The 53.7% revenue growth in the quarter was due to a 21.8% increase in volume and a 31.9% increase
in price/mix. The total volume increase of 21.8% over last year was due to organic volume growth of
20% and acquisitions contributing 1.8%. The increase in organic volume was due to the COVID-19 testing
volumes of 28.8%, partially offset by an 8.9% decline in our base business volumes. As a reminder, we do
not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately
1.7% to our organic base business volume growth.

The price/mix increase of 31.9% was primarily driven by COVID-19 testing of 25.4% and favorable mix
in the organic base business of 7%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 1.1%. LabCorp
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1 billion or 37.1% of revenue compared to
$296 million or 16.8% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due
to COVID-19 testing and LaunchPad savings partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA of $20
million. Diagnostics LaunchPad initiative remains on track with our 3-year target to deliver $200 million of
net savings by the end of 2021.

Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion,
an increase of 5.7% compared to last year due to organic growth of 3.8%, acquisitions of 0.5% and
favorable foreign currency translation of 140 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by
COVID-19 testing. Excluding COVID-19 testing, organic revenue was flat compared to last year. However,
if we exclude the negative impact from the pandemic, we estimate that our organic revenue would have
grown in the mid- to high-single digits, in line with our targeted performance.

Adjusted operating income for the segment was $210 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $175
million or 14.9% last year. The $35 million increase in adjusted operating income and 200 basis point
improvement in margins were primarily due to COVID-19 testing, LaunchPad savings and currency
translation, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Drug Development's LaunchPad initiative remains on
track with our 3-year target to deliver $150 million of net savings by the end of this year.

For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $6.1 billion and 1.31,
respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $12.5 billion, an increase of approximately $670
million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.2 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue
over the next 12 months. In summary, in the quarter, we delivered strong overall performance driven by
COVID-19 testing and a continued recovery in both our Diagnostics and Drug Development businesses.

With regard to our outlook, while we've seen our base businesses improve sequentially throughout the
third quarter and into October, as we enter into the final 2 months of the year, there continues to be
significant uncertainty related to the fall and flu season and the pandemic resulting in an unusually wide
range of potential financial outcomes. As a result, we are continuing to not provide 2020 guidance.
This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

I wanted to start by asking about the base business recovery. It was coming in stronger than we were
expecting. Is there any color you can provide around just month-by-month trend throughout the quarter?
And then, Glenn, also, if I look at how the base business, you saw the negative impact on volume, but
positive on rev rec. Just help us maybe from a test category perspective, what you're seeing as well there.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Jack, this is Adam. I'll start with the recovery of the base business. I said it before that, it surprised me
how fast the base business has recovered. If you go back to March, our base business at that point was
down 55% versus the prior year. And this is looking at Diagnostics. If you then would look at June, our
base business was down about 17% for the month of June. But for the quarter, second quarter, it was
down 35%. If you look at third quarter, which we've just discussed, we're down 9% for the quarter. So you
are seeing sequential improvements quarter-over-quarter. And frankly, we're seeing it month-over-month.
So each month is a little bit better than the prior month. So we continue to see that coming back.

With regard to our other business, our Drug Development business, that's coming back a bit slower, not
as quickly as the Diagnostic business. What we've seen is the preclinical, early stage work has come back
the fastest of the 3 businesses in Drug Development. Last quarter, the central laboratory business was
not coming back as quickly as the clinical development business. For this quarter, we've seen a significant
acceleration in our laboratory business -- central laboratory business, and that has actually come back a
bit faster than the clinical development business. With the clinical development business, we have access
to about 70% of the sites now. So that's better than last quarter, but there's still about 30% of the sites
that are not open for access at the moment.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Jack, this is Glenn. Just to your other question on kind of the volume being down, but the favorable price/
mix being up, and Adam, obviously, just went through the volume decline. On the price/mix, as you know,
in kind of a normal environment. Diagnostics overall does kind of the 1% to 2% organic volume, and then
we pick up around a point on favorable price/mix. And obviously, the last couple of quarters are anything
but in a normal environment. We have seen favorable price/mix over the last 2 quarters. We were up
around 5% last quarter and now up around 7% this quarter. The biggest driving factor to the improvement
in price/mix really has been an increase in our test per session. We've also seen an improvement in the
mix. And to your point, some categories, in particular, like women's health or NIPT or hepatitis screening
seem to be the bigger test parts that we've seen a higher growth rate than the other. But overall, a
favorable mix, but again, the biggest driver being the amount of tests we're doing per session.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Great. And just as a follow-up on COVID testing. Could you share your thoughts around the sustainability
of the rate you're collecting per detection test? And kind of building off that, your incremental margins in
Diagnostics were obviously very strong this quarter. Should we expect that rate to sustain as we go into
the fourth quarter? And any thoughts around the durability there would be great.

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27,
2020

Jack, so when we launched the PCR testing, we had 3 core principles. The first one was to use science and
innovation and build as much capacity as quickly as we could. The second was that everybody would have
equal access to the testing. So we charge nobody upfront out-of-pocket cost, and we charge everybody
the Medicare rate. In fact, when we first launched the test, we launched it before we even knew what
the Medicare rate was. And then the third thing was that nobody would be prioritized over anybody else.
That as the test came into laboratories, we would do those tests first, with the only exception was when
the CDC and HHS asked us to prioritize, so for example, for a hospital inpatients. And I think that those
principles have served us well. And we adhere to those principles as we sit here today.

In terms of the longevity, I think for as long as the emergency declaration is here, which now is through
the month of January, and we'll see if it gets extended after that, I think that the pricing is consistent. You
saw recently that there was a slight change to Medicare, where it still will be reimbursed for people up to
$100, if your turnaround time is within 2 days. And the good news is our turnaround time is about a day.
So that shouldn't have a significant impact on us for that Medicare change. And then we have to see what
happens over time with the declaration of the emergency after the end of January next year.

Operator

And our next question comes from Pito Chickering at Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

During the quarter, a lot of COVID revenues flow through to the bottom line. I understand you aren't
giving guidance but can you walk us through any new costs that we could see during the fourth quarter?
Or if you're considering taking the excess earnings from COVID and accelerating any investments in the
near term.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Go ahead, Glenn.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Just a comment on the -- for the guidance. It's less of, call it, an issue on the cost. It's more just the
significant variance in potential outcomes relative to the business demand. So obviously, we've seen in
the third quarter, as Adam and I commented in our remarks, the business is performing well sequentially,
ending the quarter even better than where we started. So obviously, at the current run rates, we would
expect to see continued good results.

As we enter into the fall, again, the flu season, we just don't know the restrictions that may be in place,
what the impact of the base businesses will be going forward. So really, the uncertainty being driven more
off of what's the demand of the business, could be continued strength, could be some softness, if we see
a pretty bad flu season ahead of us. But overall, the cost structure of the company is in place. And frankly,
one of the benefits to the margin improvement is being able to leverage that cost control, while we're
seeing enhanced revenues.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

And just to give you a little additional context. A couple of weeks ago, we were averaging about 110,000
PCR tests a day. Now we're averaging 120,000 PCR tests a day. We could go up to over 200,000 a day
if the country needed it during the flu season. If you look at Australia, Brazil, Argentina and some other
countries that have gone through the flu season, it hasn't been particularly a big flu season. In fact, it was
very small in those countries. Could it be because they were in lockdown for COVID? That would help with
the flu season? Yes, very possibly. So without knowing what the flu season could bring, and we're just
right at the start of it, you could see how much variability there could be.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Then as a follow-up, for share repurchases, historically, you've been fairly measured on your
quarterly repurchases. Should we expect a similar activity going forward or because of a recent influx of
cash flows could it be more accelerated?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, so we've always looked at our capital allocation very carefully and thoughtfully. And our first
and foremost thing that we look to do is to buy these tuck-in acquisitions, these local laboratories, local
hospital laboratories where we can bring them into our business. We can -- very quickly they become
accretive. They return their cost of capital within a very short period of time, and we know how to
integrate them. There are several of those that we're looking at. I can tell you, I believe that there has
been an acceleration in the number of those possibilities as we go through this year into next year. And
we'll look at capital allocation from that lens first, and then we'll be opportunistic where it makes sense
with the share repurchases.

Operator

And our next question comes from Erin Wright of Crédit Suisse.

Erin Elizabeth Wilson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. On the Covance side of the business, you mentioned 13% of bookings associated with COVID. How
should we be thinking about the COVID-related bookings across Covance more meaningfully contributing
to top line growth? And then how much is vaccine work compared to therapeutic COVID clinical trials?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thank you, Erin. So we're making significant progress with COVID on both the diagnostic and in the
clinical trial business. Many of the studies -- said that we've done about 300 -- we've won about 350 of
those opportunities. Many of them are very early stage, smaller trials, where we're doing in the preclinical
work or we're doing design work and those types of things. And then there are others that are late-stage
in the vaccine space where we're actively involved at the moment. They are not materially impacting the
revenue at the moment. So that's why we didn't call out revenue specifically. But as we go through time,
they'll become more meaningful for us.

In terms of vaccine versus the other types of treatments, there's less vaccines out there, but the vaccine
trials are much, much bigger than the other trials. So I would say in numbers of trials, most of them are
outside of vaccines. But when you look at volume, there's a lot of volume coming through the vaccines.

Erin Elizabeth Wilson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then quickly on capital deployment. Again, I guess, how should we be thinking about your
positioning as a consolidator in this market in a post-COVID world? Where are there more opportunities or
less opportunities in, and what does the acquisition pipeline look like?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So I'll start with in the Diagnostic business. One of the things that I've said before that has surprised
me since starting as the CEO here last November is that there are lots of opportunities and lots of
discussions that occur about acquiring local laboratories or hospital laboratories, but they just take a bit
longer than I had expected. I thought that they make so much economic sense for both the laboratory
that's looking to be acquired and for LabCorp that I thought they would go faster. So at the moment, there

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27,
2020

are many more that we're looking at today than what I would have said before, particularly if you look
at the size and scale of some of them, but how fast they go is impossible for me to predict because they
have, in the past, taken longer than I expected.

In terms of other acquisitions, we mentioned GlobalCare and snapIoT. Those were 2 acquisitions that
would help us with decentralized clinical trials and hybrid trials. We've said that those were critical to our
strategy, and they were smaller tuck-in types of acquisitions to help with our strategy. So we'll continue
to look for smaller tuck-in acquisitions that help us strategically. I do not see the need, as I sit here today,
to do any type of very large scale acquisition. I think that we have what we need to be successful, and we

And our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.

Kevin Caliendo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

What are you seeing in terms of the makeup of your base business mix? Is there any changes, if you were
to call it out sort of on a year-over-year basis? How much has it -- has it changed in any way, shape or
form? Or are you still seeing the same type of mix that you had prior?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Kevin, the mix is about the same. What's been interesting is in the beginning of the pandemic,
when our base business was down significantly, our esoteric business did not fall as fast as our other
business. Last quarter, we said that both businesses were coming back about equal. Now I would say in
the third quarter, our base business actually came back a bit faster than the esoteric business. So we're
not necessarily seeing a long-term mix shift but we've seen a different impact on the 2 businesses as
we've gone through the year.

Kevin Caliendo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, you said you were planning to add some capacity to your COVID
testing. Can you take us through sort of what that might be? Is 210,000 -- is that where we should think
about? And what is sort of the breaking point when you think about turnaround times in terms of how
many tests you can do and still get it done within that 48-hour period?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So Kevin, as I mentioned, right now, we can do more than 210,000 tests per day. And our turnaround
time today is about 1 day. Now right now, we're testing an average about 120,000 tests. And I would
say we could go much higher and I still think maintain our current turnaround time or just be within the
48 hours. The 210,000 does not include our pooling that we're able to do. And if we needed to do more
pooling, we could increase that pretty significantly. But also, we're looking at adding additional capacity in
terms of machines and capabilities.

So as we said from the beginning, one of our core tenets was to build capacity as quickly as we can.
We've been doing that since March. In July, there was a significant increase in the number of samples that
we were receiving. And no matter how fast we had built capacity, we still fell a little bit behind. So even
though right now we're running at about 50% of our capacity, we are not slowing down. We're going to
continue to buy the machines that we can buy. And to me, that's the biggest rate-limiting is the number of
larger machines that we can get as we go into the fall flu season.

Lisa Christine Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Adam, let me just start with the combination of the flu and PCR test. Can you just talk about --
will that count as a COVID test? Or will that count as a flu test when we think about volumes? And then
secondly, how do we think about reimbursement for combined tests like that?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Absolutely, Lisa. So we are currently able to do the flu, PCR and also RSV test through physicians. We
also notably filed an EUA to be able to do it with our Pixel and our LabCorp At Home test. I think that as
we go into flu season, if somebody has a lot of symptoms, it might be nice that they not even have to go
to a doctor. Their doctor can send them a test, so they can order a test and get the results.

If you look at the Medicare rates, we believe it's going to be about $143 for the combined test. And as
we've done in the past, we've used the Medicare rate as our guide as we've gone through the pandemic
and the emergency declaration. So we'll continue to do that. With regard to how we record that, Lisa, I
think we have to think that through. As we decide, we'll certainly make sure that we talk to you and let
the external environment know how we're thinking about it. To date, so we've gotten very few because
we're really not in the flu season yet. So there hasn't been a real need at the moment for the combined
test.

Lisa Christine Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And Adam, how do you think about testing when we do have a vaccine? What's your point of view around
-- and I know you're not giving any guidance for fourth quarter or for 2021? But how do we start to think
about testing as we have vaccines come into the market in 2021?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So I'll give you my thoughts on it, but anybody that tells you that they have any significant degree of
certainty is wrong. That's the only part I'm certain about, what I'm about to say. I believe that we'll have
a lot more data by the end of this year to know the effectiveness of the various vaccines that are in Phase
III. And that's going to be very helpful.

And if we have vaccines that can move forward into the marketplace, I think it could start early next year.
But before you could vaccinate a significant number of the population in U.S., I think you're probably
talking about the middle of next year, my personal opinion, based upon experience without knowing all the
facts. So I think that they're going to need continued testing for at least through the first quarter of next
year for PCR testing. I think you're going to continue to need it as you go into the second part of the year.
And then by the time you get to the summertime, hopefully, we'll have the vaccine broadly disseminated
and the need for PCR testing will be significantly diminished.

The 2 questions we have are: one, we know the pricing relatively certain what it could look like through
January. We have to see what the pricing will look like after January. My assumption is that why wouldn't
you continue to have the emergency authorization through the winter, but we just don't know that for
sure.

And then the second thing to realize with the vaccine is we don't know are there going to be antibody
tests, titer tests, they're going to be neutralizing antibody tests that might be helpful as people go through
the vaccine. So we're developing a suite of tests. We announced last week our test for the antibodies
that we give you quantitative analysis used in pharmaceuticals, to try to help understand what might
be helpful. So will there be additional tests that we can do to help in the future even after vaccine? My
assumption is probably, but we still have to wait to see the data. Is it going to be T cells? Or is it going to
be antibody? There's still a lot more we're going to learn over the coming months.

And our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I just wanted to confirm a couple of things and maybe talk through these. First off, based on your
disclosure on the 13% of awards from COVID tests -- clinical trials in the Covance segment, I'm coming up
with net book-to-bills this quarter and last quarter of around 1.15 to 1.2. And that's if I also strip out the
COVID-19 active infection testing revenue, which I think you're putting in one-for-one with bookings. Is
that ballpark? Am I getting to the right numbers here?

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Eric, I guess, just a question. Are you trying to back out the impact of the award...?

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Trying to look at what the -- I think the -- yes, thanks. The big question, I think, everyone has is how
much of the awards in the CRO side of the world are coming from COVID-19 trials. And then how much
revenue, how much impact, what the comps are going to be down the road. So I'm trying to look at what
the -- I hate to say base business because this is all what you do, but the core legacy non-COVID testing,
and then we also have to make an additional adjustment for the work that would have historically been
done in LCD, but it's getting shifted over to Covance central labs. I know you're putting that revenue in at
kind of a 1:1 on bookings. So I think if I strip everything out and look at the base, I'm still coming up with
book-to-bills for the last 2 quarters of around 1.2.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

I think the distinction, though, is that when you -- and Adam kind of commented. We have, obviously,
a lot of awards that have come in, a lot of tending to be more on the early side of our business. So
when you look at the book-to-bill that's coming in from, call it, the non-COVID testing, but the awards
that we're getting for vaccine or therapeutics would be, call it, at a lower book-to-bill, if you will, than
what we've been experiencing overall. So if anything, taking out a lower ratio of book-to-bill for at least
the awards that we have, you could even argue, could move it somewhat the other way. I think for the
businesses that are seeing more on the late-stage clinical trials for those awards, that tend to be longer
book-to-bill time periods. You might see a different outcome than what we're currently experiencing.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then on Covance margin, getting a lot of inbound questions on what the core margin was if
we strip out the COVID-19 testing. I'm coming up with something around 15% in the quarter, but I was
hoping you could lend some color on that.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So let me give you some context. One of the things that I had mentioned before is when we saw the
decline in our business in Covance, we did not reduce the size and the number of people that we had. And
the reason why is a lot of these people are hard to find. They're hard to train. We thought -- and we're
seeing the business coming back. So I'd be careful with the margins because the margins are a little bit
worse than they typically would be because we're still seeing the revenue come back. But at the same
time, we kept a bit of the expenses for the people so that we didn't have to try to rehire and refine people
that we already had.

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27,
2020

Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is that when you -- we've talked about that kind of the organic revenue
growth was really the PCR testing. So we would have been flat otherwise. So organically, still a positive,
call it, flat in the pandemic, flat organic revenue. So from a margin standpoint, plus or minus, assume
that our margins, excluding the PCR testing, would be relatively flat as well. As Adam said, the headwind
from, call it, the personnel side of it, but we also have kind of the tailwind from our LaunchPad initiative.
In addition, we get some leverage from -- we talked about the currency conversion and some acquisitions
that would be additive as well.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Right. And when you say flat, I guess, I'm trying to understand what is it, flat with last quarter, flat with
2H, flat with last year? I am just trying to get a sense on what you're implying by flat.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

The flat would be in explaining the change in our margins, where we're up around, call it, 200 basis
points in margin. Assume that's being attributable to the PCR testing, and that margins overall would be
relatively flat with the explanation that both Adam and I gave for that.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Right. So around -- you did 14.9% last year. I said around 15%. So that's correct?

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

That's relatively flat. Yes.

And our next question comes from Don Hooker with KeyBanc.

Donald Houghton Hooker
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Great. So maybe just 2 questions for me. Would love to hear kind of an update. We've hit a lot of issues
already this morning, but maybe an update on the sort of managed care environment. On a different
topic, kind of with the relationship with United, with other -- are those sort of at standstills? Are we seeing
some movement there? I know there's a lot of disruption in the markets. We'd love to hear your updated
thoughts on that.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. So we continue to have a very strong relationship with United. And we were pleased that we were
put on to p.r.n. again in July of this year. Frankly, I thought at this time this year, I'll be able to give you
an update on how the p.r.n. has worked since we entered into it about a year ago. And unfortunately, with
the pandemic, we haven't seen a significant amount of progress, but we are continuing to be optimistic
that it makes a lot of sense, and we'll be able to work with United to get the p.r.n. up and running and
to help them shift the business to where they want to shift it to, which is to the high-quality, lower cost
laboratories like ourselves. And the PLN -- it's the PLN, Preferred Laboratory Network, is something that
other managed care plans have begun to talk about those types of things. I believe that they -- we're
waiting to see if it worked. And now that they've waited a while, even though we don't necessarily know
if it works or not, I think we might see more of that as we move forward because everybody realizes the
economic advantage of having these PLNs in place. And I think we'll see more and more of it as we go into
the future. So stay tuned.

Okay. Super. And then one last quick one. You guys -- I guess, the last question was on the COVID-19
testing at the Covance facilities. Does that have any kind of crowding out effect on the rest of Covance? Or
is it -- are you not doing work that you otherwise would have done? Or is there any kind of crowding out
from driving -- putting some of the COVID-19 testing activity at the Covance business?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

No. As I said before, we could do 210,000 tests a day. We're doing 120,000 tests. We're using that facility
opportunistically. But if we had other things that we needed to do in that facility, we would obviously use
other facilities to run the test. One of the good things that we did was to go and run our tests on multiple
platforms. So we're running on 8 different platforms. But at the same time, we have a network across
the United States that we can kind of have materials and samples sent to the laboratories that will have
the best turnaround time. And we can use our network to say, let's send more samples to this laboratory,
less to that one, more to this one, and we can do it on a very routine basis. So we have the ability to flex
where we need to flex.

And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut at Jefferies.

Brian Gil Tanquilut
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just a quick follow-up to Eric's question, flipping it to the core Diagnostics business. How are you thinking
about margin sustainability once you ex out the COVID opportunity? I mean, obviously, very strong
margins during the quarter. So just trying to figure out what you think core margins could be going
forward.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Brian, I guess, similar. Obviously, the big driver in the margin improvement, as you pointed out,
was the COVID testing. We actually did leverage well, even excluding COVID testing in Diagnostics.
This business a little bit, kind of, the opposite on the Drug Development side. As Adam said, we have
the personnel for the business that we have. So we have a little bit more of a headwind on Diagnostics
because of the significant growth in the business. We continue to add personnel as we're going. So we --
from a personnel standpoint, we really leverage. So with the LaunchPad savings we had in the quarter,
margins held up really well, even despite the negative impact of PAMA with the Diagnostics. But strong
under, call it, the base business underlying the margins were -- came in very strong.

Operator

And our next question comes from Stephen Baxter of Wolfe Research.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wolfe Research, LLC

Wanted to ask you about PCR reimbursement. So it's very helpful you provide the precise revenue and
testing figures around COVID. So thank you for that. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what
your average PCR reimbursement was in Q3 and how that compares to what you saw in Q2. When I look
at your disclosures, I'm backing into something in the mid-90s for Q3, whereas for Q2, I was backing into
something more like mid- to high-70s. So just wondering if there was anything in there related to true-
up maybe as you got more confidence in your ability to collect on managed care. And an extension of that
would just be how we should be thinking about PCR reimbursement in Q4.

15

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27,
2020

Yes. Sure. So our reimbursement in this quarter was about the same as last quarter. It was in the
mid-80s to upper 80s, and that's been consistent. And as I mentioned before, with our 3 principles, the
second principle is that we charge people the Medicare rate, which is $100. As we continue to be in the
emergency declaration, which is through the first month of next year, I think the 22nd or something like
that of January, I believe we'll continue to have good reimbursement.

The question will be, will they continue the emergency declaration? If they do, I believe reimbursement
will continue or if they don't, I think we'll have pressure on pricing without the emergency declaration.
The other thing is you did see that Medicare is now still reimbursing for $100 per patient, but only if
your turnaround time is 2 days. And you have to average 2 days for the month before and be 2 days
brings with the test. The good news is that we're at about a 1 day turnaround time. So we feel pretty
comfortable with that. But we'll continue as we go through the fall season, and we see numbers increase,
watch that extraordinarily closely.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. And just 1 somewhat related follow-up. Just on payer mix. Obviously, there's a ton going on with
the pricing numbers at the moment. Just wondering if you could give us an update on what you're seeing
in terms of any payer mix shift or potentially increases in assumptions around like bad debt accruals and
like?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. We're really not seeing any significant change in payer mix. It's pretty consistent as it's been in the
past.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. I think that's the end on bad debt accruals.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes, obviously, concerning economic trends across the country. Wondering if you're seeing any increase in
bad debt.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Good. Yes, I just want to make sure I understood the question, right. Yes. From a bad debt standpoint,
obviously, as you know, we reserved in the first quarter, $17 million. We have seen an increase in the
bad debt, just given the financial strain that obviously is impacting some of our clients. We feel that the
reserves that we've established are adequate, but there's no question we've seen a little bit of a pickup in
the bad debt, but we feel our rate that we accrue for is very adequate relative to the expectations that we
have for that going forward.

And our next question comes from Rivka Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So Adam, I think earlier in response to a question, you sort of downplayed the role of serology testing
once a vaccine is available. Do you think -- do you anticipate based just on historical context any
guidelines around use of testing in conjunction with the COVID vaccine? And are you having any
conversations with the biopharma company around that?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, absolutely, Ricky. And I still believe that the serology testing is going to be important in the future.
I just don't think we have the science yet to tell us. Is it neutralizing antibodies, is it total antibodies,
quantitative analysis, T cell involvement outside of antibodies? So my only comment was meant to say
that there's a lot more science that needs to be done. If it really is, is it going to be an annual vaccine? Or
is it going to be every couple of years? If it's more than every year, you'll need titers measured and those
types of things. So I think there will be a role. We're in conversations, I'd say, with most if not all the
major pharma companies, conversations with operation more speed and conversations with many other
science and thought leaders in this area. So we're building a whole series of potential ways to measure
the impact of vaccines. I can't tell you which one is going to work. But I can tell you, if there is something,
which historically there has been, we're going to do everything as we can to be ready for it.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. So just to clarify, because if we think of one of the questions we're getting is kind of like what are
the drivers, right, in the second half of '21 and into '22 post-PCR? So to your point, there's going to be
some sort of testing that's going to replace PCR? Are you just at this point, we don't know which test it's
going to be?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

So I think there will be some. But Ricky, what I would say is that I look at the PCR testing almost as like
a short-term opportunity in a period of time. And then once that's gone, there's going to be some type
of impact to the ability to grow. But what you're going to want to look at is our underlying business. So I
mentioned that we have 1 oncology trial for major pharma company. I mentioned that we're starting to
see the power of the combined based on what we've done with the COVID testing. What we're looking
to show you is the proof that says that having Diagnostics with Drug Development matters, which you're
really starting to see now. We won more than 350 or approximately 350 COVID trials, which is a very
significant number of the total trials. And what you're going to start to see is that translating into our
core business changing. So yes, I do think there will be some things that we'll continue to do with COVID
testing over time, with vaccines and so forth. Whether that completely offsets PCR testing, I don't know.
I mean, it depends on what it is, how often you do it and so forth. But importantly, the work and what
we're showing with our underlying business is going to be where you'll see growth as we go out into future
years.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So then if you think about that, the pandemic clearly increased focus on the critical role of testing. Are you
seeing this filtering already into discussions with health systems and payers beyond the COVID impact?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

I think people have a new recognition for the importance of testing and the importance of testing
combined with Drug Development. And you already hearing people talk about antibiotic resistance that
could be occurring based upon treatment of COVID and other things. And I think there are going to be
other bugs that we're going to have to figure out how to detect and how to treat in the future. So I do
believe that the world now has a different view of the importance of diagnostic testing. And one of the
things that I'm going to be advocating for very strongly is the removal of PAMA. There's no impact of
PAMA for next year. But I think it should be removed entirely because I think part of the reason that we
were not as prepared as we needed to be for this pandemic is because for years, people underestimated
the importance of diagnostic testing. They starved the diagnostic testing business. State laboratories, for
example, were using machines that were so old and antiquated that we need government and payers to

understand that for us to have excess capacity, for us to have dual supply chains, for us to have the latest
and greatest innovations, we need to continue to have fair reimbursement.

And our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair.

Matthew Richard Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Adam, you referenced the sequential improvement in the base business Q2 to Q3, despite a second wave
and then further improvement here in October despite record case consent in recent weeks. So just kind
of curious what the key underlying improvements you're seeing. Is it as simple as PPE being available
when offices are open? Curious about that. And then maybe just comment on demand trends in some
geographies for perhaps a peak has already occurred. Are there places where you're actually seeing year-
over-year growth at this point?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Matt, so we have seen some sequential improvement months-over-months. When the country shut
down back in March, we saw almost all physicians' offices or many of physicians' offices shut down. And
it took them a while to move over to telemedicine, frankly. And we saw the hospitals that were pretty
overwhelmed and didn't have PPE, didn't have enough ventilators. And therefore, it was hard for people
to get routine procedures and so forth. What we've now seen is even in areas that have a significant
outbreak, the physician's offices still stay open or they have significant capabilities to telemedicine to
keep people getting routine care. We've seen that the hospitals are able to now have enough PPE. They
continue to do routine surgeries and procedures and so forth.

So unless you saw a major shutdown of the health care system again, I think that you'll continue to see
the sequential improvement. The only caveat I have is if it's a really significant flu season and physicians'
offices are path of people coughing and sneezing, and you don't know if it's flu or COVID, I think people
may once again say, you know what, I'm going to wait to get my routine care. So that's why I'm hesitant
to say what I think will happen in the coming months because it really, to some degree, in my opinion, is
going to depend on how hard a flu season we hit.

Matthew Richard Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe just actually following up on the point you raised regarding flu
season. Obviously, understanding that it's very early here, but just curious what you're hearing from your
preferred physicians or maybe your own medical team about what preference will be for flu versus the
combination test, whether it's for symptomatic or asymptomatic patients? Obviously, there's a variety of
both modalities and test combinations that are now available.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So first thing, to answer your other question about geography, we're not really seeing a significant
difference by geography based upon outbreaks. We're seeing pretty consistent growth. Some geographies
are using more point-of-care tests, some are using other laboratories and so forth. But in general, I don't
think you see a major difference in geography for us. With regard to the demand by test, I think for
asymptomatic patients, they'll continue to do the COVID test alone, if they've been exposed to somebody
or if they've been in contact with somebody that has the disease. I don't think there's any reason to do
multiple tests if the person doesn't have symptoms.

I think if somebody presents themselves in a doctor's office, they may do a flu point-of-care test. And if
it's positive, they may say, okay, go home, take care of yourself. And if it doesn't resolve itself, we'll have
you tested for COVID. I think in some situations, even for a positive flu test, they are going to say, you
know what, let's just test you for COVID and flu anyway, just to be certain. If you have a negative flu

2020

test point of care, I think they're certainly going to test you for COVID if you have symptoms. And then
the question is, will they add on a flu test because they know sometimes you get false negatives with the
point-of-care test, and it may just be easier to say let's add a flu test on there. So we're preparing for all
of those different scenarios as we go forward. I think that the majority of tests will still be COVID alone,
but there could be a significant number, particularly for symptomatic patients that are in combination for
flu and/or RSV.

Operator

And our next question comes from Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So first off, how would you characterize any efforts you have underway to maintain your share of COVID
molecular testing as it seems that there are new labs and new entrants spinning up all the time in this
market?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Dan, so if you look at our share, I'll first start off with ACLA laboratories. So we get a sense ACLA
reports the total number of tests. I know what our actual number of tests are, so I can calculate our share
and we have a very strong share of ACLA labs. And in fact, it's growing slightly if you go quarter-over-
quarter.

The question you're asking, though, is with more point-of-care tests out there, with additional local
laboratories, what could the future bring? What I would say is, to date, we haven't seen a very significant
impact. I think this country needs as many tests as it can get, frankly. I think there is a need for point-
of-care tests. I think for surveillance, having antigen tests available are helpful. I think in hospitals and
nursing homes, you want faster tests to actually do surveillance. And then if you have positive cases,
you do PCR test. So I actually think there's a role for all the different types of tests that we have in the
marketplace.

To me, the question really is what was asked before, which is once there's a vaccine, what does the role of
testing look like? And that's where it's a little difficult to answer because what if a vaccine works in 70%
of people and doesn't work in the other 30% and 1 of only 70% of people get the vaccine, so there's 30%
that don't get it in the first place. Well, you still have a lot of people in that scenario that would want PCR
testing over time. So we still have to learn more for that scenario.

I appreciate that. And then, Adam, for my follow-up, I appreciate that there's uncertainty around the
market demand for the combo test as opposed to COVID stand-alone. But if demand for the combo test
came in higher than you'd anticipate, how would you characterize your capacity on that test at LabCorp to
meet the demand?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Dan, I can tell you, at a meeting with the team, I think, it was last week, and we're continuing to
have ongoing discussions. And we're gearing up for as many tests that we might need. When I talk about
210,000 capacity, it's the reagents that are a bit different, not necessarily the machinery. So as long as we
have reagents to do those tests, we should be able to do as many as that if we need to. So we're going to
continue to build the capacity, and then we'll have -- we're trying to get enough reagents that we can go
either way if we need to.

And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. Glenn, I wanted to go back to your comment on increasing test per session. Do you think that's a
consequence of COVID where physicians are sort of ordering more panels even outside of COVID and do
you think there is sustainability of that where you get kind of a continued uplift there?

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, Ralph, call it, speculative, but the feeling is there's probably been a fair amount of pent-up demand as
people haven't been going for especially the routine testing. And so now as they're coming back, they're
doing more tests, if you will, per that session is, call it, a catch-up, if you will. So we have seen it. We've
seen it for the last couple of quarters. It picked up in this quarter. The assumption would be, obviously,
that, that would start to come back down, still be a positive favorable price/mix for us, but probably not to
the levels that we've seen at least over the couple of quarters, but we'll have to wait and see.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then just quickly on -- if you could help on the volume mix of COVID. First
between, if you could split out commercial versus Medicare versus Medicaid in terms of the volume mix of
COVID. And then if you could also help across where it's essentially coming from between drive up sites
versus employers versus universities versus health providers. I don't know if you have that breakout, but
it would be helpful just to kind of understand where the volumes come from.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So let me start with the second question first. The vast majority of the tests that we do, I'm not
talking about all the tests in the marketplace, but the ones that we do are still coming from urgent care
centers, from physician offices, from people that are treating patients. We do some, obviously, from
employers. We do some for hospitals still, but the vast majority is in those physician offices and in the
urgent care centers, those types of places. We continue to see Pixel doing well. It's about 5% to 10% of
our volume. And some of that is with employers, but a lot of that is just people ordering at home tests,
and we expect that will continue to be a good portion of our mix. And then if you look at the breakout,
it's not too different than what you would expect the overall breakout of our business to be in terms of
reimbursement because it's coming primarily from urgent cares and physicians.
So I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Hopefully, you can see that LabCorp is leading with
science. And I believe it's never been more important or more apparent than right now as we continue
our unwavering commitment to our mission of improving health and improving lives. I can tell you that
our team will continue to partner with our customers, our suppliers, other organizations who share our
commitment to lead the way through this crisis. And at the same time, importantly, at the same time,
we're going to continue to execute on our strategy for growth, which remains our long-term consistent
strategy. We appreciate your time today. Have a great day.
