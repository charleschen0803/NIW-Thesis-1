Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in holding. We now have your presenters in
conference. [Operator Instructions]

It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Taryn Miller, VP of Finance and Interim Head of
Investor Relations.

Taryn Miller

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's Second Quarter Earnings
Conference Call. On the call with me today are Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO; and Maria Henry, our
CFO.

Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release, and we also published prepared management
remarks from Mike and Maria to summarize our second quarter results and full year 2021 outlook. Both
documents are available on the Investors section of our website. We hope you find it valuable to have
prepared remarks ahead of this call. In just a moment, Mike will share a few opening comments and then
we'll take your questions.

During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest
annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to
adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The
release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial
measures.

Now I'll turn it over to Mike.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the Q&A, I'd like to offer some
additional perspective on our performance. Clearly, our results did not turn out as we expected, and we
knew it was a tough comp, given our strong growth and record profitability in the year-ago quarter. Now
while we expected volatility this year, the external environment has proven to be even more volatile than
our expectation at the beginning of the year and versus our April update.

Since we spoke in April, commodity inflation has spiked higher and our supply chain has been challenged.
These dynamics are impacting us and, more broadly, the industry. We're also navigating historic levels
of demand volatility in consumer tissue. Last year, we worked really hard to support our consumers and
our customers as demand increased at a record pace. While we expected the category to retract this
year, that decline has meaningfully outpaced our expectations. This has been driven by reduced at-home
consumption due to increased mobility and destocking of both consumer pantries and retailer inventory.

Consumer tissue has historically been very stable and we expect demand to normalize over time. We
remain confident in our brand fundamentals even as we acknowledge that the short-term tissue outlook
has been difficult to call. We've taken decisive action to offset the impact of raw material inflation. We
have announced pricing in key markets around the world. Our pricing actions are on track, and we expect
to fully offset the effects of input cost inflation over time as we've done in previous cycles.

We've also taken prudent steps to control and reduce discretionary spend across the business. We expect
this to be reflected in our results as we continue to implement these actions. We view this level of input
cost inflation and the COVID-driven demand volatility to be discrete issues. We will continue to take
appropriate action to reduce the impact of volatility over time.

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

At the same time, we remain confident and committed to our approach to building brands. Despite near-
term challenges, we have plenty of bright spots in our business. Our strategy to invest in our brand is
working. You can see this in our second quarter results broadly across personal care and especially in D&E
markets. Excluding North American consumer tissue, our organic sales were up 4%. Personal care organic
sales were up 6% globally, driven by a 4% volume increase. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales
were up 8%, with very strong market share performance, including in China, Brazil, throughout Eastern
Europe, India, Peru and South Africa. We've recently captured #1 diaper share positions in China and
Brazil, which reflects the strength of our brand fundamentals with consumers.

Importantly, we're starting to see green shoots in K-C Professional. The business grew year-over-year and
sequentially as we saw strength in international markets and positive trends in washroom products. As
more companies transition back to in-person environments, we expect KCP momentum to improve in the
back half.

We're encouraged by our underlying brand performance and have made significant progress in addressing
the supply challenges we faced earlier this year in our North American personal care business. Looking
forward to the second half, we are expecting better results across the business. We believe the major
factors impacting this quarter do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. We remain committed
to our strategy to deliver balanced and sustainable growth for the long term. We'll continue to execute K-
C Strategy 2022, and we'll invest in our business for the future. This includes investments in innovation,
commercial capabilities and technology.

Importantly, I also want to emphasize that we are acutely aware of the impact that this pandemic
continues to have on our employees, our consumers and our partners and the world. We will continue to
prioritize the health and safety of our people and all that interact with Kimberly-Clark.
Now with that, we'd like to address your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Wanted to first, to start with, I think, the biggest question, which is relatively short term, but is the
guidance reduction for this year. And I think it'd be helpful for everyone to just hear a bit about your
degree of confidence that like, this is it, right? The environment's been incredibly volatile. But as you look
forward from here, to what degree have you built in flexibility for things to perhaps worsen? So I think
that's sort of an important starting point. And along with that, within the inflation basket, what has been
the biggest delta versus when you last communicated an outlook for the guidance to the Street back in
April?

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Got it. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, a couple of things. I'll start with the outlook and I'll ask Maria to provide a
little more color. But first of all, I'll just say, overall, my view on the outlook is it reflects certainly, as I
mentioned in my prepared remarks, significant changes in that external environment that we, here, view
as being discrete issues and that really -- that we're managing and fully managing, I would say.

The 2 issues that we're talking about are, one, raw material inflation and then the consumer tissue
demand changes, particularly in North America. And if you add it up, Lauren, year-on-year, if you add
those 2, it's well over $3 of EPS on a year-over-year basis. So it's a pretty significant increase. Obviously,
given that amount and given our outlook, we are covering a significant portion of that, but we can't
practically cover all of that this year, all right?

And so what I would say is Part 1, our pricing implementation is largely on track and we expect to fully
offset inflation over time, not all this year but over time. And then the North American consumer tissue
volatility is COVID-driven, and I view that as more episodic in nature or temporary in nature, and I think
the team is doing a very good job navigating it. But certainly, Lauren, it's a little tougher managing
shortfalls in the category versus some of the gains that we went up against last year. And so those are, I
think, 2 that I would say are discrete issues.

The big delta on the commodities, perhaps that's less visible to all of you, is the polymer resin side of the
business, right? So you could see the -- you could track the eucalyptus prices which have kind of remained
in the space that we've called. But what's really escalated is resin, which I think for the full year, our
estimate, it will be up almost 100% at -- certainly at historic highs for us. And that should abate at some
point, but I think it's -- initially, we thought that was going to come down some in the back half, but it
looks like the highs are staying high longer. And so that does reflect some of the pricing that we've taken.

So overall, I think those are really the 2 big issues. I do really want to point out, Lauren, that our brands
are fundamentally very healthy, and we continue to see really robust growth around the world in both
organic and in share. And even we're really, really pleased with our North American personal care
recovery, although we are a little light on share, I would say almost all of that is related to supply issues.

We still undershipped orders significantly in the quarter despite being positive on organic growth in the
quarter. And so we feel good about where the business is and where our brand fundamentals are, and
we're expecting a stronger Q3 in our personal care business. But maybe, Maria, do you want to add some
color?

Maria G. Henry
Senior VP & CFO

6

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

Yes, sure. I'll -- on your first question, Lauren, about the full year outlook, we've been wrong twice
now. And so it's an incredibly dynamic environment that we're operating in and the changes versus our
expectations are clearly on the input cost side as well as how the consumer tissue category in North
America has unfolded here.

So when I think about the guidance range that we've provided, we have 6 months left to go in the year,
and there's $0.25 still in the range, and I don't like to take guidance down ever. And since we've done it
twice, you can rest assured that the guidance that we provided is both thoughtful and based on the trends
that we see, allowing for some ranges, given how dynamic this current environment is.

And then on the outlook for operating margin compared to 3 months ago, a couple of the things that I'd
call out: higher commodity costs, lower volumes in consumer tissue. And along with these lower volumes,
there's associated fixed cost absorption. The tissue business generally runs at very high utilization rates
and has high fixed costs, and the actions that we've taken to offset that also go into our outlook, which
include higher cost savings and reduced between-the-lines spending.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay, great. And Maria, when I look forward, I mean, it feels maybe a bit early, but to look forward into
next year, as I think about the headwinds that you faced year-to-date from those higher manufacturing
costs, be it a combination of the storm impact in Q1 and really more materially, the negative operating
leverage, like the absorption on tissue, I mean, as we look into '22, simply the absence of those factors,
if you just go back to a more normalized demand environment for tissue, right, those should be -- they
should just go away next year. I mean is there anything I'm missing as I think about that kind of impact to
profitability from operating leverage and higher manufacturing costs looking into next year and as we start
to compare against these periods?

Maria G. Henry
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I'll say 2 things. It's very tempting to talk about 2022, given where we are with this year and the very
unusual dynamics that we're facing. I'm going to resist that temptation as the environment's been quite
dynamic. And I think we're best off waiting to see another 6 months before we call 2022, given that the
macro factors are moving so much. But that said, Lauren, the way you're thinking about it is correct.

Operator

Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.

Dara Warren Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So Mike, you mentioned you expect to be able to fully offset the cost pressures with pricing over time. Is
that with just pricing alone, to be clear, or does that include other areas like cost savings? And just given
the inflation is unprecedented this year, do you think you have pricing in place by year-end to fully offset
those cost pressures? Or might it take a longer period of time to realize the pricing necessary and sort of a
couple of rounds of price increases? How do you think about that? And I'm particularly focused on how you
think about pricing, just given the magnitude of that inflation is much worse than it typically is when you
take pricing.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Dara, it's a great question. I would say yes and yes. I'm not trying to be flip. But I would say, one,
generally, we've taken really broad-based pricing action globally, almost -- I wouldn't say all markets, but
in nearly all key markets and pretty extensive. The price -- and the pricing ranges from mid-single digit to
high single digit, in some cases, double digits, right? And so pretty extensive pricing.

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

Obviously, we couldn't recover all of that, given timing because we announced in March, generally
implemented in June or in beginning of the third quarter, so we'll get a half year run on the pricing and
then a full year as we get into next year. That said, commodities have continued to move. But even as
we announced our pricing to our -- Part 2 of pricing is we remain committed to leveraging our revenue
growth management capability. And there's a lot of other levers that we can pull beyond list to continue to
manage pricing in our environment and we're committed to doing that. So that's Part 1.

I do think kind of given where we are, and I think it's normal and reasonable to expect that, we're also
going to leverage our cost savings program. I mean we have a very strong program, as you're well aware,
on force and we've kind of beefed that up over the course of the past year or so and we feel good about
that. And so we'll continue to leverage that.

So overall, again, I think the answer is yes on both. The bigger thing, Dara, is we do recognize the impact
of raw material inflation over time. In our categories, they tend to be a little more volatile. And we're -- a
fundamental underpinning of our strategy is margin improvement. And so because of that, we believe we
really have to, on an ongoing basis, offset the effect of inflation over time.

Dara Warren Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And just one follow-up on the pricing front, where you have implemented pricing so far, what's the
retailer reaction and receptivity been like? And it'd be early to judge consumer receptivity, but obviously,
some pretty large price increases in your portfolio. So just any thoughts on the ability of consumers to
handle that higher pricing and impact on market share, and any thoughts there on what we might see
going forward would be helpful.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, we never take pricing actions lightly, and we know they can be stressful for both the retailer
and our consumers and their shoppers. So we think hard about that. I will say, we believe our pricing
actions globally are generally on track. And I think broadly, the retailer conversations, though never easy,
I would say, have been largely constructive. And certainly, they understand what's happening in the cost
environment and so we're working through that.

And then I think from an execution perspective, our teams have done a phenomenal job executing rapidly
around the world. I would say in terms of other brands, I would say, generally, we've seen a lot of the
other brands move in a similar direction. I wouldn't say identical, but directionally in that same place. But
the execution of other brands and private label tends to vary market by market. And so some will lag a bit
more, but I would say, generally, we feel like our pricing actions are on track.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

A question for you, Mike, on advertising and marketing. So it looks like you did decide to defer some
investments, which is unsurprising in the current environment. I think the intention was clearly not to do
that. Maybe, Mike, just spend a moment on where you decided to pull back and why? And then just -- I
know this is difficult, we can appreciate that in the current environment, but balancing appropriate levels
of investment behind your best and highest return ideas with the current commodity cost environment.
And then I have a follow-up.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So overall, the thing about it, and when I say our challenges are kind of discrete, the challenges, as
I'll remind you, I'm sure you remember, Kevin, is like the inflation in North American tissue. In the balance

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

of our markets, our businesses are performing very well and generally above plan. And so I would say
maybe the thing I'll land with you is despite our near-term challenges, we're really focused on improving
our long-term growth profile. We're really confident that our balanced sustainable approach to building
brands is working and that the brand fundamentals globally are very healthy and that we're improving our
market positions.

We were up in share in about -- by our tracking, about 2/3 of our market category combinations in the
quarter and so we feel good about that. And the brands continue to respond well to strong investment.
I mean we had multi-share point gains in infant child care across China, South Korea, Australia, New
Zealand, in India, Indonesia, Eastern Europe, Argentina, Peru, pretty much double-digit growth in
Brazil. So we feel good about the overall performance of the business. So because of that, we're really
maintaining investment where that's working and where the businesses are on plan.

We have dialed back in some markets. You can assume, for example, in North American bath tissue,
given that the fluctuation in the category, we have chosen to pull back a little bit on the spending. And
we're going to continue to do that. We're going to operate with discipline. I think we talked about it in the
prior quarters, but there is as much a mass component to our advertising program as there is a creative
component, and we're pretty disciplined. It's kind of how we manage all of our consumer investments,
whether that's trade or marketing. And so we're pretty disciplined on the ROI. And so our teams are
reacting as you would probably hope that they would.

Maria, do you have anything to add there?

Maria G. Henry
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The only thing I'll add is if you look at our full year outlook, what's the thought on advertising is that
it's down somewhat to 2020 for the reasons Mike just discussed, but it's well ahead of 2019 on a dollar
basis.

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. One quick follow-up for both of you. Just on capital allocation and M&A, we saw that the buyback
outlook came down with a lower earnings outlook. But when you're going through the type of environment
you're going through now, you can't say pricing fast enough and even sort of leaning in and getting the
organization behind productivity is still not enough to offset the sort of commodity cost pressure. Does
it sort of give you pause with respect to the M&A strategy over time? And the school of thought that the
company should look to diversify the portfolio away from some of these commodity sensitive categories
and do that in a disciplined and accretive way? So your thoughts there would be helpful then I'll pass it on.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We're always looking at acquisition or M&A opportunities, right? And whether that means additions to
the portfolio or subtractions to the portfolio. Certainly, you saw that last year with Softex, which continues
to be a really exciting opportunity for us and that business is performing very, very well, by the way, up in
the teens, up multiple share points in the quarter. So we're super excited about that.

Given where you are, I think we'll continue to look for opportunity to enhance the portfolio. And certainly,
on both the plus, whether it's attractive markets or attractive categories. But also, we're going to continue
to look hard at our performance of our existing categories and businesses that don't add to our overall
growth profile or aren't going to be ongoingly accretive to our business, we're going to take a hard look
at it. And so again, we manage capital with incredible rigor and discipline. And hopefully, that's what our
investors will appreciate about our approach.

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

Yes. And on the buyback specifically, our -- at the midpoint of our guidance, our operating profit now
expected to be down $450 million year-over-year. And you'll recall that in January, when we were coming
into the year that our target for buybacks, we were expecting operating profit to be up slightly. So with
the reduced cash flow coming into the business, that's really what's behind the reduction of $250 million
to $300 million on the share buybacks.

And then in terms of capital allocation, we also trimmed our CapEx plans for the year by $100 million, and
we remain committed to the single-A credit rating and to make all of that work after having leaned into it
with the restructuring as well as the acquisition of Softex. That's how we make all of that math work.

Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.

Christopher Michael Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So I just want to actually touch on the consumer tissue outlook for the back half of the year. It seems to
me that the kind of the important part to making the outlook work, but at the same time, you had noted,
that's an area that's been a little tougher to call. And I guess, I'm trying to understand maybe just a little
bit of the confidence around the normalization, which you had noted in your prepared remarks.

It seems to me that market share has really peaked during COVID, maybe some capacity benefits and that
you just -- you've seen some reversion in market share back to crossover levels. And so if you kind of run
it flat to 2, 3 years ago, it's sort of unchanged. And I guess what I'm getting at is just what exactly you
think is occurring in that business and just maybe specifically, the types of things that you're seeing that
give you confidence in this reacceleration in that business in the back half, which again to me seems to be
kind of the important factor in making the full year outlook work.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Yes, great question, Chris. And I'll try to unpack it and we can go back and forth on this a little bit.
First, let me just say, I remain very confident in our North American tissue business. And we've got great
brands performed very well last year. I do think we have given back some share this year. What happened
last year when the category spiked, and at this point last year, I think the category was up about 30% or
so. Consumers were looking for tissue and our customers were looking for tissue. And so our organization
really moved aggressively to try to serve our customers and consumers at a point where we felt like they
needed us the most. And so we really pulled out all the stops.

We probably did gain a little bit of share, particularly on a brand like Continental, where we had a little
more availability than maybe some of the other brands in the marketplace. And so it looks like to us, while
our share is down a bit this year, I do think it's kind of reverted maybe to the prior year levels to some
degree. And we'll continue to go forward and earn our share growth over time on that business. But we
feel like our brands are healthy, but we are navigating what I would say is like the most volatile part of the
demand curve that we experienced last year. So the front half is where all the spikes in demand.

And so there were really 2 effects: there was the spike in consumer demand and then there was a
corollary effect on retailer supply. And so maybe the 1 disconnect that you might not have visibility to
the data are the category in the quarter in North America, and I'm talking back tissue specifically, was
down 12% in consumption, okay? And then our shipments were down about 27%. And so the difference
between the 12% and the 27% is really, for us, we estimate as retailer inventory changes.

And what happened last year on the inventory side was, I think exiting Q1 where there was the big spike,
retailer inventories as a percent, if I index it to historical levels or 2019 levels, had dropped down to below
40% of what, I would say, the traditional turn inventory. And so retailers worked really hard to get back
in the supply. And so by the end of the year or toward the back half of the year, they were well north of
100% of overall levels. And so as we entered into this year, our estimate would be retailer inventories

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

were probably in the 130%, 140% range. And so that's dialed back in the first and second quarter this
year. And so it explains kind of a big chunk of the delta here on demand.

Looking forward, again, I'll stand by it. I mean, I looked at this category for a long time and it's one of
the biggest categories. Obviously, if you think about back tissue in particular, it's a very stable category.
And so the logic for me is in a post-COVID world, I think there will be more people at home on an ongoing
basis than there were pre-COVID. I don't think the office environment or the work environment is ever
going back to 100% every day. And so logic would say consumption should be a little higher than the base
level of '19.

Now year-to-date, we're below '19 levels for the category, but we think -- I would say logic would say
that, that should kind of normalize over time. And I won't estimate whether that's at what point. But over
the long term, this category has proven to be very stable. And our brands have proven very, very stable
and very healthy.

Maria G. Henry
Senior VP & CFO

The other comment that I'd add if I can...

Christopher Michael Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

No, please go ahead.

Maria G. Henry
Senior VP & CFO

Yes is, just -- you were asking specifically on consumer tissue, which certainly has a big first half, second
half effect. If I look overall first half, second half, in the first half, our organic sales are down 5% and our
operating profit is down 26%. If you take the midpoint of our ranges, you get to a second half that looks
something like plus 3% on organic and plus 5% on operating profit growth.

And so if you think about the -- our second half outlook and the key drivers there, we'll have easier
comps. We will have a step-up and benefit from volume growth and price realization in the second half.
The majority of the consumer tissue destock, we're assuming, occurred in the first half. We won't have the
winter storm effects that we had in the first half. KCP washroom is expected to continue to see sequential
improvements. The pricing actions are now fully in the market.

We'll see some build on our cost savings as we typically do. It's usually second half weighted and our
other manufacturing cost headwinds should be lower. And then offsetting that what will be the higher
commodity cost headwinds. If you take the $45 million year-to-date in our guidance, it implies year to go
is $765 million at the midpoint. So -- that's -- those are the drivers for the second half and certainly, the
dynamics in consumer tissue are a key part of that.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

All right, Christopher, we threw a lot at you and I threw a lot at you on tissue. I don't know if that
answered all your questions or I'm happy to take a follow-up.

Christopher Michael Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes, that was extremely helpful. The only quick follow-up would be just on the level of the inventory --
retail inventory in tissue as you entered Q3, given some percentages, where do you see it today? And then
if I might, I would just sneak in a question on how you're thinking about birth rates and medium-term
impact on volumes, and then I'll get back in the queue.

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

Yes, all right. And just -- I'm going to -- a disclaimer on my inventory, those are our estimates and so
that's kind of how we look at it and think about it. I would say, close to historical levels. The caveat I'll say
on, Chris, was we're not exactly sure and I'm not sure the retailer is exactly sure how they want to handle
it at this point, right? And so I think kind of given the category volatility and on a retailer-by-retailer basis
included, I think it's going to continue to bounce around a little bit, right?

And so because -- and the example I'll give you is we were building up the inventories, but there was
another spike kind of in the fall period and then the winter period as well. And so I do think consumers
largely understand that there is plenty of tissue availability. But that said, I've seen a lot of new things
over the last 18 months. And so we won't be surprised if behaviors continue to shift around a little bit. So
that's on the tissue side.

And the other part of it is, certainly, there was a consumer -- we think consumer pantry destocking as
well. I will tell you, the team in North America has done a phenomenal job conducting research to try to
estimate that. I will say it's probably as accurate as trying to estimate share from panel data, right? And
so you're asking consumers how much they're carrying. And so -- but we do believe consumers are taking
a lot of their stock out as they have more confidence that tissue is available, but that remains to be proven
out. So that's on the tissue.

And then on the birth rate. Yes, our estimate for this year, first of all, it's probably down about mid-single
-- low to mid-single digit. And that's probably a little worse than the last -- the prior 2 years. I think the
prior couple of years were down about 1% to 2% depending on the year. And then given COVID, I think it
feels like some families have decided to defer family formation and so kind of in that range.

I will say we feel really good about the recovery of our infant child care business and the fact that we're
really recovering from a supply perspective. Our brand propositions, we feel very strongly about. And so
we feel like in the third quarter, we should be back to being on track in our infant child care business. So...

Operator

Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

You did throw a lot at us on that consumer tissue conversation, but I guess I have just a clarification
coming out of the back and forth you just had with Chris and the commentary this morning. If -- I
guess, I'm still trying to ascertain whether you see a change in consumer takeaway expectations on the
balance of the year. Because what I read in the prepared remarks is that the consumer pantry and retailer
inventory rebalancing occurred faster than you previously assumed as it relates to 2Q. And you just kind
of reaffirmed that, but I didn't really hear anything about a net reduction in consumer takeaway. So I
guess, were you not assuming any rebalancing in the course of '21 before? It just happened in '21, where
you thought it would happen later downstream?

Or is there -- because I guess, I can understand the pull forward in the rebalancing for the first half
versus more spread out and not hurt 2Q, but there's still a net negative impact on the full year that I can't
pinpoint. So can you just help me there?

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes, there's a couple of different ways for me to answer that question. I'll say let me anchor it versus our
original plan, our plan expectations for tissue at the beginning of the year. We walked in the year and just
think back to December, Steve, where the vaccines were really not rolled out. And so our going-in was
that the category would be lower than 2020 overall, but in some ways, probably a mid-single-digit decline,
right? Because we thought at that point in time, consumers -- people would still be at home generally,
right?

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

Now coming out of that, and as we entered our April update, it's clear that the vaccines rolled out much
faster than anybody anticipated and mobility, the data that we track, show that we're returning to maybe
80% or 85% of historical levels. And so that was faster than we had anticipated. And so our expectations
for the category, I'd say, were down a little bit further.

I think coming out of the second quarter, I would say our category expectations, which were up about
22% in bath last year, probably, we would say, are going to be down at least in the mid-teens or so --
mid- to high teens. And so overall, I think our expectations for the category are going to be worse than
they were at the beginning of the year. That said, at that level, I would say that's still -- I still believe it
should be above a base year of 2019, right, if you take the 2 years together.

That remains to be seen. It feels like a kind of sticking my neck out there call on that just because of what
we experienced in the front half. But again, I'm working from logic that says there are likely to be more
people at home than there were in 2019. And if people are home more often, then the consumption of at-
home bath issue should be higher but that remains to be proven out.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. Okay. Okay, that helps. And I guess that segues into my next question, which you sound pretty
satisfied and happy and kind of upbeat with the trajectory of the Professional business, probably in part
because of that vaccination reopening trend. I guess -- so that resonates with me, but I guess I was
expecting a bit more just as it relates to 2Q, given the dynamics you said as an offset to consumer tissue.
And so just maybe a little bit more color as to how you see that business trending and kind of what your
expectations are in the back half.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes. On KCP, I wouldn't convey happy. I would say it's certainly proud of our team and how they respond
to all these challenges. I'm cautiously optimistic about where that category is, and I do see some green
shoots. I mean a couple of things kind of going on. Organic was up 2%, right, which is a sequential
improvement versus where we were -- we've been for these past several quarters. That was predicated on
really strong growth internationally, which had a really soft comp from a year ago.

But importantly, improvement in -- sequential improvement in the North American washroom business,
which is a big business for us and really, really important. I wouldn't say it's taken off yet, but we are
seeing the impact of more people returning to work, whether it's in the office environment or a factory
environment. And so I think that's -- those are all positives there.

There are some offsets because we did grow significantly in our wipers and PPE or safety business last
year due to additional COVID demand. That's probably cycling down a little bit this year and that's a bit
of an offset. So we feel good about the KCP business. I think the team, even throughout last year, was
working hard. I think somebody mentioned on the call last year around Jenn Air Dryer conversions, and
we've got better offerings in our washroom business, great tal product's, great dispenser products. And
so we are winning conversions. But I think I said on prior calls, we haven't seen the -- we won't see the
share until the products flow through the dispensers. So what we feel good about what the team is doing
and looking forward to -- I'm cautiously optimistic.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. If I could just, Maria, you've mentioned that $770 million or so at the midpoint of inflation to come
over the back half. Do you -- is there any, I guess, color you can offer in terms of how you see that flowing
3Q versus 4Q? If it's weighted significantly one versus the other or if it's more evenly spread? Just some
help with the cadence there would be helpful.

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

Yes. I think the expectations are that the commodities will reach peak in the third quarter and then start
to ease a bit as we get into the fourth quarter. So I've used that as the kind of phasing guidance.

Operator

Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.

Peter K. Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So you mentioned in your prepared remarks, and I was also pretty encouraged by the performance and
commentary around D&E. And so obviously, you have pockets of strength, pockets of weakness and
you mentioned strong share performance there. But I was just curious, has the consumer been more
resilient in those markets than you would have anticipated, kind of given the COVID environment? Or is
this strength really just Kimberly specific?

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Well, that's really hard for me to generalize because I think it varies. I think certainly, there's a lot of
markets that were less impacted by COVID, and I would say a lot of that is in Asia. Although I caution
when I say that because it's starting to pop up again now more significantly, particularly in market -- big
markets for us like Indonesia. So I think there is some aspect of resiliency.

But the other aspect is and maybe underlying is the strategy that we're on, which is to elevate the
category and expand our markets. And I think the teams have really concentrated, particularly in infant
and child care with the Huggies brand. Really great product offerings. I mean, I think the big thing that's
happened over the last, I would say, 2 years is, globally, our teams on diapers have really aligned around
kind of a set of consumer benefits that we're going to win on and really aligned on kind of the product
technology platforms that are global platforms that they're launching.

For reference, we're up 4 share points in Australia, New Zealand in diapers. We're already, obviously, the
market leaders there. But that diaper has specific lineage that's linked to our China diaper. I wouldn't
say they're identical, but they're highly related, right? And so that's kind of the work that we've been on.
We've taken share leadership positions in Argentina and Brazil. And again, the diaper there is related to
the diaper that we're making in North America. They're not twins, but they're related, right?

And so I think, again, the teams are really focused on, I would say -- made a shift from product features
to consumer benefits that we're focused on delivering. And I think that's really shown in the shares.
And again, I'd say in China, we were up about 3 share points in the quarter as we were last quarter. I've
mentioned 4 share points in Australia and New Zealand, 4 in Korea, 4 share points in Peru. So we're
seeing pretty broad-based share gains.

But we feel like they're earned. We're certainly not promoting our way to those share gains because we
don't really believe in renting share. I think it's basically great products, great digital execution and then
really hard sales execution and great partnership with customers.

Peter K. Grom
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

No. That's super helpful. And then I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions in regards to the
commentary on second half organic sales growth. So first, I just want to make sure I heard the comment
on volume growth correctly. Is that a total company comment or is that something specific to consumer
tissue? I thought total company, but I just wanted to be sure because I think Chris' question was on
consumer tissue. And then just like anything you can share on phasing of that 3% growth between Q3
versus Q4, given the cycling of the accrual true-up in Q4 would be really helpful.

Maria G. Henry
Senior VP & CFO

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

Sure. I was making the comments. I'm just bridging from the question on consumer tissue to the total
company because consumer tissue is certainly part of the story in the second half when we look at the
total company outlook. So to clarify, I was talking about total company in my remarks about first half,
second half.

And the phasing of the quarters, I'm going to stay away from quarterly guidance. Here, I think the
things to consider are the year-over-year comps. I did make some commentary around phasing on the
commodity headwinds. And beyond that, I think I'm going to stay away from the quarters.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So a couple of questions. I guess just I really want to focus in on tissue and pricing. You guys had
phenomenal price growth in the fourth quarter '20 in North American tissue. And I believe it was because
you had under-accrued or over-accrued -- excuse me, over-accrued for trade spend throughout the course
of the year and had the true-up. So we're lapping a period where you had over-accrued for trade spend,
suggesting that, well, I know list prices take time to get in, but I think I was expecting -- many of us were
expecting you to at least get some pricing benefit from lower trade.

Yet on a 2-year stack basis in North America, prices eroded. In developed markets outside of North
America, prices are deflationary. In developing and emerging markets, your prices are deflationary and
you just achieved the worst price/cost deficit that I can find on record.

So it begs the question of what's happening? What's really impeding your pricing power right now,
particularly in an environment where as you're saying, you'd expect demand to be above base case 2019?
Why aren't we seeing more responsiveness of sort of net price benefits flowing through the P&L?

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I will start, Jason. So Part 1 is we have announced pricing in consumer tissue in many markets, in
most of our tissue markets around the world, including in North America. I wouldn't say we've taken it
across every product line. And so Scott 1000 is kind of a key product that we have. And so that's one
area.

Certainly, we did benefit, as you mentioned, from accrual differences at the end of last year. And the other
thing that we benefited throughout last year was given the amount of demand in the marketplace, we
reduced our promotional spending overall, right? And so we kind of earned maybe the same or higher
volume levels without having to spend the trade. So that was a benefit last year that we are cycling this
year, and so we are putting some investment back in trade.

For reference, I would say, the category promotional intensity in a market like North America, still below
historical levels but moving its way back to what I would say are more normalized levels, and so we
recognize the need to do that. The thing that I will tell you is I think your point is on, which is we've got
to get better price realization. I will say we don't necessarily view the additional spending of trade to be
a negative profit driver in the sense of, we've invested in a lot of tools and revenue management, and we
expect our teams to be able to use those tools to drive volume and growth profitably. And so we're going
to hold ourselves accountable to that.

But with that, again, we recognize the need to get additional price realization, and there's many ways
for us to do that in addition to the list pricing that we've taken. And there's also ways for us to do that
through revenue management, through trade efficiency, price pack and other things that we'll continue to
look at. I don't know, Maria, if you have anything...

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

Yes, that's right.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. So there's other mechanisms, we're just not going to see them yet. They're going to take time
to see. Last time, we had inflation in tissue, you guys ran a price/cost deficit for 8 consecutive quarters
before you flipped positive. Is there any reason to think that you could close the gap faster? Or given
the environment that you're mentioning with promotional activity actually picking up in the face of rising
costs, could it actually even be more prolonged this time?

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Well, again, I think we've actioned generally our pricing in the marketplace. And so I would think that,
hopefully, the duration of that gap would be shorter. Certainly, we didn't like the gap through the first half
of this year. And so that's one part. Second, again, we're going to continue to review kind of all the levers
that we have on revenue management and make sure that we make the appropriate adjustments to our
plans on a market-by-market basis.

Operator

Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.

Andrea Faria Teixeira
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So I wanted to go back to pricing, I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here. But what is your read on the
consumer elasticity, not only in the U.S. but also internationally as you obviously compete with players
that oftentimes are private? But specific to the U.S., the dollar share that we're looking not only in tissue,
in track channels, as you explained well through Chris' question before, but also in diapers, are you seeing
that the same decline across all channels?

And is that an indication that consumers are probably down-trading now, that they see private label, for
example, Scott 100 (sic) [ Scott 1000 ] is the one that competes more neck to neck with private label?
So are you seeing any issue there or perhaps you're going to tweak a little bit of your price increase now
that you know what you know about tissue, and then perhaps do more GM where you barbell a little bit
of these price increases? So any update on -- embedded in your guidance, if you were changing some of
your pricing or any second rounds in North America that we may not be aware or you embedded in there?
So any color there would be great.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Great question, Andrea. Maybe the short answer for me is I don't know yet. I think for reference, we
took about a high single-digit price increase across our personal care businesses and then some selective
price increases, for example, on Scott tissue in North America. And I would say those went into effect at
the end of June. And so it's a little early for us to gauge that.

If I go off the history though, I will say the last list price increase we took on these businesses actually in
personal care was not listed, it was more count, okay? But that said, I would say the consumer elasticity
at that point back in 2018 was probably, in my mind, a little lower than what we modeled in terms of
elasticity. So what that implies, I think there's a couple of different factors. If I would say, more price
sensitive factors would be that I think consumers are facing broader inflation in this environment across all
categories, right, beyond consumer packaged goods. So that may be one factor, right, that makes it a little
more challenging.

The other factor that I know talking to people in other industries is there have been reductions in other
spending, consumer spending, which create a little more wallet for some of the more consumables, and so

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

that's an offset. So for me, the answer is at this point, a little theoretical ambiguous. And so it remains to
be seen, but we'll know as we work through this quarter.

Andrea Faria Teixeira
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And no, that's super helpful for tissue. And in diapers, like I felt that you don't have as much of this
channel stuffing that we saw, even I'm assuming retail inventory. I think you spoke mostly from a
consumer tissue perspective and not so much on the diaper. So what is happening there? Do you see that
changing also, the elasticities moving around as a moving target for you?

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Again, I don't see significant change, but again, it's still early for us to tell. Yes, I think you're right,
Andrea, the dynamics in personal care were very different than tissue last year. And so there was a bit of
a, I would say, consumer buy-in in the first quarter last year, but it was, I would say, a mid-single-digit
kind of number, maybe mid- to high single digit, whereas the first quarter last year, consumer tissue was
like up 30%. And so very, very different behavior.

And then we unwound that, almost all of that in Q2 of last year. And so I think the consumer -- the
personal care North America behavior has perhaps been a little bit normalized. And again, I think the
same thing holds from what I was talking about tissue, which is our pricing has been kind of in the market
for about 3 weeks now. It's a little bit earlier for us to get a read. But again, I think we feel cautiously
optimistic about it.

Operator

Next, we have a follow-up from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I was taken offguard. Wanted to ask about, let me just find my follow-up question, just the category
growth in personal care in D&E markets. I know you talked a bit about -- very much so about market
share gains. But one of the things that's definitely been out there like the resilience of some of the
categories in D&E markets. So just anything you can offer in terms of perspective on why the categories
have kind of held in as well as they have because even, again, with your share growth, it still implies the
categories are in a pretty good spot, too.

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And maybe I'll go around the horn because it varies so much because of a couple of things, one
-- probably the biggest one being COVID. I would say we were really positively encouraged by our
performance across Latin America. I thought it was terrific performance in a really, really challenging
COVID environment. I'm sure you're kind of reading all about it. But I mean, in a market like Brazil, our
personal care organic was up over 20% behind volume and price, and we did take pretty significant pricing
actions there.

Overall, we maintain our share there. We're already in the leadership position. And I think what's
happening in Latin America broadly and why we're winning is the team is doing an excellent job adding
value by premiumizing the category but also pivoting, in some ways, back and forth, even within the same
year between value and premium. So the big thing is we have very strong leadership positions throughout
Latin America. For example, in Argentina, we're the leaders in value tier and we're the leaders in premium
tier, and we're the #1 brand overall.

And so the team, depending on kind of what's happening in the local environment, kind of makes the pivot
as to what products they're going to maybe drive and emphasize a little harder. And certainly, I think in
Latin America, maybe this year more than maybe even 2 years ago, value is very important. Consumers

KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2021

are stretching out their consumption. But we flow through a lot of our great product innovation to our
value tier as well. And I think that's working. So that's kind of one set of things.

I would say China is different. Lauren, we're up 3 share points in the quarter. We're proud, at least
for now, we're in the #1 share position, which we feel great about and we feel really great about our
products. And so I think the consumer continues to really respond to product superiority and innovation.
I will say the category conditions are pressurized because I don't know how much you're seeing, but the
birth rates are coming down fairly significantly. And so we recognize that's going to be an issue for us to
work through. But in the near term, our team feels great about their ability to grow the business, to grow
share and work with the big e-commerce partners.

And then in some of the other markets, Eastern Europe, I mean, I think we are multiple share points up in
almost every market across Eastern Europe, somewhere in the 1 to 7 points of share in the quarter. And
again, I think great offering. They're all related. The China diaper, the U.S. diaper, the Brazil, they're kind
of all related to each other and very good. And I think the teams are recognizing how to drive those. So I
think it varies.

The one watch-out area that we're very kind of paying close attention to because of COVID is ASEAN,
Indonesia, Vietnam, India as well. Again, those environments right now are really pressured with the
pandemic. And so we're really keeping a close eye on that. So I don't know if I answered what you were
looking for, if there's something else.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. No, absolutely. I really appreciate it.

Operator

Next, we have a follow-up from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Super quick follow-up question, real tactical on your response to Lauren there. I think you said China
growth for you on personal care was up maybe mid-single digits, but you just said you captured 300 basis
points of share in the quarter. It implies a pretty sharp market decline in the market. So can you drill
down a little bit deeper there, like what is the rate of decline you're seeing? And I think you mentioned
birth rates down and you exactly know when the birth rate is down, that has a prolonged drag on infant
population. So is what we're seeing today likely to persist for a protracted period of time?

Michael D. Hsu
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Sorry, my bad. I was a little unclear. China overall, personal care was up mid-single digit. Our diaper
business was up double digits. But that said, I think your question still holds. Yes, there are expected to be
some birth rate challenges in China, so it will slow down as a market. I still believe, and I think our team
believes, there's still significant opportunity to premiumize our categories and we're still a low double-digit
share. And so there's still plenty of share opportunity. That said, I do think there will be a slowdown on the
diaper side of the business.

Our femcare business has been growing strong double digits. In the quarter, it was down a bit because
we were cycling a promotion, a big promotion that we've decided to get out of this year. And so -- but we
feel great about our femcare business. That's grown strong double digits for, I think, 3 or 4 years in a row
now. And so we expect continued growth in China, although I think on the diaper side, the category will be
challenged somewhat.

It also kind of points out our emphasis on diversifying our growth across developing and emerging
markets. So one of the things I'm excited about, Jason, is I think we grew significantly in India. I don't
know if I could -- I think 50% -- well, strong double digits in the quarter.

And I would say, Indonesia, I'm really glad we made the acquisition of Softex. It's a great business. I think
the business is up in the teens. Even though they are cycling or working through some pretty good COVID
challenges -- pretty significant COVID challenges, but it's a great business and a great team. And again,
with Indonesia and India, I think the growth in those markets is going to be very significant for us over
the next several years.

There are no more questions at this time.

Michael D. Hsu

environment, but we're taking decisive action and we're continuing to improve our brand fundamentals to
sustain long-term sustainable growth. All right. So for that, thank you.
