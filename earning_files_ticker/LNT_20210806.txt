ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning and welcome to Alliant Energy's Conference Call for Second Quarter 2021 Results. This call
is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Zac Fields, Lead Investor Relations Analyst at Alliant
Energy.

Zac Fields

Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We
appreciate your participation. Joining me on this call are John Larsen, Chair, President and CEO; and
Robert Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO.

Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment
community.

We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's second quarter 2021 financial results.
This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the
Investors page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com.

Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your
questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that
could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed
in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. In addition, this
presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP
and GAAP measures is provided in the earnings release and our 10-Q, which are available on our website.

At this point, I'll turn the call over to John.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Zac. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We completed another solid quarter with
strong operational and financial results. I'll share with you the highlights from the quarter and then turn it
over to Robert to recap key regulatory, customer and financial results.

I'll start with a focus on our strong ESG story. We recently issued our 2021 Corporate Responsibility
Report. This year's update showcases many examples of our environmental stewardship, governance and
our long-standing efforts to address the important social needs of the communities we proudly serve. I'll
start with the end in mind as no clean energy story is complete without results.

First off, in 2020, we achieved a 42% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 2005 levels with a clear
path toward our goal of 50% reduction by 2030. We also reduced water usage by 66% in 2020, well on
our way to a 75% reduction by 2030. And we've already met or exceeded our ambitious NOx, SOx and
mercury emission goals. Looking forward, our aspiration is to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions
from the electricity we generate by 2050.

We've been reducing our carbon footprint for many years, transitioning from older and less efficient coal
units to low-cost and efficient generation resources like wind, natural gas and solar. These resources
continue to be low-cost options in our service territory, making them a smart choice to serve our
customers well into the future. We're building on our successful wind energy expansion that includes
our excellent track record of project execution as we turn toward expanding our solar energy profile.
A balanced generation profile of efficient natural gas, wind, solar and battery storage will serve as the
backbone for delivering safe, reliable, affordable and resilient energy to our customers.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2021

We recently announced that our first 675 megawatts of new solar in Wisconsin is advancing to the
construction phase after receiving approval from the Public Service Commission. Robert will share more
details on these projects as well as our efforts to expand our solar energy footprint in Iowa a bit later in
the call.

You've heard us talk about our Clean Energy Blueprint, designed to guide us toward a clean energy future.
Our blueprint is comprehensive, going beyond generation to also ensure a clean, efficient and resilient
energy grid. We're adding smart technologies to our grid, transitioning our electric lines from overhead to
underground and expanding the use of energy storage. Our blueprint is designed to ensure resiliency and
reliability of our grid, reduce customer costs and allow for more distributed renewable generation on our
grid.

For example, we recently were joined by Iowa's Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg along with several local
and state leaders and our partners at the ribbon-cutting event for our latest battery storage project in
Decorah, Iowa. We're very excited to continue expanding battery storage solutions. Not only do these
projects have a future on our system as dispatchable load, but they can also serve to enable distributed
energy resources and support the resiliency of our distribution system.

Speaking of resiliency, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the derecho that devastated our Iowa
service territory, I'm reminded of the resiliency of our customers and employees as we recovered from the
largest storm in our company's history. It's one of the reasons I'm also excited about our commitment to
plant 1 million trees, representing the customers we're so privileged to serve. As these trees grow, they'll
capture CO2 out of the atmosphere and help rebuild the tree canopy lost in the storm across so many
Iowa communities.

I mentioned earlier our focus on ESG. One of our newest social efforts is investing in the Energy Impact
Partners' Elevate Future Fund, which aims to create a more diverse founder community within the broader
energy transition. The fund will be focused on investing in companies founded or run by diverse leaders
that are driving innovation and advancing the low-carbon economy, including supply decarbonization,
electrification and technology-enabled infrastructure. The Elevate team will form partnerships with
technology accelerators and universities, including historically black colleges to nurture talent, promote
infrastructure and support systems to retain talent from underrepresented groups.

We're excited about the promising opportunities this partnership creates for inclusiveness, locally and
nationally. And we appreciate the opportunities to support innovative ways to build a more diverse and
inclusive workforce that advances our collective efforts for creating a carbon-free future.

Before I turn the call over to Robert, I want to share that the accomplishments that I highlighted today are
the direct results of the efforts of our talented employees who work each and every day to deliver on our
purpose: to serve customers and build stronger communities. Their efforts over the past year are nothing
short of amazing, and I want to take the opportunity today to thank them for all that they do.

Thank you for your continued interest in Alliant Energy. I'll turn the call over to Robert.

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings
of $0.57 per share compared to $0.54 per share in 2020. Our utility earnings increased year-over-
year driven by higher margins from increasing rate base and warmer temperatures. These increases in
earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower allowance for funds used during
construction from rate base additions in 2020.

With a very solid first half of the year now in the books, we are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance
range of $2.50 to $2.64 per share. And as a result of favorable margins from temperature impacts year-
to-date as well as our continued success in managing costs, we are currently trending towards the upper
half of our guidance range.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2021

Contributing to the higher margins was a higher rate base at our Iowa utility related to the successful
completion of our 1,000-megawatt wind expansion program in 2020, which has resulted in lower fuel
costs and increased tax credits for our Iowa customers. Additionally, our Iowa utility began recovering
earlier this year, a return of and a return on the $110 million payment made to NextEra to terminate the
Purchase Power Agreement with the Duane Arnold nuclear facility 5 years early. Customers in Iowa began
benefiting from lower energy costs related to this transaction last fall.

In Wisconsin, higher margins are attributable to the rate stabilization plan that was approved last year.
Based with the unexpected challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we work collaboratively
with our stakeholders to keep rates flat for customers in 2021. This approach is benefiting both our
customers as well as our shareowners as we began recovery of previously approved projects, such as our
Kossuth Wind Farm and the Western Wisconsin pipeline, which we offset with excess deferred income tax
benefits and fuel savings.

The second quarter continued the trend of improving economic conditions as our service territories return
to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales in the second
quarter were up 4% versus the second quarter last year. This increase was largely from strength in
commercial and industrial sales. These changes in sales are a positive sign of economic recovery and
resulted in a positive impact to margin.

As economic conditions have improved, we've also seen an uptick in economic development in our service
territory. Two noteworthy successes so far this year are the announcements of new facilities for Simmons
Pet Food in our Iowa jurisdiction and Spray-Tek in our Wisconsin jurisdiction. These two new customers
are bringing new jobs into communities in our service territories in addition to new load for Alliant Energy.

Many of you joined us a few weeks ago at our ESG investor event. I hope you took away from our
comments how passionate we are about our leadership position in the transition to cleaner energy and
other important aspects of our ESG performance.

One key area of the ESG story is our commitment to focus on customer affordability. That begins with the
efforts and innovations of our outstanding employees. Two such innovations include our planned tax equity
partnerships for solar generation and the levelized cost recovery mechanism for our retiring Edgewater
coal plant in Wisconsin. Both of these were brought to us through the research and hard work of our
employees who are consistently looking for new and unique ways to keep customer costs low.

Let me spend a moment on our corporate tax rate, which are provided on Slide 4 of our supplemental
slides. We estimate our full year 2021 effective tax rate will be negative 17%, which is primarily the result
of production tax credits we earned from our expansion of wind generation and the excess deferred tax
benefits from the 2017 federal tax reform, which we continue to return to our customers. Both of these
items support affordable rates for our customers. And please note that these items are largely earnings-
neutral as they lower both revenues and income tax expense.

Our financing plans for 2021 remain unchanged. We plan to issue up to $300 million of long-term debt for
our Wisconsin utility later this year. And we're also on track to issue approximately $25 million of common
equity through our Shareowner Direct Plan in 2021.

Moving to our key regulatory initiatives. We are pleased that our strong collaboration with stakeholders
resulted in a settlement agreement in the second quarter for the 2022 and 2023 revenue requirements
in our Wisconsin rate review. The agreement includes maintaining 10% return on equity, achieving
an effective regulatory equity layer of 54%, and utilizing an innovative recovery mechanism for WPL's
retiring Edgewater coal plant. The settlement is now subject to review and approval by the PSCW, and we
anticipate a decision on this filing later this year. More details on the terms of the settlement agreement
can be found on Slide 6.

As John mentioned earlier, we received written approval from the PSCW in June for 675 megawatts of new
solar generation in Wisconsin. This is a significant milestone in our clean energy transition and another
example of our long track record of achieving constructive regulatory outcomes. We also filed our second

Certificate of Authority application for an additional 414 megawatts of Wisconsin solar in March. We
anticipate a decision from the PSCW on this filing in the first half of next year.

Later this quarter, we plan to file a request for advanced ratemaking principles for up to 400 megawatts of
new solar projects in Iowa. The advanced ratemaking principles process in Iowa includes approval of the
return on equity for the life of the asset, depreciation rates and cost caps for the projects. We anticipate a
decision from the Iowa Utility Board on this filing by the middle of next year.

Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Alliant Energy. We look forward to connecting with
many of you over the coming months.
Now I'll ask the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We can now take the first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of
America.

Dariusz Lozny
BofA Securities, Research Division

It's Dariusz on for Julien. I just wanted to ask about your comments about the upper half of the '21 guided
range. Just wanted to maybe talk through some of the puts and takes as far as how you're looking at Q3
and 4 relative to how you're tracking for the first half of the year compared to 2020. If you could maybe
just talk about some of the moving parts there. And additionally, is there any July weather effect built into
that assumption as well?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. You bet. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the July part. Not really any notable impact on
the July front. So we did track weather and some favorable O&M or costs, if you will, in the first half. So it
has us currently tracking towards the upper half.

We're expecting a fairly normal second half of the year. There's always a number of things that can come
into play. But with those things in consideration, that's why we've noted the upper half that we're currently
tracking. So I'll see -- Robert, anything else you'd like to add?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Just maybe to quantify the impacts. So through the first half of the year, the weather impacts on our
sales -- or temperature impacts on our sales are about $0.05 to $0.06 positive. And so that's what's really
pushing us to that upper half of the range.

Dariusz Lozny
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And if I can also ask one more about -- I know in the past, you've spoken
about some potential future undergrounding efforts for some of your distribution lines. Was curious when
we might hear more about that as far as specific investment amount, as far as rolled forward CapEx plan
or anything along those lines, if you can speak to that at all.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Certainly. We would expect to roll forward CapEx as we get to EEI. So you'll see more at that time
along with some other items that we typically share, dividend and others financing toward that time of the
year.

We've been working the overhead to underground now and getting more and more efficient at that. So
we've got, certainly, a lot more opportunity. We'll share more of the specifics a bit later in the year, as I
noted. But we're -- we really are moving towards that path quite aggressively, and we'll share more about
how that plays into future CapEx when we get towards the EEI later in the year.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We can now take the next question from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2021

First question, just wanted to ask on -- just could you guys remind us where you stand on credit metrics
and how much capacity there is there as you potentially take up CapEx over time?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Michael, this is Robert. So you should think of us as -- right now, when you think about 2021, we're
probably lower in a range of credit metrics largely because we're refunding a lot of tax reform benefits
back to our customers in this time frame. That's scheduled to sunset towards the end of this year into
2022. And so we're expecting over time those credit metrics to improve when we go through '23, '24 time
frame. So feel well positioned to maintain our current credit ratings. And if anything, I see some optimism
as far as increasing credit metrics over time, largely because of the cash flow improvements that we see in
the future.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. But any just like number specifics in terms of like FFO to debt?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Think of us right now in the mid-teens for the most part. Like I said, a lot of that will be improving
over time as we get into '23 and '24, even until the latter part of '22. So like I said, we feel well positioned
for where we're at with our credit metrics and credit ratings currently and improving environment going
forward. But think of us in the mid-teens now with things getting better over time.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. And then also, just any color on what you guys are seeing in terms of inflationary pressures,
particularly with some of the solar development that you're doing?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Thanks, Michael. John here. You certainly have seen some cost increase. A lot of those commodities
are levelizing a bit, or some of them are, but we've seen that and weaved to our estimates. So we do see
some additional cost for the solar going forward.

The projects we have that we've filed for with our first CA in Wisconsin, and we expect others, are very
low cost. So they are very, very competitive costs even with these increases. And of course, they provide
significant benefits for our customers over time. So well positioned, a lot of flexibility in our plan, but we
have seen some increases on commodities, as I'm sure most of our peers have as well.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. And just last one real quick. I could have missed it in the prepared remarks, but are you guys
reaffirming the 5% to 7% long term?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

It wasn't specifically in our remarks, but we are. So we've identified the 5% to 7% over the long term, I
think through this point, maybe through 2023, and we'll refresh that when we get through the November
EEI conference. So that's our normal protocol as we usually add another year into the process when we
provide additional CapEx for another year and rate base for another year to support that.
