CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 CBRE Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kristyn Farahmand, Vice President, Investor Relations and
Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.

Kristyn Farahmand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Finance

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier
today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and it is posted on the Investor
Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow
along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results
for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our
third quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we'll open up the call for your questions.

Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve
a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding
CBRE's future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration,
financial performance, including profitability and margins, the effect of cost savings initiatives and our
2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not
historical fact.

We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the
information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that
these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors may affect us in the future and
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.
For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements,
please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.

We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-
GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures,
together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of our presentation slide deck.

Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter
of 2020.

Total revenue and fee revenue fell about 5% and 13%, respectively, driven by a decline in our Advisory
Services segment. Lower revenue was partially offset by disciplined cost management and temporary cost
reduction as well as the initial benefits of transformation initiatives targeted to improve the ongoing cost
structure of the business. This limited the adjusted EBITDA decline to 3%. Overall, adjusted EPS for the
quarter was $0.73, while GAAP EPS, which includes around $0.13 of transformation initiative costs, totaled
$0.55.

Now for insights on the quarter and our longer-term outlook, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over
to Bob.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. The results we reported this morning highlight the progress
CBRE has made in building a more resilient business since the last downturn occurred more than a decade
ago. We are a remarkably different company from the one that endured the global financial crisis. I'll
briefly cite some specific ways the company has evolved and improved.

Facilities Management, which provides steady recurring revenue, has grown exponentially, with the
portfolio up by 3.7 billion square feet in 10 years and now totaling 4.2 billion square feet. And we have
added a data center management capability that is growing robustly.

Our industrial and multifamily offerings have also grown dramatically and are proving to be very resilient
in the current environment. These offerings together cut across leasing, sales and mortgage origination
and servicing. They also comprise the majority of our Real Estate development portfolio.

U.S. Project Management has grown fivefold in 10 years, and COVID is further catalyzing demand for this
group's specialized services.

Finally, our Investment Management business' core asset portfolio, which has grown more than 300%
over 10 years and now comprises nearly 85% of total AUM, has held up quite well this year. The resilient
aspects of our business are helping us weather the sharp COVID-driven fall in property leasing and sales.

Another key contributor was quickly aligning our expenses with reduced market demand. A significant
portion of our compensation structure falls automatically in the current environment, and our global
leadership team has rapidly implemented other cost management actions. Many of these actions were
contemplated before COVID following a strategic review designed to enhance scalability and efficiency.
This work has been quite effective, cutting where appropriate without compromising our future.

I want to briefly comment on the macro environment before handing the call to Leah.

At the present time, COVID is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger
opportunities in other parts, several of which I highlighted earlier. Inevitably, the magnitude of COVID's
impact will diminish considerably once the public health crisis passes. We can expect our sales and leasing
businesses, where decision-making is now largely frozen, to be prime beneficiaries.

However, a significant amount of the COVID-driven change will be permanent. For instance, our work
with occupier clients confirms that companies will continue moving toward a hybrid model that combines
working from the office and from home. Occupiers will take space for fewer employees but that space will
be less densely populated, more intensely managed and more flexible. There will be a premium on high-
quality, well-managed buildings with great infrastructure.

We are continuing to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends that were driven by the last
cycle, including occupier outsourcing, industrial and logistics space, institutional quality multifamily assets
and workplace experience services. We expect new secular opportunities to be created in the wake of
COVID and are positioning our strategy and leadership focus and allocating our capital to make the most
of them as the new cycle unfolds.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the quarter in detail.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell
over 23% and nearly 32%, respectively, reflecting weakness in high-margin sales and leasing activities
that Bob alluded to.

While our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell about 180 basis points year-over-year, it improved
sequentially approximately 560 basis points to about 15.5%. This sequential improvement was due to the
combined impact of short-term cost reductions, including continued furloughs, lower bonus accruals and
tight management of travel and entertainment expenses as well as the initial impacts of transformation
and workforce optimization efforts. Additionally, about 190 basis points of the sequential improvement was
due to the cadence of COVID-related items.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Global leasing revenue declined about 31%, as the pandemic continued to negatively impact our major
global markets. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which together comprised about 81% of
global leasing in the period, revenue decreased 36%, 22% and 6%, respectively. The U.K. benefited from
some large industrial transactions during the quarter, which helped to offset weak demand for office space.
Globally, industrial leasing fueled by the continued shift to e-commerce increased 10% in Q3 and 8% year-
to-date.

Advisory sales improved sequentially, falling 34% year-over-year in Q3 versus 48% in Q2. All 3 regions
saw sequential improvement, paced by Continental Europe, where advisory sales revenue fell just 7% in
Q3 compared with 26% in Q2.

In the U.S., we added 280 basis points to our market share according to RCA, as investors seek out the
best device and execution in a challenging market. Given the high level of institutional dry powder and
continued low interest rates, investor demand for quality real estate assets with strong rent rolls and
creditworthy tenants remain solid despite the pandemic.

Commercial mortgage revenue fell 21% in the quarter. The lending environment improved marginally
from the second quarter, but lenders remained quite conservative in their underwriting standards, which
weighed on volumes.

Notably, multifamily volumes rebounded sequentially during the quarter, and by September, exceeded the
prior year level. Refinancing activity comprised 60% of our year-to-date originations, up from the typical
40% to 50% range.

Our other Advisory Services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Valuation
revenue fell about 10%, in line with the last quarter, while Advisory Property and Project Management and
loan servicing each saw fee revenue growth of over 2%.

Lower growth in Loan Servicing was the result of lower loan prepayment fees. Excluding prepayment fees,
our servicing revenue would have grown at a low double-digit clip, consistent with previous quarters. The
loan servicing portfolio grew 13% over the prior year period and 3% sequentially to nearly $253 billion.
Forbearance requests also continued to be immaterial for this business.

Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions business increased fee revenue nearly 6%, as 9%
growth in Facilities Management and 13% growth in Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS
transaction revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nearly 480 basis points to nearly 17% despite
the loss of high-margin transaction revenue, and this was our second consecutive quarter of record
profitability.

This strong improvement in profitability was partially driven by temporary measures primarily associated
with lower discretionary spending and bonus accruals, long-term cost efficiency initiatives and about $12
million in expenses in the prior year period that did not recur.

Structural changes to the cost structure contribute a -- contributed about 1/3 of the margin improvement.
We also expect to drive gradual long-term improvements in profitability as our client relationships expand
and mature. Long-tenured satisfied clients typically expand their scope of service and engage us to
support their project and transaction management needs.

While our margins are improving and our new business pipeline is strong, we continue to feel the effects
of pandemic-related delays in securing and onboarding new GWS clients. Several large contract decisions
slipped from Q3 to Q4, while others are temporarily on hold. As a result, we continue to expect top line
growth to be more muted than we would typically expect in a more normal recessionary environment.

Turning to Slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investments segment, where we achieved $65
million of adjusted EBITDA, a $51 million increase from the prior year period. Development was the
standout performer, with adjusted EBITDA rising to approximately $50 million, reflecting a large number
of asset sales and a small contribution from the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired
last October. We are benefiting from positioning our portfolio to meet elevated demand for multifamily,
industrial and health care assets.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

In fact, these 3 property types, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise over 80% of
our in-process activity. Because of this and our sizable pipeline, we expect our development business will
remain resilient moving forward.

Our investment management business also had an impressive quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose over 12%,
and importantly, adjusted EBITDA from recurring sources increased nearly 70%. This reflected continued
strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at $114.5 billion and more than
offset a lower contribution from carried interest revenue and co-investment returns.

Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of nearly $10 million was slightly higher than in the last quarter.
Hana's results continue to be impacted by lower-than-anticipated occupancy as a result of the pandemic
as well as costs associated with expanding our enterprise-focused, flexible space solutions.

Turning to Slide 11. Given COVID-19's uncertain trajectory and adverse economic impact, we will again
refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, but we'll provide an update on our expectations for the full
year and fourth quarter.

In advisory, we are taking a conservative view of transaction activity in Q4. Transaction revenue has
performed better than expected during this crisis, which is partially driven by the transaction size and
geographic diversification embedded in our business.

In the U.S., deals less than $250,000, which comprise over half of total transaction revenue declined about
26% year-to-date versus 40% decrease from transactions over $2 million. We anticipate a similar benefit
of this diversification in our Q4 results but also expect the transaction business to recover more gradually.
We expect sales and leasing revenue together to be down approximately 30% to 40% in Q4, in line with
the trends we saw in the second and third quarters, with the Americas slightly lagging other parts of the
world.

For the rest of the advisory business combined, we foresee a mid-single-digit revenue decline in the
fourth quarter. This reflects the expectation that Q4 will be our highest revenue-generating quarter as it
usually is. Given this uptick in revenue and our continued focus on cost management, we expect advisory
adjusted EBITDA fee margin to continue expanding by around 2% compared with Q3.

Moving to GWS. We now believe growth in fee revenue will rise in the mid-single-digit range for the
year, with growth in contractual Facilities Management and Project Management revenue offsetting
continued weakness in GWS transaction. This marginally lower-than-normal growth expectation reflects
our view that the pandemic-related delays I mentioned earlier will improve more slowly than we previously
expected.

At the same time, we expect double-digit full year adjusted EBITDA growth, reflecting the benefit of
stronger-than-expected Q3 performance and the continuation of our cost management efforts into Q4. We
expect margin expansion will be slower sequentially as the benefit of temporary cost actions dissipate.

Looking at REI, our Global Investment Management and development business lines are well positioned
for the current environment, and we foresee more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In
Investment Management, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA will grow in the high teens range from the $91
million achieved last year.

We now expect growth in recurring EBITDA stemming from our growing AUM to be complemented by
higher expectations for incentive fees and carried interest than we previously anticipated. We now project
U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to exceed the more than $100 million generated in 2019. Demand for
quality assets has been stronger than we previously anticipated, and we now expect to complete more
asset sales before year end.

We again expect sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from U.K. multifamily development in Q4. The
pace of improvement since the peak of the pandemic has exceeded our expectations, and we now expect
a small but positive EBITDA contribution from U.K. multifamily development for the full year. This is an
improvement from the breakeven performance we expected previously.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

And finally, our expectations for Hana remain consistent with our previous outlook, with an adjusted
EBITDA loss of around $35 million to $40 million for 2020, which is marginally higher than the loss
incurred in 2019.

Turning to Slide 12. We've continued to fortify our financial position throughout the COVID-19 crisis. On
a run rate basis, we have lowered our expense structure by nearly $200 million. We expect to realize
about $120 million of this in 2020 and approximately $80 million in 2021. We primarily achieved these
reductions by making structural changes in the design of our workforce while also focusing on rightsizing
our cost base and teams to meet future demand.

In addition, our liquidity has increased by almost $1 billion from a year ago period to $4.2 billion, and we
ended Q3 with just 0.2 turns of leverage, down over 0.4 turns from a year ago. This improvement reflects
the long-term strategic work we initiated well before the pandemic to drive improvements in profitability
and cash flow conversion.

Given that we've been able to strengthen our financial position meaningfully at the depth of the COVID-19
crisis, we're highly confident we have ample capacity to withstand future challenges while simultaneously
deploying discretionary capital.

As Bob highlighted at the outset of the call, we strongly believe there will be parts of our business that
will benefit from COVID-driven secular trends as well as portions that are likely to be adversely impacted.
We plan to focus our discretionary capital deployment on areas where we believe the crisis is likely to
accelerate demand.

At the moment, we are deploying capital for internal investments and actively evaluating a steadily
increasing M&A pipeline as we begin to see strategic opportunities. This means we will prioritize internal
investments and M&A rather than share repurchases. We want to ensure we are using our liquidity and
financial capacity to enhance the revenue and profitability growth trajectory of our business as well as the
resiliency of our business over the long run while also recognizing that the cost actions we've taken this
year have impacted our people. As we've said before, once the time is appropriate, if we are unable to
identify suitable and properly valued acquisition opportunities, we will then consider share repurchases.

While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're more confident than ever that our business and
our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID but to build on
our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings and cash flow growth.

With that, please turn to Slide 13, and I'll turn the call back to Bob.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Leah. Before we take your questions, I want to briefly acknowledge our CBRE employees. Their
hard work and strong focus on our clients are truly distinguishing our company at a time of significant
challenges stemming from the public health crisis. These challenges have also brought us closer together
as a company.

The $6.1 million we raised from our people and the company for the CBRE Employee Resilience Fund has
enabled us to provide more than 9,000 grants to our colleagues who are facing financial hardship. We are
pleased to help make their lives a little easier during this stressful time.
Now operator, we'll take questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just wanted to sort follow up on a couple of things. Leah, the $55 million in expenses that you talked
about, these transformation initiatives, I just wanted to get a little bit more understanding how much of
that was to benefit the current quarter. And how much of that is really kind of longer-term kind of benefits
to the company? And how do we sort of measure or see those benefits going forward?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, Steve. The $55 million was onetime costs that we recognized in the quarter attributable to the
separation and other expenses related to the transformation. Those will, in combination with workforce
actions that we took in the second quarter, will amount to about $200 million of run rate savings. A little
more than half of that, we'll benefit from this year, and the rest will commence in 2021.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And then I know you can't be too specific about the M&A activity. But I guess I'm just trying to get a little
bit better feel for the areas, maybe if you think about your 3 divisions, where you're more likely to deploy
capital or maybe where you're more likely to see opportunities arise or maybe where you're seeing more
opportunities today.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Steve, this is Bob. We've gone through our business pretty carefully in the past year, is subject to a
very thorough strategy update that we did, and we've identified areas of our business that we think either
we're well positioned to grow disproportionately in or there will be secular tailwinds. And we're targeting
those areas of our business for M&A activity.

Now we'll do M&A activity in other areas if we think we can get a particularly good deal or if we think
we have holes in our geographic coverage, things of that nature, an ability to add to our capability for
our clients. But we're really focused on some areas of the business that we think are going to have nice
secular tailwinds, and they're very much in line with what we do as part of our core offering. And we're
pretty excited about what's out there for us right now.

But I will say we're going to be patient. We're not going to [ win ] out just because we have the dry
powder we have or because we're at a low point in the market cycle and buy up a bunch of stuff unless we
think we can integrate it well, it's got a good cultural fit, and we can make a reasonable deal.

Operator

We'll go next to Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question is, I guess, we'll stick with the M&A side of things. Are you considering deals that just add
to businesses that you're already in as you think about this? Are there new places you think you can go
into? I know in the last several years, you've done -- you did Norland that got you into data centers. You

did infrastructure on the Investment Management side. And so just curious if it's -- if what you're focused
on is additive or just new to the platform.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Tony, we will look for things that are closely adjacent to what we do, and we think consistent with our
skill set and relevant to our client base. We would not likely go too far afield from that because we think
there's enough opportunities that would meet that requirement or be more core to what we do. And that's
basically how we think about that.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And do you see the opportunity set having some size? And you'd mentioned, it sounds like putting
buyback on the back burner, so it sounds like -- are these a potential size that you would not be able to do
both?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So, Anthony, this is Leah. Our current pipeline is actually larger than we could reasonably entertain in any
1 quarter. So we are being very cognizant of the opportunity set that we have. We want to make sure that
we have sufficient dry powder to act quickly if we find the right opportunity. And so from our perspective,
we think it's a prudent measure given, one, we have a very active M&A pipeline; and two, we are taking
actions that directly impact our people for us to balance our approach on the buyback and put that off for
a quarter or 2.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then on the cost side, thanks for all the detail there. Just wondering if there's a way to
think about it, of the $200 million, for instance, if we thought of 2019 as a baseline. What piece of that
should we think about as being, I guess, more permanent that would change the margins on a more long-
term basis?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

That is all incremental reduction from 2019 levels. So it is all run rate.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And do you think that's all permanent, not just part of the current environment and doing things more
temporarily?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Correct. There have been other actions that we've taken, for example, furloughs. We're deferring -- our
compensation structure naturally reduces because of commissions and bonuses based on certain targets
that were set at the outset of the year that won't be achieved. So those are not included in the $200
million. The $200 million is actual structural cost reduction, either through reducing -- really through
reducing overhead and headcount -- basically, headcount.

10

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Okay. And then last one for me. You had mentioned in GWS a couple of items just slipping. I think last
quarter, you had mentioned, I think, mid- to high single-digit top line and high single-digit EBITDA. Does
that change? I didn't catch if you had updated that part of it.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So we now expect the GWS revenue to be in the single digit. However, we do expect profitability or
EBITDA growth to be double digit. So we have updated that.

Operator

We'll go next to Jade Rahmani with KBW.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Just to start off with, I think last quarter, JLL's CEO said that the average office lease duration in their
pipeline was down by about 16%. What kind of trends are you seeing in terms of how occupiers are
looking at their office exposure? And are you seeing a reduction in average lease maturity?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes, James. Well, the overwhelming thing that's impacting average lease maturity is that a lot of the big
long-term leases just have been put on hold. Decisions aren't being made. We have that circumstance
with our own portfolio of office space for our CBRE people as everybody tries to figure out what space use
is going to look like post-COVID. Those big decisions aren't getting made.

By the way, that's something that will definitively come back. Will it all come back? Probably not, but much
of it will come back, and that's on hold. So the average lease is shorter as a result of that.

What you're seeing now is renewals, extensions, small deals getting done, but all of that impacts the
averages, and we expect that to continue as long as COVID is having the impact it's having now.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Just separately, I've gotten a lot of calls from investors today on the restructuring charges. And I was
wondering if you could provide any insight as to what types of actions those relate to. Is that on the
Advisory Services business? Was that as it relates to infrastructure and administrative back-office
functions? Where did the actions occur? And should we really be expecting, in terms of a fixed run rate
benefit, $200 million in annual savings?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So Jade, it's Leah. The distribution, about 60% of it was in our advisory segment. About 30% was in GWS
and about 10% was in REI. That's a combination of the workforce actions we took in the second quarter as
well as the transformation initiatives that we launched in the third quarter.

The third quarter actions were principally around the spans and layers exercise that we did, just looking at
the overall shape and structure of our organization and making sure that we were appropriately structured
to be as efficient as possible coming out of this.

So most of it is related to severance and other separation costs related to that action. We do have some
lease terminations and other things that have gone through as we've sought to consolidate our workforce,
but the vast majority of it is represented in terms of severance costs.

11

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

And to what extent does it reflect an expectation of a very moderate and drawn out recovery in
transaction volume with respect to perhaps 2021 and 2022 in terms of the advisory segment?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Well, we certainly are very cognizant of this. And we said that. I said that earlier, that we do expect it to
be a more moderate recovery. Therefore, we are being very cautious around the expense structure for our
advisory business. And so you should expect we'll continue to look at ways to make sure we're rightsized
to ensure that our business and our workforce reflects the level of demand that's coming from our clients.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And I guess if you could stratify the cost saves in terms of headcount reductions versus other structural
changes, you mentioned lease terminations, how would that be split amongst those 2 categories?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

The majority of it is severance cost.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then finally just on the EMEA outperformance on capital markets, which you mentioned, what
do you think was driving that? And could that be a leading indicator as to a pickup in demand on that side
of the transaction pipeline?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We actually had some really strong performance across EMEA, particularly in Continental Europe.
So certainly, we'll watch each one of those markets. Europe certainly came out of the COVID lockdowns
before the Americas, but we're seeing some of that come back. So we're just overly cautious right now in
terms of the level of activity that we're expecting in the fourth quarter headed into 2021.

Operator

We'll go next to Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.

Joshua Kapler Lamers
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

This is actually Josh Lamers on for Stephen Sheldon. I'm going to start with a recurring question, but
always good to gauge. Wondering how far along you characterize we are in the price discovery process on
the investment sales side. Wondering if there are any indications that bid-ask spreads have come in over
the last couple of months. And if not, can you just outline why the persisting valuation gap?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

I think it's going to be really important for us to see larger transactions on the leasing side occur before
there are significant transactions that come back from an overall capital markets activity perspective. So I
think we are still a bit of a ways away from seeing significant capital markets activity resume.

One of the benefits, though, is that we are seeing more liquidity in the market, and that will certainly help
buoy our investment property sales business to come back with more strength than we've seen in prior
cycles where there's been more of a credit constraint in the market.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Sure. Makes sense. And then just picking up with one of the prior question lines here. Just generally
speaking, on the leasing front, I mean you've noted longer-term -- delays in making longer-term leasing
decisions. So based on your conversations more recently, has it influenced your thought process in any
way about leasing activity picking up in a more meaningful way in '21? Or does it seem that leasing
activity is not going to resume at a higher level until there's some health resolution?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Midsummer, we saw the level of activity in discussions start to pick up some, Stephen. But the fact of the
matter is we are deeply engaged with most of the big occupiers around the U.S. and around the world on
how they're thinking about this. And they really are looking for clarity related to COVID before they make
their big decisions. And this is really an important point. There's 2 separate things going on here.

One, we do think there will be some real change in the way office space is used going forward. We think
there will be less people in the office. We think the offices will be used less densely. We think they'll be
more intensively managed. We think buildings with great infrastructure will be favored.

There's a whole separate issue from that, though. And a separate issue is the leasing that's going to get
done isn't going to get decided on in this environment. And that is going to come back. It's not all one
thing. It's 2 separate things.

Joshua Kapler Lamers
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. And then switching gears to GWS. It's good to hear that interactions have continued here. Although
I have to say it's, I guess, a little surprising from my perspective to hear that occupiers are delaying
their decision-making on this front just given that there's usually first year cost savings associated with
outsourcing and then layer in the added risk of managing operations due to COVID.

So I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the reasoning behind the contract delays. And what's
your confidence at this point in GWS returning to double-digit growth next year?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

We have very big backlogs of opportunities not only relative to earlier this year but relative to prior years.
But the simple thing is there's so much physical presence that's needed to get these things done. People
need to examine space. People need to think about moving people from one place to another. People need
to think about getting project managers on-site and getting work done.

All of that is hard to do in this environment. Decision makers traveling the see space, it just has inevitably
slowed things down. And clients very directly tell us that. They tell us that they're not in a decision-making
mode or their decision-making has been delayed for those reasons, not knowing how the space is going to
get laid out when they move into it or when they move out of it.

And so again, there's -- it's so important as all of us think about what this means for our business, the use
of office space and the impact of COVID on leasing or office occupancy. There's the absence of decision
making that's taking place that will come back and happen when we get to the other side of COVID. And
then there's the different way space will be used on the other side of COVID, but it's really important to
separate those 2 things.

Joshua Kapler Lamers
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. That all makes sense. And then last one for me. Just looking to grab some comments from you
on Hana. You've noted that you're targeting to have 10 units opened by early next year now. Given your
comments around office considerations and the outlook for the future, I mean, does this become more of a
priority looking ahead? Or is it being rolled out, I guess, about as you expected maybe a year ago?

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we believe that given what we've learned about the way space is likely to be used going forward,
several things: greater flexibility, more satellite type uses because of people working from home.
Companies hesitate to put capital in because they're not sure how they're going to think about their space
long term versus short term.

We believe that there's evidence that flex space like Hana will become more necessary than it is today. But
like every other kind of office space out there, most markets around the world, people aren't going into
the office space in the short term. They're working from home because of COVID.

So in the short term, Hana has been impacted materially. It performed like we thought it was going to
perform this quarter. But in the short term, it's been impacted materially like every other kind of office
space has been. In the long term, we believe that it could be a more prominent strategy than it has been
historically, and we're pretty encouraged about the prospects for flex space in Hana.

Operator

We'll go next to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

How are you guys thinking about pressure on office rents weighing on leasing and capital markets revenue
when transaction volume does more fully rebound?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So as we look at the level of activity that we see today, there has been a smaller impact or a lesser impact
on the secondary and tertiary markets relative to the large top 25 cities in the world.

So if we look at the space needs, I think near term, there will be less impact on rents in some of those
smaller markets and particularly on smaller-sized leases. In those cases and in certain asset classes or
property types like industrial as well as multifamily on the capital markets side, I think you'll be able to
see more price discovery happen sooner.

But certainly, from an office perspective, we're watching those smaller markets and those smaller space
transactions really lead the path for that price discovery. And we would expect that as COVID begins to
attenuate and we have a vaccine and better therapeutics, we would be able to see more occupancy levels
increase in office space, and that should lead to more leasing decisions, as Bob alluded to, and help to
drive more capital market transactions in office.

So we certainly would expect there to be, in terms of capital market activity, transactions happen where
you have strong credit rent rolls, long-term tenant leases in place. Those transactions are happening, but
we're seeing the pause is really in the largest cities and in value-add asset class space where there's just
too much risk for underwriting today.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

But when you do see the bid-ask narrow in some of the major city centers in New York and Boston and
San Francisco and those transactions start to happen again, is your thought that the rents and the building
prices have to move lower in order to kind of hit that market clearing level? And if so, is there a concern
that, that presents a long-term headwind in terms of the commissions that you're making off of those
transactions?

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

I would say it's really ultimately going to depend how leasing decisions are made post-COVID. I think
it's too early to say specifically where rents are going to go relative to where they are today. There may
be some distressed assets where you do see some concessions. But it's not as though there's massive
amounts of vacancy or new assets coming online.

You really have to see a radical shift in terms of occupancy needs all at once. And you have to remember,
most of these leases are over -- are coming up on a renewal cycle over a long period of time. You don't
see massive changes in terms of occupancy being able to be executed in a very short period of time.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then I guess on the theme of maybe city center versus secondary and tertiary areas, how are
you thinking about the potential impact of urban flight on the multifamily business? As people want to
maybe live in the suburbs and not in the city centers, do you still see the same sort of structural demand
for multifamily units as maybe you would have expected a year ago?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, multifamily has really been driven by an underlying affordability issue around housing. And so we
don't see that abating. And in fact, it's getting more challenging for individuals from a single-family
perspective. So we certainly think there continue to be secular tailwinds for multifamily.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And the last one from me, and sorry to go back to margins again. But specifically with regard to
your Global Workplace Solutions commentary that approximately 1/3 of the margin expansion was driven
by structural improvements, does that imply that the remaining 2/3 was due to more temporary cost
reduction measures and those costs do come back in a more normalized environment?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Correct.

Operator

We'll go next to Michael Funk with Bank of America.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

[ Just to squeeze me ] if I could. So going back to your market share comments in the U.S., the 280 basis
points during the quarter, can you comment on, based on what you're seeing in 4Q, if you expect that
market share gap to improve? And then to what do you attribute that improvement?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So Michael, I think it's a bit too early to speculate on market share for the fourth quarter. It's certainly
something that we were pleased to see, and we will continue to monitor it, but I think it's just too early to
make a call on that.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Maybe a couple more if I could then. So I mean, obviously, early on, COVID put a pause on all
the activity, and you commented before, there's a very strong capital availability driving the sales cycle
right now. Are you seeing any impact over in Europe in the recent uptick in COVID? Is that causing some
potential clients to pause?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

It's way too soon, Michael, to make a call in terms of how that's going to impact the market in Europe.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. I'll try one more time then. So the comment about more the activity towards the low end of
the market, the 2,000 or below type of deals and then more multifamily industrial. Are these more
opportunistic deals? And is there enough potential pipeline there to continue that or do you think it's more
shorter-term benefit, and we need to see more of a full recovery to see, I guess, carry through on the
sales cycle?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

You're asking about the fourth quarter?

Michael J. Funk
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Even the third quarter. What you're seeing in third quarter -- actually, deals got done during third quarter,
try to deal with obviously smaller deals, whether or not those kind of reflected more of a kind of normal
course of business or the large enough pool for that to continue to help to drive the similar type of activity.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So one phenomenon that I think we will see happen in the fourth quarter is the 1031 exchange
activity around transactions from a capital markets perspective. That tends to be when we see quite a bit
of multifamily transactions come to market as -- in that smaller to mid-tier range. So that is something
that we would expect to help buoy the market, particularly in the U.S.

But we do have transactions happening within the sales part of our business. There are well-diversified,
strong credit tenant, long duration rent rolls, underlying certain assets as well as certain asset class --
certain office assets as well as certain asset classes like industrial and multifamily that are commanding a
tighter bid-ask spread, and that's resulting in transactions happening in the market.

So we certainly think there are transactions out there to be done, and that was evidenced in the third
quarter around our leasing and sales results. But it's certainly a more muted market just because there is
such a significant pause going on around decisions that are being made, particularly in office.

Operator

We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to
Bob Sulentic with closing remarks.
