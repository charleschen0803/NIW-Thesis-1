ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second
Quarter 2020 Earnings Release and Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Borde, Vice President, Investor
Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.

David Borde
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We will begin today with comments from
Entergy's Chairman and CEO, Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh, our CFO, will review results.

In an effort to accommodate everyone who has questions, we request that each person ask no more
than one question and one follow-up. In today's call, management will make certain forward-looking
statements. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to a number
of factors, which are set forth in our earnings release, our slide presentation and our SEC filings. Entergy
does not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

Management will also discuss non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP
measures are included in today's press release and slide presentation, both of which can be found on the
Investor Relations section of our website.

And now I will turn the call over to Leo.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.

Today, we are reporting strong second quarter results of $1.37 adjusted earnings per share. Sales in the
quarter were better than we expected. We are on track to achieve our $100 million O&M cost savings
target for the year, and our capital plan is unchanged. With these results, we are affirming our full year
guidance, our longer-term outlooks and our dividend growth aspirations. As you all know, the COVID-19
pandemic has placed a burden on our customers, employees and communities. We believe it is part of our
mission in powering life to do all that we can to support our stakeholders as we all work to recover from its
effects.

Despite these extraordinary times, 2020 is on pace to be another year of significant accomplishments for
Entergy. This quarter, we've made progress on multiple fronts, all of which will benefit our stakeholders.
We completed Phase 2 of the Western Region economic transmission project. The New Orleans Power
Station came online. The Public Utility Commission of Texas finalized its rule-making for a generation rider.
The Mississippi Public Service Commission approved Entergy Mississippi's formula rate plan filing. Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana each filed their annual formula rate plans and requested extensions
of these mechanisms. And Entergy Louisiana issued a request for proposal for up to 300 megawatts of
new renewable resources. And more importantly, we continue to successfully manage the effects of our
investment on customer rates.

According to an S&P Global Market Intelligence study published earlier this month, in 2019, Entergy
provided power to retail customers at the second lowest average price of the major investor-owned
utilities in the United States, something we are very proud of.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect all of us across the country. As we discussed last quarter,
we were well prepared from the outset, and we continue to effectively manage our response. We are
taking precautions for our employees and our customers. Those who can are working from home. And we

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

have procedures in place to keep our employees in the plants and in the field safe. We are also creating
innovative solutions to help our customers and our communities.

For example, our social responsibility and automation employees work together to develop a bot that
proactively informs customers in need about the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or
LIHEAP. This project also won second place in a global contest for innovative ways to reduce COVID-19's
impact on the economy and communities. Students and faculty at Southern University are using
3D printers in their Entergy sponsored lab to make parts for reusable N95 masks for health care
professionals. With our community partners, Entergy has helped to prepare more than 2 million meals,
provide crisis grants for more than 5,000 households and deliver personal protection equipment to first
responders, individuals and families in need.

Through the first half of the year, Entergy has donated almost $9 million in charitable contributions to
support our communities, including almost $3 million in COVID relief efforts and introduced the Power
to Care program, which helps customers who need financial assistance to pay their bills. In parallel
to our COVID-19 relief efforts, we continue to execute on our major projects across our service area
to modernize our utility infrastructure and enhance its efficiency and reliability for the benefit of our
customers.

We placed New Orleans Power Station in service in May, in time for the summer peak period and hurricane
season. Since entering service, this highly flexible and efficient peaking unit is being dispatched frequently.
We completed Phase 2 of the Western Region economic transmission project. This $115 million investment
supports economic growth in Southeast Texas and enhances reliability for existing and future customers.

The Public Utility Commission of Texas also approved our Certificate for Convenience and Necessity for
the Timberland transmission line, a $57 million project expected to be completed in 2022. We reached an
important energy milestone with the 100th customer signing up for the Renewable Orleans Residential
Rooftop Solar Program. The program offers a cost-effective way for low-income customers to participate
in the benefits of renewable energy without having to make an upfront capital investment. Entergy New
Orleans installs, owns and maintains the rooftop solar systems, and customers get a bill credit for their
participation.

Renewable Orleans is a good example of the innovative programs we are implementing to deliver
renewable energy solutions to our customers. We will continue to engage with our regulators and
stakeholders to expand the use of renewables under our framework that ensures we build the most
economic system balancing reliability, cost and sustainability.

In addition to providing meaningful customer benefits, our 3-year capital plan has significant certainty.
We've talked to you before about the 90-90 framework by which you should view the certainty of our
capital plan, that our capital plan is 90% ready for execution from a regulatory approval standpoint, and
that more than 90% will be recovered through timely mechanisms. Today, we're adding a third 90 to
further emphasize the strength of the plan. That 90% of the capital plan is based on the need for system
modernization and not dependent on customer growth.

These 3 statistics mean that our customer-centric capital plan is necessary, the majority will not require
special regulatory review and we expect timely recovery. We benefit from constructive and progressive
regulatory mechanisms that provide clarity to our plan and give us confidence in meeting our financial
commitments. Recently, the Public Utility Commission of Texas finalized the generation rider, which will
provide for full and timely recovery of capital costs associated with a new generation facility. We are
grateful for the commission's leadership in developing this new rule. More timely recovery will help us
create value for our stakeholders in Texas and ensure that the communities we serve remain economically
competitive.

We plan to make a filing later this year using this mechanism to request recovery of Montgomery County
Power Station when it comes online in 2021. Entergy Mississippi received approval of its formula rate plan
filing, rates were implemented in April. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana each submitted their
annual FRP filings. Summaries of their requests are included in the appendix of our webcast presentation.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Both of these operating companies are in the last year of their FRP cycles and both are requesting
extensions.

Entergy Louisiana's request includes a midpoint reset and a new distribution rider similar to the
transmission rider that is currently in effect. In New Orleans, we continue to work with the City Council on
the appropriate timing to begin the filing cycle for the recently approved 3-year formula rate plan.

At SIRI, we filed our brief on exceptions to the ALJ's initial decision issued in April. As you know, we
disagree with most of the initial decision because it incorrectly seeks to resolve important policy issues
of first impression that FERC ultimately must decide. The actions we've taken seek to create significant
benefits for our customers who consistently experience some of the lowest rates in the country year after
year.

Our customers have not been harmed by our actions and, in fact, stood to benefit greatly from them. Our
tax planning practices have created more than $900 million in direct customer benefits, $550 million of
which has already been credited to customer bills. The April initial decision, if it is affirmed by the FERC,
will discourage utilities like ourselves from pursuing such prudent innovative strategies to lower customer
bills. The sale-leaseback arrangement also produced significant savings for our customers and the ALJ's
recommendations would similarly discourage utilities from entering into such transactions. We feel strongly
that our positions on the law and the facts are correct. To be very clear, we believe that our actions have
been prudent and for the benefit of customers and that there should be no refunds or disallowances
except for the small depreciation correction that we agreed to.

While we will vigorously defend our position at the FERC, the time frame for pursuing SIRI's uncertain
tax position any further is lengthy, and the outcome is uncertain. This leaves us no choice but to mitigate
risk for our owners. In the next few weeks, we will give up SIRI's uncertain tax position with the IRS. This
will effectively cap the principle of any potential historical refunds, eliminate the basis for any reduction in
SIRI's rate base going forward, and eliminate the basis for the $147 million excess ADIT customer credit
raised in the July ALJ initial decision. Drew will provide additional thoughts on this matter, and I encourage
you to review our brief on exceptions.

At Entergy, we play a vital role in every region where we operate, and our core values are reflected in
our efforts on behalf of our stakeholders. Entergy is consistently recognized for its corporate citizenship,
climate leadership and commitment as an employer of choice, which is a tremendous honor. For a fifth
consecutive year, Entergy was named a 2020 honorary of The Civic 50, by Points of Light, the world's
largest organization dedicated to volunteer service. This award recognizes Entergy as one of the 50 most
community-minded companies in the United States.

Additionally, 3BL Media has named entry to its annual 100 Best Corporate Citizens ranking, which
recognizes outstanding environmental, social and governance transparency and performance among
the 1,000 largest U.S. public companies. This is the eighth year Entergy has included in this prestigious
ranking. We were also named the winner of the Bronze Stevie Award for our 2019 climate report, where
we outlined steps that we are taking to deliver cleaner energy solutions and promote a lower carbon future
for all of our stakeholders.

Finally, like many of you have been saddened and upset by recent events that have laid bare yet again
the deep social inequalities and injustices so many in our country continue to face. As our human rights
statement outlines, Entergy respects the human rights of all individuals. With a workforce of close to
14,000, we leave no room in Entergy for racism, discrimination or intolerance, but rather seek to achieve
our vision and mission through diversity and inclusion of all people and their unique ideas, backgrounds
and perspectives. We will continue to move forward in our mission and you, as owners, including our
employees who are a top 10 owner of the company, have my and the entire Entergy leadership team's
commitment that we won't retreat from our obligations, personally or professionally. We know that our
actions towards creating real and meaningful change speak much louder than words.

As I said at the outset, we delivered yet another strong quarter. Even though COVID-19 has had an
impact, 2020 has already been a year of significant accomplishments that keep us on track to meet our
strategic, operational and financial objectives. We are committed to those objectives and are resolved to

be the premier utility. The foundation of our business remains strong and sustainable. We have among
the lowest retail rates in the country. Our capital plan remains on track and will modernize our system
and benefit our customers and our local economies. We have constructive and progressive regulatory
mechanisms. We are an industry leader in critical measures of sustainability. We have one of the cleanest
large-scale power generation fleets. And while we have seen some slowdown in industrial activity, our
industrial base is among the most economically advantaged in the world, and we expect that they will lead
the region's recovery in their respective industries.

We create innovative solutions to help our customers, and we are prepared to overcome headwinds
through a disciplined cost management program, as evidenced in our response to both last year's
unfavorable weather and this year's COVID-19 impacts. It should not surprise you that we are affirming
our longer-term outlooks given our commitment to create permanent cost savings through continuous
improvement efforts. These efforts strengthen and, when possible, will improve our delivery of steady,
predictable earnings growth, as we demonstrated on this call just last year.

This is what makes Entergy a compelling long-term investment. This is the foundation on which we will
grow, innovate and expand our investment profile to continue to deliver on our commitments tomorrow.
Before I turn the call over to Drew, I want to confirm that our virtual Analyst Day will be held on
September 24. These are exciting times for Entergy, and we look forward to continuing the conversation
with you then about what we're doing to build the premier utility.

Drew will now review our second quarter results and our outlooks.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo noted, our second quarter results were strong. Sales
were better than we expected on our last call. We are well on track to achieve our cost savings for the
year, and our capital plan remains unchanged.

We are affirming our guidance and longer-term outlooks as we stay focused on becoming the premier
utility. Entergy adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.37. And drivers were straightforward. Starting
with utility on Slide 6, we saw positive effects of regulatory actions associated with our customer-centric
investments in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, including the Lake Charles Power Station, which
came online a few months early. We experienced lower sales volume due to impacts from COVID-19 and
unfavorable weather.

Lower O&M reflected our cost reduction initiatives as well as the timing and scope of nonnuclear
generation outages and lower nuclear generation expenses. Depreciation and interest were higher as a
result of our continued growth, and earnings on a per-share basis also reflected a higher share count.

At EWC on Slide 7, as reported earnings were $0.55 higher than a year ago, the key driver was strong
market performance for EWC's nuclear decommissioning trust funds. The quarter's results also reflected
lower revenue and lower O&M, primarily due to the shutdown of Pilgrim and Indian Point 2.

Slide 8 shows operating cash flow increased approximately $240 million. The main drivers were higher
collections for fuel and purchase power costs and a $45 million reduction in the unprotected excess ADIT
returned to customers. The second quarter also benefited from lower nuclear refueling outage spending
and lower severance and retention payments at EWC. Lower collections from utility customers partially
offset the increase.

Now turning to Slide 9. We are affirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.45 to $5.75 and
our 2021 and 2022 outlooks remain unchanged. As I mentioned in my introduction, our sales came in
higher than we discussed last quarter when we initially estimated the effects of COVID-19, and we're well
on track to achieve our cost savings for the year. Sales were better than expected in all classes, and our
overall 2020 expectation has improved slightly.

For O&M, to date, we have achieved near 40% of our $100 million spending reduction and remain on track
to achieve the remainder by year-end. And while our year-to-date variance is very positive, portion of that

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

is due to planned projects that were shifted to the second half of the year in response to COVID-19. As a
result, we expect the third and fourth quarters to reflect spending for these delayed projects as well as the
balance of our identified cost savings initiatives.

Our credit metrics and liquidity position are outlined on Slide 10. Our parent debt to total debt was
22% and our FFO to debt was 14.6%. The FFO metric includes the effects of returning $189 million of
unprotected excess ADIT to customers over the last 12 months. Excluding this giveback and certain
items related to our exit of EWC, FFO to debt would have been 16%. As we noted last quarter, we remain
committed to achieving FFO to debt at or above 15% by fourth quarter 2021.

Our liquidity position remains strong and you can see that as of June 30, our net liquidity, including storm
reserves of $3.5 billion. Following up on Leo's comments regarding SIRI, we estimate that if the FERC
were to agree with the conclusions in the ALJ's initial decision without modification, the ongoing adjusted
EPS impact could be $0.15 to $0.20. This includes approximately $0.06 for the sale-leaseback issue
and the remainder is from financing refunds to customers. This also reflects that we will give up SIRI's
uncertain tax position with the IRS to mitigate risk to our owners. And it does not reflect any actions we
would take elsewhere in the company to mitigate the impact.

This estimate should not be interpreted as acknowledgment on our part of the merits of the initial decision
or our expectation of the potential outcome on this matter. As Leo mentioned, we disagree with the initial
decision, we've clearly laid out in our filings in this case and we don't believe there should be any material
impact to EPS.

Before closing, our Analyst Day is scheduled for September 24. We'll share with you our longer-term
growth strategy, including our customer-centric investments and continuous improvement efforts. We will
provide 5-year views of our EPS outlooks and credit expectations as well as details on the key drivers that
support our path to achieve our objectives. We're excited to share our plans with you.

We had a strong second quarter. We achieved a number of significant accomplishments, and we remain on
track to meet our strategic, operational and financial objectives. We are committed to these objectives as
well as our goal to be the premier utility. And we look forward to continuing this conversation at Analyst
Day.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital
Markets.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just 1 -- 2 real quick questions. I think your previous guidance had assumed a 2% decline for 2020 --
sorry, 2.5% decline for the full year. Now you're at 2%. Can you kind of give us a breakdown of how
you are thinking about that for the balance of the year? And do you think there's some -- maybe some
conservatism baked in there on the industrial side as you're kind of looking at the recovery through the
end of 2020?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, James. This is Drew. Yes. So we haven't changed our outlook for sales, actually, for the third and the
fourth quarter from what we described in May, even though we did see a little bit better outcome in the
second quarter than what we were anticipating. It is possible that we could do better. But given the spike
in cases around the country in our service territory, we thought we should just keep it about where it is for
right now.

We do continue to see the phased reopening, even though it's paused in certain municipalities right now.
So there is opportunity perhaps over the balance of the year. But for the time, we've elected to keep our
outlook for sales where we had it for the second half.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Perfect. So basically, the improved sort of outlook really comes from just the second quarter and the
weather you've kind of -- and the sales you've seen sort of quarter-to-date? Relative to...

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

That is correct.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And then the other question, I guess, just comes back to sort [indiscernible], are you still
comfortable with the equity guidance that you had given before, where you're looking, I think, for the high
end of the 5% to 10% of the planned CapEx? Is that still sort of how you're looking at things? And do you
still feel like you're on target for the end of the year to get to 15% FFO to debt, which I think is where you
guys were sort of targeting last time we spoke?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

That's right. We are still targeting that, and we still expect to make that by fourth quarter next year. And
our equity outlook is in that same range that we've talked about previously. We have continued to think
about timing, and we think it's probably in the later half of next year when the need will actually arise.
And we've continued to think about the method in which we would deliver that. And in the past, we've
talked about block trades. That's what we did a few years ago. So that's still on the table, but we've also
added other options to the table, including an ATM possibility and even perhaps preferred equity.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Right now, we don't have authorization for preferred equity within our chart. So we would need a proxy
vote to ensure that, that would be shareholder friendly. But we're considering that as well.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And just a follow-up on the preferred equity, I'm assuming that would be like a mandatory convert?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Is that -- from a rating agency standpoint, I know that you'll get anywhere from 25% -- 50% credit for
something like that. Does that kind of limit, I guess, how much of the funding you can do through the
convert, just considering it's a little bit farther out, and you don't get as much equity credit as you would
versus, say, a block sale or through an ATM?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So that's why the preferred equity gets you actually, I think, up to the 100%. There are other options
around preferred debt and other versions of convertibles that will give you various credit depending on
the rating agency. And we have authorization for all of those. What we don't have authorization for is the
preferred equity that would allow you to get the 100% credit.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So good to see that the $100 million cost savings program is on target. Is there any plans to hold
recurring savings into '21? Any sort of rough numbers to think about? I mean, what could be recurring
with the 2020 savings? Anything perpetual? And I have a follow-up.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Shar, this is Drew. So obviously, at this point in the year, we are also thinking about 2021 and what that
might mean. And we have started to think about opportunities for savings in 2021. So that is actually
well underway. Currently, we are monitoring everything that's going on in the world and making sure that
there isn't any other risks that may be out there that we would need to apply those to. But that work that
you're referring to is well underway, but we're not prepared to talk about specific numbers at this point.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And obviously, you've highlighted it's been relatively a strong start to the year. Can you just maybe
point us to kind of where you're tracking within your 2020 earnings band? Seems to be just with a rough
model and you're getting a little bit closer to the top end, especially if the 3Q weather transpires. Just
maybe a little bit of -- from a trend perspective with where you are within the band?.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we're still tracking towards the middle of the band. There are opportunities potentially out there
for us, but we continue to track towards the middle at this point.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Guys. John? I would just -- could I just come back to sales and just ask you were they most sort of
deviated to the positive or otherwise from -- in the second quarter? Because the way you showed that
slide on the Q1 deck, I believe that was sort of versus guidance rather than a year-over-year comp. So
just curious whether they're sort of down -- I think it was down 1% in industrial, for example, in Q2. Was
that where the favorability was or was it more on the residential side?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

This is Rod. I think the storyline remains consistent with what we expected back in May, where the growth
was driven by residential because so much of the shelter in place were showing up in our residential
sector, and you had some volatility in the commercial sector because you had so many different levels of
uncertainty with schools and churches and restaurants and the like. And I think the clarity we had in the
industrial sector sort of played out, although it was a little bit better than expected. So the fundamentals
have not changed dramatically when you think about sort of this cross sector contribution to growth.
So residential is really showing up for us in offsetting a large part, a lot of the volatility we're seeing
elsewhere.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

And I'll just add that it pretty much was across all 3 plans where we were a little bit ahead of
expectations. It wasn't one or the other that's completely dominated.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Got it. And just my follow-up on -- so on the balance sheet, it looks like your uncollectibles went up from
$7.5 million to $43 million or so. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there, whether it's sort
of on a -- has it kind of spiked? And is it plateauing now? Or is it sort of on an accelerating trend? And
then just how to think about some of those variables going forward?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Jonathan, that's a good question. So we are seeing more uncollectibles right now. We actually -- as
you noted, we booked about $30 million of bad debt expense this quarter. That was offset by regulatory
assets, given the regulatory orders that we have in our retail jurisdictions. So there's not really any
bottom line impact associated with that because we would expect to be able to recover those costs.

Historically, we've experienced about -- bad debt expenses, about 1/3 of our typical arrears. So typically,
we have arrears in any given point of about $75 million, and we experienced about $25 million of bad debt
expense. We are about $100 million higher on our arrears right now, and that's why we booked the $30
million sort of consistent with that ratio. We expect that there are some people that are able to pay, but
are just taking advantage of the current situation. But -- and we do expect that to grow a little bit more.

We haven't turned on our dining programs. And we would expect that, that balance would continue to
grow through the summer, although we expect it to continue to be manageable. And it is -- that growth is
reflected in our liquidity expectations, which continue to be strong. So that is something that we're closely
monitoring, and it's important for us to continue to work with our customers in order to help them through
this.

Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

If I can hand -- first off, I want to say that are [indiscernible].

David Borde
Vice President of Investor Relations

Julien, we're having trouble hearing you.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

On the merits of your argument with SIRI and just understanding the financial implications, Drew, you
specifically said that there were some mitigating factors but didn't quantify or specify what they were. Can
you help walk through what they might be, be it from a reduction in financing needs or otherwise? Just
help us understand what reserves you might have already taken and/or other mitigating circumstances?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Julien, I'll start with the "mitigating circumstances," and I'll let Drew kind of finish up. But first and
foremost, my expectation would be that we would -- that whatever impact ultimately happened, that
we would overcome that and still meet our expectations. So that's our going-in position from just an
organizationally that whatever the impact is that we would continue to meet the objectives that we've laid
out for you.

There are also some -- within the SIRI case, I think there are some things that we talked about in the past
that could be used to mitigate such as the interest costs that we've been paying the IRS and some other
things like that. So -- and obviously, there'll be some financing or whatever that would fit into whatever
financing plan Drew has. But I guess the overall -- overarching mitigation is that whatever it is, that would
be our expectation to overcome it.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Right. Well I would say that the opportunity within our business is embedded within our continuous
improvement program. And so as you know, we've been working hard to continue to develop that. We feel
like it's continued to grow and mature. And that is where that opportunity would come from. So not all
of it clearly has been identified at this point. But as Leo clearly just articulated, there's as an expectation
about how we would be expected to operate within the company. And just like we have in the past, I have
100% confidence that the company is going to figure out how to make that work.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

And of course, Julien, our perspective is that there won't be an impact. Because of our position in the
case. So I just want to make that clear to you.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Absolutely. I appreciate the merits of your arguments there as well. It makes some sense. But if I can
ask you to expand on this. Do you obviously have $100 million in prospects that you are well on track to

be for this year. When you say you'll find ways to offset that, does that include leveraging or offsetting it
with continuation of the $100 million in cost cuts? And maybe even more broadly [indiscernible], I know
the last quarter and at the outset of COVID, we've been talking about the sustainability of these cost
reductions. How do you think about that now given the plan for the back half of the year and how that
might impact '21? And also considering potential timing in '21 of resolution for the sales [indiscernible]?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

So I'll unpack a little bit of that, Julien, and I'll ask my colleagues to tell me if I forget some of the points
that you want to get that in there. I appreciate the question because really there's a couple of things at
play here. The $100 million is, by and large, our FLEX program with what we're doing within the year to
manage the impacts of COVID and weather. Obviously, we've had that negative weather so far this year,
plus the impact of COVID. Last year, we had negative weather and those intra-year dollars are primarily
what we talked about at the beginning of the year when we started to FLEX associated with weather and
then continue to ramp up the FLEX because of the impact on sales of COVID.

In parallel to that, we do have a continuous improvement program, which is more akin to what we did
last year on this call where we found permanent cost reductions that, as you recall, allowed us to invest
more capital into the system to improve the reliability of the system and the impact and the experience
on our customer base, plus grow the business, allowed us to add -- actually add money to our charitable
foundation and to our employee benefits. Through those -- the headroom that was provided through those
continuous improvements. So when we start to talk about next year, there'll be a combination of the 2 as
well.

I will say that, I'm sure this is not unique to us, that we're finding there are some areas of impact on our
cost associated with our reaction to COVID that will likely fall into that bucket of continuous improvement
and could be permanent. We have -- we're in the process of trying to marry what goes from an annual
thing to a permanent thing, but I'm sure even within all of your firms, you found things that you used
to do one way that you're doing a different way today, that's much more efficient that you'll probably
continue to do. So I hope that helps. There's really 2 parallel things that we work on. One is just the
normal flex within the annual budget that every department has. The other is the permanent continuous
improvement that everybody is also focused on.

And you saw that in second quarter last year, where we changed our outlooks because of the continuous
improvement. This year, we're holding on to [ outlooks ] because of FLEX. Does that make sense?

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Right. And does the offset potentially the impact next year, too?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. So -- but I would say impact next year, depending on what it is, whether it's weather or
whatever, it'd be a FLEX sort of thing. We were just talking about SIRI, that would be more of a
continuous improvement sort of thing.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wondered if you could speak a little bit more on the 90% of CapEx, not dependent on customer
growth. And is this kind of like a shift in planning and strategy? Or is it kind of just more reflective of
current system investment levels that are needed?

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

That's a great question, Jeremy. It's consistent with the capital plan that we've had for the last 10 years.
And I felt like it was necessary to add a metric that keeps that top of mind with everybody because I
believe that's important about our plan. If you think about what we're doing in the generation space
and what we've been doing for over a decade, we're replacing 50-year-old generation with brand-new
generation. The heat rate is lower. It creates a significant production cost improvement that pays for
the plant. Emissions are 40% lower than the -- they use less water. All those things are good about new
plants.

And so what we've been doing over the years is adding new generation then subsequently retiring old
generation. So it's meeting the needs of the system with new stuff rather than old stuff. Same things
goes with the investments that we've had in the distribution system. So if you think about AMI, we're
replacing old meters with new meters, it's not new customers. Although there are new customers that get
a new meter, the majority of that program is driven by the technological improvement. Our distribution
automation strategy, our asset management strategy, all of those are really based on improving the level
of service that our customers achieve by deploying capital that lowers costs or provides a service that was
not available in the past.

So 90% of it has been and continues to be based on the fact that we need to modernize the system.
Where the fact that we have customer growth has assisted us is that it has provided a lower rate path
for everybody as we expand the sales that we have on those assets that we're using to modernize the
system, which contributes to the fact that we have historically have either the lowest or second lowest
rates in the United States. So I just felt like it was necessary given the impact that COVID has had on
the economy and sales that we point out that the capital plan is still there to modernize the system and
COVID hasn't changed the need for us to modernize the system. If anything, it's actually enhanced the
need for us to modernize the system, particularly at the distribution level.

And so while 90% of what's in there today is based on technological improvement, if there is a lot in the
wings for more technological improvement that we could do to the extent we find the headroom to do it. I
hope that helps answer your question.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That was very helpful. One more, if I could. Just wondering if you could talk a bit on how your positioned
MISO impacts Entergy's renewable planning. And do you see opportunities here changing over the next 5
years from MISO level planning and changes?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Well we do our resource planning, obviously, in conjunction with the resource adequacy that we need for
MISO. But our resource planning is done at the state level. So the resource plans that we have and the
type of generation we need incorporates our participation in MISO. But it's not -- MISO is not driving what
resources we pick.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

One very brief clarification on the CRE. Because of this change you're going to make to the uncertain tax
position, does that cause the earnings impact to occur kind of temporarily until you get the final decision?

Andrew S. Marsh

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

No, no. There shouldn't be any real earnings impact associated with that other than the fact that we
did have an expectation that we would be successful, which would have reduced future rate base and
subsequent earnings. But I -- that's not what we're referring to when we're talking about maintaining our
expectations. It would have to come through other means.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Just the FRPs, the extensions, I think Louisiana, you filed, and then are you doing Arkansas?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Both. Both jurisdictions.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Just how much do we need to kind of worry about these as more like normal rate cases as opposed
to these like annual reviews? Like can you just explain the issues in the multiyear extensions versus the
annual?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

I think the primary question on the renewal is -- has the FRP accomplished the objective that we set
out 5 years ago in Arkansas and 3 years ago in Louisiana. And when you think about how we've shaped
the capital plan, and we've disclosed to our regulators what our plans were, then the question becomes,
can we achieve the objectives? And you've heard it before, Steve, around our reliability, sustainability,
affordable, low-cost competitive rates. Can we achieve that given the capital plan for customers?

And if the answer to that question is yes, and as we lay out in our renewal filings, the answer is yes, in our
view, then they'll -- we expect that they as well as the other stakeholders will agree that it makes sense to
keep it going. It's not a -- it hasn't been viewed, as we've discussed with the stakeholders, as a full-blown
rate case where we're reviewing -- when we spend a year going through the traditional backward looking
base rate case. So that's not the expectation. But of course, the regulator has the ability to weigh in on
whatever component that they wish. But we believe the interests are aligned. We think the way that the
FRPs have worked historically have been consistent with what we represented 5 years ago in Arkansas.

And as you know, this is a series of 3-year renewals in Louisiana and again the shape of the capital plan,
we're going to be done just the renewal of the FRP in Louisiana, for instance, recognizing, as Leo laid
out. We have -- we're shaping the capital plan with more distribution investment, for instance, as part of
that asset renewal. That's going to show up in what we're asking the jurisdiction in Louisiana to consider
with a distribution rider. And so it's those type of policy considerations that we're going through with our
stakeholders and not as much a rate case review, if that's helpful.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Steve, Rod mentioned that we -- just to look at how it works in Louisiana, just flip back to the
last renewal and the renewal before that and renewal before that and the renewal before that. This is
obviously the first time that we've done it in Arkansas, but it's been pretty clear that the Arkansas formula
rate plan has worked exactly the way it was intended to work with the combination of -- all you have to
do is look at something like a year, like 2018 where we ended up with a year that worked out differently
because of tax reform than we thought it was going to do. And then we ended up earning our allowed rate
of return, and we refunded dollars to customers in the next formula rate on filing that went through. So
that's worked really, really well for customers as well.

So Louisiana, obviously, we have a long history of renewals. This will be the first one in Arkansas, but it
appears to be working exactly the way it was intended by all the parties.

Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

So I wanted to go back to SIRI. So I appreciate your quantification of the downside case here, the $0.15
to $0.20 and your ability to offset that potential earnings drag. But it seems like that's just potentially half
of the impact, right, because there is a separate proceeding regarding the ROE and property equity ratio
for the asset. And I see that the ALJ recommendation is expected only in February of next year. But if you
could just explain how -- I assume that -- I'm assuming that there's some negotiations on that front. We
had the nice ROE decision from FERC. We had some adjustments, at least the proposed adjustment to the
calculation mechanism for the ROE and how that could impact the earnings power of Grand Gulf?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

So this is Drew. We've had, Angie, the -- an expectation for ROE and capital structure baked in for 3
years or so at this point, and our expectations, and those are in our outlook based on the outcome
of this proceeding. And at this point, we don't see any reason to change those based on how the
proceedings have moved to date. And even if those outlooks weren't met from an ROE and capital
structure perspective, we don't think that the -- whatever that delta would be is something that we
couldn't manage within our current expectations.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. Even if there weren't those overlapping impact, right, with the reduction of the rate base and
reduction of the ROE and the reduction in the equity layer?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

That's correct. Yes.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

And we're saying we already reserved on the ROE.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

We've already -- we have an expectation for that based on our outlook. So we don't want to -- we don't
usually talk about that because we're still in the proceeding, but we're comfortable with where that is in
our outlooks right now.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Great. And just one follow-up. So what should we expect in going into your Analyst Day? I mean, do you
plan on making any announcements, for instance, regarding more renewable power spending? Or is this
just an additional cost cutting initiatives? Again, I mean, just the big picture expectations going into the
Analyst Day?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think big picture, Angie, what we'll be talking about is being able to get a little bit more color on
how we operate and what we're doing and what's in the capital plan and how we're thinking about it. The
capital plan is pretty certain where it is. As you know, there's a large mix of renewables in our future as

16

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

it is. As we've stated before, between 22 and 30, we anticipate a lot of renewables. We got the RFPs that
we've been involved in, the construction -- the projects that are up and running, the ones that are under
instruction. So I think the capital plan is in pretty good shape. We may give you some more details about
that and talk about what's in our future, particularly as we spend time on the customer solutions side of
things.

But really a little more depth on things like what's in the capital plan, what's in our path to lower
emissions, what's in our customer solutions space, what's in the distribution space, how are we
operationalizing continuous improvement, things like that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

So I wanted to go back to maybe a little bit to the volume picture. And just looking at the breakdown by
the class, right? It seems like the industrial is doing pretty well here, right? It's fairly down year-over-year
on a weather-adjusted basis. In commercial, understandably, it's suffering a little more and the residential
is up, and I think we will get that. My question is, I guess, could you help us a little more to understand
what's going on in the ground right now? Is this a trend which you just expect to continue the same way?
And if the -- given the shift in the mix, if the sensitivities to these changes that we had pre-COVID still
hold in this new environment?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Sophie, the industrial piece, in particular, that you noted, we were expecting pretty solid growth
this year at the outset in the 5% to 6% range for industrial. So the fact that it's 1% down is a pretty big
drop relative -- even though year-over-year, it's 1% down, we were expecting to be 5%, 6% up. And
on the balance of the year, I would say that we expect the residential to trend -- start to trend down as
people return to work in different places than their home. And we expect the commercial, governmental to
slowly begin to trend up in industrial to hopefully begin to improve. And that's all, I think, consistent with
where we lined out our expectations in May. And so I think that we are continuing to expect the phase
reopening to support slow but steady improvement in these numbers.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And then lastly, maybe if you could give us a little bit of a sneak peek into your Analyst Day. I think things
are going on track for the most part for your company. What topics or what areas do you plan to give us
an update on?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

As far as topics for the Analyst Day, we'll probably just a little more depth and color around what's in the
capital plan, trends to lower emissions and as well as continuous improvement structure and things like
that will be subjects that we'll talk about. We don't want to -- we don't want to talk too much about it
today. We want you to tune in.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine from Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

What projects are in your capital plan that are most sensitive to load outlook that was incorporated within
that 10%? I don't know if that was highlighted in the prepared remarks.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

There probably is smattering, I'll call. Obviously, there's -- new customer hookups are the big piece of it
in the distribution and the transmission space. So for example, if you had a major industrial customer that
was locating your service territory, the substations for them can be pretty significant. So you'd have to
build them a substation. And then we just have general line extensions to our distribution business every
day when a new house is built or something like that. So some of the transmission infrastructure could
be put in that bucket as well to the extent that we need to put -- build transmission infrastructure into
an area because of either prior load growth or new load growth, but it's really more in getting to that last
mile.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then in terms of the industrial load assumption in your guidance, what are your conversations with
customers suggesting for that outlook? And are there any big lumpy customers that you have color as to
their plans or timing of when some of that industrial load can return throughout the remaining portion of
the year?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

Ryan, it's Rod. I know we'll talk more in detail about the nuances of our industrial engagement, perhaps
at the Analyst Day. But part of our confidence comes from -- in our growth observations comes from the
fact that we're actually talking to real customers, and we can quantify and identify the existing projects.
And so what we're paying attention to at the moment are not just sort of the macroeconomic commodity
spreads and other indicators. We're talking to those companies who've made final investment decisions.
And whether they've delayed projects or ramping back up, we can point to specific companies and tie
them to specific projects that are in our outlook.

And as we've shared before, we probably will wait not just the projects and the plan, but there are other
projects that make up our economic development type of pipeline that we're also monitoring to determine
whether or not we need to include those or exclude those as the case may be in the plan. We've not seen
much movement in our existing plan with regard to projects that we've identified that -- for instance,
that were canceled. There might have been 1 or 2 here or there, but they were on the lower end of the
spectrum in terms of impact. But our confidence comes from the fact that we're tying them to actual
projects that are still in play.

Operator

Our last question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just want to quickly clarify, Drew, the $0.15 to $0.20. I'm trying to reconcile that to the Slide 26 where
you show the rate base exposure. Am I right in thinking about the $0.15, $0.20 is essentially you sort of,
in a worst-case scenario, losing the return on that $400 -- north of $400 million rate? Is that the right way
to think about it? Or am I comparing apples and oranges?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the $400 million, plus the $100 million of interest that is part of the refund, because they're saying
that we owe the money. And it's not actually really rate base. It's refund. So the rate base doesn't really
change in that regard. It would only change if we were successful in our outcome with the IRS, because
then there would be deferred tax and the rate base would go down. The net rate base would go down. So
really, what we're talking about is the $510 million that you see there. That total amount is the requested
refund.
