And now I will turn the call over to Ron.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a record quarter and fiscal year.
Strong demand for our portfolio of differentiated solutions is fueling continued momentum across all of our
end markets.

Today, I'll focus my comments on 4 key headlines.

First, demand for Keysight differentiated solutions continues to be very strong with orders exceeding our
expectations. Outstanding order growth of 21% in the fourth quarter topped off an excellent fiscal year
where we grew 18%. Demand continues to be balanced across our business with double-digit gains across
all end markets and regions, both in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year.

Second, we delivered outstanding Q4 results despite a tightening supply environment. Exceptional
execution by Keysight employees around the world resulted in record revenue, gross margin, operating
margin and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year 2021.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

Third, we enter 2022 with strong momentum, robust end market demand and record backlog. Assuming
a loosening of the supply situation in the second half of the calendar year, we expect fiscal year 2022
revenue growth of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Beyond 2022, we are increasingly
confident in our ability to deliver sustained above-market results. We have established a strong track
record of execution, and our competitive position earned over the past 7 years of investment and
transformation has only grown stronger.

Lastly, given the strength of our cash position and generation, we continue to see tremendous
opportunities for value creation through disciplined investment in organic capabilities, targeted acquisitions
and accordingly, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion.

Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2021 financial
performance. In the fourth quarter, we saw continued momentum in the demand environment. Orders
exceeded our expectations and grew 21% year-over-year. Revenue grew 6% with growth across all
regions. Operational excellence resulted in record profitability as we delivered gross margin of 66%,
operating margin of 31% and earnings of $1.82 per share.

Fourth quarter results drove a very strong finish to an excellent year. In 2021, we overcame 5 percentage
points of China trade headwinds and delivered 18% order growth to outpace the overall market, which
continues to be strong. Despite a tightening supply environment, we ended it with 17% revenue growth
and achieved record profitability with gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 28% and earnings of
$6.23 per share.

Compared to pre-pandemic fiscal year 2019, orders and revenue have grown 21% and 15%, respectively,
over this 2-year period, highlighting the continued strong demand for our market-leading solutions. Broad-
based growth across multiple dimensions of the business demonstrates the breadth of our customer base.
We added more than 2,000 customers in 2021 and more than 1,900 in 2020 as we continue to expand our
footprint, adding to the stability and durability of our business model.

Despite the headwinds we faced in 2021, we delivered annual double-digit order and revenue growth in
both business segments.

The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue,
driven by double-digit growth in semiconductor solutions and in automotive. Another quarter of record
semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investments in advanced technology nodes and capacity
expansion to address pent-up demand.

In automotive, we achieved record orders and the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order and
revenue growth. Investment remains strong in EV and AV technologies. This quarter, we announced the
collaboration with NIO, one of China's top EV automakers who selected Keysight's 5G and C-V2X network
emulation solutions.

Strong demand for general electronics solutions was driven by continued investments in digital
transformation, industrial IoT, digital health, Industry 4.0 and advanced academic research.

The Communications Solutions Group delivered double-digit order growth and record revenue in the fourth
quarter. For the year, orders and revenue grew double digits despite the impact of China trade restrictions.

Commercial Communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue in the fourth quarter. Q4 was
another record quarter for 5G driven by the strength of our platform, continued O-RAN adoption and new
industry applications. In addition, we saw ongoing investments in 400G and 800G R&D across the entire
communications ecosystem. Increased spending in data centers and network security drove double-digit
order growth in network test and visibility.

In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by ongoing investments
in technology with a focus on space and new commercial technologies like 5G. We recently announced
a collaboration with Lockheed Martin to advance 5G in support of mission-critical communications for
aerospace and defense applications.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

Keysight's first-to-market solutions are enabling the rapid progression of new technologies and winning
engagement with industry leaders like NXP, NEC and MediaTek. In Q4, we joined Google's cloud partner
initiative to support agile orchestration of innovative 5G services at the network edge. Our end-to-end
solutions portfolio continues to capture new opportunities as the 5G life cycle progresses and expands into
aerospace, defense and government, automotive and industrial applications.

We continue to accelerate Keysight's capability to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic
acquisitions and recently added scalable network technologies to our software-centric solutions portfolio.
Scalable is a provider of best-in-class network simulation solutions to model and visualize communication
networks and cyber threats for aerospace, defense and government customers. We're excited to welcome
the scalable team to Keysight.

Our software-centric solutions and higher value services continue to drive differentiation, strengthen
our competitive position and capture a higher percentage of our customers' wallet share. In fiscal year
2021, software and services not only delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, but also outpaced
Keysight's overall growth. Combined, they represented just over 1/3 of Keysight's total revenue for the
year. We also continued to grow annualized recurring revenue, which now exceeds $1 billion. The growth
in software and services as well as the recurring revenue further strengthens the durability and resiliency
of our business model, while at the same time contributing to Keysight's margin expansion.

Keysight's focus on first-to-market software-centric solutions and operational excellence drives our
consistent execution. We have a strong track record of performance and proven business resiliency. Since
our inception as a public company 7 years ago, we have achieved a 10% compound annual revenue
growth rate, expanded gross margin by over 800 basis points, increased operating margin by nearly
1,000 basis points and generated 16% annualized EPS growth all while significantly increasing investment
in R&D and sales to drive future growth. Over this same period, we have nearly tripled the size of
our software revenue and more than doubled recurring revenue while growing services 75%. These
accomplishments are a testament to Keysight's leadership model, our values and our people. I would like
to thank all Keysight employees for their exceptional execution and dedication. We continue to capitalize
on these multiple waves of technology innovation and long-term secular growth trends across multiple
markets. We exit this year in a strong competitive position and expect to continue to deliver sustained
above-market profitable growth.

Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Happy
Thanksgiving.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and fiscal
year.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered record revenue of $1.294 billion, which was above the high
end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 5% on a core basis despite a tightening supply environment.
The further contraction of the supply chain within the quarter tempered total revenue results and was
more impactful on the Communications Solutions Group businesses.

With demand outpacing supply, we delivered a record $1.491 billion in orders, up 21% on a reported and
core basis and enter fiscal year 2022 with over $2 billion in backlog, which will position us well as the
supply chain situation improves.

Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported record gross margin of 66% and operating
expenses of $456 million, resulting in an operating margin of 31%, an all-time high.

Net income was a record $338 million, and we achieved $1.82 in earnings per share, which was well above
the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 186 million shares.

Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record
revenue of $919 million, up 2%. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $622 million, up 3%, driven by strength across
the 5G ecosystem, O-RAN adoption and investment in 400-gigabit and 800-gigabit R&D.

Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $297 million, up slightly from the same
quarter last year as solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted
revenue in the U.S. and Europe.

The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $375 million, up 18% on a
reported and core basis, driven by strength in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported record gross
margin of 66% and record operating margin of 36%.

Given tightening supply chain constraints and trade headwinds, we are very pleased with our full year
results. In FY '21, revenue totaled $4.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 15% on a core basis. Gross
margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 65%. We continue to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue
or $788 million for the year, while operating margin improved 260 basis points to 28%. On the strength of
this performance, we have achieved our long-term operating margin target of 26% to 27%, 2 years ahead
of plan. FY '21 non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $6.23 per share, up 28%.

Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and cash
equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $368 million and free cash flow of $295 million. Total
free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue and 99% non-GAAP net income.

As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share purchase
authorization of $1.2 billion, effective immediately. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we
acquired approximately 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $171 for a total
consideration of $353 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 4.4
million shares at an average share price of $154 for a total consideration of $673 million or 59% of free
cash flow.

Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Despite a strong demand backdrop, supply chain constraints
continue to moderate shipment expectations. As a result, we expect first quarter 2022 revenue to be
in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.50 to
$1.56 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 185 million shares.

Looking forward to 2022, we expect supply chain to remain tight in the first half of the year. Assuming a
loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we expect full year revenue growth to be in the range
of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Interest expense is expected to be approximately
$78 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million with
increasing capacity and technology investments. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-
GAAP effective tax rate for FY '22, which assumes no change to current U.S. tax policy.

In closing, we are entering the fiscal year with strong momentum, a record backlog position and a strong
track record of operational excellence. We're encouraged by the strong dynamics across our end markets
and are competitively positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth going forward.

With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations
Thank you, Neil. Catherine, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Joseph Lima Cardoso
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. My first question is just around the full year guide. So you're guiding the
full year to 6% to 7% growth, and I'm just trying to flip that with your commentary last quarter around
expectations around a more muted seasonality. First of all, does that expectation still stands true? And if
so, does that imply that we should expect to see a similar cadence to revenue as we did in fiscal '21? Or is
there something I'm not appreciating here as I think about revenue trends for the full year, such as maybe
the benefits of the loosening of the supply chain as we head into the back half of the year?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's a great question. So yes, as we mentioned on the call, we did see the supply chain situation
tighten during the quarter, and our guidance does assume that we will see some relaxation in that
environment in the back half of the year. So if I was thinking about the seasonality for FY '22, I'd say 2
things. I think, first of all, I think we'd expect revenue to build as we move throughout the year. And then
maybe if you think about it in terms of year-over-year growth, right, our guidance of 6% to 7% for the
full year, I was thinking about that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I'd be expecting growth rates in the first
half of the year that are below that 6% to 7% level and growth rates in the back half of the year that are
slightly above 6% to 7% level so that we average that for the full year.

Joseph Lima Cardoso
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. I appreciate the color there. And then just on my second question, EISG posted record operating
margin this quarter. They were really strong. Just curious to hear what were some of the big drivers or
contributors to the margin there relative to operating margins? And just curious to hear if there was any
onetime benefits in the quarter that we should consider?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. No onetime benefits, but I mean I think the thing that comes immediately to the forefront is
obviously the extraordinarily strong revenue growth for the year, with 30% revenue growth on the year.
The demand for those products has been very strong. We've seen a very nice rebound this year in the
automotive business, the semi business. Everybody has seen the press on the continued strength in semi.
So you take that strong demand picture which has essentially sensibly allowed them to leverage their
OpEx infrastructure and drive really high levels of operating margin in the short run. I think as we look
forward, we continue to see great opportunities to continue to grow the business as well as to invest in
further technology investments to serve these end markets.

Operator

Your next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations on the solid results. Neil, I wonder if you could just dig a little bit deeper into kind of
some of the supply constraints that you're seeing out there. I think you said in your prepared comments,
it's hitting EISG stronger than Comms. I'm kind of curious, is this logistical constraints? Is it component

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

constraints? Is it a little bit of everything? And is there a dollar amount you can give us that had impacted
revenue both in the fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal first quarter?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, John. It's a great question. So first of all, I said the opposite. The impact was greater on
CSG businesses than in EISG businesses. If you think about why that is, the CSG products tend to be
more complex. They have a longer bill of materials. And so there are more parts and components that
go into building those instruments on average. And so that, just by its nature, increases the risk and the
challenges that we have to fulfill that supply chain. I think it's also true on average that the CSG products
tend to be at the higher end of the technology spectrum. And so there are fewer suppliers for those
cutting-edge technology products than for a little bit more of the mainstream products that exist within
EISG.

I think if you think about the impact to supply chain, I'd maybe lump COVID and supply chain together
because we've really seen this phenomenon over the last couple of years. And if you're starting to think
about how to quantify those impacts, I'd really kind of focus your attention, not on any one quarter,
over time, you're looking at the full fiscal years, as an example, at our order rates, right? If you look at
our history prior to 2020, we have done a pretty good job of converting our orders to revenue. There's
typically a little bit of a lag, a certain percentage of each quarter's order ship within the quarter, another
portion shift out into the following quarters.

But over the past couple of years in 2020 because of COVID and into 2021 because of supply chain, we
have seen that delta between orders and revenue grow. And so I think we estimate, if you think about it in
terms of kind of an abnormal backlog build, that abnormal backlog build over the last couple of years is in
the $300 million to $400 million range. And so I think that's the opportunity for us as we look forward to
eventually clear that backlog once the supply chain situation fixes itself. I don't expect that we'll flex that
in a quarter or 2. I think it will happen over time because the kind of the remedies of the supply chain are
going to happen over time as well. But that's the rough magnitude of what the impact has been here over
a couple of year period of time.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's really helpful color. And then, Ron, over the last several years, we, on this side of the world, have
been trying to compare and contrast sort of the 5G rollout with the 4G rollout relative to your business.
And I guess what I was hoping to do is get a little bit more color about the software strategy you're
deploying this time around, which seems like an incremental driver. I'm just kind of curious, can you size
the potential TAM opportunity that gives you, especially as the network moors from just being a backbone
for handsets and mobile to actually being a backbone for a lot of new incremental applications. And to the
extent that software and services is 1/3 of the business now, sort of how do we think about that over like
the next 3 to 5 years?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Well, thanks, John. It's very, very clear that software and services continues to be a bigger and bigger
percentage of our total business as we move from a hardware product supplier to a software-centric
solution provider, and the solutions obviously include hardware, software and services. And we've seen
great growth, obviously, in our software and our services, and they've outpaced the hardware growth.

Looking overall at 5G versus 4G, we made the decision in 2013, we announced that Agilent were going to
spin off Keysight in 2013, which we eventually did in November of 2014. But in 2013, I started working
with the team that was developing to invest in 5G and make sure that we were going to be leaders.
In 4G, we were providing a little bit more of, let's say, cash contribution to Agilent where we were not
investing as heavily in the communications rollout of 4G by a substantial amount. So we invested earlier.
We invested a greater amount as now we're roughly at 16% R&D where we used to be at approximately

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

12% of R&D. And we've gone from roughly $400 million to roughly $800 million in R&D spend over this
period of time.

But software is a key part. What we did was we consolidated our hardware development facilities into
one organization as opposed to in separate divisions. And accordingly, that enabled us to basically
provide software that could span the whole product offering. And we made an acquisition for instance of a
company called Anite, which gave us software capability. They had some capability in 4G. We moved them
over to 5G. And all this together, investing more, starting earlier, having a consistent R&D and investment
profile has really gave us the lead and caused us to be a much, much stronger provider, and I believe the
leading provider, for 5G. 5G is still growing, and we anticipate it growing for years.

I'm going to turn it over to Satish who could tell you a little bit more about our results and our growth in
not only 2021 but what he sees going forward.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Thank you, Ron. Great question. I think at the summary, we've had another record quarter for 5G. And
the drivers are scaling deployments but, equally important, is the new application space. And I think we
outplayed that as a strategy. We had to continue the progression from physical to protocol to application,
and this application area is very rich, right? As I look forward, some of these application spaces have
software as a percentage of the total value proposition in the 30%, 40%, 50% range and one we pursue
very actively.

I'll just make a few examples of these, right? So you can think of on the 5G side, O-RAN being a great
example of that; on the wireline side, the protocols with 400-gig, 800-gig getting more complex; you
look at new emerging spaces like SD-WAN, SASE and MACsec and the security domain. So you look at
the commercial comms portfolio, it's very rich in applications that really favor our strategy of being more
software-centric and one we're investing to pursue and we're generating strong results.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations

We are ready for the next question from Jim Suva of Citibank.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I had a thought about your vertical integration. You're a lot more vertically integrated than the other
companies. Has that materially benefited you during the supply chain bottlenecks? Are there like little
things, whether it be plastics or connector or housing, that held you back just as much as the other?
And I'm just trying to think about does this now cause you to even want to be a little bit more vertically
integrated? Or are you at the sweet spot of your vertical integration?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Sure, Jim. The first thing that's probably really important to note is that our differentiating technologies
that have given us the leadership position outside of the software that we have developed is
semiconductors that have very particular high-performance capabilities. And as you know, we have
an on-site fab that exists in Santa Rosa, and that fab makes gallium arsenide and indium phosphide
semiconductors. So a lot of people are having trouble now getting more custom components built, and we
build a lot of those custom components in-house. So that has definitely helped us.

Now again, if you don't have all the parts, you can't ship anything. And we are in relatively good shape
compared to other competitors, but there's no doubt that we have to make sure that we get all the
components that are needed in order to ship the product. We always will look for opportunities to integrate
provided that it makes financial sense. We feel very good about what we have in-house right now. It's not
so much the plastic pieces and things like that. There are obviously not only components but there is the
whole logistical shipping issues that the whole world is going through. So we are impacted a little bit less

than others. And I think the overall organization has done a real good job of being able to deliver during
these very challenging times.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Congratulations to you and your team at Keysight.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Thank you, Jim.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations

And then the next question goes to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Some of the defense primes have spoken to slowing Department of Defense budget outlays, and I
appreciate that Keysight reported broad-based order strength. But I was hoping you could talk a little
bit more on what you're seeing in your ADG segment and if you are experiencing any slower end market
trends, even if in certain portions of that business segment.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. So again, a pretty strong quarter for aerospace defense orders growing double digits, finishing
off a year with double-digit growth. If you look at what drove that growth, it's recovery in the macro
environment globally, stimulus spend, especially towards technology that continues to increase, both in
the U.S. and internationally and one we're capturing. We also took some concerted steps last year or 2
years ago, in fact, to take our 5G technology stack and customize it for aerospace defense applications.
And as you've probably seen, our collaboration with Lockheed Martin that we announced, so we're very
pleased with the progression that we're making with commercial technologies that are getting adopted. So
all of these are pretty favorable.

We are observing that right now, we are under continuing resolution from a budget perspective in the U.S.
But if you look at the budget that has been put in place or that has been proposed, and if it's approved,
it does call for a year-over-year increase and also increased spend in technology, our RDT&E line item,
which we view as a favorable dynamic. Peripherally, the Infrastructure Bill that is getting through the
Congress has some sustained spend outlays for EV and broadband and semiconductor, which we also think
is favorable for us.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's really helpful color. And my follow-up question was on the supply chain and if you could talk in a
bit more depth around what is leading to your comments of potential alleviation in the second half of this
coming fiscal year.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I mean the supply chain situation is very dynamic, I guess, I would start by saying that. And we have
very close relationships with our key suppliers and are in constant dialogue with them during this period of
time to make sure that we are procuring the parts that are necessary to meet the needs of our customers.
I think our confidence and our guide reflects the start of a recovery in the supply chain situation in the
back half, and that stems from direct indications that we've got from key suppliers within our supply chain
environment.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations

Okay. Great. Thanks for that, Mark. We'll move over to Tim Long from Barclays.

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Two, if I could. Maybe on the wireless side, could you talk a little bit about kind of the impact of C-band
and current views on millimeter wave? And particularly with the C-band, any impacts from these potential
delays with the FAA, et cetera? And then secondly, maybe, Neil, could you just kind of update us --
obviously, it'd been a great period of margin expansion. Can you talk a little bit, give us an updated view
on kind of leverage and incremental margin growth and operating from these levels?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

I'll make a few comments on 5G. As we stated before, the continuing deployments that are going on,
especially in the low frequency bands across the world, we view it as a favorable dynamic, specifically
the C-band auction was a near-term catalyst. And we've had some strong results, as I mentioned, strong
double-digit growth in 5G this quarter, capping off a double-digit growth in 5G for the full fiscal year. And
a big part of that was driven by the C-band auction and the related investments that are going on in the
Americas.

Our Americas business grew the strongest in our 5G from a regional perspective, and we also saw our
FR1, our low frequency business, double year-over-year. So very strong results, all the while when our
millimeter wave business has been pretty stable this year. And as we have mentioned before, in the
medium term, we're expecting that the millimeter wave adoption continues to rise in a very steady
manner and we're watching for the Beijing Olympics use cases to emerge from the success of the Beijing
Olympics that we expect to occur next year.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Tim, to your second question, yes, we've obviously had a great run here in terms of margin
expansion since the birth of Keysight, adding 800 basis points approximately to gross margins, about
1,000 basis points to operating margins. And I think the key point is that as we look forward over the
longer term, we continue to see opportunities for further expansion of margins within the Keysight
portfolio.

I think as we look to next year, it's a really dynamic time, obviously, with supply chain pressures putting a
little bit of a governor on revenue. At the same time, we've got inflationary pressures across the broader
economy. And then the other thing that we're looking to that's a little bit of a cost up within next year
is, hopefully, a return to kind of a post-COVID or a pre-COVID normal in terms of our general operating
environment. And that includes the costs associated with the facilities management as we return to the
office, increased travel as people get back out and start seeing customers and conducting more business
in person rather than over Zoom.

And maybe the last point being that we invested in R&D this year, just under 16% of revenue. I think we
continue to see great opportunities to invest in technology and bring new solutions into the marketplace.
I think you're likely to see R&D tick upward next year in the kind of mid-16% range. So from those
perspectives, I think FY '22 may be a bit of a catch-up year. But over the longer term, a lot of opportunity
as we expand our software portfolio, expand our solutions portfolio, continue to work with customers
and provide them with first-to-market solutions to continue to drive both gross and operating margins
northward.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations

And the next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

Nicholas Alexander Heisler
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

This is Nick on for Matthew. Congrats on the quarter. So just first, I wanted to talk about CapEx that you
had kind of like guided picking up next year. I just wanted to know what's driving that uplift and whether
that should carry on into future years. Is that sustainable? Or is there a specific project that's going on?
And I have a follow-up.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's a great question, Nick. So we talked about in this recently completed fiscal year that we expected
a couple of years of elevated CapEx as a result of some efforts to improve the resiliency of our supply
chain. And that, in fact, did pan out with CapEx of approximately $175 million this year. I think in addition
to continuing those investments, we see incremental investments that are necessary as we continue to
expand our own capacity and invest in key technologies to drive the future growth of our business. So I
think those are additive.

Given everything that's happening across the economic sphere today, there is, relative to what we
were seeing this time last year, an increased need to spend money on capacity investments here within
Keysight. And so I do not believe that the approximately $250 million of CapEx that we've communicated
for next year is the new steady state. That is not the case. That steady state is significantly lower, a little
bit difficult to call at this point, but materially lower than the $250 million that we're indicating for FY '22.

Nicholas Alexander Heisler
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up on the competitive environment. I mean there
are a few puts and takes that I'm just thinking about, and I was wondering you could provide some color.
On the one hand, a lot of competitors are having a harder time sending out shipments. Does that create
a positive pricing environment? And then a slightly different angle, one of your competitors recently made
some EV acquisitions, just how you think about EISG from the competitive landscape going forward.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Very strong performance in our EISG business. Again, strength, as I mentioned, in the semiconductor
where new wafer starts are really enabling us to continue to drive growth there, a very strong year, again,
building off of a strong double-digit year last year in semiconductor as well. So when I think about what
we're doing there, we're definitely taking share and we are continuing to invest to keep that portfolio
growing and capitalizing on the environment we see with semiconductor.

With regard to automotive, it's been a newer market entry for us, relatively speaking. We started this
in spin. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And if you look at this fiscal year, we've
had some wins in the manufacturing expansions that have happened in the EV sector. And as we shore
up our contributions in the AV market, we've announced a partnership with NIO, as an example, of what
we're doing by extending our 5G technology stack in C-V2X. In summary, all in all, you look at our entire
portfolio for automotive, it is growing and it is much more comprehensive than any of our traditional
competitors at this point and we are continuing to invest in growing that business. So overall, pleased with
where we find ourselves with the EISG business.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

And your second question, which was with competitors having a little tougher time on shipments, are we
going ahead and taking advantage of that for pricing, the answer is no. We're in this for the long haul
with customers. We've been, back from the original Hewlett-Packard days, over 80 years working with
customers. And we're not taking advantage of them. Where costs are up in certain areas for shipments

and others, we will do price increases, but not because of any competitive position or hard ability for our
customers to get products from competitors.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations

Next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of UBS.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

The company in the past has talked to industry growth in the 3% to 5% range with expectations for about
100 to 200 bps of outgrowth for Keysight, above the industry. But when we look at it over the last 4 years
now, the company has been growing about 10% organically per annum. I guess my question is, is this
level of growth more so driven by just much stronger industry growth over the last 4 years or just better
Keysight outgrowth or a combination of both? Can you just kind of help us unpack how we kind of bridge
that gap?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

I'll make a couple of comments and then turn it over. I think it's a combination of 2. There's no doubt
that we've seen more growth and more opportunity in 5G. But as we see the digitization of everything,
the market is, there is no doubt, a great place to be. And we have a very diversified portfolio. We're
seeing growth in semiconductor. We're seeing growth in Industry 4.0. We're seeing growth all across
our real stated growth initiatives and the markets that we've gone after. So there is no doubt we pick
markets that are winning, and we have been growing faster than the market in general. And I think
the execution of the team, the investment that we have and our strategy of providing customers with
total solutions, is unmatched in the industry. Others are trying to mimic it to a certain extent, but I do
believe with our outstanding sales force, sales support organization, our overall organization that provides
hardware, software and, we'll call it, partnership with key market makers, it makes a huge difference on
how successful we are.

So I'll stop there, and Satish may want to make another comment.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes, Ron, I think you're absolutely right. With regard to what we see in the marketplace, it's this
expanding ecosystem. As we have expanded our portfolio from just products to offering total solutions to
customers, we remain focused on the end markets that we've called out. Another angle to this, that Mark
Wallace can add, is the customer adds that occurs as this expanding contribution that we're making.

Mark A. Wallace
Senior VP & Head of Global Sales

Yes. Thanks, Satish. Chris, to add to this, I think our go-to market, the investments we've made in sales
and marketing and customer engagement is making a big difference. As you've heard, we had strong
double-digit order growth across all regions and all end markets not just for Q4 but for the entire fiscal
year. So this is a very sustaining effect that we've had as we engage with the market leaders, implanting
our solutions engineers to help innovate with customers. Our largest customers have grown substantially.
Our long tail of small and medium-sized business customers have grown. And as Ron has mentioned in the
prepared statements, we continue to add new customers every quarter and every year, more than 2,000
were added during fiscal year '21, which creates sustaining opportunities for us going forward, diversifies
our business.

And then it's not just all about our direct channel, we have a very strong partnership or partner channel,
with the indirect channel distribution sales helping us reach more than 30,000 customers per year. And
we're seeing continued adoption and growth from our e-commerce channels as well. So we have multiple
ways to serve our customers and deliver these great solutions. And I think that's a big part of it, too.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I appreciate all of that color from everybody. I guess my follow-up would be, so in terms of the above-
normal industry growth, how long can that last? And is it reasonable to think that lasts until 5G peaks,
which I believe is expected maybe in the '23 or '24 time frame? And then in addition to that, is there any
reason why we should expect Keysight outgrowth over the market to compress back to the 100 or 200 bps
kind of guided levels just given the R&D scale investment advantage the company has?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

If we were sitting at a total of, let's say, 60% market share or 70% market share, you may say that
there's diminishing returns. But when we look overall where we are, we're in the 25% to 30% range.
We have a lot of headroom, and I believe it's going to go way past 5G. 5G, whether you're talking '24 or
whatever your perspective is on that, we're already investing in 6G. We're investing in EV. We're investing
in AV. And there are so many more opportunities that are being put right in front of us or that we see. We
are aiming to go ahead and outgrow the market for many, many years.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

The only thing I would add to that is our ability to spend $800 million a year in R&D as a real differentiator
in the marketplace and I think goes to at least to indicate what our ability to continue to outperform the
broader market should be over time.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations

Next question comes from the line of Rob Mason at Baird.

Robert W. Mason
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Can you hear me?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Yes, we can hear you, Rob. Go ahead.

Robert W. Mason
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. I did have a clarification question just on the first quarter guidance. So I guess, Neil, maybe this is
directed to you. Is the assumption that margins would be down year-over-year within your guidance? I'm
not sure I totally caught your below-the-line guidance.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. All I said was relative to where we just finished Q4 -- we finished the year at 15.9% R&D investment,
it was 1 point lower than that in the fourth quarter. And I think we look and see a tremendous amount
of opportunity for us to invest via the R&D line to bring new technologies to market. So I think over the
course of FY '22, you could expect us to return our R&D spend more into that mid-16% kind of a range,
which will obviously have a little bit of a pressure on margins.

The only other thing I would say is, in Q4, we did have a very favorable product mix within the quarter.
At least as we see Q1 taking shape, we expect mix on a sequential basis to be a little bit less favorable.
And then there are some normal items for Keysight that also typically impact Q1, most notably that we do

company-wide salary administration in the first quarter. And given the inflationary environment that we're
in, that is a larger-than-typical salary increase this Q1.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

And again, that's compared to Q4, which was a 31% operating margin. That was a very, very high record.

Robert W. Mason
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Right. Your expectation, within 10% type EPS growth, how would your assumptions around incentive
compensation play out on a year-over-year basis?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So obviously, there's 2 components to our incentive programs. There's the incentive programs for the
broader employee base, which are driven based on the organic growth rate of the company as well as our
operating margins. And so those would be the true drivers there. I think for the executive population's
ability to grow EPS, and this is really cash compensation portion, its ability to grow EPS and grow the top
line. And over the longer term, our primary source of variable compensation is based on total shareholder
return. And so I think as we look forward to FY '22, we're seeing wages up significantly as a result of kind
of the broader inflationary environment, and that's being offset by a decrease in the broader variable pay
programs.

Robert W. Mason
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Just a quick follow-up. With respect to your capital allocation plan, could you just give us an update
on how you view the M&A pipeline, maybe where your focus would be at this point?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Absolutely, Ron?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. Again, in our target markets, what we're looking to do is provide total solutions. And there's no doubt
if there are certain parts or components of a total solution that we need, that would be the first priority.
The second thing that we're doing is we're expanding into adjacent markets. As Satish had mentioned
earlier, we started off in 5G or 4G, mostly on the physical layer, going ahead and providing solutions there.
Then we moved up into the protocol layer. And now you can see we're in the application layer and security.
So we continue to look for adjacent opportunities also. That is what we're looking at. We have a very
robust funnel, but we also have very high hurdles. So we have the ability to not only make the acquisitions
that we need to make but also to return cash to the shareholders. And that's why we announced $1.2
billion share buyback program.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations

Thank you, Rob. Next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson, Davis.

Adam Robert Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

Just a quick one on margins. I'm curious how you guys are thinking about operating margin improvement
by segment. You had a great year at EISG. I just wonder if that creates a tough comp for you or if you can
even build off of the '21 result.

16

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Certainly, obviously, a very tough comp for EISG given the strong results not just within the quarter
where they reached up into the upper 30s, 36%, but for the full year here. I think we have opportunities
to increase margins across both segments. I think we have initiatives in place across both segments
to increase software content, to increase solutions content and to increase the value added that we're
bringing to customers. And so I think if you think about opportunities in EV, in IoT for EISG and, of
course, in not just 5G but 6G and quantum and aerospace defense on the CSG side, there's ample market
opportunity for us to continue to increase the value add that Keysight brings to our customers. And I think
as we do that, that has a chance to be margin accretive across both groups.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations

Great. Thanks, Adam. So well, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to thank
you all for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming conferences. So
thanks, again, and have a great day.
