AMGEN INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

My name is Erica, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter 2020
Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvin Sood, Vice
President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may begin.

Arvind Sood
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our Q2 call. This call is going to feel a bit
different than our previous earnings calls because we are making some changes. As a matter of fact, in
response to feedback from many of you that our prepared comments are too long, we are going to limit
our prepared comments to around 20 minutes. We'll also limit the duration of the call to 1 hour. Now that
doesn't mean that we are scaling back on disclosure. You'll notice our press release has been enriched to
provide explanations that were previously included in our prepared comments. We think this approach will
free up time for Q&A. But to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to ask a question, we are still
going to request that you stick to asking only 1 question.

The slides have been posted but will not match up to our prepared comments, given the brevity. Just
a quick reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation and some of the
statements will be forward-looking. Our 10-K and other filings identify factors that could cause our actual
results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President

Okay. Thank you, Arvin, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. As we look back at the first 6
months of the year and project forward to the second half, I'm very aware that we're still in the midst of a
really significant global public health challenge and deep economic downturn. In that context, our results,
which includes 6% revenues growth and driven by 13% volume growth. These are strong results, and they
reflect the resilience of our people, strength of our operating systems and our success in continuing to
supply every patient every time with the medicines they need.

We remain confident in the long-term growth potential of innovative medicines like Otezla, Repatha, Prolia,
EVENITY and Aimovig as well as our expanding portfolio of marketed biosimilars. Even in the second
quarter, when we felt the depths of the pandemic, we delivered. Murdo will have more to say about that
later and also about how we're navigating commercially through what remains a very dynamic week-by-
week situation, especially in the U.S. and other parts of the world.

As we find new ways to meet the needs of current patients, we're excited about the potential of the
medicines in our pipeline to enable us to serve many more patients in the future. We expect readouts in
the second half of the year for sotorasib, which, of course, is our AMG 510 in non-small cell lung cancer;
tezepelumab in severe asthma; and omecamtiv mecarbil in heart failure. Encouragingly, we've restarted
many of the earlier-stage clinical trials that we put on hold due to COVID-19 at the end of the first quarter
and beginning of the second. We're also exploring Otezla as a potential treatment for patients with
COVID-19, and you'll hear Dave say more about that in a moment.

In an environment of ongoing uncertainty, our strong financial position provides us with competitive
flexibility. And as Peter will discuss in a moment, our financial strength enables us to continue to invest
in the long-term growth of our business internally and externally, while also returning capital to our
shareholders.

We demonstrated tight control of expenses in the first half of the year. With health care systems operating
more normally now, we expect to increase expenses, including for activities that were curtailed in parts of
the first and second quarters.

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

We're in a strong position heading into the second half of the year, and I just want to take a moment
to thank the Amgen staff all around the world in their steadfast support of our mission. I also want to
express our profound appreciation for all our partners in the health care community for the support
that they've shown to the patients that we're trying to serve together. Look forward to answering your
questions later on our call. But right now, let me turn it over to Murdo.

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Thank you, Bob. We continue to focus on growing volume across our diverse portfolio, while expanding our
business geographically. Despite the challenges introduced by COVID-19, we executed effectively in Q2,
growing year-over-year global revenues by 6%, with 13% from volume. Our U.S. business grew 7% with
14% from volume, and our ex U.S. business grew volume by 11%, posting nearly $1.5 billion in sales.

As expected, during Q2, we experienced varying degrees of impact from COVID-19 across our portfolio.
Exiting Q1 and through the first part of Q2, we saw interruptions to physician-patient interactions that
led to delays in diagnosis and treatment. During the quarter, certain professional medical societies,
such as NCCN and others, introduced treatment guidelines to assist in decision-making during the
pandemic. Implementation of those guidelines had varying degrees of impact on prescribing for some
of our products. For example, Prolia, which addresses an older, more vulnerable patient population and
requires in-office administration, experienced greater negative impact early in the quarter.

In the case of Nplate, we saw a transition to competing oral alternatives as patients look to limit
their visits to doctors' offices. XGEVA was also impacted by fewer patient visits and NCCN's recent
recommendation to prioritize primary cancer treatments over bone-targeting agents. In contrast, Neulasta
Onpro benefited during the quarter as it provides a convenient solution to help patients avoid additional
visits to their site of care post chemotherapy. As physicians and patients learned more about ways to
reduce the risk of COVID infections, and as local conditions improved in many countries and states, we
saw some recovery during the second half of the quarter.

Let me just spend a few minutes discussing steps we've taken to provide continuity of care for patients
during the pandemic. In bone health with Prolia, we implemented programs to address issues such as
identifying alternate sites of care, mobile nurse-administered injections and prescription fills at specialty
and retail pharmacies. Given Prolia's 6-month dosing schedule, we're keeping a close eye on further
disruptions for the balance of 2020 and into 2021.

With EVENITY, we continue to see this product as a complementary growth opportunity with its unique
bone-building profile and usage in high-risk post-fracture patients.

Within cardiovascular, total Repatha prescriptions grew quarter-over-quarter, in part because of access and
affordability improvements. We experienced a reduction in new prescriptions in April due to COVID-19,
but saw improvements later in the quarter. While we're pleased with the new patient growth in Repatha,
we're disappointed by CVS's decision to remove Repatha from its national formulary as of July 1, which
will negatively impact total prescription growth in the third quarter. However, even with this formulary
change, we continue to have segment-leading coverage in the PCSK9 class, with 75% of lives covered.
And given the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients, we remain very
confident in our ability to grow Repatha.

Moving to inflammation portfolio, Otezla TRx growth remains strong in the quarter. Otezla grew in new-to-
brand prescriptions and maintained a leading NBRx share, despite a decline in NBRx volume for the overall
psoriasis market due to COVID-19. Otezla has proved to be a convenient option for patients due in part
to its oral administration and lack of required lab monitoring. Otezla performance is tracking ahead of our
original expectations in part due to exceptional integration.

With Enbrel, the pace of growth in the RA market slowed this quarter, causing a greater decline in overall
market unit volume than past quarters. Consistent with prior results, we anticipate volume and net price
trends for Enbrel to continue through 2020. Enbrel is a cornerstone of our inflammation therapeutic area,
behind which we continue to invest, especially given the reaffirmation of Enbrel's intellectual property. We

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

also continue to find promotional synergies across our inflammation portfolio of Otezla, Enbrel, AMGEVITA
and recently launched AVSOLA, our biosimilar to infliximab.

Moving to our biosimilar products. They generated $357 million in sales in Q2. As a reminder, these
products are promoted by the same teams as our branded products, making for an efficient commercial
model. As we talk with customers, they increasingly recognize the value proposition of Amgen's
biosimilars, given their high quality, reliable supply and cost savings they provide.

In late Q1 and early Q2, social distancing measures also led to medical distancing. Looking ahead, we
see a different pattern in the second half of 2020. While social distancing remains a critical behavior to
minimize the risk of COVID infection, we see providers and payers encouraging patients to stay in touch
with their doctors and to continue to seek medical care, either by telemedicine or through in-person
appointments.

While certain parts of the U.S. and other countries have observed an increase in COVID-19 infections, our
conversation with customers indicates that they are better prepared to handle spikes in cases as compared
to 4 months ago. We continue to be vigilant and watch the spread of the virus as additional patient care
disruptions could occur.

I am very appreciative of the hard work of Amgen employees through these challenging times. We remain
focused on ensuring continuity of care for patients, including executing on investments in the second half
of 2020 to drive growth of our markets and products, continue our geographic expansion and prepare for
potential new product launches. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave Reese.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with an update on our clinical trial execution as
we look forward to important data sets in the second half of 2020. Enrollment in our clinical studies has
rebounded in recent weeks, and we have resumed enrollment to most of the studies that we paused due
to COVID-19. Going forward, we expect to make additional investments in the second half of the year as
enrollment increases in our clinical studies and work in our research labs approaches pre-COVID levels.
We're also putting in place strategies to mitigate the uncertainties in clinical research created by any
potential regional outbreaks of COVID-19.

Importantly, our pivotal studies for sotorasib, tezepelumab and omecamtiv mecarbil remain on track, and
we continue to expect high-quality data sets from these trials later in the year. We have also initiated
new trials, including the sotorasib Phase III lung cancer study and several sotorasib Phase I combination
cohorts. Finally, we continue to make progress with our half-life extended BiTE programs, and as
previously communicated, anticipate sharing initial data for AMG 701 targeting BCMA; AMG 757 targeting
DLL3 at meetings in the second half of 2020.

Initial data from the AMG 160 program targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, will be
presented at the virtual ESMO meeting in September. We will be presenting an update on our sotorasib
Phase I non-small cell lung cancer cohort, including initial biomarker data at ESMO as well.

In our mid-stage pipeline, based on encouraging Phase I data in patients with elevated Lp(a), AMG 890 or
short interfering RNA or siRNA has now entered Phase II development. In inflammation, with AstraZeneca,
we made a strategic decision to discontinue the Phase II trial of tezepelumab in atopic dermatitis after
reviewing the 16-week top line data. No new safety signals were observed, and this decision has no
impact on the ongoing studies in asthma and COPD.

Let me conclude by saying a few words about our efforts against COVID-19. We are investigating Otezla
in multiple platform trials as a potential immunomodulatory treatment in patients hospitalized with
viral infection, and the first of these studies should be announced in the coming days. In our pursuit of
therapeutic antibodies, we are taking an orthogonal approach by focusing our efforts on the development
of antibodies against targets other than the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, the RBD. The goal here
being to develop an antibody complementary to the first generation therapies.

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

I'll be happy to discuss these or any other topics further in the Q&A session. Before I hand off to Peter,
I'd like to thank all of our staff for continuing to deliver for patients during a difficult and important time.
Peter?

Peter H. Griffith
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon. Hope everyone is healthy and safe. Let's turn to the business. Our
confidence in the growth potential of our business remains strong. This is exemplified by our solid
execution in the second quarter. You will find our detailed Q2 results in the press release.

Let me provide some summary comments on how I view the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we
delivered 6% revenue growth and 7% non-GAAP EPS growth during the second quarter in a challenging
environment. We are particularly pleased with revenue growth, driven largely by unit volume increases in
Otezla, biosimilars, EVENITY and Repatha.

Operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to invest to drive growth, while
recognizing COVID-19-related expense slowdowns. These slowdowns were pronounced in the second
quarter, including a slowing of clinical trial activity. However, we exited the second quarter with an
acceleration of activity as most trials were initiating clinical sites and enrolling patients.

Overall, we expect to increase investment in the second half of the year.

We have a strong balance sheet and cash position. This position was further strengthened in the second
quarter with free cash flow of $2.7 billion and our debt issuance of $4 billion at attractive rates. Our capital
allocation principles and plans remain unchanged and uninterrupted. Investment in both internal and
external innovation remains the cornerstone of our long-term growth.

Earlier this month, we announced an additional $421 million of investment in BeiGene, reflecting our
confidence in our ongoing collaboration with them. Further underscoring our confidence in generating free
cash flow, we continue to return capital to shareholders through both growing dividends and opportunistic
share repurchases.

Let me now share some thoughts on our outlook going forward. We experienced a negative impact from
COVID-19 on our sales early in the second quarter, but began to see a general recovery in the second
half of the quarter. The more recent resurgence of COVID-19 infection in parts of the United States and
certain other countries creates significant uncertainty, both in the magnitude and the specific timing of
the recovery. This could cause fluctuation in our quarterly revenues and earnings over the duration of the
pandemic.

Despite this uncertainty, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion. We are
updating our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $15.10 to $15.75 versus prior guidance of $14.85
to $15.60. This reflects our confidence in our underlying business continuing to deliver for patients.

For the full year, we continue to expect total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the high-single-
digit percentage range year-over-year with the breakdown as follows: cost of sales as a percent of product
sales to be generally consistent with 2019; in R&D, we plan to increase investments in the second half of
the year, including in our innovative pipeline and as clinical trial and lab activity accelerate; SG&A spend is
projected to increase primarily due to Otezla, geographic expansion and launch preparations for our late-
stage pipeline.

I would reemphasize that we expect operating expenses to meaningfully increase in the second half of the
year as the recovery continues. This increase reflects, first, investments in our pipeline as well as launch
preparations. And secondly, the typical historical spend pattern for our business.

We anticipate non-GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense of about $1.4 billion. We continue
to expect share repurchases at an amount at the lower end of our previously disclosed range of $3 billion
to $5 billion. And I, too, would like to thank all of my colleagues around the world for their commitment to
the Amgen difference to patients. This concludes the financial update.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Evan Seigerman with Crédit Suisse.

Evan David Seigerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And I appreciate the new format of the call. So I'm looking at the -- I'm curious on the tezepelumab Phase
II atopic dermatitis data. Did you see any signal in this trial? And more importantly, is there any read-
through to the Phase III asthma trial expected later this year?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Thanks, Evan, this is Dave. I'll take that question. While there was some evidence of activity on some
disease measures, we just have top line data right now. We've got a number of additional analyses,
including biomarker analyses to do. Importantly, I really don't think there's much read-through at all to
asthma and, in fact, the best insights that we have into the activity of the drug in asthma or the large
Phase II study that we previously conducted in asthma across the range of patients with both eosinophil
high and eosinophil low forms of the disease. So we're on track, as I mentioned, for the readout of those
data, and this doesn't really change our point of view on asthma.

Operator

Your next question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen.

Yaron Benjamin Werber
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. I have maybe a quick question on biosimilars. And again, you continue to really capture a lot of
share. You're sort of in the 30s already with MVASI and KANJINTI. You've had some destocking, and now
it sounds like you obviously are continuing to expect some competition coming in. So I want to know, give
us a sense kind of, if you can, where are you sitting with inventories? And how much competition or how
impactful of a competition do you think will be given that you're capturing share? And how quickly would
AVSOLA really be a meaningful contributor?

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Yes. Thanks, Yaron, it's Murdo. We are very pleased with the performance of the biosimilar portfolio and,
specifically, the 2 that you highlighted, MVASI and KANJINTI, which, quite frankly, in the period of time
that's been disrupted by COVID. I think providers are looking for a lot of places where they can extract
more value in the health care system, so we've been pleased with the uptake. As you mentioned, we're in
the high 30s with MVASI, mid-30s with KANJINTI, and we don't see those trends slowing right now given
competition. So that's the first comment I would make.

And overall inventories, there's been no real build there over the last few weeks. So we continue to see
normal inventory levels in the biosimilars market. I would say, to your point on competitive dynamics
overall, as more entrants come into the market, I would say we're less challenged on share, but you might
see some net price effects of multiple competitors entering.

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President

Murdo, do you want to touch on AVSOLA, which was one of the other questions Yaron asked.

Murdo Gordon

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Thanks for the prompt, Bob. Yes, we're pleased. We just recently launched AVSOLA at the beginning of
July, our biosimilar to infliximab. It's early days, so I don't really have any performance metrics to provide
with you. It is a nice addition to our strong inflammation portfolio with Enbrel, Otezla, AVSOLA and soon
some other biosimilars as well, as hopefully, tezepelumab, so really strengthening our portfolio overall.

We are a little late on this one. So we're going to see how we do in the market versus the existing
competitors, but we have a strong team there. And just like we did with oncology, where we use our
innovative field force who have existing relationships with providers to commercialize our biosimilars,
we're doing the same thing in inflammation.

Operator

Your next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.

Jay Olson
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on an impressive quarter during difficult times. I'm curious about the comments you
made regarding mobile administration of Prolia. Is that a temporary strategy to navigate the pandemic?
Or is that something you consider more of a permanent arrangement? And if so, would you also consider
providing home infusion for other Amgen drugs besides Prolia?

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Thanks for the question, Jay. The Prolia story is one that I'm really thankful for. That team mobilized
very quickly around the world, wasn't just in the U.S. Prolia is, in many markets, actually a hospital-
administered product. And if I can use Italy as an example, we actually were able to do home delivery of
Prolia for Italian patients, if you recall, with the spike that they had with COVID in Northern Italy.

In the U.S., we worked closely actually with CMS and even the FDA to ensure that we were appropriately
opening up alternate sites of care for Prolia patients. And we were successful in securing this mobile nurse
platform that you alluded to. We also actually opened up the possibility of home infusion or injection in
this case with Prolia and, potentially, even self-administration. We've developed, with input from the FDA,
a self-administration kit.

I would say it this way, I would say the vast majority of Prolia administrations are still in-office and
continue to be as long as we have relatively open access to physician practices and physicians have
evolved and are adapting to COVID by helping create safe waiting rooms and safe care environment for
patients.

However, should there be additional spikes in COVID or additional disruption to that patient care, we
believe we've opened up other channels that we feel good about in helping patients have continuity of
care.

And as to the long-term possibility of this, I think, look, we see a lot of innovations during COVID that
could persist. There are definitely some reimbursement mechanisms with Prolia being a Part B product
that make that a little more difficult. But with time and experience, we'll know more on how to continue to
make Prolia available to patients.

Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.

Terence C. Flynn
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Dave, I was just wondering as you think about your BiTE platform here, is your confidence level in the
platform the same in terms of the heme indications versus the solid tumor indications? Just wanted to kind

of get a sense from you. I know you've made some comments before about solid tumor activity, but just
curious on kind of how you view that lately.

And then can you just remind us of the design of the 160 Phase I study that's going to be at ESMO, and
maybe what you're hoping to see to advance into Phase II?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned, we're going to be presenting at ESMO the 160 data. We've
got 2 of the BiTE programs moving along in solid tumors, that one and the program targeting DLL3
in small cell lung cancer. Both of those are in dose escalation, so you're going to see the initial dose
escalation from 160 at ESMO.

I would say we're seeing interesting hints of activity. You'll get a look at those data as we move forward.
It's still early days, and we're still dose ranging. But I think we remain confident in the half-life extended
BiTE platform, and we're looking forward to pushing those studies through dose escalation.

Operator

Your next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.

Geoffrey Christopher Meacham
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Bob, I wanted to get your thoughts on the drug pricing and other executive orders. I didn't hear much
about it in the prepared remarks. And so the question is would you expect implementation in its current
form? And as written, where would you imagine would be the greatest exposure relative to the Amgen
portfolio?

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President

Geoff, I would just say it's early days still. We're looking forward to seeing the actual language behind
these executive orders. And we're pleased that one of the executive orders addresses the rebate
mechanism. And we're very focused on, as you know, our view is the nation needs more innovation, not
less. And the nation needs to have less innovations sitting stock on pharmacy shelves and making its way
to patients. And one way to do that is to try to bring down the out-of-pocket cost for, in particular, seniors
of the pharmacy. And we think the rebate rule, the executive order, as we understand it anyway, opens the
door for that. So that feels constructive.

Obviously, there's a lot of focus as well, Geoff, on this most favored nation or IPI-like executive order. But
as far as I'm aware, the language on that is not available yet. And obviously, for us and I think for all the
innovators in our industry, the idea of importing prices from socialized medicine countries where there are
all kinds of other access problems for innovative medicines like ours, unlike those which U.S. citizens have
access to, we think, is problematic.

Now the good news for seniors in the United States is virtually all the innovative cancer medicines that you
ask us about and that we're so excited about are available to our citizens. And it's a very different picture
in other parts of the world, including other parts of the world that that order might reference. So we will
watch with concern, but we think there are better ways to address the issue than that approach. So stay
tuned. I'm sure there'll be more information on it as time passes.

Just with regard to Aimovig. Some of our checks we've done recently indicate there's a pretty decent
level of receptivity to oral CGRPs in the prevention setting once those options are labeled. Maybe, Murdo,
maybe just sort of talk about your view of sort of the longevity of subcu CGRPs in general, and maybe
Aimovig in particular, even when there's an oral option available in that setting.

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Thanks for the question, Chris. Yes. The overall, we have to just reflect on the huge unmet need with
migraine here. We are barely penetrating roughly a 4 million incident patient population where there's a
significant amount of usage of older medications that just do not provide the migraine relief that Aimovig
can. And so far, we're pleased with the evolution of penetrating that unmet need with Aimovig and we're
definitely very pleased with the impact we've had on patients' lives.

What we're seeing so far with the oral agents is really they're used more as add-on treatment options
given their current indications. And I think that's actually helping further strengthen Aimovig's perception
in clinical experience for patients from neurologists. It will be interesting to see what the data look like on
the prevention side and what labeling looks like as well.

But overall, I think there's a lot of room for more patients to benefit from a CGRP-based therapy. And
we think we've got the one of the best, if not the best, given the convenient once-a-month injection, the
really strong coverage that we now have across the U.S. in terms of insured benefit and great patient
support programming to help patients, possibly even titrate up in their dosing on Aimovig. So I think a lot
of growth yet to be realized even with additional entrants in the market.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. This is Dave. Chris, this is Dave. I would just add that, obviously, we'll be looking at long-term safety
with the small molecules when you get to chronic administration. And we're very happy with the long-term
safety profile now extending 4 years in some patients with Aimovig.

Your next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.

Aaron Gal
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Question is for David. First, if you don't mind clarifying, you kind of mentioned the tezepelumab data in
atopic dermatitis. You haven't mentioned the safety side in the Phase II in asthma. You did see a case in
Guillain-Barre, and I guess, stroke, and there's always a concern of anaphylaxis in this population. I was
wondering if you could just clarify if we are seeing this signal repeating themselves in the atopic dermatitis
trial.

And then on the mutualizing antibody strategy, is the strategy that you're having to find in antibodies
which are complementary to the spike proteins is that coming instead of the previous strategy was to look
for the high specificity antibody? Or is this an additional strategy?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Thanks, Ronny. So in regard to the teze data, I would say there were no concerning safety signals
at all in the Phase II atopic dermatitis trial. The Phase III trial, as is standard, has an independent data
monitoring committee that, of course, periodically evaluate safety. And they have always indicated the
trial should proceed as planned, and we fully expect that that will happen to completion over the coming
few months.

In terms of our COVID-19 therapeutic antibody strategy, we -- as we have looked at the rapid evolution
of the field, most of the antibodies, as I'm sure you're aware, that have gone into the clinic, target the

RBD, receptor binding domain, of the spike protein. Our technical assessment of those antibodies is that
some of them appear to be quite good. And our belief is that we could potentially add value here to the
therapeutic armamentarium by developing an antibody, targeting another epitope, nonoverlapping, and
that could potentially be added to an antibody or a cocktail from that first generation. So that is the
strategy. We were open to that from the start, and we are now focusing on that, I would say, as we've
watched the evolution of the field.

Aaron Gal

Your next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.

Matthew Kelsey Harrison
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Dave, I was hoping to ask about the IL-2 mutein program. It seems like you made a decision not to move
ahead in RA, but there are obviously some GI indications that you and other companies are studying. Can
you just talk a little bit about your excitement or lack thereof around those other indications, and any data
you got from RA, which may influence the profile in those other indications?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. We remain quite interested in this molecule, which, again, to remind
everyone, is designed to enhance the number and function of T regulatory cells and restore some of the
dysregulation of the immune system that occurs in certain autoimmune diseases.

We knew from the start that it's a high bar in rheumatoid arthritis, given existing therapies and based
on the emerging data, elected not to go forward in that indication. I think there are a variety of other
autoimmune diseases where this is of interest, and we're continuing to push that program forward. As we
move towards additional trials, of course, we will share that with you. And we've got ongoing studies in
diseases like lupus or where there remains a significant unmet medical need.

Your next question is from Michael Yee with Jefferies.

Michael Jonathan Yee
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

A question for David on omecamtiv mecarbil, of course, a big Phase III readout and has a unique
mechanism and elegant science. Could you just put into context for us what maybe 1 or 2 things you
specifically like from the prior data and what degree of confidence you have given a high bar for a CV
outcome study, clinical meaningful magnitude of benefit? Maybe just talk a little bit about that and how
you uncap that. Appreciate it.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Thanks, Mike. As you mentioned, there's -- it's a novel mechanism of action. It's the first drug that
directly affects contractility of myocardial cells, and that's, of course, one of the primary dysfunctions in
advanced heart failure. So that's obviously a priori, one of the things that we like about the molecule.

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

In addition, I think the Phase II data, what caught our eye was the fact that there was internal consistency
when you looked across physiologic measures, the various physiologic outcome measures that are
used in mid-stage heart failure programs as well as various biomarkers. And to see that sort of internal
consistency is another thing that gives you confidence. But I would point out that we're now doing the
definitive experiment, a Phase III trial in over 8,000 patients. It's well powered. And there will be sufficient
follow-up. And so I think we're going to know the answer as to the utility of omecamtiv mecarbil in
advanced heart failure by the end of the year.

Your next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust.

Robyn Kay Shelton Karnauskas
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

So I guess 2 quick ones. What are the trends that you're seeing in the doctor's office as far as ease
of reimbursement given the economic climate? Are you having to give more free drugs? And second
question, given the environment, you talked about spending more in the back half of the year, what
about your -- any changes or new thought on -- updated thoughts on your appetite for M&A or business
development?

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Okay. Robyn, why don't I start with the first -- Yes. I'll start with the first part of your question and turn it
over to Bob for your second part of your question. Overall, we're actually pretty pleased with what we're
seeing, particularly in the latter part of the second quarter in patients accessing reimbursements for their
medications. We do have generous programs that we provide. But given the fairly significant expansion in
Repatha, Aimovig and EVENITY coverage with a permanent J code, we really have seen less need for those
programs currently. Now that could change in the longer term as some of the patients who are maybe
currently furloughed could become displaced or laid off or as patients who may be securing COBRA could
end up lapsing.

Also, many patients end up going off of their own benefits to a spousal benefit. So there's multiple
layers of how people who are losing their insurance coverage might be able to bridge through different
mechanisms. We're also hopeful and maybe even optimistic that some additional stimulus would be
provided so that patients can seek continuity of their health care coverage. But overall, I would say, so far,
so good, despite significant disruption, obviously, in our economy.

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President

And on business development, Robyn, I wouldn't point to any changes in our approach. We address this, I
think, pretty consistently on prior calls. We're looking for licensing or acquisition opportunities in the areas
of our focus. So we'll continue, I think, in particular, scouring the licensing landscape at the moment. So
we'll keep you posted as opportunities develop.

what sort of hazard ratio or benefit do you think is clinically significant, given quite a few other products
that are advancing in that setting right now?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes, Geoff, thanks for the question. What I would say is that the study is powered to detect what we
would consider a clinically meaningful difference in outcome. The primary end point as a standard for
these sorts of trials, as a composite heart failure events and cardiovascular death on the order of 15%-
or-so improvement on those measures are the sorts of things that cardiologists will typically look for and
consider clinically meaningful. And the study has been designed to detect those sorts of differences.

Umer Raffat
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just wanted to focus on KRAS for a second. A, maybe gauge your expectations on durability of
response, how you would prepare the trade heading into your data? And b, if you could catch us up on
whether there's any early evidence emerging on your BID dosing, and if you're seeing possible efficacy
differentiation with the higher AUC at BID?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Thanks, Umer. In terms of duration of response, it's still early. As I mentioned, we're going to have an
update on Phase 1 data at ESMO in roughly 6 or 7 weeks. So in that -- by the time we have those data
sets, we'll get some look at duration. In BID dosing, we continue to examine. I would expect it's going to
be later in the year or first part of the next year until we would have enough data to thoroughly examine
both safety and then whether there's any sort of efficacy difference between monotherapy and BID dosing.

I would reiterate that based on everything we've seen, we remain comfortable with the monotherapy dose
that we've chosen to go forward with. In terms of KRAS inhibition and, certainly, in lung cancer, that is our
primary focus right now.

Congrats on the progress during the quarter. Another one on omecamtiv. I know there's roughly about 3
million people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but I was hoping, Murdo, maybe you can
drill that down a little bit and help us think about maybe kind of an initial population based on how the
study is designed.

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Yes. Thanks, Alethia. I would say this, and Dave's already touched on it, given that this is a slightly sicker
population than some of the other recent heart failure trials, our focus is really in institutional setting. We
have made investments over the course of last year and this year to expand our cardiovascular hospital
presence.

We've established a cardiovascular account management team who will focus really on the more severe
hospital frequent flyer, if you will, heart failure patients who really need some symptomatic improvement
and need some functional improvement so that they can reduce the amount of hospitalization that they

have. We also think that's where, quite frankly, the greatest value in treating heart failure can exist in the
health care system. So hopefully, we have a successful trial in our hands because we still see a really good
opportunity for that type of patient.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

And I would add, Alethia, that the trial includes initiation of therapy in both hospitalized patients and
nonhospitalized patients. So as Murdo mentioned, it is a little sicker population than some of the other
trials that have read out recently. And heart failure is typically the leading or top handful of causes of
hospitalization in most countries now. It's almost always the leading cause of rehospitalization within
30 days, which has huge economic implications. And so as Murdo mentioned, these factors really have
informed our thinking about how the drug might be positioned going forward.

Your next question is from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.

Cory William Kasimov
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This one is probably for Murdo. I'm curious if you anticipate a longer-term tailwind for Neulasta Onpro that
might extend beyond COVID-19 given that more providers may see the value of the product than they
have previously. Just curious if you're able to gather any feedback from the field on this front during the
pandemic.

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Thanks, Cory. The experience so far, I mean, there's really -- there's 2 drivers of that tailwind you alluded
to. One is the overall utilization of long-acting filgrastim, in general, has gone up. And then, of course,
the innovation that is Onpro, which allows patients to have less frequent visits to their site of care has
driven some share preference for Onpro. I think we'll be able to hold quite a bit of that improvement in
our share. But I'm also hoping that oncologists remain vigilant and continue to increase their usage of
long-acting filgrastim in general, consistent with the NCCN guidelines.

Clearly, as long as COVID is out there, people should be using care strategies to minimize patients'
exposure, particularly immunocompromised patients' exposure to risk. And of course, for Onpro,
minimizing their exposure to the site of care where they may pick up an infection. So overall, I think we're
pretty enthusiastic about what we're seeing with Neulasta and with Onpro specifically.

Your next question is from Mohit Bansal with Citigroup.

Mohit Bansal
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the progress. One quick one on Aimovig. One of the common feedback we get from doctors
is that many of these patients, migraine patients, get treated by primary care physicians and not just by
a headache specialist. And that may be the reason why the penetration remains low for these agents. To
that end, how do you see current subcu CGRPs expanding to primary care? Is it even possible? And what
could a company like Amgen could do to make it possible?

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Yes. Thanks, Mohit. We do have experience with primary care physician promotion. And we do have
primary care physicians in our target audience. And there are those that specialize in treating migraine
that become good at it. And I would say that their openness to using Aimovig is actually quite good and
quite high.

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

I think one point that I would make that's adjacent to what you're describing is we definitely saw, in
COVID and even post-COVID, some bottlenecking on the part of the neurologist and to some extent, these
headache clinics in getting caught up with patient care after the March, April period of COVID disruption.
And so I think we continue to watch that closely. We're seeing good improvements, but this is a stretched
specialty, neurologists take care of a lot of different conditions, as you know. And the more we can expand
care into primary care community-based treatment, the better, I think it will be for the growth of the
category. So I would align with your observation that we need to expand the prescribing population of
physicians for CGRP. And I actually see that. That's what's happening in our data.

Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I have a question for Peter. I was hoping he could walk through the cost of goods progression in the
quarter. I appreciate the full year guidance. But in the quarter, I mean, volume was up mid-teens,
biosimilars were up meaningfully. And I believe you have a meaningful royalty in that and yet non-GAAP
COGS was only up 3%. Is this strictly sort of a COVID-19-related ability to sort of downshift? Or is there
some other nuance I'm missing? Or does it speak to some sort of broader COGS story?

Peter H. Griffith
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thank you, Carter. Yes. On cost of goods sold, it was just product mix in the first -- in the second

the year.

I'll also throw in my thanks for being a leader in the industry here in shortening the prepared remarks,
hopefully others can follow suit as well. I just had one question on omecamtiv, maybe for David. So David,
it sounds like you're pretty bold up on this trial working and hitting the 15% bogey that you mentioned.
I just want to know if there was one thing that you had to take into trial design, whether it's the sicker
patients you mentioned or maybe the slight troponin elevation that we saw in cosmic, if there was one
reason why this trial failed and didn't hit that 15% bogey, I'm curious what you believe that reason would
be.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Thanks, Salim. It's hard to speculate on a specific reason. Look, advanced heart failure is high-risk by
its nature, and we fully recognize that. We think we've done methodologically a very good trial. But at this
point, it is up to the molecule in Mother Nature, and we're going to know that answer in a few months.

where the drug is being used now? And specifically and mechanistically, how are you going to open up the
formularies to actually really unlock the more mild patient phenotype versus more of the moderate where
you already do have penetration now?

So I guess, one, on the label, how will it really read differently and open up? And then two, how are you
going to work with payers, and how is that going to change the formulary status?

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Thanks for the question, Dane. Overall, we see there's a very large population of mild to moderate
patients out there, but we're really focused on those patients that tend to have larger surface area of the
skin involved in the psoriasis, where they're really finding the topical treatments incompatible with the
nature of their disease and looking for something better, like an oral option. And I think given the strength
of the results in the clinical trial, we feel that we would be able to target and motivate that population of
patients to seek an alternative to topical treatments.

Much the way Otezla is currently used today, which is post-topical, pre-biologic, we think it's really
a logical expansion of our current positioning. From our interactions with prescribers, we've been
encouraged by their enthusiasm for what Otezla might offer these individuals, these patients.

The other thing I would say is we did, at the end of last year, initiate a primary care promotional effort
on Otezla, something that our legacy Celgene colleagues couldn't do or had not done, and we were able
to try that out. And we actually saw a good promotional response there. So we have the ability, given
the scale of our primary care field force, to add Otezla to the mix there. I think that will help grow our
commercial presence. We also are cross-training all of our Enbrel field force on Otezla to ensure that we
have maximum presence for, hopefully, an approved indication in not-too-distant future.

With respect to access, which you mentioned specifically, because again -- because of the very good cost-
benefit of Otezla compared to particularly to biologic options, we've actually got very good coverage in this
patient population today, not mild to moderate, but in the moderate to severe patient population today
that we think we will be able to expand without too much gross-to-net erosion. So we're feeling pretty
good about this growth opportunity. I'm pleased with how Otezla has performed since we integrated into
our portfolio. It is performing ahead of our expectations in TRx, and that's with some nominal COVID
pandemic impact on the overall dermatology category. So so far, so good.

what do we need to see from the KEYTRUDA combination in lung cancer, which I believe is most advanced
in development, to advance that particular combination into the next development phase?
