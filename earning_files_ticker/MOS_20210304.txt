THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Mosaic Company's First Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms.
Gagnon, you may begin.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Opening comments will be provided by
Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer, followed by a fireside chat as well as open Q&A.;
Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jenny Wang, Vice President, Global
Strategic Marketing and other members of the leadership team will also be available to [ take ] your
question.

We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are
not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's
beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release furnished
yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our fourth quarter press release
performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday's Form 8-K filing also contain important information on
these non-GAAP measures.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today. Mosaic delivered excellent results in the quarter,
with revenues up almost 30% year-over-year and the gross margin rate at the highest level since early
[Audio Gap]. And our momentum continues to build higher fertilizer prices driven by very strong global
demand, tight supply and excellent agricultural fundamentals, combined with our significantly improved
cost structure, lead us to a positive outlook for the remainder of the year.
Laura, let's [ move on to ] the analysts' questions.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Question and Answer

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we've received several questions about nutrient affordability, its impact on demand and sensitivity
to commodity prices. Specifically, how elastic does developed market demand tend to be? And how much
application elasticity do you see in emerging markets?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. Generally speaking, within normal ranges, grower demand for fertilizer is relatively price
inelastic, whether that be in developed or emerging markets. Accepting that, changes to demand
would then be driven by acreage and by yield expectations. However, growers will look at the return
on investment of fertilizer applications and particularly, if prices of crops are elevated. Or conversely,
if they're down, they will adjust their rates higher or lower in order to maximize their yield potential.
It certainly appears that last year and now this year, we're seeing signs of some of those upward
adjustments to application rates.

In India, maximum retail price is set by the government. As such, Indian farmer affordability may be
negatively impacted this year.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, a few of our analysts had questions regarding our phosphate sales volumes during the quarter. P.J.
Juvekar of Citi and Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley both asked about our sales volumes being higher
than our production volumes despite lower inventories and raw material constraints. Did Mosaic draw
down further inventory? And will that offset the sulfur impact?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, gentlemen. Our inventories do continue to be below typical levels for this time of the year. But
you must understand that this is normally the time of the year where the strong spring demand means
we will run down our inventory, and that's typical of most years. At the end of the quarter, we certainly
had lower-than-normal inventories. However, we also relied on 100,000 tonnes from Ma'aden that flowed
through the Phosphates segment.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

John Roberts of UBS and Joel Jackson of BMO asked for additional color around the sulfur market,
specifically, is the sulfur shortage only a North American phenomenon? Or are sulfur prices going up
elsewhere? Also, do we think the situation could extend into the second half of the year? And what plans
do we have in place to resolve the Q2 sulfur shortage?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, gentlemen. This year, the molten sulfur supply was constrained due to COVID impacts on
refineries. And this was exacerbated in that freeze at the February of 2021. So when you ask, is this a
local or global issue, certainly, sulfur is tight around the world, but particularly, molten sulfur is very tight
right now. So you will see that we actually melted more in our melters than we normally would, and that
was actually up 27% from a normal of about 20%. Now we do expect U.S. refinery activity to recover in
the second half, which would take us back to more normal levels.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Michael Piken of Cleveland Research, Ben Isaacson of Scotia, Andrew Wong of RBC and Steve Byrne
of Bank of America, all asked for an update on Canpotex negotiations with China. In particular, they ask
that with the domestic potash price in China now well over $100 per tonne higher than the last import
contract price and about $100 per tonne above the recent India contract price, what are the implications
for a new contract in late 2021? And what might the effect be on 2022?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. Look, Canpotex is committed through quarter 3, as they've said publicly. And we're seeing
strong demand in North America, in Brazil, in Southeast Asia, all of which were seeing prices go up. And
this price strength is also occurring in China's spot market. So we see all of those markets as having
high demand, which is shown by Canpotex' tight supply. And even India now, which was -- had an
updated contract is now well out of the money and seems to be outdated. So we see all of these things
as very positive for the potash market moving forward. And I expect they will lead to an earlier and more
constructive settlement with the Chinese at some point in the fall or early next year.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, I have a two-part question here. Michael Piken of Cleveland and Adrien Tamagno of Berenberg
and Ben Isaacson of Scotia have all asked about Mosaic Fertilizantes. First, do you have guidance for
Fertilizantes from a pricing and margin standpoint? Or how should we think about pricing and margin
progression at Fertilizantes?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. While we don't give specific guidance for Mosaic Fertilizantes, we have said that of the pricing
sensitivity we provide in our earnings materials for DAP, about 20% of that enterprise impact occurs in
Mosaic Fertilizantes.

Now also, we have historically seen distribution margins in the range of $25 to $40 per tonne. We believe
that those 2 together should give you the information you need to model our Brazil business.

In terms of cost, our quarter 1 was impacted by a few short-term issues related to mine productivity
and lower conversion rates, which are temporary in nature and should improve throughout the year. Also
remember, there are actions being taken for COVID that will impact our cost short term in Brazil as they
are in a fairly serious spot with COVID right now. Finally, depreciation of the Brazilian real has offset the
increase in inflationary pressures that we're seeing there.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

The second part to that question, Joc, was a follow-up. Could you discuss seeming disconnect between the
magnitude of price appreciation for MAP versus a much smaller increase in average realized selling prices
for Mosaic Fertilizantes sales?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. Our average selling price includes blends that have a significant amount of nitrogen, potash
and lower-grade phosphate materials in them. A portion of which will vary throughout the season and can
have a real impact on our realized pricing. Beyond that, a significant portion of Q1 sales were committed
in Q4, which contributed to the pricing lag. And that is typical in Brazil due to logistics constraints in that
country.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we've received several questions on India. In particular, John Roberts from UBS and Andrew Wong of
RBC asked about our outlook for India's agriculture business, fertilizer demand and nutrient affordability
resulting from higher retail prices. They would also like to know if COVID is having any impact.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, gentlemen. Look, good monsoons and full [Audio Gap] and even still attractive crop prices
continue to point to favorable farmer economics in India. Certainly, COVID is disrupting activity as the
country goes into lockdown. And we've seen a bit of a pause in the near-term activity. So we're waiting to
see how the country addresses the recent outbreaks.

While COVID is a near-term headwind, the underlying demand for nutrients remain significant as indicated
by the extremely low inventories and still strong crop prices. We will not speculate on subsidy changes,
but believe the government is committed to maintaining domestic food security.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, P.J. Juvekar of Citi, Seth Goldstein of Morningstar and Michael Piken of Cleveland Research have all
asked for thoughts on Chinese phosphate supply and demand. What are our expectations for Chinese
phosphate exports in 2021? And are we concerned that attractive pricing could lead to higher operating
rates?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. Our base case for 2021 shows phosphate exports relatively unchanged, and we expect them
to stay at around the 9.3 million tonnes we saw in 2020. Now clearly, and even the latest report show the
operating rates in China are up, probably exceeding 80%, but most of that is going to internal demand
inside the country. So we have seen so far, exports that are right on our expected target.

Also, there has been several structural changes that occurred last year in China. And I'm going to let
Jenny just give a little bit of background on some of the major ones there.

Jenny Wang
Vice President of Global Strategic Marketing

Sure, Joc. We've seen some structural changes in the Chinese phosphate industry since last year. On the
supply side, the Chinese largest producer, BPC, they have shifted their production from producing DAP/
MAP fertilizer to other industrialized use of P2O5. For example, they have shifted production to purified
cost assets not only for use of -- in the food industry, but also in the emerging growth of electrical vehicle
and 5G stations demand to the batteries. We see this is going to continue in 2021 and going forward.
Therefore, we are going to see less P2O5 to be produced at DAP and MAP.

The other change is really on the demand side, domestic phosphates tax growing in 2020, which has
tipped most of the increased production in Q1 at home. Therefore, we see really little export increases in
the first quarter. Over to you, Joc.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, following on this topic, John Roberts and Ben Isaacson both asked about the marginal cost phosphate
producers, specifically have costs for marginal producers tracked with phosphate pricing?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Thank you. Price increases for the integrated producers have largely outpaced production cost increases,
including those in China, to the point that most Chinese producers there are experiencing good
margins despite higher raw material costs. So now, the marginal cost producers are predominantly the
nonintegrated producers in India and particularly those that are reliant on imported phosphoric acid. Their
DAP production costs at the new Q2 phosphoric acid contract price of $998 per tonne is about $615 per
tonne, or about $50 per tonne higher than the Indian imported DAP price.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we have two questions on our global distribution businesses. First, Mark Connelly from Stephens
asked what a good across-the-cycle margin assumption for distribution is now given our operational
improvements and growth?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Mark. Historically, we've targeted around $25 a tonne for our distribution business, but we
have seen that improve with economies of scale and efficiencies. And we've seen that margin expand
recently. Scale matters, and this has led to this quarter's margin of $40 a tonne and even higher for our
combined business in India and China.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Andrew Wong of RBC also asked what China and India distribution contribute to earnings?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Andrew. In this quarter, we had a combined gross margin of the 2 businesses that sat around
$30 million. And -- but we have to understand that, that margin was enhanced by the upward trajectory of
phosphate and potash, which allows for profit from the inventory that was held by those businesses.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we have a few questions on free cash flow generation and capital allocation. First, Vincent Andrews
asked why net income increased by $300 million quarter-over-quarter, but cash flow from operations only
increased by $130 million. What are the drivers in cash flow from operations this year versus last?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Vincent. I'm going to hand this straight over to Clint to talk about our cash flow.

Clint C. Freeland
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Joc. I think there are -- specific to the year-over-year, I think a large part of that is inventory
movements between the 2 years. Last year, we were -- if you recall, we were -- we had very significant
inventories, and we're liquidating some of those excess inventories. Where this year, our inventory is built
by about $180 million mostly in Brazil and Canada. So I think a year-over-year comparison, that's what's
driving a lot of it. But also recall that every year during the first quarter, there are some pretty meaningful
accruals that are actually paid out in the first quarter. Those accruals primarily being some tax accruals
from the previous year that actually pay out and hit our free cash flow in the first quarter of every year as
well as our short-term incentive accruals that again were accrued the previous year, but paid out in the
first quarter of every year. So that's just something to keep in mind that are recurring things in the first
quarter each year.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Vice President of Investor Relations

Second related question comes from Ben Isaacson of Scotia who asks if Mosaic has revised its thoughts
on capital allocation, given the strong free cash flow Mosaic will generate this year, especially as K3 CapEx
line is down?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Ben. The simple answer here is no, we are not changing our priorities. We continue to have
a balanced approach to capital allocation, which balances debt repayment, return to shareholders and
investing in the business in high-return, quick payback projects. And there's a couple of things I'd like to
highlight here.

Earlier this year, we increased the dividend by 50%. We've committed to paying down $450 million of
long-term debt that comes due in November. And the other piece is we've had a number of really good
return projects in our transformation. And we continue to invest small but meaningfully in those high-
return, quick payback projects. So we completely remain committed to doing exactly what we've said
all along, which is balancing off all of our positions. And frankly, that's what our investors have said they
expect of us.

Thank you. That ends our fireside chat. Now I would like to open the phone lines up for any further
questions from the audience.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

You have reportedly some forward sales into the third quarter of MAP and DAP at prices with the [ 5 ] in
the front that seems like a fairly lofty price. But I have no idea whether the volume is really light. Can you
comment on how much forward sales you have into third quarter right now? And maybe compare that to
historical levels, are you seeing the distribution channel more interested in building inventories even at
these prices than normal? Or are the high prices causing kind of a pull back and a wait-and-see approach?

Unknown Executive

Standby, we've lost connection to the group. We will be right back.

[Technical Difficulty]

Hello, operator. Are we back?

Operator

All right, perfect. And Steve Byrne, your line is now open. You may ask your question, please.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. I guess you didn't like that question, Joc. Do you want me to run it by you again?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

I would love you to, I think I got 2 words into it. So it wasn't anything about your question. We love your
questions.

Steve Byrne

9

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Okay. It's really about your forward order book. There's some reported sales of phosphate, both MAP
and DAP in mid-500s, a short tonne into the third quarter, how much volume have you sold forward? And
maybe more broadly, how would you characterize the demand outlook into the fall at this point relative
to historical levels? [ Is the ag ] cycle causing that distribution channel to aggressively want to rebuild
inventories? Or is there risk that we could see a pull back and more of a wait and see until later in the
year?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Steve. And again, I apologize for the loss of connection there for a few seconds. In terms of
the forward order book, if you will, I suspect what you're referring to is, I think, late last week, we started
to have people come to us with summer fill needs. So the spring season is basically finished from our
perspective. And now the -- some of the larger retailers have come to us looking for positioning material
for the fall. It is a little early for a fall program. And frankly, we think the prices were -- we expected some
little dip in prices as you go into the summer lull. But with the tightness that is in the market globally and
then in North America, we're starting to see people come to the market earlier. So we will look at this as a
very good sign and a good sign for an early and aggressive fall application season.

Operator

Next question we have from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe along a similar line, Joc. Just trying to think about your phosphate realizations and the gap in
your -- kind of what you're talking about in terms of your second quarter price improvement versus what
we're seeing in pricing out of Tampa or NOLA, it seems like the benchmark prices have gone up more.
Is that a function of the volume shortfall and precommitted tonnes? I'm just trying to make sure we're
understanding, the gap there seems to be wider versus the published benchmarks than history?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Adam. Well, I think there's a couple of things there. Of course, there was great demand
earlier in the spring season than usual, I think, because of the low inventories we started off with. But --
so there is always a big lag in this as we sell early Q1, even Q4, we're not rev racking them until well into
this quarter. So there's always that, and then there's the people who are buying early, and that's when
they -- when the prices get set when they buy. So If we look at the ending price or the high price of in the
[ 590s ], it was only there for a short period of time, and it was probably for the just-in-time deliveries as
opposed to the people who'd plan better. So we expect now we're going to see Q3 average [ netbacks ]
rise again as we sell into the summer fill. And basically, we'll move into the fall with that. And we don't
have much lower-price carryover anymore so the lag will decrease.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It sounds like you're not thinking about any big investments. But since conditions are improving, when
that time comes, do you think it will first be in potash or first in phosphate? Or the distribution acquisition?
Or maybe back in -- further back integration into ammonia? Where do you think your big opportunity
comes from?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Yes. Well, look, the way I would probably characterize this is I'd like to see the money in the bank before
we talk about how we're going to spend it. So our first priority is continue to be that. We've talked about
the paying down debt. We've talked about the priorities being the returning money to shareholders.
And we're not going to rush out and spend a bunch of money on anything until -- till and if the right
opportunity comes where we believe that we can add real value and get an extraordinary return for
the shareholders. So I wouldn't think about any of those 3 as being our priority. I think we'd look at all
opportunities, but they have to have a great risk return -- risk-adjusted return.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Yes. One of my questions is if you look at OCP and Russians, at today's prices, they can import here, pay
the CBD and still make more money than what they did a couple of years ago when they were exporting a
lot. Do you expect that those volumes to come in here as the market remains tight?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, P.J. Let's start by saying there have been a number of new importers into the U.S. such that I
think quarter 1 volume of imports into the U.S. were pretty much on par with what they were here. So it's
not that we've got less imports, it's just we have different importers or different people coming into this
market.

In terms of OCP and the Russians, I mean, they're welcome to come into this market, but it doesn't really
make sense with an OCP with a 20% tariff that they wouldn't go to a market, another market like India or
whatever, which is not being tariffed right now. So I think they'll go to where their profits are the highest,
which would not be North America at this point. There's other markets with the same price without the
tariff.

Operator

We have the next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets.

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

In terms of a capital allocation, the lockup for the Vale shares have been over for quite some time. How
much priority do you put on maybe saving some cash, getting some dry powder to kick out those shares
-- to clean up the share in 1 day?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Joel. Well, I think we said before that we would certainly look at participating if Vale shares
came to the market. And I guess the way I would look at that is, although they're really no different than
buying back anyone else's shares, the reason for participating would be more to make sure that the --
that there was a more orderly and less disruptive impact on the market. So we think we would participate,
we'll participate based on our cash position at the time. And we'll look at it at the moment. At this stage,
we don't have official word from Vale on what they're going to do with those shares or when. So -- but it
will be public, they'll be the ones to tell us when they're going to sell them. And if they do, we'll certainly
look at how much and how aggressively we participate.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephen.

Mark William Connelly

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Stephens Inc., Research Division

Joc, I was hoping you could talk to us a little bit more about your aspirations for biologicals. We usually
see [indiscernible] chem companies focused on that. You've got a couple of partnerships now, you talked
about nitrogen fixing soil enhancements. Can you give us a sense of how broad your interest there goes
because those things really run the gamut?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Mike. But look, what we're looking at with that is how do we extend our product lines, how
do we use our beneficial distribution system. I mean we've got a big distribution system, for instance,
in Brazil, where we can really help these products get to market. But I would say, look, it's early days.
We are making some small, but well thought out investments. And what we're doing right now is trying
to fill a pipeline, and that pipeline will be filled over time. And if you think about it, no different than the
MicroEssentials, which took years to develop, these will take years to develop.

I think Anuvia's -- or our Sus-Terra product is now just going to market. We would expect our Sound
products to go to market in the next, I guess, year or 2. And then our AgBiome would go to market
probably in the year after that. So I mean, these are long-term small investments that are likely to do well
over time, but we have to get into it first.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Adrien Tamagno from Berenberg.

Adrien Tamagno
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

A question on the Phosphate division, please. Can you comment on expected evolution of utilization rates
of U.S. phosphate assets going forward?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Sorry, I missed -- utilization, the utilization rate, did you say, of phosphate? Yes. Look, the U.S. is a
relatively stable, mature market. But what we are seeing and particularly with the advent of the precision
agriculture, actually, the farmers are really looking hard at what they need to do in terms of putting better
fertilizers, better technology into their crops. And one of the things that's benefiting from that is probably
a higher usage of phosphate fertilizers and particularly our MicroEssentials, which is an [ efficiency ]
improving fertilizer.

Operator

We have a follow-up question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Joc, I was wondering just with the improving kind of market outlook in the potash space, how you maybe
kind of restarting or bringing back some of the idled Colonsay capacity and what it would take from the
market to think about bringing that capacity back on?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Adam. That's an important question that we're spending actually a fair bit of time on right
now because the demand for [ potash ] has been strong. Now look, we fully expect to meet the demand
of our customers, and we're seeing an increased demand, particularly internationally. So when we can
legitimately bring back Colonsay because it's got a price for enough, we expect price for long enough, we'll
be doing just that. And right now, we're able to supply our needs through our ramping up K3 and our Bell

Plaine. But there will be a time soon or in the next year or 2, I suspect, where Colonsay may be required,
but it will also require a sustained price, probably a little higher than what it is even today.

We have the next question comes from the line of Adrien Tamagno from Berenberg.

Adrien Tamagno
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Sory, earlier, I was referring to the utilization of your own operations in Florida, not in the market. It was
down to 77% in Q1 -- yes.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Yes, our expectations, Adrien, are that we will run those plants probably pretty hard for the next
6, 9 months because -- and the limit will be, like we've said earlier, I think the limit to production may
be, at least in the near term, will be the sulfur availability. So we expect to run those with allowing for
turnarounds and regular maintenance, but we expect to run those close to full capacity.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Given your sulfur shortages, you said that your second quarter tonnes would be about equal to your
production. What's your current level of production? And then secondly, in terms of the tariffs on
phosphate in the United States, can they be changed over the next few years? Or are they in place for the
next 5 years as a base case?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So yes, let me answer, first of all, I think our sales in last quarter was about 2.1 million tonnes
of which -- and I think production was in the range of the 1.9 million tonnes. I think what we can be
looking at in the second quarter probably is slightly down from that. We may drop inventory slightly, but
I would have expected that same range in that 2 million tonne mark would be probably about where our
production will be, exempting what we're predicting for sulfur limitations. And recognize those will meet
sales.

The second -- sorry, Jeff, just repeat your second part of your question, I was rushed to write it down.
John, what was the second question?

Operator

Next question comes from the line of...

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

[ Can you ] repeat the question, Jeff? Let me finish, sorry, the CBD question. I lost -- [Audio Gap] down
quick enough. So in terms of the CBD, there is a yearly review of that amount and even as we move
forward, there is an opportunity for some level of a review of those, both the damages and of the actual
numbers. And so there could be some change from either the -- from the Department of Commerce in
terms of what they look. And we believe we have actually good reasoning why the CBD rates actually
should be higher. So we'll see what happens there. But I suspect there wouldn't be major changes in that
in the next year or two. But after that, there will be annual reviews that will tell us whether they continue
or whether they can be modified.

And we had last question comes from the line of Rikin Patel from Exane.

Rikin Patel
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Just one on potash, with your upgraded shipment guidance for 69 million tonnes to 71 million tonnes, I'm
just curious what sort of puts and takes are required to get you to that 71 million tonnes on the upper
end? And then maybe just more broadly speaking, on the Phosphate business, given ammonia is a key
input over there longer term, I'm just curious how you think about decarbonizing that production process.
And any thoughts around green ammonia and how that might factor into your thinking going forward?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Thanks, Rikin. Well, let me start with our potash. If we look at the expectations on potash this
year, I'd start by saying the North American demand appears to be very strong, and that's one of the
gain areas. Brazil will be strong. Again, we're expecting record use of fertilizer in Brazil [ it seems ] year
after year. We're seeing a big rebound, let's call it, in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia with
their palm oil, but all the way across Southeast -- all the way across Asia, we're seeing good demand.
And again, probably the only place where it will be flat year-on-year as probably going to be India. And
although we expect a decrease in phosphate use, we sort of expect [Audio Gap] use in potash. So overall,
that would be the -- those would be the drivers. And if those do better, we could get up to the 71%.
Otherwise, we'll probably be more in that 69% to 70% range is kind of our base case.

In terms of decarbonization, if you will, we've set some fairly aggressive ESG targets. We said we would
reduce our greenhouse gases by about 20%. Our -- sorry, we would decrease our greenhouse gases by
20%. A lot of what we're doing there involves how we're running our phosphate businesses. We've put a
lot of effort and resources into how we can use recycled heat to make power. And over time, we see that,
along with just other uses to use less power, et cetera.

In terms of the nitrogen, I guess a couple of the nitrogen producers are talking about green and blue
nitrogen. At this stage, those really haven't got to the market yet, I would assume that if we can buy a
lower intensity, carbon intensity nitrogen for our usage, ammonia for our usage, we would certainly go
that direction.

Operator

We don't have any questions as of the moment from the queue. Please [ proceed ], presenters?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So thank you, everyone. I guess we're going to give you back a little bit of time. But let me just close
by saying we -- what we're seeing today is the culmination of all the effort we put into for a long time. And
now that these markets have started to move forward we're starting to really reap that benefit. And we
see that strength going well into the second quarter and through the rest of this year. So with that, have a
safe and productive day, and thank you very much for listening.

Operator
Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now
disconnect.
