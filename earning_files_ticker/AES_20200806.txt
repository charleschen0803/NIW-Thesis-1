THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. Welcome to The AES Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Financial Review Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor
Relations. Go ahead.

Ahmed Pasha
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2020 financial review
call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at
aes.com.

Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may
cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent
10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can
be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andrés Gluski, our
President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior
members of our management team.

With that, I will turn the call over to Andrés. Andrés?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I'll
spend some time on 3 near term priorities: achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment-
grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We believe that progress in these 3 key areas will allow us
to reach a larger investor base in the near term. They will also advance our longer term strategic and
financial objectives. After discussing these 3 themes, I'll provide an update on our sustainable growth
initiatives and our efforts to create a technological competitive edge.

Last quarter, I indicated that we were well positioned to withstand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
due to the resilience of our business model. I am pleased to report that our second quarter results
demonstrate this resilience and keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We delivered adjusted
EPS of $0.25 in the second quarter in line with last year. This reflects the strength of our business model,
which is based on long-term take-or-pay contracts with creditworthy customers. As a result, we are very
confident that we will achieve our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.42, and our expected parent
free cash flow of $725 million to $775 million.

At the same time, we have continued to grow our free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with a
parent free cash flow to debt ratio of 24%, which is comfortably above the 20% threshold required for
investment-grade ratings. As a reminder, we've already received one investment-grade rating from Fitch
and remain optimistic that we will attain our second investment-grade rating later this year.

Turning to our aggressive decarbonization goals on Slide 4. As we've said before, we are very focused
on reducing our generation from coal to less than 30% of total generation to comply with Norges Bank
Environmental Investment Criteria. On this front, we've made great progress over the past 2 months,
signing binding agreements to sell OPGC in India and Itabo in the Dominican Republic. These sales
will reduce our generation from coal by a 11 percentage points to 34%. We're working on a couple of
additional transactions that combined with our growth in renewables will allow us to easily comply with
Norges Bank's criteria by next year.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

To further our reduction in coal exposure, AES Gener is negotiating with several off-takers in Chile to
delink PPAs from physical assets and be able to monetize the value of long-term tolling agreements. These
transactions will demonstrate that the real value of the business is in its contracts and customers while
providing funding for AES Gener's successful green blend and extend renewables growth strategy.

Turning to Slide 5 and sustainable growth. I'm happy to announce that since our last call, we have been
awarded or signed 852 megawatts of new renewable PPAs. This brings our year-to-date total to 1.5
gigawatts, including 346 megawatts of energy storage. As a result, our backlog of new renewable projects
increased to 6.2 gigawatts. About half of this backlog is in the U.S., and the majority is expected to come
online between 2021 and 2024. Therefore, we remain on track to continue to add 2 to 3 gigawatts of new
renewables per year by capitalizing on our business platforms and our growing technological expertise.

In addition to our 6.2 gigawatt backlog, we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of renewable projects under
active development in the U.S. This considerable pipeline positions us very well for an acceleration in U.S.
renewables growth if federal policies change following the November elections.

Turning to Slide 7. We're also consolidating our position in existing renewable platforms. To that end, we
recently acquired additional shares of AES Tietê, increasing our ownership from 24% to 43%. We will
finance this acquisition mostly through nonrecourse debt in Brazil, and it is accretive from day 1. We plan
to upgrade AES Tietê's listing to Novo Mercado on the Bovespa, where companies trade at significant
premiums due to best-in-class governance. This move is expected to further unlock the value of AES Tietê
for the benefit of all of its shareholders.

We continue to actively pursue new technologies that support our growth in renewables and innovative
products that meet the changing needs of our customers. As you can see on Slide 8, Fluence, our joint
venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to be the global
market leader in this sector. This leadership is based on our track record of deploying more than 2
gigawatts of energy storage, presence in 22 countries and offering more than 40 digital applications to our
customers.

This year, Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million, an increase of 400% in relation to last
year. We believe that energy storage will play a major role in the global transition to a low-carbon
economy. As a result, we expect Fluence's revenue to grow at 40% compounded annually to reach $3
billion by the end of 2025.

Turning to Slide 9. We are already experiencing this acceleration of growth in demand for energy storage.
In June, Fluence launched its sixth generation product, which includes a modular and factory assembled
cube design that is safer, more reliable and lower cost. Fluence's new cube already has orders for more
than 800 megawatts to be delivered over the next 3 years.

As you may know, Fluence is currently running a private placement for a minority partner in order to
capitalize this high-growth business. We are encouraged by the strong interest we are seeing from
potential investors, and we expect to have concrete details to share with you before the end of the year.
Together, AES and Fluence continue to pioneer new applications for lithium-ion based energy storage
technology. One example is a virtual reservoir for run of the river hydro projects, utilizing energy storage
that charges when power prices are low and discharges during peak hours.

As shown on Slide 10, at the Cordillera hydro complex in Chile, we just commissioned the world's first
such virtual reservoir, with 10 megawatts or 50-megawatt hours of energy storage. We can further expand
this facility to 250 megawatts or 1,250 megawatt hours over the next couple of years. Today, about half of
all our renewable projects have an energy storage component.

Now moving on to Slide 11. We continue to pursue new technologies that have the potential to provide
us with a competitive advantage in our markets. To that end, we recently acquired a 25% stake in 5B, a
prefabricated solar solution company in Australia. With 5B's patented technology, solar projects can be
built in 1/3 of the time and in half the space. We believe that being able to double solar energy output
from a given area will become increasingly important as solar penetration increases, especially near urban
or congested areas.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see
an additional addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our development pipeline. As part of this strategic
agreement, we have exclusive rights to develop utility-scale projects using 5B's technology in our key
markets, including the U.S. We have already started the deployment of 2 megawatts in Panama and 10
megawatts in Chile. We aim to be the most competitive solar developer by using 5B to reduce time to
build and increase energy density, while combining it with our robotic and digital solar initiatives.

Turning to Slide 12. In 2018, AES invested in Uplight to improve our customer experiences via digital cloud
based technology. In addition, Uplight provides cloud-based services to third parties to improve energy
efficiency and balance system demand. This fast-growing business already reaches more than 100 million
household and businesses in the U.S. and expects a 20% increase in annual revenue in 2020.

Finally, regarding our partnership with Google, it is progressing well. And as you might have seen, we
recently launched an RFP for 1 gigawatt of carbon-free energy in PJM. We are working on several other
significant initiatives with Google, and we will share additional details as these firm up.

In summary, our ongoing leading technology efforts aim to give us a competitive edge to deliver the
products and services required by our customers in a rapidly evolving and growing market.

Now I would like to turn over the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our
results, debt profile and guidance.

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Andrés. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the
second quarter and our capital allocation plan.

Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are from
utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years. This provides
significant stability to earnings and cash flow. We have also reduced our exposure to volatility in foreign
currency by growing the portion of our U.S. dollar earnings.

As you can see on Slide 15, today, 85% of our earnings are in U.S. dollars as compared to approximately
60% a few years ago. For context, through 2022, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would reduce our
annualized EPS by only 1.5% or $0.02.

Looking at Latin America, specifically, almost all of our businesses in that region are contracted, as you
can see on Slide 16. Nearly 60% of these businesses have no volumetric risk as a result of the take-or-
pay nature of the contracts. The remaining capacity is mostly contracted with large industrials and export-
oriented mining companies that continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. We
intentionally work with high-quality off-takers, and this strategy is also contributing to the resilience of our
business model.

For example, as you can see on Slide 17, roughly 2/3 of our customers in Latin America have investment-
grade profiles. The remaining customers are largely backed by government-owned institutions. The result
of this resilient contracting structure and customer base can be seen in our collections performance on
Slide 18, with Q2 receivables and days sales outstanding remaining very much in line with historical levels.

Moving on to the impact of global lockdowns on our financial results on Slide 19. As you may recall, we
had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. This assumed
the second quarter would be the hardest hit with a demand drop of about 10% to 12% at our U.S. utility
businesses and between 7% and 15% internationally. The actual result was not as severe as anticipated,
with volume at our US and Utilities dropping mid-single digits and demand in other markets declining
in the range of low single digits to low double digits. As I have noted, our generation businesses did not
experience any material impact on earnings from lower demand. Our utility business, where most of
our volume exposure has experienced an impact of about $0.02 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better
than our initial expectation of $0.03 to $0.04. Despite these encouraging results, we continue to assume

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

an extended U-shaped recovery for guidance purpose, given the overall uncertainty around the macro
environment.

Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 20. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter versus $0.26
last year. This reflects the lower demand at our regulated utilities, I just discussed, and the regulatory
changes that were implemented at DPL and Argentina in 2019. We are able to offset these headwinds
through higher contributions from our South America and Eurasia SBUs as well as our cost savings and
deleveraging initiatives.

Turning to Slide 21. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was relatively flat at $238 million for the
quarter, with a decrease of only $2 million versus the second quarter of 2019. I will cover our results in
more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 22.

In the US and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the lower regulated tariff implemented in Q4 2019 due to
the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as lower demand at utilities due to the impact of COVID-19.
Additionally, at Southland, we had lower capacity revenues as a result of the retirement of some of our
legacy units in 2019. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions
from AES Gener, including better operating performance at our Guacolda plant and recovery of previously
expensed payments from customers in Chile.

Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects improved availability at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama,
following an extended major outage last year. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama,
following a very dry year in 2019. This was partially offset by outage-related insurance proceeds in the
Dominican Republic last year. Finally, in Eurasia, high results reflect improved operational performance in
Vietnam and the impact of the sale of our loss-making business in the United Kingdom.

Now to Slide 26. To summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of
$0.54 versus $0.53 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42.
Relative to the first half of 2020, performance in the second half of the year will benefit from contributions
for new businesses, including the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project, for which the 20-year
contract began in the second quarter, and about 1 gigawatt of renewables coming online.

Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 27. As we discussed on our first quarter call, since 2011, we
reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. At the end of the second quarter, our
parent leverage was 3.5x, and our parent free cash flow to that ratio was 24%, comfortably within the
investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. This highlights once more our credit strength
and give us confidence in attaining our second investment-grade rating later this year.

Moving on to liquidity on Slide 28. We have $3.5 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. As
you may recall from our prior call, we had taken a conservative approach to enhance our liquidity at the
beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak by drawing on about $500 million of our revolvers. As a result of the
strong collection we experienced in the quarter, we decided to pay back most of these facilities, lowering
the overall interest expense for our businesses.

Next, I I'd like to provide an update on our refinancings on Slide 29. As you know, we have been
proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. Since last year, we executed more than $7 billion
in liability management across our portfolio. In the second quarter alone, by taking advantage of a low
interest rate environment, we refinanced more than $2 billion of debt, significantly reducing our interest
costs while eliminating any material refinancing needs at both AES Corp. and DPL for the next 5 years.

Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 30. We expected $1.4 billion of discretionary cash this
year, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Regarding asset sales, we have already
announced agreement to sell 2 gigawatts of cogeneration, achieving roughly half of our target for 2020.
We are working on a few other transactions and feel good about the prospect of achieving our targeted
asset sales of $550 million for this year.

Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December,
we expected to return $381 million to shareholders this year. We plan to invest $700 million in our
subsidiaries, 90% of which is in the U.S., demonstrating our proactive actions to grow the portion of

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

earnings coming from the U.S. to about half by 2022. These investments include funding our renewables
backlog, the equity for the Southland repowering and the investment in rate base growth at our utilities.

Regarding AES Gener, as Andrés mentioned, we are in negotiations to delink the PPAs from the coal assets
and monetize the value of some of its store in agreements. As a result, we now expect the capital increase
in our contribution of equity to happen in 2021. This leaves us with up to $317 million to be allocated in
2020.

Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We continue to
expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated
from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.

Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder
dividends. Subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4%
to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We're also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our
backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and
the investment in AES Gener. This $1.9 billion also included the $300 million infrastructure investment in
DP&L. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.

In summary, we are very encouraged by our solid financial performance to date despite being in the
middle of an unprecedented global crisis. Our performance and position validate the actions we have taken
over the last several years to materially improve the quality and resilience of our business model, and we
remain very confident in our ability to continue delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me close today's call by saying that we remain
very confident in achieving our guidance for 2020 and growth rates through 2022, attaining a second
investment-grade rating before year-end and realizing our decarbonization goals to meet Norges Bank's
threshold by the end of the year. At the same time, we continue to make progress on deploying innovative
technologies that we believe will give us a competitive edge in today's rapidly evolving and growing
market.
With that, I would like to open up the call to your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And congratulations on continued execution here. Perhaps just going back to the '20 guidance, and I
know you guys just commented here in your prepared remarks about a little bit of your positioning, but
I'd like to dig a little bit further into that. So you're saying that you're a few pennies ahead relative to
initial expectations for the utility after last quarter's update. You're saying your power outlook is not
appreciably impacted from lower demand. Just help frame where you are within that '20 guidance range
as a consequence of these updated assumptions?

And then thirdly, I didn't see you comment specifically on how the asset sales and/or expected asset sales
impact and the potential dilution from those impact where you are within that range. If that makes sense?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Okay. Let's split this into 2, I'll take the first half and Gustavo can take the second half. Look, we feel
confident that we're going to hit our numbers. We feel very good. We have a lot of good things happening.
We're still, I think, all of us in uncharted territories. This has to play out for the second half of the year. I
think our business model has demonstrated its resilience. I think very importantly, both earnings and cash
or accounts receivable are very much in line from where they were last year. So we feel good about it.
We have a lot of positive things. But there is some uncertainty. So we -- what we're saying is we feel very
confident we will hit these numbers. And the model is resilient, and let's see what plays out in the second
half of the year.

With that, I'll pass it over to Gustavo to talk a little bit about asset sales.

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

So Julien, yes, those 2 asset sales, they were already incorporated in our long-term forecast. So the
associated dilution is already in the 7% to 9%. So no impact to our forecast.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Nor the impact of any perspective further so that's already assumed, right?

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

No, no. The additional ones to reach the $500 million are also in this plan, the 7% to 9% growth.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

In other words, they're assumed in our forecast.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And if I can ask just a step further here. I mean you guys made a further commitment in Brazil in recent
weeks. Can you talk to your thought process about realizing the full value there? I mean I suppose it's
a unique situation and backdrop where you all are, I suppose, your peer shareholders is receiving a

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

premium bid and you all are stepping in to basically say, we see greater value. So can you elaborate on
where you see that value coming and maybe further next steps in realizing that?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Look, we have, I think, a very good track record in Brazil of creating value in our separate
companies. If you think of the sale of Sul, the sale of Eletropaulo, you think of the sale of our telecom
Atimus. So what we're doing here is we're -- BNDES wanted to sell part of its share. So by buying BNDES'
shares, we go from 24% ownership to around 43% ownership. This will allow us to list AES Tietê on the
Novo Mercado. In the Novo Mercado, generally companies trade at a 10%, 20% premium versus where
they trade on ordinary listings.

So in Brazil, you have your preferred shares, which actually don't have a vote and receive a 10% dividend
uplift. And then you have normal ordinary shares, which have votes. So our shares and BNDES' shares are
ordinary shares. So what we see here is an upgrade of the company in terms of its market listing, in terms
of who can invest in the company. And we're able to go to Novo Mercado because now we own a much
larger percentage of the company. So it's one share one vote, we still control this company.

I'd say furthermore, you might have seen there the Tietê actually is a good platform for growth. It has
now almost 4 gigawatts of 100% renewable energy. And we've been able to do some very innovative
things there. So in terms of our big strategy, it makes sense as well. So it makes sense from a money
point of view because we're buying it accretive. We are -- it's accretive at these prices. Second, I would
say that it's a platform for growth and fits into our overall strategy of reducing our carbon intensity, the
carbon intensity of our footprint.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Sorry, last quick clarification. What's the contribution for renewables in aggregate in 2020 and beyond?
Just getting this question consistently.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Look, right now, including, again, renewables for hydro, it's about 1/3 of our fleet.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Earnings terms?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Earnings...

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

By the same.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

I think it's pretty much in line.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great update on a lot of fronts. Just on the storage side of things, obviously, the size of this business and
the growth is impressive. Could you just speak maybe generally to the capital needs for this business,
strategically how you think about the growth of this business within AES? And just -- and it's just an
unusual business given the incredibly rapid growth rate. I'm just curious sort of strategically, how are you
thinking about this business?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Well, we started 12 years ago. So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an
innovator in applications. So we've decided to sell it to third parties via Fluence, and we're very happy
with the partnership with Siemens because it allows us to sell it in 160 countries. So what we're seeing
is that this is a very rapidly growing market. So Fluence itself, we see a lot of new applications, not only
the virtual reservoir, but I can see grid booster, which really reduces significant long distance transmission
expenses or investments. So that, I think, is the next front. So I think this is an area that's going to grow
very quickly.

So how does it fit in into AES. Well, first, of course, we're happy with the investments we've made in
Fluence. I think time will show that, that was a very good investment. But it's also good for us in the
sense we're one of the big customers of Fluence. So today, half of our product offerings have an energy
storage component. So we have stand-alone storage, but we also have it integrated into solar, as you
know, our award-winning project out in Kiewit. But we also have it incorporated, for example, wind. So
when we talk about green blend and extend and meeting customers' future needs, if customers want
24/7, for example, renewables, energy storage plays a big component.

Now I'm a believer in lithium-ion batteries for -- our batteries, let's say, electrical batteries because they
don't have to be lithium ion for the next 5 to 10 years for many of the applications. And the reason is that
it's very -- as the batteries become more efficient, become cheaper, you're basically going from electric to
-- in some cases, a chemical back to electric. And the losses are very low.

There's been a lot of talk about hydrogen, for example. Hydrogen has advantages and then it has much
greater energy density. So we see much -- many more applications in transportation where the weight of
batteries precludes long distance, say, big trucks using a battery. So I think this is a very interesting area.
But if you're talking about sort of combining renewables with storage or day-to-day applications, we really
think that batteries seem to be the killer app.

Now we've put a toe in the water into hydrogen as well. We've actually run some tests on old coal plants
in Chile, basically cracking the hydrogen, using renewable energy at around $35 a megawatt hour, and it
still comes out quite expensive. We do see it could be -- we've also run some tests on diesel, and it might
be interesting for micro grids. So we do have an electrolyzer in Chile, where we -- actually, in Argentina,
excuse me, where we actually produce hydrogen for our own needs at the San Nicolas plant.

So we have a foot into this. We're looking into this. But I just mentioned this because there some people
say, well, hydrogen will replace battery-based energy storage. And the reason we don't see that is, at
least in the short term, is because you're going from electric to produce a chemical -- a chemical reaction.
Then you have to store it cryogenically, then you have to transport it, then you basically have to burn it
again. So if you look at the energy from the original electricity losses to electricity again, you're talking
about at least half. Whereas with the battery, you're talking about a much smaller percentage.

Now of course, batteries don't work for intraseasonal differences. So we're looking into it. And we have
some small experiments in some of our different units. And as I said, the ones that look more promising
really are diesel units. And we're certainly a believer of green hydrogen for transportation.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

That's a great description of the market potential of storage versus hydrogen. And I wanted to shift over,
maybe just to your corporate relationships. Maybe we could just briefly touch on Google to make sure
we just talk through the, sort of, the commercial relationship. I guess there's sort of an element of near
term fees plus longer term margin potential. But then also just thinking more broadly and maybe more
importantly, just about the potential for other such corporate relationships, given AES' global footprint and
ability to help customers globally to decarbonize. If you could just talk to that opportunity broadly as well,
please.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you for that question. I mean we are investing very heavily into the U.S., as Gustavo said,
it's about 90% of what we're investing. But we do have this wonderful global footprint. So if a client has
global needs, we can satisfy those. So when you talk about the relationship with Google, we are -- we
do supply them with renewable energy in Chile. And we did have the RFP -- we have the RFP out for 1
gigawatt of zero-carbon energy in PJM.

We're also -- as I mentioned in my speech, looking at other possibilities with them, I really can't comment
on them -- about them at this time. But it goes beyond just a single sort of RFP or a single PPA in one
country. Because we're doing, I think, a lot of innovative things like they are, and so we have commonality
of interest in some areas. But just like Google, I mean, of course, there are other companies that are also
interested in our global footprint. And having a, let's say, common high-tech approach to reducing carbon
emissions among multiple countries, and we can certainly supply that.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Charles Fishman from Morningstar.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

If I could firstly ask a housekeeping question on Slide 18. I guess it's a lot more than housekeeping, but
your receivable balance is going lower. Now first of all, I assume that's apples-to-apples. In other words,
you adjusted that from any businesses you've divested between Q4 and Q2.

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

That's correct, Charles. This is Gustavo. That's correct.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. I assume that, but just wanted to ask it now. And then, I guess, more of a big picture question.
Why -- is there any particular reason you see your receivable balance going actually lower, which is
certainly great considering the environment, where among your -- well, there's nobody really up here with
you guys, but other utilities, let's say, which I realize are different businesses, most of them have capable
balances going in the other direction. Anything that you're doing differently or you probably have more
contracted type generation. I realize that, but is there anything else going on?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, I think you hit the nail on the head. It's 85% of our business is contracted generation. And we
have credit-worthy off-takers. So there are situations, for example, where, say, a currency depreciates but
what they're exporting is actually then more attractive because they have a portion of their costs, whether
it'd be mining or such things that they're exporting. So in general, our clients are doing well. Much better
than the markets that they're in. So I think that's very important. But we're 85% contracted generation.
And that's a big difference.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

So if you actually see why we guided down initially. We correctly forecasted that we would have a drop
in demand with the quarantine at our utilities, at our distribution businesses. So that's what's going on.
But other than that, our plants are critical. So in those cases, where we're selling to the grid or selling to,
which is, in many cases, backed by the government, we are -- make sure that we get paid because we're
absolutely critical to the grid or the low-cost generator in that market. So we're very well positioned in this
crisis. So we don't expect that to change, certainly, in the generation business, given, let's say, the current
outlook.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then, Andrés, if I can ask you one strategic question with respect to Fluence. Why a minority
partner at this point? What is the thinking behind that?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's a great question because this is a rapidly growing business. And we think it has a great future,
and it's coming out with new products. Part of it is that both of us, Siemens and AES, we would like to
have a marker from a transaction. We're not going to sell down a very large stake, we're talking of around
a 10% stake. So we think it would be just good to have that capitalize it, maybe 10% with an outside
partner. And obviously work towards a bigger sell-down perhaps in 2, 3 years of an IPO. But -- and then
we'll have to reassess strategically how we feel about this business.

But we feel very good about the business. And as I said, I think that this is a market, which is growing
very rapidly. Now something that people haven't talked about, I think, so much is, if you do have a change
in federal policies in the U.S. to promote green or carbon-free generation, we're very well positioned.
Fluence is very well positioned. But specifically, AES because we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of
potential projects in the U.S. And those run the range from quite advance to medium advance.

If we looked at just hypothetical projects, it's a much bigger number. So we feel good that we have a
pipeline that we could execute on and potentially double our rate of growth of renewable build in the U.S.
should there be such a change.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. So -- and the partner then very well could be financial rather than just somebody like yourself that's
also selling the Fluence product?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

No, yes, no, absolutely. Absolutely. A lot of the people looking at are just financials. We're looking at a
good investment with an eye towards a potential IPO, 2 to 3 years from now.

Operator

Our next question is from Agnie Storozynski from Seaport Global.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

So I have a number of questions. So first, on Fluence. I mean incredible results, by the way. But on
Fluence, so the attempt to monetize the business, which I don't think that you're being paid in the current
stock price for Fluence among others. So is there any EPS contribution for Fluence in 2020 or even in
2022?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

13

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

No. No. I mean this year, it'll -- it should be probably about $0.01 dilutive. And the reason for that is even
though it's like margin positive, and we haven't been putting more money in as it had this very rapid
growth is because R&D, you have to expense. So for example, all the design work, the production work of
the new -- next-generation of the sixth generation, well, that is expensed.

So look, we've talked probably, I'd say around 2 years for it to turn positive in terms of EPS. And what
basically happens is that the faster it grows, the more new products you have to come out with, you delay
that, turning it positive. So it's a business that could be positive today if that were the objective. But the
objective is to create value. So we think a sell it down, as you say, will give us a marker. So people say,
well, how much does it worth? Well, somebody just paid expert. Like we did, for example, with the gas
business in the Dominican Republic, people weren't giving us much value and we were able to show what
it was worth to third parties.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

The second question, so it's a 2-part question. So one, is there like a rule of thumb that I can say, for
example, for 2021, you will have additional 2,000 megawatts of renewables in operation and granted it's
probably going to be scattered throughout the year. But can I say, for instance, that 100 megawatts adds
x in EPS?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Well, it will depend a little bit because it depends what you are inaugurating, right, and where? So there's
a difference between solar and wind, and there's a difference outside of the U.S. because of tax. So it's --
there's no rule of thumb for just like 100 megawatts. I don't know Gustavo, if...

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

What I would do is, we are putting on average $300 million, $350 million per year, right? So that's our
equity in the project. We bring partners and so on. So if you assume, call it, 12% return on average,
you're going to come up with the EPS accretion that those deals are bringing to us.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Awesome. Awesome. And now a bigger picture question. So I've been actually looking at it. So as you
become investment grade, I know you're already investment-grade by Fitch, but you get those additional
investment-grade ratings. Would you ever consider not project finance, but corporate-level debt to fund
the growth? I understand that there's an issue of finite life of the contracts for the renewables.

But I think that there is this growing conviction even among investors that the useful life of these assets
is going to be longer than the duration of the original contract. And under project financing, you are in a
sense -- the debt amortization, most of the cash flows of the project, and so the real equity accretion is
only at the end of this contract. So in a sense, you could help yourselves quite meaningfully from a cash
flow perspective if you were started to rely on corporate level debt -- on corporate debt.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me sort of answer philosophically, then I'll pass it to Gustavo. Look, philosophically, we like doing
project-level debt because it's an asset test. So since I've been CEO, almost all of our major projects, I
think with the exception of Southland, we brought in a partner. And the reason was that bankers have first
dibs on the cash flow. So you have to convince somebody, a third-party, that you're going to operate this
and that they think it's a good project as well.

So given that, philosophically, we like using project-level debt, and so I don't see that changing for the
time. There are advantages of certain roll-ups. We can aggregate at the sublevel. Gener has debt, for

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

example, Tietê has debt, which would get some of those advantages. But we think that the discipline of
having to project finance is good and having to bring in partners is good. So Gustavo?

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

I think, Andrés, you covered well. I mean it brings more discipline to the process. It also allows us to
amortize the debt within the PPA time frame, which we like. We don't want to count on post-PPA period to
pay for debt, quite frankly. So it's just more disciplined. I think the projects are more sustainable when we
validate at the project level, right, with the debt there and all the amortization within the PPA flow.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

And just one follow-up, if I can, on Fluence. So we saw the results of the investigation by APS on the
root cause of the storage system accident. And we also saw some response from LG. And APS seems to
suggest that there needs to be some changes in the configuration of those storage systems going forward.
I haven't necessarily seen the response from Fluence, but is there any fundamental change in how you
think those storage designs need to be adjusted? And if there is any needs to make adjustments to your
already existing operating systems?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, look, that was a unit that was inaugurated in 2017. We're 2 generations away from that. The
issue as we see it was with a series of LG Chem batteries, a specific series that were produced in some
factories. So we've operated for 12 years. This is the first, let's say, serious incident we've had. But really,
the best standards are, for example, UL 9045a. And if you look at the best-in-class standards, the sixth
generation incorporates all these.

So if you look at, for example, it doesn't require -- it's not contained, so it's actually outside. The modules
are separated, so you don't have cotangents. It has enhanced fire suppression systems on it. And in
the worst case, should there be any type of thermal event since it's not enclosed, the heat and any
gases would rise. So definitely, we feel that we've taken all the lessons learned from this event. We've
incorporated into the new design. And really, safety was one of our #1 priority. So again, we have 12
years of operating these. And we -- this is the one really event that we had.

Now regarding those cases, which weren't that many. I think you can count on them with one hand, all
those units that had that series of battery in them, we immediately put out instructions of not to charge
them -- like instructions you get on your Tesla car, not to charge them above 75%. And we've taken
corrective actions and we've given more information, more training for like local fire units, et cetera.

So yes, we -- as you know, safety is #1 value, super important for us. We have been very serious and
very diligent, I think, about looking into this and supporting our clients and supporting our local fire
departments on this. But I feel very good that the sixth generation cube is the safest unit out there and
incorporates all of the suggestions that are out there technically.

Operator

Our next question is from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just starting off with the opportunity around delinking PPAs. Could you provide a little bit more color
around that opportunity versus your current financing plan? And maybe the assumed asset sales as well.
Is there an inter-player offset potentially with this new consideration? Or is it more of another tool in the
tool bag down the road?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert

THE AES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Well, we've always said that -- and they've had a lot of tools to address its financing needs because it's
growing so fast, they've been so successful on green, blend and extend. We really can't comment on some
of these transactions until they close. But there are several transactions where we're delinking the PPA,
which in some cases, was specific to a given asset. So like this power plant has this PPA. We are delinking
them and allowing us greater flexibility in terms of how we satisfy their demand or requirements of the
customers.

So I really can't give you too much color on it, other than saying that it will help us. It will help Gener with
its financing plan. And so it's very likely that any capital contribution from us will be in 2021 instead of
2020, this year. We tend to be very conservative. So we saw that these have been advancing. So prior
to having these as advanced as they are today, we had talked about AES putting in the money this year.
So that, I think, is the main change. So I'd say stay tuned, and we can give you more color as these
transactions close.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Look forward to that. And then just a quick clean-up question. The inclusion this quarter, I believe
it was recovery of expense payments from customers in Chile. Just -- was this in your plan, specifically in
your 2020 plan, included in guidance?

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean this is -- at the AES Corp. level, I mean, this is about a couple of cents in this quarter when
you normalize for ownership adjustment and so on. It was included. This is good guy, meaning cash and
earnings from prior expenses, pass-through costs that we had with some particular clients and we're able
to firm up those receivables back.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

But this is baked into the original guidance?

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.
