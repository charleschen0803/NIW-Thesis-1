& Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call.
On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating
divisions.

We had an excellent second quarter. The team delivered on all 4 of our long-term operating priorities to
drive shareholder value. We grew organically. We grew through acquisitions, improved our productivity,
all while raising our quality and maintaining our unique Gallagher culture. For our combined Brokerage
and Risk Management segments, we posted 17% growth in revenue, 8.6% organic growth, but it's over
10% when adjusted for timing, which Doug will spend some time on in a few minutes. Net earnings
margin expansion of 107 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 30 basis points, and we
completed 8 new mergers in the quarter with more than $70 million of estimated annualized revenue.
Most importantly, our Gallagher culture continues to thrive. Just a fantastic quarter on all measures.

Now before I discuss how each of our businesses performed in more detail, let me comment briefly about
the termination of our agreement to purchase certain Willis Towers Watson brokerage operations. We were
excited about the opportunity. I would have loved to complete the transaction. There are a lot of great
people at Willis, and they would have been a great addition to our team. But here's the key point. With or
without this, we remain very well positioned to support our clients, compete for new ones and ultimately
drive value for all of our stakeholders. We're in the greatest business on earth, our culture is stronger than
ever, and I'm excited about our future.

Okay. Back to our quarterly results, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was
strong at 16%. Of that, 6.8% was organic revenue growth, a little better than our June IR Day expectation
and closer to 9% adjusted for timing. Our net earnings margin moved higher by 53 basis points, and our
adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded by 23 basis points, highlighting our continued expense discipline.
Another excellent quarter from the Brokerage team.

Let me walk you around the world and break down our organization by geography, starting with our
PC operations. First, our domestic retail operations were very strong with more than 8% organic. New
business was excellent, nicely above second quarter 2020 levels. Risk Placement Services, our domestic
wholesale operations, grew 12%. This includes nearly 25% organic in open Brokerage and 6% organic in
our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business and retention were both better than 2020 levels.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted more than 9% organic. Specialty was 10% and retail was
excellent at 9%, bolstered by new business production. Canada was up an outstanding 16%, fueled by
rate and exposure growth on top of solid new business and retention. And finally, Australia and New
Zealand combined grew nearly 4%, benefiting from good new business and stable retention.

Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Second quarter organic was up about
4%, which is also ahead of our June IR Day commentary and another sequential step-up over first quarter
2021 and the second half of 2020. As business activity improves, we're seeing more favorable growth in
our core health and welfare, fee-for-service and retirement consulting businesses, which is encouraging
-- it's an encouraging sign for the second half of the year. So when I combine PC at 9-plus percent and
benefits around 4%, total Brokerage segment organic was pushing 9% but with timing reported 6.8%.
Either way, another really strong performance.

Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Global PC rates remain firm overall, and at
the same time, we are seeing increased economic activity across our client base. Customers are adding
coverages and exposures to their existing policies, and monthly positive policy endorsements are trending
higher than pre-pandemic levels. And overall, second quarter renewal premium increases were similar with
the first quarter.

Moving around the world. U.S. retail was up about 8%, including double-digit increases in professional
liability. Canada was up 9%, driven by increases in professional liability and package. New Zealand was
flat and Australia up 6%. Moving to the U.K., retail was up about 8%, with most classes of specialty
business over 10%. And finally, within RPS, wholesale open brokerage was up 12%, while our binding
operations were up 4%. So clearly, premiums are still increasing across nearly all geographies.

Looking forward, it feels that the current renewal environment will persist for some time. Carriers that cut
back capacity in some of the less profitable lines of business like property, professional liability, umbrella
and cyber have yet to budge on terms or conditions or haven't reverted back to offering more limits or
lower attachment points. And elevated natural catastrophes, continued impacts of the pandemic, social
inflation and low investment returns are all continuing to pressure rates. And on top of this, the potential
for increased claim frequency as economies recover and carriers are making a strong case, the rate
increases are likely to persist for some time. We, too, see the global PC environment remaining difficult for
our clients, and that is likely to remain for the foreseeable future.

Moving to our benefits business. Our customer base is returning towards pre-pandemic levels a little more
slowly than headline-grabbing sectors like retail, leisure and hospitality. So we are expecting even better
organic in the second half. Further, our HR consulting units are very well positioned to deliver solutions
as clients and prospects pivot away from controlling costs to growing their businesses and attracting,
motivating and retaining their workforce in 2021 and beyond.

So as I sit here today, I think second half Brokerage organic will be better than the first half and could
take full year 2020 organic towards 8%. That would be a terrific step-up from the 3.2% organic we
reported in 2020.

Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We completed 7 Brokerage and 1 Risk Management merger during
the second quarter, representing over $70 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all
of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of
professionals.

As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or
being prepared, representing around $300 million of annualized revenues. Our platform continues to
attract entrepreneurial owners looking to leverage our data, expertise, tools and market relationships to
grow their businesses. And we expect that our U.S. pipeline will grow in the second half of the year given
the potential changes in capital gains taxes. So 2021 is setting up to be another successful year for our
merger strategy.

Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic
growth was pushing 20%, better than our June IR Day expectations of mid-teens, and our adjusted

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

EBITDAC margin exceeded 19%. We benefited from a revenue lift related to our 2020 new business wins,
increased new arising claims within core workers' compensation and an easier pandemic-era comparison.
Looking forward, the rebound in employment, economic activity and our solid new business should lead
to third and fourth quarter organic nicely in double digits. For the year, we expect organic to be just over
10% and our EBITDAC margin to remain above 19%.

So what an exciting time to be part of Gallagher. And that's because of our 35,000-plus employees and
our unique Gallagher culture. It's our culture that keeps us together during the depths of the pandemic.
And as we open offices around the globe yet preserving the flexibility we mastered over the last 16
months, I'm hearing the excitement about being back together. Ultimately, it's our employees that wake
up every day and decide to do things the right way, the Gallagher way. That's what makes us different.
It makes us special as a franchise. It attracts the very best people and merger partners and ultimately
clients. I believe our culture has never been stronger. So with 2 quarters in the books, 2021 is shaping up
to be an excellent year.

Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. As Pat said, an excellent quarter and first half of the year. Today, I'll
spend a little extra time on organic and then give you our current thinking on expenses and margins. Then
I'll walk you through some of the items on our CFO commentary document, and I'll finish up with some
comments on cash, liquidity and capital management.

Okay. Let's move to Page 4 of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table. Headline all-
in organic of 6.8%, excellent on its own, but as Pat said, really running closer to 9%. There's 2 reasons for
that. First, recall that we had some favorable timing in our first quarter related to contingent commissions
that caused a little unfavorable timing here in the second quarter. Call that 70 basis points. Second, also
recall that we took our 606 revenue accounting adjustment in the first quarter of 2020. We then adjusted
that in the second quarter of 2020. So that creates a more difficult compare this year second quarter. Call
that about 150 basis points. These 2 items combined for about 220 basis points of a headwind here in the
second quarter. We don't expect similar headwinds in the second half.

Okay. Let's go to Page 6 to the Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC table. You'll see that we expanded our
EBITDAC margin by 23 basis points here in the second quarter. Considering last year's second quarter
was in the depth of the pandemic and our Brokerage segment saved $60 million in that quarter, to post
any expansion at all this quarter is terrific work by the team. It shows we are indeed holding a lot of our
savings.

So the natural question is, when you levelize for the $60 million of pandemic savings last year's second
quarter and about $15 million of costs that came back this second quarter, what was the underlying
margin expansion? Answer to that is about 125 basis points, which on 6.8% organic feels about right. That
$15 million mostly relates to higher utilization of our self-insurance medical plans, a modest tick-up in T&E
expenses and incentive comp. So we held $45 million of cost savings this quarter, and that's really terrific.

Looking forward, we continue to think we can hold a lot of our pandemic period savings, perhaps more
than half. But naturally, some of those costs will come back. As of now, we think about $20 million of
cost returned in the third quarter and $30 million return in the fourth quarter. Both of those numbers are
relative to last year's same quarters.

So again, the natural question might be, what organic do you need to post third and fourth quarter to
overcome those expenses and still have margin expansion? Math would say about 7%, which is really the
real story. Recall at the beginning of the year, after expanding margins 420 basis points in 2020, we were
looking at just holding margins flat. Now we're looking at a full year margin expansion story.

So even with the return of the expenses and again, let's say, assuming for illustration a full year organic
of 7%, math would show another full point of margin expansion in 2021. That would mean our cumulative

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

2-year margin expansion would be well over 500 basis points. That really highlights the improvements in
productivity that are now ingrained in how we do business and how we operate. What a great story.

Let's move on to the Risk Management segment EBITDAC table on Page 7. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of
19.7% in the quarter is fantastic. And we continue to expect the team to deliver margins above 19% for
the full year, showing that our Risk Management segment can also hold some of the pandemic-induced
cost savings, meaning that the 2020 step-up in margin can be sustained in 2021.

Let's move now to Page 4 of the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Comparing
second quarter results in the blue section to our June IR Day estimate in the gray section, interest and
banking is in line. Clean energy came in better than our estimate, thanks to a hot late June, less wind
energy production in certain areas of the country and higher natural gas prices. Accordingly, we are
increasing our full year net earnings range to $75 million to $85 million on the back of the second quarter
upside.

You'll also notice 2 non-GAAP adjustments. One related to the costs associated with the terminated Willis
Towers Watson acquisition, and the other is a onetime deferred tax revaluation charge related to the
statutory increase in the U.K.'s 2023 corporate tax rate. When you control for those 2 items, it shows that
adjusted M&A and corporate lines were both pretty close to our June 17th estimates.

Looking ahead to the third quarter, and that's in the pinkish section, you'll see non-GAAP after-tax
adjustment for $12 million to $14 million. This charge is mostly related to redeeming $650 million of debt.
That's the 10-year senior notes we issued in mid-May. You'll read that also on Page 3 of the earnings
release. This should also lead to lower third and fourth quarter adjusted interest and banking expense,
savings maybe of $2 million to $3 million after tax each quarter.

If you turn now to Page 5 of the CFO commentary, go to the peach-colored section. Just another reminder
of what we've been discussing in these calls and during our IR Days for the last couple of years. 2021 is
the last year our clean energy investments will show GAAP P&L earnings. Rather, beginning in 2022, we
will show substantial cash flows through our cash flow statement, call it $125 million to $150 million a
year for, say, 6 to 7 years. I know I've highlighted this a lot, but I just want to make sure you consider this
as you build your 2022 models and beyond.

So next, let's go to the balance sheet on Page 14, the top line cash. At June 30, cash on hand was $3.2
billion, and we have no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. We'll use that first to redeem the
$650 million of debt I just discussed. And also today, we announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase
program. That would leave us with about $1 billion of cash. Then add to that about $650 million of net
cash generation in the second half. That's after dividends, CapEx, interest, taxes, et cetera. And we would
also have another $600 million to $700 million of borrowing capacity. Means we have upwards of $2.5
billion for M&A. When I look at the pipeline and if a capital gains tax rate change gets momentum, I think
we'll have plenty of opportunities to put that capital to work at really fair multiples.

Okay. Those are my comments, an excellent quarter, an excellent first half, a bright outlook for the second
half and a really terrific cash position. Back to you, Pat.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO
Thanks, Doug. Laura, I think we can take some questions now.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question is on, Pat, your organic growth comments. I think you mentioned that you guys would
get the full year to 8%. So if my math is right, if you were sitting at 6.4% for the first half of the year, that
would imply that you guys are expecting the back half to come close to 10%. Is there something wrong
with that thinking? Or are you thinking given the timing impact in the second quarter that we get close to
double digits in the second half of the year within Brokerage?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. Elyse, I think you might be a little strong on that based on the math. So just take a look at it again. I
think our math produced it more like towards 9%. Just like that.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. So 9%. Okay. Close. And then my second question, you guys announced a $1.5 billion share
repurchase program, right, to effectively buy back the stock issued for the Willis deal. So I just wanted to
get a sense of timing on the buyback. Is that something you expect to complete this year? And then is the
expectation that you will buy back all those shares? Or is that also a little bit dependent upon some of the
tuck-in deals, if some of them come together pretty quickly?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

No, I think as we said right now, our intent is to repurchase the $1.5 billion. We think we can get that
done in short order also and certainly by the end of the year. The point here is that we're -- we won't let
excess capital sit idle by any means.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then on the margin side, Doug, you were -- you gave us some helpful
information. And you were giving an example, right, that if you guys get to full year organic of 7% that
you could show 100 basis points of margin improvement. So is that with the saves coming back? Or is that
kind of after adjusting for the impact of saves or the expectation that we'll see about 100 points of margin
within Brokerage this year?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. I think what I'd do is using the illustration of saying if we pose 7% for the full year, you'd see about
100 basis points of margin expansion even with those costs coming back into our structure. And clearly, if
we better 7%, we should be able to better that, too.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

I had a question just on the expense side. If I just look in Brokerage at the operating expenses, noncomp,
non-D&A, just the OpEx line, if I take out the $15 million of incremental costs, it looks like expenses were
roughly flat year-over-year. Doug, I think you spoke about this a little bit in your comments. But I guess
I'm just wondering, is that sort of right that the underlying expenses in the business were sort of flat year-
over-year? And would you expect that to continue for the rest of this year?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

So did you take the entire $15 million out of OpEx? Or did you spread some of that into comp? And then
also did you factor in M&A? But you're not far off of that being pretty close to flat when you factor in M&A.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. I was just looking purely at OpEx. So it was roughly flat. But that's something that you think can
continue for the rest of the year just given some of the changes you guys made over the course of last
year?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. I think that we -- like I said, I think the $20 million will come back in the third quarter of expenses,
and I think $30 million will come back in the fourth quarter. That will be split some between OpEx and
some between compensation. But by and large, our underlying costs other than maybe in the IT areas,
we're starting to see savings in real estate. We're starting to see savings in professional fees. We are
seeing increases in travel and entertainment expenses because some of our clients are expecting us to be
there and we're happy to be there for it.

But you are seeing some good learnings from the pandemic. We have pretty well taken care of all of our
incoming and outgoing mail that's saving some costs there. So we can centralize that. So we can deploy
mail anywhere around the world with a touch of a button. So there are some good projects that have been
going on to -- that we're continuing to harvest out of the operating expense line.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Yes. That continues to come in a bit better than I would have thought. I guess any sort of update
on the thinking in terms of the sustainable expense saves that you're getting from COVID of -- I think it
was 150 to 175. Is that still a good sort of level to think about? Or yes, any sort of changes to that?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. Let's level set. We're saving, let's say, let's call it, $65 million a quarter during the pandemic, and we
think that we can hold $30 million of that, $35 million of that. So again, back to -- I don't know where
your $150 million came from unless it was $60 million times 4.5 and then divided by 2. But where did you
get the $150 million from?

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I was using more of a range that you guys have given. But no, that makes sense. That makes sense. I
guess also maybe just on the growth side. I guess could you just break down if we sort of look at the
organic, the 9% in Brokerage on sort of a clean basis? Could you just talk about some of the different
components of that, whether that is rate versus exposure versus new business and share gains and how
you expect each of those to trend over the course of this year?

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Okay. So new business is stronger than where we were same second quarter or, let's say, for the year, new
business remains stronger. Retention is about the same. We're getting lift from rate and exposure that
when we combine that together, right now, I think it's about 50-50 rate and 50% exposure.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Some of your end markets have been a little slower getting ramped up maybe compared to other
more cyclical end markets. Could you expand on that just a little bit?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

What do you mean end markets?

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Well, I think you were talking about your customers, if I heard you properly. Tell me if I didn't -- like your
customers...

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

I think what you're talking about is our employee benefit business. You see a lot of headline recovery in
employment staff that generally are citing retail, hospitality, travel-related industries. Our customer base
is not concentrated in those industries. It's more diverse than that. And it's just the return to work in our
customer base isn't quite at those headline returning to work numbers that you see there. Is that what
you're asking about, Mark? Nothing -- it's just a mix of business down in our benefits business.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Right. Yes. Got you. Yes. No, that was my question. And Pat, on pricing, I might not have heard all of your
commentary, but it seems like looking at some of your specific numbers compared to last time, they were
as good or better in Q1. It seems like there's some broader discussion of potential deceleration. Why do
you think you may be seeing it a little more optimistically than others perhaps?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Just from where I sit, Mark, when I'm talking to people in the field and when I'm talking to our
underwriting partners, there just doesn't seem to be any appetite for cutting. Now rate of increase is
down. But I'm not seeing people say, "Oh, gosh, we get this thing right. Let's open the floodgates."

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

We're seeing a little bit of -- I think there's a little bit -- I think the larger account market, our larger-sized
market, we saw increases in premiums there that were a little higher than, let's say, the mid-market or
the smaller market throughout the end of 2020 and here in the first half of '21. So we're just not seeing
if the large account market is not growing rates quite as fast as they were in the past. We're not really
seeing that as much in the mid-market. We're seeing it more consistent with first quarter and fourth
quarter.

Did we lose you there, Mark?

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

No, here, I'm back. I'm sorry. Just curious if -- in a public forum, any thoughts you'd care to share around
the potential for adding some staff in light of the Willis Towers Watson, Aon breakup. Are you seeing
anything out in the market, any people moving that is noteworthy?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, no, we don't. But as you know, Mark, you've followed us a long time. Organic hiring is a big part of
our strategy. And there's no doubt that we're going to continue to hire production talent across all lines of
business that we've got. And our doors have -- even in the depths of a soft market, you've followed us.
You know the door is open for production talent.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to touch a little bit on capital management. I guess the $850 million of the raised debt that
you're keeping, is it fair to interpret, Doug, your comments about M&A potential as being able to utilize
that $850 million?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes, absolutely. That's cash in the bank right now. We think that we might have to borrow a little bit more
toward the end of the year or first part of next year, depending on how the M&A pipeline looks at. But the
$650 million, there's a special mandatory redemption feature in there. So we'll pay that back. And then
we're happy with the $850 million that we raised along with that and that we'll get back to work here in
the second half of the year.

Okay. I might be trying too hard with this one. But if you're expecting an increase in potential sellers
because of capital gains tax rate, is that likely to depress pricing on these assets at all?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

You might have a little bit and -- but I think it will put -- truthfully, I think that might put -- pricing might
stay the same, and I actually might pull forward a little bit less on an earn-out and more upfront. So you
put it here in this year. You might be feel that -- is it a full turn on the multiple? Maybe to accelerate it, not
have as much on the earn-, but I wouldn't say it's going to cause a big decrease in pricing.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

No. There's a lot of competition for deals out there.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

I'm calling in on behalf of Greg Peters. Maybe kind of sticking with M&A and the cap gains conversation,
when you're talking, I guess, to potential -- cap gains coming up within the conversation as of now? Or is
that still a thought?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

No. It's coming up every time.

Alexander Bolton
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then when looking at, I guess, M&A, I guess what -- the size of acquisitions that you're
considering, has that changed at all?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

No, we're good at tuck-ins. By the way, let's also -- Greg knows this very well actually. If, in fact, there's
39,000 agents and brokers in America, let's remember that Business Insurance just brought out its July
edition this month. #100 was $25 million in revenue. So the playing field is full of really, really good tuck-
in players.

Alexander Bolton
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. And then when thinking about margin expansion and the effect T&E has, maybe
you can touch on your thoughts around deployment of T&E and how that might be changed compared to
2019.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

All right. Let me see if I can understand that again. I thought you asked a question about India in there?
Or did I hear your word wrong?

Alexander Bolton
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

No. I guess -- no. I didn't say anything on India. It was the effect of lower T&E on margin expansion and
then how you're considering deploying T&E in the future maybe compared to 2019.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Right. Great. Well, first of all, we have no hold on -- if somebody wants to travel to see their clients,
they're more than welcome to go do it. We have no restrictions on that, and people are self-governing
on that. We will meet our clients wherever they would like us to meet them in order to conduct business
with them. So we are there on how they want to do it. How much is that? We probably have maybe $5
million a quarter of step-up from where we were in the past. So maybe there's an extra $5 million in our
first quarter, another 5 -- maybe we're at $10 million this quarter, $15 million next and $20 million next
quarter relative to the depth of the pandemic.

So we're doing -- the good thing about this, though, is that we are actually being able to bring our experts
to the point of sale virtually much more now than we were before. So remember the advantage that we
have, and that is we have experts in every single aspect of insurance around the world. We can now drop
that person into our customers' office or even if they want to do it from home virtually. International
folks, there's a lot -- there's considerably less international travel. But now we can bring our experts from
London right into our terrific client or prospect in Des Moines, Iowa with a click of a button.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

So that's really the competitive advantage that we have. And 90% of the time, we compete with
somebody smaller than us, and they just don't have the expert. So when we can drop our expert in
and bring those capabilities to bear, it's going to lead to more wins in the future. In the past, to travel
somebody in for a 0.5-hour meeting, that might be a 2- or 3-day affair. So think about even though
expenses might return to a certain extent, it's the ability to get our experts at the point of sale or the
point of -- to the prospect virtually that really is the terrific outcome from the pandemic.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.

Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP

First question, thinking about the second half of the year, about 9% organic. I think you mentioned this
quarter, you did 4% in employee benefits. You just got a lot of visibility on how that's supposed to trend. I
mean how are you guys thinking about how that would fit in the 9% in the back half?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

I think there's a sequential step-up continuing in employee benefits like we've seen. As people come
back, we're really starting to -- just even in the last few weeks, our HR consulting units are starting to get
more calls. We're starting to get -- as covered lives increase, the number of participants in medical plans
and dental plans is stepping up. So if that 4% went to 6% and then went to 8% over the next couple of
quarters, then it wouldn't surprise me in our employee benefit.

Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP

Got it. And then on for Pat. Could you just remind us why -- I mean you see guys do like 40 deals a year,
but very few of them seem to be wholesale related. When you think about wholesale M&A, why don't we
see more of those?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

We're very active there, Ryan. I think it's just opportunistic. We've built RPS over the last 20-plus years in
large part with acquisitions. And we've done some nice acquisitions over the last 12 months in RPS. One
of the areas we've built out, of course, we're the country's largest MGA. We also have a program business
that's really strong. But open market brokerage, we've built the typical Gallagher way. We recruited our
own and built our own young people out of our internship, and we've done some very nice acquisitions
there. So no, there's no hold back there. And actually, there's no real shortage of opportunities, a lot of
competition, one of which had a very successful IPO this month.

Operator

Our last question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. So Pat, I guess I'm not sure how to put this, but I hope it's not offensive. But I
know there's a complaint I'm going to get tonight and into tomorrow, is the organic growth seems to be
lagging peers. And I understand the timing issue in the -- with the contingent and the 606. But even at
9%, it feels like people are going to -- I suspect people are going to -- how do you want me to respond to
this as I'm looking at conversations over the next day?

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Well, I think it's -- I'll let Doug give you the technical side, Phil, because he's good at that, but let's put it
this way. If you chuck me in the room, here's what I'd say. I'm really proud of our team. We had a great
quarter. And so did our competitors. God bless them. And if you take a look at our results over the past
number of years versus anyone else you want to put up into that, our team gets up every morning and
aggressively sells a lot of insurance.

And so I take no second stance to the fact that this quarter was anything but outstanding. And one
quarter comparables doesn't get my dander up. Doug could give you a more technical answer, but I think
our people did a great job of selling insurance and holding on to our clients. And I'm really happy with the
quarter. On a comparable basis, there's others that look stronger. I'm okay with that.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. I think, Phil, one of the things you might want to do is take last year's second quarter and this year's
second quarter for all of us, add them up, and I think you might find that the delta isn't all that much
different. And like Pat said, so over 2 years, we're up about 10% organically in aggregate in our Brokerage
segment. And again, I think that if you do the math on those that have reported or wherever your other
insights are coming from, their second quarter and their second -- last year and this quarter might add up
to about the same number.

I think that running towards 9% is the best quarter since we posted since fourth quarter 2003. And like
Pat said, this level of organic growth isn't an aberration just to 1 of us or 2 of us or whatever. The entire
industry is showing excellent organic growth. Industry is growing at a much higher clip than GDP. And
I guess what I would say is our outlook for the second half of the year is pretty bullish. So that's how I
would answer it. But mathematically, take the 2 quarters together, and we won't be all that far apart when
you have like-for-like business.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I guess part of this comes back to -- if I think about the 2-year stack that you're suggesting, it comes
back to the idea that your clients were more persistent, and so we don't get the ebb and the flow that
we've seen in the recovery last year. I guess is that a fair way to tie that commentary into the numbers?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

The other way I might put it, Phil, is we're doing a better job than our competition in mitigating the impact
of rates for our clients.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Fair. So Pat, when I think about the -- you said that the door is always open for talent
that wants to come. As part of the agreement for the Willis potential businesses that were going to be
acquired, was there any noncompete or no shop for talent provisions within that, that would keep you on
the sidelines from certain talent that might be wanting -- looking around?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we have some limitations. We've agreed, of course, that we intend to honor those, and they're not
extensive. But generally speaking, we're not limited in our ability to hire general production talent. But of
course, in that discussion, in that transaction, there are some limitations, which we intend to honor.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. Okay. Perfect. Congrats. And look, I think the margin expansion story over the past few years has
been probably second to none. So hopefully, that's the takeaway that you get for me in my comments
tonight.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Appreciate it.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & CFO

Thanks, Phil.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Let me just make a few comments here. We delivered, obviously, an excellent second quarter. I'm
extremely proud of our team. I believe that we are in the best business in the world, and we're delivering
significant value for our clients around the globe day in and day out. Thank you all for being with us this
evening, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks very much. Thank you, Laura.
