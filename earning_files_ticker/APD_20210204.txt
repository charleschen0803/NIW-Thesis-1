Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Thank you, Liane. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products First Quarter 2021 Earnings Results
Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and
Sustainability. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott

This discussion contains forward-looking statements please refer to the forward-looking statement

Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. We thank you for taking time from your busy schedule
to be on our call today. We are living at a time that all humanity faces significant challenges. The most
important and immediate one is the battle against the deadly virus that has already taken many lives and
continues to ravage communities around the globe. We can only fight this deadly and global virus if we
work together and stay united. In my more than 45 years in business, I have learned that all problems, no
matter how challenging, can be solved if we stay focused and united working toward the common goal.

So it is in this spirit of working together as a team that I want to acknowledge the united and
extraordinary efforts of all the talented, committed and resilient people of Air Products around the world.
They work hard every day to provide critical products and services to our customers. Our people working
in solidarity and in a determined way, have made it possible for us to keep our 750 facilities around the
world operating during this unprecedented crisis. They are the ones who are making it possible for us
to deliver the good results we see this quarter. And they are the ones who are pushing forward with
developing and executing major world-class projects to ensure our growth in the future. They are the
ones who, through their actions every day, give meaning to our higher purpose as a company, which is
to help humanity move forward in a sustainable way and bring people together to help solve energy and
environmental challenges. Our people are the soul of our company, and I am very proud to stand with
them.

Now please turn to Slide #3. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products.
It's our moral responsibility to keep our people safe and our goal will always be 0 accidents and incidents.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our
strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers and our communities.

On Slides 4, 5 and 6, you can again see our goal, our management philosophy, and our 5-point plan
for moving forward. These are the principles that we follow every day. They drove our performance
improvement in the past and will continue to guide us in the future. While we have accomplished a great
deal in the past 6 years, transforming Air Products and delivering superior performance, I always prefer to
focus on the future because I prepare the dreams of the future through the history of the past.

I have shared our dreams of the future with you before, which you can see highlighted on Slide #7. I
would like to repeat them again. Our dream of the future is to be the safest, most diverse and most
profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our dream of the future is to be the largest American
chemical company as measured by market capitalization. Our dream of the future is to be the leader in
providing solutions to the world's significant energy and environmental challenges. And we believe Air
Products has a higher purpose beyond delivering superior financial results, bringing people together to
work together and deliver sustainable solutions that benefit our customers and our world. This is what
drives us every day.

Now please turn to Slide #8. I'm proud to say that during the past 12 months, we have made significant
progress in making these dreams a reality. We have significantly improved our safety record. Our
margins remain highest in the industry. We announced our new sustainability goals, including carbon
intensity reduction and diversity goals. These are consistent with our growth opportunities and our higher
purpose. We helped drive our market cap increase by improving our earnings per share by over 10% on
average over the last 6 years, with positive EPS growth in 2020 despite the negative impact of COVID-19
pandemic. We have continued to create and win projects that help customers and countries meet their
growing needs for cleaner energy and environmental solutions.

Let me share a few of the examples of these large important projects that demonstrate progress on our
strategy. We've won 4 world-scale LNG heat exchanger projects over the last year, including the Qatargas
megaproject, and the project in Mexico that we announced earlier this week. These projects are already
contributing to our bottom line as we continue to complete them for our customers. We are executing
the Gulf Coast Ammonia project in the U.S. Gulf Coast and have acquired the hydrogen assets of our PBF
customer in California and Delaware. These projects will further enhance our hydrogen leadership position
in the United States. We announced the $2 billion coal-to-methanol project, categorized as a national
strategic project by the Indonesian government to support energy development and transition and reduce
the country's reliance on fuel imports. We also announced the innovative NEOM project in Saudi Arabia to
provide the world with a robot map to transition to carbon-free that is green hydrogen, the energy source
of the future.

Now please turn to Slide #9. We remain committed to delivering superior financial performance. And as
I said, our people also know they are supporting the higher purpose in the work they do every day. Our
industrial gas enterprise is critical to the success of dozen industries and the scope and complexity of
our megaprojects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts
of the world to work together as one team. We are proud to bring people from diverse backgrounds and
experiences together to collaborate and develop these innovative solutions for some of the most significant
energy and environmental challenges in the world. That is our higher purpose that inspires our team and
drives us every day.

Now please turn to Slide #10, which highlights our key gasification projects. We are committed to our
gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We continue to see countries
and large companies, driving to convert low-value feedstock into high-value products. They have identified
gasification as the best way to use abundant, low-value resources like coal, petcoke and refinery volumes
in a sustainable manner. And we are in the best position to work with them and help them deliver better,
more sustainable solutions that benefit their economies and their people. We do expect to announce
additional gasification projects in the future.

Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 largest gasification projects, which I discussed
during our last earnings call. First, our $12 billion acquisition of the Jazan Gasifier and Power Plant from

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Saudi Aramco. Since our last call with investors on November 11, 2020, we have continued our discussions
with Saudi Aramco to finalize all of the contracts, arrange the financing and move towards the financial
close. I am encouraged by the progress we have made in the last 3 months. And I would especially like
to thank the Saudi Aramco very senior management for the positive steps they have taken to move
this transaction forward. We obviously still have work to do to bring this significant project to a final
conclusion. But I am more optimistic than I was 3 months ago.

The second project we discussed on the last earnings call was Lu'An. We have reached an agreement with
Lu'An to temporarily reduce our fixed monthly fee during the time that the plant is shut down. And Lu'An
has agreed to extend the length of the contract, which improves our return. Lu'An did pay us the reduced
monthly fee for the months of October, November and December. We continue to believe that the plan will
be restarted during this fiscal year.

Now please turn to Slide #11, which reflects our recently announced 12% dividend increase, raising
our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share for an annual rate of $6 a share. This dividend increase is
a reminder that while we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities, we have significant
cash flow that supports this substantial dividend increase, the 39th consecutive year of increase for Air
Products.

And finally, Slide #12, shows our EBITDA margin. As always, my favorite slide, that it shows that the
margin is up over 1,400 basis points since 2014. I am very proud of our team who continue to deliver
EBITDA margins of nearly 40% for the quarter despite the challenges facing us.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, to provide a financial overview. Scott?

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi stated earlier, our company continued to demonstrate resilience, delivering both
higher sales and EBITDA this quarter despite the challenges of the pandemic. Our business, which is about
half on-site, continue to deliver stable cash flow in spite of the difficult conditions continuing around the
world.

Now please turn to Slide 13 for a brief discussion of our first quarter results. Sales of $2.4 billion were up
5% compared to prior year, driven by strong price, higher energy pass-through and a positive currency
impact. Price actions continue to be an area of focus for us and improved in all 3 regions. This is the 14th
consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gain. Volume was relatively stable, down 1% as the additions
of new plants, acquisitions and increased sale of equipment activities were more than offset by COVID-19
impacts and the reduced Lu'An contribution that Seifi mentioned.

EBITDA of $932 million was up 3% as favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income more than
offset the impact of lower volume and higher cost primarily due to higher planned maintenance outages.
EBITDA margin declined about 100 basis points as lower volumes, including Lu'An and higher costs driven
by increased planned maintenance in North America, more than offset the positive price impact. Operating
income was 4% lower, while EBITDA was higher compared to last year, largely due to depreciation on new
plants, particularly the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired last year.

COVID-19 continued to negatively impact our business. We estimate the pandemic reduced overall sales
by about 4% and EPS by about $0.10 to $0.15. ROCE was 250 basis points lower, negatively impacted by
the step-up in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt. Sequentially, the 3% weaker volume
was driven primarily by seasonality, Lu'An and lower sale of equipment activities. However, sales were up
overall sequentially as this lower volume was more than offset by favorable currency, higher energy pass-
through and positive price.

Now please turn to Slide 14. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.12 was comparable to last year, despite
the negative $0.10 to $0.15 impact of COVID-19. Volume was unfavorable $0.25. The negative impacts of
COVID-19 and Lu'An more than offset the PBF acquisition and new plants. Volume was nearly flat in sales,
but unfavorable in EPS due to business mix. Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.17, with increases

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

in all regions. Cost was unfavorable $0.06 as we executed planned maintenance projects and added new
resources for future growth.

For this quarter, we also benefited from the settlement of a supply contract. Currency and foreign
exchange contributed $0.06, primarily due to appreciation of the Chinese RMB and euro relative to
the U.S. dollar. Equity affiliate income added $0.04 due to strong underlying business results, while
noncontrolling interest was also favorable $0.04 on lower profits in our consolidated joint ventures,
primarily due to Lu'An. As a reminder, we consolidate 100% of Lu'An's results, given our 60% majority
ownership of the joint venture and deduct our partners' 40% interest in the noncontrolling interest line.

Interest expense was $0.07 unfavorable due to the costs associated with the additional $5 billion of debt.
The remaining $0.05 includes a favorable $0.04 pension impact and a favorable $0.01 impact from a lower
tax rate. The effective tax rate of 19.3% was down 50 basis points from prior year. We still expect our
effective tax rate to be around 20% to 21% in fiscal year '21.

Now please turn to Slide 15. We continue to generate strong cash flow, underscoring the stability of
our business. Over the last 12 months, we generated almost $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or
about $0.115 -- $11.50 per share. From our EBITDA of over $3.6 billion, we paid interest, taxes and
maintenance capital. Note, our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending
on our new corporate headquarters.

From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 40% or over $1.1 billion as dividends to our shareholders
and still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow,
even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends
and capital deployment.

Slide #16 provides additional details on our capital deployment. We continue to have substantial
investment capacity remaining. As you can see, we expect about $18 billion of investment capacity
available over the 5-year period from FY '18 through FY '22. The $18 billion includes over $9 billion of cash
and additional debt capacity available today; about $2.5 billion of investable cash flow between now and
the end of FY '22; and about $6 billion already spent.

Additionally, we will generate more cash and borrowing capacity as projects come on stream. And some
of the spending in our backlog extends beyond FY '22. We expect to reframe this potential for you later
in 2021. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/
A2 rating. With a few new projects signed and some coming on stream, our total project and M&A
commitments increased slightly to $12.7 billion, with about $11 billion remaining to spend on them. So
you can see, we have already spent almost 35% and already committed 95% of the capacity we show
here.

Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide #17 for our Asia results. Compared to last year, currency, price
and energy pass-through resulted in a 4% increase in sales despite weaker volumes. Currency, favorable
across most key countries, contributed 6%. Overall, price rose 1% for the region, which represents a
3% increase for merchant products. I'd like to remind you that pricing was positive for Asia for the 15th
consecutive quarter and particularly strong in Korea and Taiwan this quarter.

Volumes were down 4%, with new plants more than offset by Lu'An, while the merchant business
remained stable. Despite the impact of lower volumes, a strong price and favorable currencies kept
EBITDA -- we kept EBITDA relatively stable. EBITDA margin at almost 48% was 240 basis points lower,
primarily driven by lower volumes, mostly from Lu'An. Sequentially, sales were up 1% with favorable
currencies more than offsetting the weaker volumes, EBITDA increased 4%, primarily driven by lower
costs, while favorable currency offset the negative impact of weaker volumes.

Now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk about our Americas results.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Americas results. Sales were flat compared
to last year. Higher price and energy pass-through were offset by lower volumes. Price was again better
across all major product lines. The 3% increase for the region was equivalent to 7% for merchant. This is
the tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement.

Volume was down, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, but partially offset by the PBF acquisition.
EBITDA of $400 million was 2% below last year's level as better price and the PBF acquisition were offset
by this volume shortfall and higher maintenance costs.

For the quarter, although Americas' planned maintenance was higher than last year, it is consistent with
what we expect in Q2. EBITDA margin dipped 90 basis points, with a negative 80 basis point impact
from higher energy pass-through, while the unfavorable cost impact was largely offset by other favorable
factors, including price and acquisitions.

Now I'll make some comments on our sequential results. Sales increased 2% as higher energy pass-
through and positive price overcame negative volume. Price was up across all major product lines, while
volume was weaker primarily due to seasonality. EBITDA declined 3% as weaker volume was partially
offset by better price. Margin was down primarily on higher energy pass-through, which had about a 200
basis point impact.

Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region
results. Our EMEA team delivered outstanding results this quarter. Both sales and profits grew double-digit
compared to both last year and last quarter. Price, volume and currency were all favorable and contributed
to the 13% year-on-year sales growth. Volumes grew 5%, principally due to acquisitions and higher on-
site volumes, which offset the adverse impact of COVID-19, predominantly in our packaged gas business.
Price increased 3% for the region and 4% for merchant, with improvement across most major product
lines and subregions. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement.

Currencies were favorable 6%, primarily due to the euro strength versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA surged
18% to more than $220 million, supported by price increases, favorable currency and acquisitions. EBITDA
margin improved 170 basis points. Sequentially, volume improvement was driven by a modest COVID-19-
related recovery in our merchant business, acquisitions and higher on-site volumes. EBITDA was also up
sequentially and margins remained about flat.

Now please turn to Slide 20, global gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment business as well
as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activity, but profit was lower due
to business mix and higher product development spending. As mentioned earlier, we also benefited from
the settlement of a supply contract, which offset the gains in project activities last year.

Please turn to Slide 21, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate
costs. Sales and profits were higher this quarter versus prior year, driven by LNG project activities as we
continue to execute multiple large projects, including Golden Pass and Mozambique, the massive Qatargas
project also began to contribute this quarter. Sales and profits were both down versus prior quarter,
primarily due to timing of percent complete activity on the LNG projects. We were excited to announce
another new project earlier this week for the Energia Costa Azul LNG Export terminal in Ensenada, Mexico.
This represents the fourth LNG project we've announced in the last year.

Now to provide some additional thoughts, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Thank you, Simon. Now please go to Slide #22. As we look forward, unfortunately, we do not expect the
COVID-19 global crisis to moderate anytime soon. This will continue to have a negative impact on the
economies of most of the countries we operate. We have confidence that the vaccine will help to reverse
the course, but the rollout is still in early stages and the pace of vaccination is hard to predict. As a result,
we continue to find it very difficult to make any reasonable projections about the course of economic
activity around the world. Therefore, we are not providing EPS guidance or CapEx guidance for quarter 2
or for our fiscal year 2021 at this time. We hope the outlook will be less uncertain in April. And if so, we
look forward to providing you guidance then.

However, I want to share with you what we are seeing so far this quarter, that is in the month of January
and as of today in February. Representing about half of our sales, our on-site business has been stable,
and we expect this to continue. With respect to our merchant business, in Asia, our merchant volumes are
down slightly versus where they were at the same time last year, which is before the virus crisis began. So
the volumes have reached almost precrisis levels.

In Europe, we are off to a weaker start following the holiday season and continue to see a larger impact
on our packaged gases business versus the liquid bulk business. In Americas, merchant volumes remain
down, and I would like to remind you again that we do not have a packaged gas business in North
America.

As we move forward, we remain committed to executing our growth strategy, providing sustainable
solutions to help the world meets its increasing needs for cleaner energy. With our strong portfolio, we
are able to meet customers' and countries' drive for cleaner and more sustainable solutions. We see great
opportunities ahead in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility, and we continue to develop
and invest in strategic opportunity to drive our growth for decades to come.

As always, the continued success -- the continue -- I'm sorry, as always, the continued success of
this strategy is rooted in the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products.
Our resilient and focused people understand the critical role they play in safely operating more than
750 facilities around the world, executing broader scale projects that support economic and social
development. As Air Products, we will work together to deliver these solutions to our customers and to the
world.

I am proud to say that unlike many other companies, we have not reduced staff or reduced the salary of
our people during this pandemic. Indeed, we have continued to strengthen our organization by adding the
resources necessary to pursue great opportunities. We have stood by our people.
In closing today, I would like to thank all of our dedicated and hard-working people around the world who
continue to deliver despite these challenging times. I am proud to be working with them every single day.
Now we are pleased to answer your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Two questions on 2 of your big projects. First one on Lu'An. With the renegotiation of the contract, do the
economics change at all once the plant is back up and running?

And then the second one is just around NEOM. And on that one, when should we see the groundbreaking
kind of by segment? So when should we see the solar and the wind farm start? When will we see the
ammonia plant start? And then when will we see the electrolyzer start? If you think about that, kind of
what's the timing of those relative to each other? And then maybe just a last one, tied on there, have you
already ordered long lead time equipment for the NEOM project?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Duffy, thank you for your question. With respect to Lu'An, we -- as I said, we had negotiated a reduction
of fixed fee during the time the plant is shut down. But Lu'An has agreed to extend the contract. So once
the plant comes back on stream, our overall return will be a little bit better than before.

The second thing is that with respect to NEOM, we are finalizing the agreements and all of that, you know
how it is and doing pre-engineering and all of that. We hope to break ground sometime in May-June time
frame, and we have ordered some of the long-term items. We are in the process of doing that in very -- in
the next few days. And we expect, obviously, then everything to come on stream as we go forward for a
start-up in 2025.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Seifi, as you consider future projects in China, based on your experience with Lu'An, do you anticipate
increasing a sovereign premium or your hurdle rate as you evaluate future projects?

And then I had a second question on volume what was the impact from Lu'An in the quarter? And I think
you also mentioned an impact from lower sale of equipment affecting volume in the quarter, if you could
quantify that as well, it would be helpful.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Kevin, first of all, I mean, you -- the way you are asking the question about Lu'An as if it is a -- something
that -- I mean, Lu'An is a specific case, we have gone through that with you in terms of what is
happening. We do have 4 other gasification projects in China. They are operating. There is no issue. They
have been paid for the past few years. And we continue to being -- continue that. And with Lu'An, the fact
that we agreed to a decrease while the plant is shut down, is a sign that we are trying to work with the
customer because there is a lot -- plenty of new opportunities.

So there is no change in our view about investing in China. We have had an excellent experience. We are
having EBITDA margins of 48%. We see significant opportunities. That is the economy of the future and to
ignore it would be really shortsighted. And therefore, we continue to be committed to that country the way
we have been before.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

With respect to exactly quantifying those 2 numbers that you want to do, I'm as hesitant to do that
because then we will tell you exactly what are the terms and conditions of our contract with Lu'An and
with sale of equipment, and that is not very wise for us to do that. I hope you give us a pass on that.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

If I could just ask Seifi, we're about to go into a period of time where we're going to start lapping COVID.
It sounds like you still have some concerns about what that impact could be. And so we shouldn't think of
it as being maybe a tailwind for you in the coming quarters as we go through the harder parts of that. Is
that correct? Or is there some other things or risks that you see in the outlook? So that would be my first
question.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Vincent, thank you for bringing your very thoughtful question. I know that everybody is very optimistic,
wants to be optimistic, all of us have been wanting to be optimistic, way back in the summer, then the
number of cases have got down, the number of deaths were down, and then you saw what happened. I
have no idea what is going to happen. I hope that vaccine and all of that will work. But there is still 4,000
people a day are dying. The number of cases is now -- has come down, but still, there is 100,000 cases. I
don't know whether there will be another round, there will be another variant and so on.

So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I know that everybody -- believe me, us, more than anybody
else would love to be done with this COVID and go back to our normal lives, but I'm responsible for giving
investors a balanced view of what we expect. And I just don't want to run ahead of ourselves and tell
everybody that everything is rosy.

The part of the world, which is especially giving us problem is actually the United States of America, where
the volumes are down. So I don't know how it will work out, but if it does, for the better, then we are in a
better shape. But we just -- you can accuse us of being conservative, maybe we are, but we just want to
have a balanced view of it.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's fair enough. And just as a follow-up, there was elevated planned maintenance expense this quarter
in the prior quarter. How should we be thinking about that over the next couple of quarters? Are you done
with that? Or is there more to come?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

On that one, I would say that you should see the numbers become better as we go forward because a lot
of the higher maintenance was driven by the refinery shutdowns and all of that. That's not all under our
control. A lot of people took advantage of the COVID thing to have turnarounds. So I'm hoping that those
numbers will look better as we go forward.

And we'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

But I was a little confused in the commentary about COVID punishing your U.S. business, where you
note that you don't have a packaged gas business, and yet that was the source of COVID pressure in

Europe. So is it something to do with the refining industry? Or could you give us a little more color on
what particular end markets may be causing you trouble from a COVID standpoint in the Americas?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Helium. We serve a lot of helium to MRI machines and to balloons and all of that. People are not doing
elective surgeries, the volumes of helium is down. And people are not having many parties and the
general activity is down. So that is one thing. And also the volumes on our hydrogen pipeline is down.
Some of it is because of the refineries being shut down. But overall, the activity people are not driving as
much. So those are the things that has been causing us trouble.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then my ask on Lu'An, and maybe you're reluctant to provide the specifics, but do
you have comfort in knowing exactly why they haven't restarted and that gives you the confidence that
it happens sometime? It would seem like coal gasification when oil has rallied as much as it has, maybe
more competitive? Maybe a little more color there would be helpful?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Look with respect to Lu'An, there are a lot of different -- you can put in the several different cases about
why the plant is shut down, if there's reorganization on all of that. And I don't want to publicly talk about
that because it has a reflection on the management of that company, and I don't want to be negative on
that.

But the Lu'An situation will resolve itself, we are confident that, that plant will restart and the arrangement
that we have come with the company is accommodating us, accommodating them, and they have a lot of
new projects underway, that we want to participate in. So I'm not as worried about Lu'An as our investors
seem to be, but we need to wait and see and we report to you what we know as of the time that we are
reporting to you.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Seifi, Jazan began starting up last quarter. Where are they in the process of their ramp up?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

They are still commissioning the different units of the facility. And we are obviously there, helping
them. I believe -- I don't know the exact number, but we almost have close to 200 people helping them
commission the facility. I'm not sure that crude has been officially introduced into the stream, and that's a
question that should be directed towards Saudi Aramco. But overall, we have, as I said, a large number of
people working with the Saudi team in a very productive way to start-up the facility.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then secondly, the refining industry is under a lot of pressure. Are your refining customers generally
at minimum take on their contracts? And as they restructure here over the next several quarters or a
couple of years, is there anything we need to look out for in terms of the integrity of the contracts?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

About the integrity of the contracts, no, the fact that our customers are not taking as much as they used
to take before is a fact. As I told you, the volume in our pipeline in the Gulf Coast is down. But it's very
regional. I mean, different parts of the world is different, then, for example, in California, our pipeline
volumes are doing okay. So it depends on which region you are. But there is no question that overall,
people are not driving as much, and therefore, there is an impact on the refining industry. You know that
better than I do.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

In terms of Jazan, what's the issue in the negotiation? That is, why wasn't the deal closed earlier? And
what are the issues that you're trying to work out in order to get to a resolution? And how long do you
think it might take?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the things that we have to discuss is, as I told you before, Jeff, one was the fact that when we
initially negotiated the contract with Saudi Aramco, we expected a significantly higher interest rate for the
$7.2 billion of debt that we have to finance. Today, because of the market condition, the actual interest
rates are obviously lower than that. So the issue that we have had to negotiate and we have negotiated
that, but is -- how much of that saving goes to each party. That's basically -- I mean, we were assuming
X amount of interest. Now it is lower, therefore, the -- so who gets the benefit of it and how much of it. So
that was one issue in terms of negotiation.

The second thing is that we are trying to erase $7.2 billion of debt. That is not an easy task with a lot of
banks involved and all of that, and that, the terms, conditions and all of that. So those are the 2 issues
that we need to work out.

In terms of how long it takes I think -- I'm hoping that we will be done with this thing by the May, June.
But it takes time and it is unpredictable. There is a lot of factors. This is a geopolitical thing. The view
of the banks changes every day, the view of Saudi Aramco changes every day. So I'm not pessimistic.
I'm actually optimistic. I think we'll get this thing done at some point in time. But the issue -- those
are the 2 issues that we are working on. I think one of them, we have worked on. I think you have an
understanding with the senior management of Aramco in terms of what we're going to do in terms of
sharing of the profit. But the devil is in the details, all of this has to be translated into actual contract
language and the debt has to be a arranged. So that's what is taking time.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then my second question is, I guess, a question of clarification to Scott. Scott, when you were
reviewing the Americas business, did you say that you thought the -- either the operating income or the
EBITDA in the second quarter would look like the first?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Scott, would you please answer that? I don't have the [indiscernible]

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Happy to. Yes, yes. Yes. Thanks, Jeff, for the question. I appreciate it. And my comment there
was regarding the maintenance spending. And as Seifi mentioned, these terms are driven by when our
customers take turnarounds, plant turnarounds. So it's a technical term here and the spending on that and

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

the expense that will incur is kind of lumpy. And my comment in there is for the second quarter, not be
surprised if we see the same sort of level of maintenance that we saw in the first quarter.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

So question on Lu'An. You mentioned that you have 3 other gasifiers that are running in China. So what is
the underlying issue with Lu'An? Is it just -- is it -- it looks like it's company-specific? And is it that it's not
profitable at current coal price? Or is it the downstream process into fuels that is an issue? Can you just
shed some light on that?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

P.J., number one, we have 4 other gasification projects that are working. It is a specific issue related to
Lu'An. And as much as people would like me to convert that into economic reason, I think it has to do, and
I need -- as I said, I need to be careful because I don't want to say anything kind of implying that there is
a little bit of a confusion with the management there and so on. But the state of Chongqing has decided to
consolidate all of the chemical facilities into one facility.

They have new people and all of that, and those people have said we want to look at everything and look
at our options and all of that. That is more of a reason for keeping the plant shut down than anything to
do economically and all of that. But the fact that coal prices are higher in China significantly in the last few
months because of the winter, and the fact that the parent company can sell coal, I mean, you can make
a lot of theoretical argument, but it's just basically that the new management is taking their time trying to
assess their options.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. And then just quickly on your EMEA. You have a packaged gas business that's down in Europe.
Would you say that post-COVID, that business will have the most upside in a recovery?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it will. Yes, it will. But I have to say that our team in Europe is doing a wonderful job. The results that
they have produced this last quarter, considering what's going on there is very, very good. They have their
act together. They keep pushing the pricing, and they are doing a very good job. But if COVID goes away,
there is significant upside there. Yes, absolutely.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Seifi, just on Jazan, how soon after the issues resolved and the deals are completed, the contract signed,
can the project come online and startup?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

The day that we do the financial close, we are online. Whether the refinery is online or not, that our bid is
a fixed BFC thing, as like other deals. So the day that we do the financial closing, the next day, we will see
the benefit of the EPS on our bottom line. So you need to look for the announcement about the financial
cost. Yes.

Great. And just on potential new green hydrogen projects. I know you're working on them. Is there
potential for another announcement this year on green hydrogen?

Seifollah Ghasemi

David, I'm not going to go there. I have no idea. I mean, we are working on other projects and all of that.
But for me to be that specific, would not be responsible when those things are very big projects. We are
working on other projects. But to be that specific, I can't be that. You need to give me a pass on that, too.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Seifi, in terms of EPS growth, you did a nice job in 2020. Can you still generate some EPS growth in '21? I
know you can't give any specifics, but the model seems to be built to be able to do that on an annualized
basis. So then has the growth algorithm changed at all longer-term in terms of what you think you could
do in terms of EPS growth?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

No. We still believe that on the average, in the next 5 or 6 years, we will deliver about 10%, the same way
that we have done in the last 6 years. My view hasn't changed on that. That is our goal, and we will make
that happen and we'll do our best to make it happen. There is no fundamental structure or reason that --
yes, go ahead.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Just any comments on '21 in terms of your ability to grow?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, in '21, if -- quite frankly, if COVID subsides, Lu'An starts and we close on Jazan at a reasonable time,
then the 10% increase should not be too much of a problem. It depends. We are not giving any guidance,
not only because of COVID, but also because of these 2 big things can have an effect. So we just need to
be a little bit patient to see how the bidding works out. But we, obviously, I'm very optimistic about the
future of Air Products. For sure. That's why I bought a lot of shares in December, as you know. So I'm
personally, I'm very optimistic, but we have to give you a balanced picture here.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

Seifi, you mentioned that your hydrogen pipeline on the U.S. Gulf has slowed. But in California, it remains
firm. I was just curious whether that is potentially a bit of an end market difference? You have some of the
refineries in California converting their hydrotreaters and hydrocrackers over to renewable diesel. And just
wanted to hear your view on whether there is a potential longer-term opportunity here to Air Products, if
there is a kind of an expansion of the renewable diesel opportunity nationwide rather than just California,
whether the net use of hydrogen per unit of diesel versus per unit of renewable diesel is meaningfully
different?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Steve, you have a very good insight. That's a very good observation. We don't want to talk about it too
much because that is really not our business. But fundamentally, what you are saying -- all of the things
that you are saying are correct, and that can actually be an upside for us. Yes, I agree with all of your
statements.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And Seifi, I remember a couple of years back, you made a comment about the number of
gasification projects that were being considered in -- I believe it was just China. And the number, if I
recall correctly, was more than 50. I just wonder whether a lot of those may have been kind of idled or
reconsidered over this past year, given much lower crude and whether or not you're seeing any pickup in
that activity in those discussions going forward now that we've seen a recovery in crude.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

There are significant number of coal gasification projects and their consideration, not only in China but
also in India and Indonesia. Those are the places where we see the most activity. And we expect, I think,
with COVID, everybody pulled back, as you know, very well in terms of capital expenditure and so on. But
as time goes by, we do -- we are optimistic about gasification. We have a very, very strong position there.
Quite frankly, we are by far the market leader. And if there is another gasification project in the world, I
would bet you 90%, that Air Products will get that. So I think that we continue to be optimistic about that.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So I guess the first one would just be on Jazan. It sounds like when you at least based on your discussion
of kind of what the sticking points are, it sounds like, assuming that this thing does get to the finish line,
that the overall profitability that you were expecting is pretty much online with your original expectations.
Is that fair? Or has anything else changed when you think about the terms or anything like that?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

First of all, John, hopefully you're well. And secondly, your statement is totally accurate. That means that
as soon as this thing is done, we will see the impact on our bottom line, kind of in line with what you
would expect.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. Perfect. And then I guess with regard to the Americas, I guess, admittedly, we were a little bit
confused on the volume weakness, where you're kind of seeing the same declines as you saw kind of at
the heat of COVID, kind of in the June quarter. So I guess why haven't things gotten better? Like when
we look at the macro, it looks like it has improved. So I guess, is it just a function of the seasonality of
refining and maybe that's kind of -- whatever, maybe that's part of the reason to blame. I guess I don't
quite understand why the Americas isn't getting at least from quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, getting better
at this point?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

John, I'll provide you an answer, and then I would like Scott to comment on that if he wants. But the
biggest impacts are maintenance costs; the second significant impact is lower helium volumes; and the
third impact is that the refineries have slowed down a bit. Those are -- and the fourth one is that the
U.S. economy is still struggling, my friend. Everybody is talking about these great rosy things. But on
the ground, we don't see that yet. So those are the 4 reasons. Scott, do you want to make any further
comments?

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

No, I agree with that. And just to also point out, like I said in the prepared remarks, that there's some
seasonality on a sequential basis. But as you mentioned, [indiscernible], there's the COVID, helium
situation. So I just agree with what you said out. All the different businesses will act differently. But when
-- as there's improvement in the economy, COVID and otherwise, we expect to see a lumpy, as things
restart and so forth as opposed to a steady increase.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I just have 2 brief ones. Just first, as it pertains to the carbon capture opportunities, do you just have a
brief update on your perspective addressable market, any internal projects? And also just anything on how
you could potentially work with third parties given your tech expertise?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Chris, the carbon capture opportunities are being driven. Things look even rosier than before because
one thing is capturing carbon to help environments and all that. But there is a significant push right now,
as I talked to the investors in the last 1.5 years to the last 2 years, that the transition to the hydrogen
economy will be gray hydrogen then blue hydrogen and then green hydrogen. There is a significant
demand now for so-called blue hydrogen. That people are thinking about making ammonia where you
capture the CO2 that is generated, then you make the hydrogen. And therefore, the ammonia is called
blue and then especially Japan wants to take that ammonia and blow it directly into their boilers for their
power plants, and that is how they are going to decarbonize.

So there is significant demand, a lot of conversations about so-called blue ammonia and blue hydrogen
and all of that. We are working our carbon capture. We continue to work on carbon capture. And as I said,
we will, in time, announce appropriate projects of the meaningful size to show you that we are making
progress on this thing. This is something I've been talking to you about for 2, 4 years. It takes -- just like
in NEOM, it takes 5 or 6 years to develop these projects. So we are working on them. And hopefully, we're
going to have some news for you in the years to come.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

We'll certainly look forward to that. And the second very brief question, just in the second half, a lot of
local media in India and Indonesia were reporting that you were actively bidding on a lot of projects. And
on the latter of which we've obviously already heard some constructive news. Can you just possibly speaks
to just the magnitude of those opportunities and the rough timeline, given it seems like you've already
bid? Is that something we could potentially expect in fiscal year '21? Or should we still be kind of more
methodical and more balanced with our expectations on this front?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Chris, one of the things that one does in life is that you learn from your past experience, right? We have
gotten a lot of heartburn because we announced Jazan before it was a done deal, and now you see every
quarter we have to explain it.

So in Indonesia, we are obviously talking about gasification projects in Indonesia. We have been telling
you, we have been doing that for the past 3.5 years. I met the ministers there 4 years ago. But we
haven't done anything that is announceable yet. We have talked to people, we have talked about projects
and all of that. And we don't want to do anything again like Jazan to come and say, "Oh, we have signed
the memorandum of understanding and all of that." And then every quarter, we have to explain why it
didn't become a project.

These projects are very complex. It depends on the actions of a lot of government agencies. It changes
the course of some of the countries, there are significant impacts on people who import product who now
are not going to be important but is very complex, and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I
have read all of those reports, I've seen all of those reports, but we just want to be responsible when we
announce something when we think is going to be a real project rather than just discussions. And I hope
you have some patience with us, Chris.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I certainly will.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.

Jonas I. Oxgaard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I would say -- I was going to pick a little bit more at the Lu'An scab here. So you mentioned that you have
high confidence that it's going to restart. But what happens if it doesn't? Is that part of your negotiations?
And is there a signed agreement with the new management there?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

But if it never -- you're talking about, but if the plant never starts?

Jonas I. Oxgaard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

We have agreed with a reduced fee. We will wait another -- as long as it takes, for a few quarters to see
whether they restart or not. But if they come and say, we are never going to start this plant, then we have
a contract. We will go to -- we will go to court and enforce our contract.

Our contract is very clear about what happens if this customer shuts down. It is very clear. It is very
defendable, and we are very confident about the outcome of that. But we didn't want to go to court
and start enforcing that because we don't know what -- the customer has never told us that they are
shutting this thing down permanently. And we didn't want to prematurely destroy our relationship with the
customers. So it's a matter of being patient and working with your customer. I mean, it is next year at this
time, and they haven't even started yet and they have sent us a letter that they are going to mothball the
plant, then we go to court and enforce our contract.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Okay. A second question, if you don't mind, on hydrogen. Your competitors and even companies who, I
guess, aren't really considered competitors, are approaching hydrogen much more tentatively, right? Your
-- one of your competitors inaugurated their first 20-megawatt electrolyzer last -- this week. But you're
going from -- well, I wouldn't say 0, but close to 0 to the 1.3 gigs in one fell swoop. Can you talk about --
like the reason why you're so confident that you can do this megaproject without baby step first? And how
are you different from the rest?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the way they are different is the same thing with gasification and everything else. The main reason
that we are doing what we are doing is that we want to be competitive and put our customers in a
competitive position to use green hydrogen. You cannot do it at small scale. The scale-up that we are
doing is that it's not as if you are taking a technological risk . We are not. I mean, what are we doing
at NEOM. We are building, yes, 4 gigawatts, 3.5 gigawatts, 4 gigawatts of wind and solar. That's known
technology. It's no big deal. Then we are building 650-tonne a day electrolysis. And everyone says, "Oh,
my God." Yes, but how are we doing that? We are going to take 30 of those 20-megawatt things that you
said and put them together. So there is no risk in there.

And then the ammonia plant, we are building 1 million-tonne ammonia plants all over the place. So we are
not taking any technological risk. What we are doing is that we are creating a megaproject so that we get
the benefit of the economy of scale. That's number one.

And then the second thing is that all of these people who are announcing these different plants, the
source of electricity is not green, and we are creating a green source of electricity. But the main thing
is we are doing megaprojects because that is how you, number one, make it economically feasible. And
number two, unless somebody like us makes a commitment to make a big project, people are not going to
convert.

I mean, if you own buses in San Francisco, you are not going to go and convert them to fuel cell vehicles,
if you don't have an assurance that you will have the green hydrogen to put in, then what's the point of
converting? So when you know that somebody is spending $6 billion, $7 billion to build the infrastructure,
then you get the confidence. That is the difference in terms of what we are doing and what they are doing.
It's not a big technological risk, but it's being the first and being the people, the first ones who develop the
infrastructure.

I mean, I don't want to make big comparisons here, but what is to making an electric car, I mean, my
God, it's a motor and a gearbox, right? But look at the Tesla and look at the GM and Volkswagen. Those
guys took the decision that first and everybody said, well, this is not going to work out because it's no
big deal. GM can do this anytime. Well look at the where their stock is and where GM's stock is. There
is significant advantage to be the first mover and you have to move on a big scale in order to make
it economical for your customers to have confidence that you're going to have the product when they
convert their fleet. So that is what we are doing.

I have no comment about what our competitors are doing. They are -- I'm sure they are very smart
people. And people like yourself, you question them about what they are doing and what they are not
doing, and I don't want to make any comment on that. But for sure, I hope we know what we are doing
and what we are doing is go for a scale, go for economy of scale, when you have the opportunity and
produce a real green hydrogen, not these toy things at 10-tonne and 20-tonne a day, that really doesn't
-- but beside that, we are doing those things. We are building a 30-tonne a day plant hydrogen in
[indiscernible]. We are building 30-tonne plant hydrogen in other parts of the world. So that's not a big
deal. But the mega-scale is the future.
