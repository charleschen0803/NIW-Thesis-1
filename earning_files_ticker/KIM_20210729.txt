KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Kimco Realty Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Bujnicki. Please go ahead.

David F. Bujnicki
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategy

Good morning, and thank you for joining Kimco's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. The Kimco
management team participating on the call include Conor Flynn, Kimco's CEO; Ross Cooper, President and
Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, our CFO; Dave Jamieson, Kimco's Chief Operating Officer; as well
as other members of Kimco's executive team that are also available to answer questions during the call.

As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it is
important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such
forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors. During this presentation, management
may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better
understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found
in the Investor Relations area of our website. Also in the event our call was to incur technical difficulties,
we'll try to resolve as quickly as possible and if the need arises, we'll post additional information to our IR
website.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll focus my remarks on our operating results. The supply
and demand dynamics surrounding those results, the strategic direction we are taking the organization
and the powerful position Kimco will have upon the closing of our merger with Weingarten. Ross will then
provide some perspective on the transaction market, and Glenn will provide additional financial insight on
the quarter along with our updated guidance.

As I have often mentioned, our core focus has been and will continue to be on leasing, leasing, leasing.
It fuels our growth, validates the quality of our portfolio, strengthens our balance sheet, reduces risk and
is a catalyst to overcome pandemic-induced disruption. Our second quarter leasing activity and overall
results continue to build upon the success that began earlier this year as we leased 1.8 million square
feet and signed 333 leases. This leasing included 139 new leases of GLA exceeding the prior sequential
quarter. Overall occupancy finished at 93.9%, up 40 basis points while our new leasing spreads of 9.2%
and renewal spreads of 4.7% resulted in a record 42 quarters or 10 years in a row of positive spreads.

The combination of record leasing demand in a 5-year low of new vacancies continue to drive the earlier-
than-anticipated occupancy recovery for Kimco. Traffic at our properties is back to 2019 levels and the
healthy leasing market reflects the reopening of the economy and the rush by tenants to capture market
share is apparent as they pursue our high-quality locations.

Moreover, in our attractive and strategically selected markets, we do not anticipate any material new
supply in the near term to impact our pricing power. Robust demand for anchor space continues across our
portfolio. Centers of the grocery component have outperformed during the pandemic and continue to lead
the rebound.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

We're also seeing data on restaurants that show people are eager to go out and eat again with the Sun
Belt states outperformance. Similar trends with fitness where traffic is coming back quickly. On the store
openings, off-price continues to be a leading source of demand but we're also seeing solid demand from
furniture, home goods, pet supply, hobby, health and wellness, including discount fitness, just to name a
few.

Our anchor occupancy finished the quarter at 96.9%, up 70 basis points which is the single largest
quarterly gain since we started reporting anchor occupancy 10 years ago.

Small shop demand also continues to recover, albeit at a slower pace. The small shop demand that's
now building is coming from franchise quick service restaurants, beauty, hair and nail salons, medical
and other services. While small shop occupancy did finish down 30 basis points to end at 85.5%, it
was impacted from the inclusion of Dania Phases II and III into occupancy. If not for this, small shop
occupancy would have actually increased sequentially by 30 basis points during the second quarter, and
we remain confident that the smaller tenants will gradually accelerate their demand for space as they gain
comfort that the recovery from last year's severe disruption is sustainable.

Further, the importance of being located as a last mile solution for a multitude of potential tenants
continues to grow.

Our mission-critical last mile brick-and-mortar locations will prove to be durable solutions for consumers,
retailers and many other businesses that want scale and reach to serve the end consumer. One silver
lining of the last 1.5 years is that it showcased the strength of our repositioned grocery-anchored portfolio,
the resiliency of our cash flows and the strength and diversity of our strong mix of high credit tenants.

As our occupancy recovers, we anticipate EBITDA and FFO growth will follow and bolster our balance sheet
metrics. We are also in a unique position to drive earnings results with multiple levers for growth, led by
our continued emphasis on leasing and attractive redevelopment opportunities.

On the strategic front, the completion of our accretive merger with Weingarten is fast approaching and
ahead of schedule. The shareholder votes are scheduled for August 3 and subject to customary closing
conditions, the closing should occur shortly thereafter.

With Weingarten's portfolio, combined with Kimco's, following the merger, we will have even more
confident in our ability to drive significant and sustained value from this concentrated platform of open air,
grocery-anchored and mixed-use assets in the leading MSAs across the country.

Touching further on the power of the merger, the combined company will continue to focus on operating a
dynamic and well-diversified portfolio in these markets, but with greater scale, resources and embedded
opportunities. We expect that the complementary business operations will allow us to extract annualized
cost efficiencies while deleveraging our balance sheet.

I think it is important to reiterate the scale and reach we will have with our targeted first ring suburbs
of core markets across the Sun Belt. Together, we'll have approximately 550 open-air grocery-anchored
shopping centers and mixed-use assets, comprising more than 100 million square feet of gross leasable
area.

At closing, approximately 82% of the company's total annual base rent will be derived from strategic Sun
Belt growth markets and high barrier-to-entry top coastal markets.

The combined platform will also have a highly diversified, strong credit tenant base with the top 10
tenants all essential, industry-leading grocers and best-in-class retailers with no single tenant representing
more than 4% of ABR.

And given that we are not completely out of the pandemic woods yet, with the reality and threat of new
strains, we believe the combined portfolio, strong balance sheet and battle-tested team puts us in an even
better position to withstand any disruptions to the ongoing recovery.

Looking beyond the closing, the Weingarten portfolio brings a largely funded and derisked development
pipeline and presents vast potential in the form of embedded untapped redevelopment from which we

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

believe we can extract incremental value. Ultimately, we believe this accretive combination will result in
enhanced financial strength with the flexibility and resources to efficiently capitalize on the value creation
opportunities ahead.

While we will be quantifying the impact until after the transaction is closed, we are highly energized by the
opportunities in front of us to maximize value for shareholders.

In closing, our team is motivated and executing. As we look forward, our ability to create value will be
enhanced in the coming years by our last mile fulfillment opportunities with high-growth, high-quality
open air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use properties that will enable us to realize
substantial operating benefits.

With that, I will turn the call over to Ross.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Good morning, and thank you, Conor. As the recovery from the pandemic continues to take shape, and
the essential nature of our open-air shopping center locations become more apparent, the capital flowing
to the space also continues to significantly increase. A well-capitalized private equity investor recently
told me there's only so much sub-4% cap rate industrial and multifamily products we can buy, the risk-
adjusted return for high-quality open-air retail products has become increasingly evident.

We have seen this sentiment play out in the transactions market this quarter and the momentum
continues to build. We have seen it on portfolios and one-off centers alike. Leasing velocity and renewal
rates have given investors confidence in both the stability and future upside of existing cash flows and rent
rolls.

With capital abundant on both the equity and debt side and with interest rates declining even lower
recently, a very accommodative environment for deal flow exists. This includes a recently closed grocery
portfolio in the Philadelphia MSA, a diversified portfolio of retail assets in Phoenix, one-off grocery deals in
South Florida, New Jersey and several in Southern California and Atlanta to give a few examples.

As we see brokers starting to report results, it is clear 2021 is on track to be one of the highest production
years for the industry. There is no question that appetite for open-air retail is voracious. We continue to be
opportunistic, yet selective and disciplined in the investments we make.

In the second quarter, as an addition to our structured investments program, we invested approximately
$55 million in a preferred equity position into The Rim, a dominant retail, entertainment and mixed-use
district having over 1 million square feet of GLA located in the fast-growing San Antonio market. The
property has consistently been the #1 most heavily traffic center in all of Texas with exceptional tenant
sales to support the property.

We are extremely excited for the upside of this investment, which was made at an attractive current yield
and reasonable basis along with the right-of-first refusal to buy the center in the future.

Another recent success is the sale of 2 Rite Aid California-based distribution centers closed in the second
quarter that were acquired by our taxable REIT subsidiary earlier this year in a sale-leaseback transaction.

When we completed the sale of these 2 properties at a price of $108 million, it represented a significant
increase from the $84 million paid just 5 months earlier and generated a 72% IRR for Kimco on this
investment. As we carefully consider capital allocation and disciplined investment opportunities, we believe
that selective acquisitions, structured investments and partnership buyouts will continue to present
themselves at the appropriate times.

Now to Glenn for the financial results for the quarter.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Thanks, Ross, and good morning. Our solid second quarter growth was fueled by continued improvement
in rent collections, lower credit loss and very strong same-site NOI. Our strong leasing efforts, combined
with an improving economy, produced a sequential uptick in occupancy and another quarter of positive
leasing spreads. In addition, as EBITDA has increased, our debt metrics have also improved.

Now for some details on second quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $148.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share
for the second quarter 2021, which includes merger-related charges of $3.2 million or $0.01 per diluted
share in connection with the anticipated merger with Weingarten. This compares to $103.5 million or
$0.24 per diluted share for the second quarter of the prior year.

The significant growth was mainly driven by increased pro-rata NOI of $44.7 million, comprised of lower
credit loss from potentially uncollectible accounts and straight-line rents of $50.9 million and higher lease
termination income of $2.7 million. These increases were offset by lower minimum rents and reduced CAM
and real estate tax recoveries due to lower occupancy compared to the same quarter last year.

The improvement in credit loss is attributable to our increased cash collections as we are approaching pre-
pandemic rent collection levels. During the second quarter, we collected over 96% of pro-rata base rent
bill. We also collected over 77% of rents due from cash basis tenants during the second quarter, up from
70% collected in the first quarter.

Further, collections of prior period amounts from cash basis tenants totaled $7 million during the second
quarter of 2021 versus $1.8 million collected during the same period in 2020. Our cash basis tenants
comprise 8.8% of total annualized base rents. In addition, we collected almost 90% of the deferred rents
billed during the second quarter. At the end of June, we have approximately $25.4 million of deferred
rents, which remain to be billed over the next 12 months and 64% of this amount is reserved.

As Conor mentioned, the operating portfolio delivered significant improvement in the second quarter with
a sequential increase in occupancy and positive leasing spreads.

Our same-site NOI growth, including redevelopments, was 16.7%, including a 30 basis point uplift from
redevelopments. This is the first positive quarter of same-site NOI growth since first quarter 2020 and
should be the start of a recurring trend. Another positive indicator is the increase in the spread of leased
versus economic occupancy, which now stands at approximately 300 basis points, up from 230 basis
points last quarter and represents $33.4 million of pro-rata ABR. This spread bodes well for future cash
flow growth.

Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.3x.
On a look-through basis, including pro-rata share of JV debt and pro rata and preferred stock outstanding,
the metric was 7.1x. These metrics are better than the pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2019.

From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the second quarter with over $230 million of cash and full
availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. We will be using cash on hand and a portion of the
revolver to fund the cash component of the Weingarten merger consideration and transaction costs.

In addition, our Albertsons marketable security investment was valued at close to $800 million at the end
of June, and there are no plans to monetize any portion of this investment during 2021.

During the second quarter, we repaid $120 million of mortgage debt, unencumbering an additional 23
assets. We have no consolidated debt maturing for the balance of the year and our next bond maturity
is not until November of 2022. Our weighted average consolidated debt maturity profile stands at 10.7
years, one of the longest in the REIT industry. As for JV debt, we have only $53 million maturing for the
remainder of the year with refinancing alternatives already identified.

With respect to outlook for the balance of the year, based on our first half 2021 operating results and
expectations that include ongoing improvement in credit loss and same-site NOI growth, we are again
raising our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.29 to $1.33 from the previous range of $1.22 to
$1.26. This new range is presented on a stand-alone basis and does not incorporate any impact of the
pending merger with Weingarten other than the $3.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share of merger-related

charges incurred during the second quarter of 2021. Assuming the merger is completed during the third
quarter as anticipated, we will provide updated guidance on a combined basis on our next earnings call.

Lastly, with respect to our common dividend, shortly after the merger is completed, the Board of Directors
expect to declare a regular quarterly cash dividend, which will be payable during the third quarter.
And now we'll be ready to take your questions.

Question and Answer

David F. Bujnicki
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategy

We've been advised to keep this call focused on Kimco's second quarter results and the outlook as
a stand-alone company. More information will be forthcoming once this transaction closes, which we
anticipate will be shortly after the completion of the respective meetings of stockholders, which is on
August 3.

In terms of the Q&A, we want to make this an efficient process. You may ask a question with an additional
follow-up. If you have additional questions, you're more than welcome to rejoin the queue.

Tom, you can take the first caller.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

Obviously, enjoying the improved results. But I just -- I want to know if the recent spike in COVID-19
cases and some of the breakthrough cases, are giving any of your tenants or retailers hesitancy regarding
longer-term leasing decisions?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, Craig. It's a great question, obviously, top of mind for all of us right now. The delta variant, as
we know, is running across the country. But we haven't seen any meaningful change in terms of our
outlook or views. Right now, obviously, all markets are open and a lot of lessons have been learned over
the last 16 months of how people have adapted to sort of a new normal and how you shop and access
those retailers and the retailers themselves. As you -- as evidenced by our occupancy gains this quarter,
continue to look for new opportunities to expand as they prepare for the new normal within '21, '22 and
'23.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And then a follow-up question is probably for Ross. Regarding the increased transaction market,
neighborhood community lifestyle or power centers, which are you seeing the biggest pickup in activity in
transaction and which you're seeing the lowest rise in transactions?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. I mean there's no doubt that grocery-anchored infill shopping centers are very much in demand right
now. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mean you think about the risk-adjusted return spread on
high-quality grocery-anchored centers in the high 4s or the low 5s, and you're still getting a good 100,
125 basis point spread compared to some of the other asset classes. So we're starting to see a lot of both
private and some of our public peers getting much more aggressive on that product type, and we think
that will just continue.

We are seeing more activity on power and lifestyle. There's not as much that we've seen transact as of
yet. But with the improvement in the economy, with the improvement in the retailer sales, we are seeing
much more conviction on some of those categories that you see in lifestyle centers such as restaurants,
entertainment, fitness, really coming back and solidifying themselves. So I think that there's just a lot of
demand for all product types right now within open-air retail.

The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.

Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just hoping you could spend a little time talking about the assumptions behind collections of past due
rents and/or reversals of bad debt for the balance of the year? And if you could just go over what was in
the second quarter? As the numbers you went through in your prepared remarks were pretty quick paced.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

So in terms of what we collected $7 million from our tenants -- our cash basis tenants from the prior
periods during the second quarter. In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, again, it's still going
to be a wait-and-see how it all goes. But collections, as I've mentioned, have improved. We collected close
to 96% of our base rents. We collected 77% of the cash basis tenants that were built during the quarter.

So it's -- we're going to have to wait and see, though, for the balance of the year. We do have in guidance,
there is credit loss that still's built into the numbers. The low end has -- still has about $20 million of credit
was built in. The high end of our range has about $5 million. So based on where things are today, we're
more comfortable when we look at our guidance towards the upper end of the range.

Is there a follow-up, Juan, or we could go to the next caller?

Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I apologize. I was on mute surprise, surprise. Just if you could give a little color on gaining and how
leasing is tracking there for the small shop space and where the demand is coming from? And how you're
feeling about your underwriting there?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, we actually feel very good about the direction that Dania is going with the new openings earlier this
year with Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. Later this summer, we have several other new openings
there on the horizon. You have American Eagle towards the end of the year, Regal, the other 2 Marriott
flag hotels. They will be opening this fall as well as including some of the additional restaurant spaces.

So there's tremendous change in growth that's coming from Dania as we start to get these other retailers
open and we have Sprouts that's scheduled to open towards November, December of this year as well.
Then followed by that, obviously, is the strong leasing demand as the economies have started to recover
and people really appreciated the location of this site, along I-95 and all the growth that's happening in
the Fort Lauderdale market. We're very encouraged by the direction of Dania long term.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

And the only point I'd add is Spirit Airlines is in for permit on their piece of the project, which is their
headquarters that I think should be a nice component of the live-work-play environment that we're
building there.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

And I'll add one on top of that to Conor's. And it's that the second residential tower is also in the permits
and ready to break ground shortly.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

The next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to come back to occupancy for a second. By all indications, and I think your prepared remarks
support this -- the leasing market feels pretty good. But I think a lot of the recovery depends upon how
long we're going to -- how long it takes to get occupancy back to normal.

I think your peak, prior to COVID, and correct me if I'm wrong, was just a little bit higher than 96%. And
so while the trends look really good, I'm wondering if you can just comment on the path to getting back
to pre-COVID levels? How long do you think that takes? And what does that mean for a recovery in total
NOI? Is that still a mid-'23 of it? Or do you think after this quarter, that's pulled forward to maybe late
'22?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

It's a great question. Well, the past is really dependent on demand. So I think you have to start there and
understand where the retailers are today and then what we anticipate going forward. I think for a few
reasons, we will continue to see this demand stay pace -- or maintain pace from what we've seen in the
last 2 quarters.

One, you still are -- the retailers are still working through. They are open to buy numbers that they're
trying to achieve in '20 and now in '21. So there's a bit of a bottleneck there that they're actively trying
to expand and upgrade the quality of their portfolio to A-quality sites with the new supply that's obviously
come online, not the new supply, but the vacancy as a result of the pandemic.

That's giving them the opportunity. Second to that, other retailers were able to raise additional capital or
rightsize our balance sheet through the pandemic. So when you look at grocers, such as fresh market that
may have not been necessarily on an expansion mode. Pre pandemic, they're now starting to look at new
stores and new locations to add grocery in new markets.

So you now have some new demand drivers on top of the pent-up demand from the existing retailers.
And then third, you have others that are really testing new formats. We've learned so much in the last 6
months of how consumers respond to retailers, how they want to shop. And so you do have retailers like
container store that had been fairly set in their way about their historic format.

But now looking at smaller formats and penetrating other markets as well. So you'll continue to see that
as a demand factor. And then new concepts, new concepts like Choice markets, which is trying to reinvent
the C-store and adapt to more millennial trends. DoorDash has come out with DashMart. And so you're
starting to add some new categories on top of what we've historically seen.

So I think as long as you maintain those demand drivers, we'll be able to make good progress in
recovering our occupancy and get back to what was our peak.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Rich, the only thing I would add is just the Kimco differentiator, I think, is our team, obviously, first and
foremost, but then we've optimized the entire portfolio with the curbside pickup program. And I think
retailers are really resonating with that program. They've come to us and said it's best-in-class. They want
to do more sites with us. And I think when you combine that with our team, it leads us to believe that the
occupancy is going to continue to trend in the right direction.

Now we might see a pause next quarter because of some of the eviction moratoriums that are burning
off. But we think there's enough demand, obviously, there to backfill that. And it's led by the anchors, and
then we think that's going to follow with the small shops. The anchored demand is diverse, which is great
to see. And then the small shop should fall along after that.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Conor, just to push a little bit more on this. What I'm trying to get at is, is the trough just higher
than what we anticipated, but the endpoint is the same. And if I look -- if I'm looking at sort of your
prepared remarks and your press release where you talk about maybe stronger portfolio occupancy gains
than what you were previously anticipating. That leads me to believe that the trough is higher, but the
recovery is also a little bit steeper.

So if I can push just here a little bit, I'm sorry for putting words in your mouth, but I think you've said
mid-'23 for recovery in the past. Does that -- do you feel better about that recovery endpoint post 2Q? Or
is 2Q just a sugar high, that leads to a higher trough?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

It's really, obviously, Rich, it's hard to predict the future, especially with the Delta variant out there. But
what we've seen so far is the demand is not subsiding. I think that time line still holds true. And I think
we've got to obviously execute and let the numbers speak for themselves.

And right now with this quarter, it's not a sugar high quarter. We see the backup of pent-up demand
occurring through the leasing pipeline that we've built up and believe that we can continue the
momentum. But clearly, there's a lot of various factors out there that we can't anticipate the future with.
But right now, where we sit, we like what we see.

Rent spreads on new leases accelerated further during the period, how much pricing power do you have
right now? And can that continue to accelerate from here?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. So leasing spreads are always is quarter dependent about the population that's within that on any
given quarter, but the supply-demand balance right now, where retailers are really looking to upgrade the
quality of their portfolio. Our efforts to rightsize our portfolio to make sure that we really own A-quality
assets enables us to maintain that supply-demand balance. And so we're able to push rents on the below-
market leases that we have.

And when you look at the lease expiration schedule, that's on the horizon in the next couple of years,
there's still -- those leases and those rents are below what our corporate average is right now. So we still
see that there's opportunity to push those rents further as those leases roll.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

The demand for last mile retail has just come roaring back. And when you look at some of the tidbits that
we're hearing from tenants that are typically, I would say, penny pinching that are saying that they'll pay
up for the locations that fit their needs. Clearly, the supply and demand dynamic is shifted in our favor.
And with no new supply on the horizon, we do feel like we're going to have pricing power continue in our
favor.

That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, when retailers are looking to expand, what are they looking for
specifically in their new locations? Are they focused on certain geographies? Are they focused more on
first-ring suburbs or maybe more suburban areas? Like how are -- how does the expansion look and where
are you seeing that demand?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. It's retailer dependent based on their corporate strategy. So it's what are the voids that they see in
their program and how are they trying to fill it? For example, you could have a grocery store that's either
modified their format. Sprouts Did that a couple of years ago between 30,000 square feet now down to
around that 22,000 to 24,000 square foot range. So they're looking at new box opportunities that are
more prototypical to what historically they had targeted.

While others are looking to potentially expand the box to incorporate more last mile distribution as
Conor mentioned earlier, or some other form of fulfillment, the first ring suburb, that's really where we're
focused. And obviously, there's been a huge value add and being closest to the customer and where they
live.

And now with what the world will look like with the hybrid back-to-work model, there's definitely much
more of a balance between urban and first-ring suburban markets. And so we'll continue to see that, that
demand pick up on the first ring suburbs. So it's a really hard answer to give that specific in 1 general --
in one specific way because every retailer is looking at it a little bit differently based on historically what
they've done and where they see these voids and how they want to achieve them.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, the retailers today have more data on their customers than they've ever had before. And so really
where they're focused is how do they best serve that customer. And now with the data that they have,
how important that last mile store is to not only the 4-wall but the actual halo effect of buy online, pick up
in store, curbside pickup, the ease of returns. A lot of the feedback that we're hearing from our retailers is
the spaces that we may have passed on before we want to look at again.

And I think that's sort of the tidbits that we're taking away from this is there's a lot of pent-up demand.
There's a lot of voids that need to be filled, and last mile retail has become more valuable due to the
pandemic.

The next question comes from Katy McConnell with Citi.

Mary Kathleen McConnell
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So wondering if you can provide a little more background on the writing transactions and the market
dynamics that led to the quick monetization of that investment?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. I mean when we started the conversation with Rite Aid back in May of 2020, obviously, it
was a bit of a different environment. We stated publicly around that time that we were looking to be
opportunistic. We felt that the balance sheet and our liquidity position enabled us to do that. So we
were fortunate enough to have those conversations directly with one of our retailers. We felt very good
about the leases that we were able to negotiate with them in terms of the rent versus market, having
annual increases that we felt were very attractive and obviously, seeing the demand for single-tenant
products, particularly in the industrial space, we knew that there was a lot of value that was created on
that acquisition. So we wanted to maintain as much flexibility as possible, which was why we bought it
into the TRS and the market spoke.

And clearly, there was some good upside rather quickly that we wanted to capitalize, and we were able to
do that with the monetization of it. So it was a bit of a unique transaction, but we were excited about it, of
course, and we'll continue to look for those diamonds in the rough, where they come.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. Katy, you know, but others may not, but this really falls into our "PLUS" business, which we believe is
a real differentiator for Kimco. We focus on retailers that are real estate rich and have the ability to come
in and hopefully unlock a lot of value for our shareholders through a differentiated strategy.

So it's 1 that is unique to Kimco. We're very proud of it. Obviously, we own a lot of Albertsons shares
because of the strategy, and this is just another data point of why we think it's a nice differentiator for
Kimco to unlock value from retailers that are real estate rich.

Mary Kathleen McConnell
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then bigger picture, can you provide some more commentary around what you're seeing
from an institutional capital perspective and the appetite to put capital to work in strips today? And maybe
touch on your appetite to monetize assets if approached by your capital partners for more JV deals today?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, I missed the beginning of the question. I'm sorry. Can you mind just repeating that?

Mary Kathleen McConnell
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. Just looking for some more commentary around what you're seeing from institutional capital on the
demand to put capital to work in strips today.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. I mean it's voracious, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, I mean there is a significant
amount of capital that was raised during this pandemic. Everybody was looking for distress. It really did
not materialize. And now what you're seeing is that a lot of that capital is really focused on core. So we're
in a pretty unique position that there's a lot of investors that want to invest in retail, but maybe lack the
operational expertise.

So we are fielding a lot of questions, a lot of comments, a lot of inquiries from institutional capital that
want to invest in retail, want to take advantage, see that there is clearly a need and the utility of our
open-air space, but how do they actually go about investing in that. So we're having a lot of those
conversations. There's plenty of capital that's looking for it and now it's just being very selective as to
where we put our capital and who we invest alongside.

That being said, there are other investors that have substantial legacy retail investments, many of
which are not necessarily in open-air retail that are looking to maybe reduce that exposure and that also
becomes an opportunity for us. If they're looking for what component of their retail investments are liquid
in this market, it's clearly the open-air neighborhood grocery shopping centers that are attractive -- are
attracting a lot of capital that they know that they can monetize and we're there to discuss that with them
as well.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

So just noticed that renewal lease volumes were down from last quarter, but I assume that bucket is
primarily driven by expiring leases and somewhat out of your control. Now that said, have you noticed any
changes or trends with regard to tenant retention?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. So in Q1, you tend to have a higher renewal rate because that's when more leases roll over. So you're
spot on there. It's really related to the population on a given quarter about when their leases roll. But as
it relates to retention trends, they've been very strong. People that have sort -- retailers that have made
it through the pandemic at this point feel good about the position they're in. For us, as Conor mentioned
earlier, with curbside, we've done an extraordinary amount in working with our tenants and trying to
provide a true Kimco advantage to be a retail partner within a Kimco Center.

And I think what retailers have come to learn is that your landlord matters. If you're well capitalized,
you have vision, you're willing to test experiment and be a true partner and good steward of not only the
retailer but of the community itself. It makes a big, big difference. For a lot of these small shops this is
their livelihood, and they're investing a tremendous amount of spot equity in their own mining into the
business. And so they want to make sure that whoever they're aligned with is also in partnership with
them. I think that's been a big high opening experience for a lot of those retailers. So that's definitely
helped us with retention levels.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

So that maintains retention then? Or is it increased like versus pre-pandemic?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Well, I think our renewals have always been quite strong. And so I think it's sustaining and improving.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Greg, I think most retailers today are looking at their spaces and recognizing that the leases might be
below market and it might be very difficult to replace that location. So retention rates are high. We feel
like we're confident in the portfolio and knowing that the supply and demand dynamic, we don't see that
changing.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then Juan partially covered this question earlier. But Glenn, just curious how you're thinking
about switching tenants back to accrual-based accounting. Are you kind of waiting to see what happens
with the potential rising COVID cases right now? Or could we start to see some of those reversals?

Kathleen Thayer
Vice President of Corporate Accounting

Greg, it's Kathleen. I shall take this one for you.

So you're right. There's always a thought of what's to come with the pandemic. And as you probably
know, cash basis is the kind of category where tenants can pop in and out of it from a GAAP perspective.
So there's criteria that you need to set.

So generally, we look to see that the tenant remains current on their base rent for 6 to 9 months. And so
we'll continue to monitor that trend. I do anticipate that in the second half of the year, there will be some
of our tenants that make up that 8.8% of ABR that Glenn mentioned, will be coming out of cash basis.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

But just something to keep in mind when thinking about that and just because the tenant comes at a cash
basis, obviously, as I said, they need to be current on their rent. So the impact that you're going to see
on credit loss is very minimal, right, because they're actually paying where you may see some sort of FFO
impact is really on the straight line side, which although I wish that was cash, it's not, but there could be
an FFO impact from that.

The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

In the beginning in the prepared remarks, I think you touched briefly on the redevelopment opportunity
that Kimco has. So I was wondering if you could give more detail on kind of the depth of that opportunity.
And I know you're working on a number of large mixed-use projects, but even just the smaller ones, how
much of that activity do you expect you could complete each year and what types of projects are most
appealing?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure. Caitlin, so on the redevelopment side, we continue to see a lot of opportunity. We continue to look
for what's the highest and best use of our real estate. And what we have seen is we've been averaging
around 700 to 1,000 multifamily units a year of entitlements. And so we continue to think that's a great
use of our sweat equity to create opportunity for future value creation on the asset and then activate that
at our -- when it's the best time to do so.

On the smaller redevelopment side, clearly, those are ones we get the best bang for our buck, where
we're, on average, returning over 10% on invested capital.

So we continue to monitor and mine the portfolio for those. Typically, it's adding a pad out in front with
a drive-through or expanding a shopping center in some way, shape or form. And those continue to be
right around, I would say, between $80 million to $100 million a year of capital investment. Now we'd love
to do more of that. Clearly, it's some great returns on capital and we'll continue to try and look for those
opportunities going forward.

And then on the larger scale redevelopment projects, we continue to look through our portfolio and say,
what's the best way to activate these on these projects, and we want to be mindful of the fact that we
have a lot of opportunity, but there's different ways to structure those opportunities. And so you've seen
us do it in the past, where we've sold entitlements, typically office entitlements. We've ground lease
entitlements.

Those sometimes are multifamily projects or were joint ventured and done projects that add a nice live-
work-play experience to the shopping center. So we'll continue to do that. As you know, we've done a lot
of work on entitlements already. We're up to 5,000 apartment units in title and continue to think that's a
great use of our time and effort going forward.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just to clarify, you mentioned on the smaller ones, was that $80 million to $100 million per year?

Conor C. Flynn

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Okay. And then maybe a question just on leasing volume. You guys pointed out that for the second
quarter, historically, 2Q '21 was up 11% higher than that historical level. So I was just wondering if you
expect the above historical average leasing activity could continue through like mid-'23 as occupancy
comes back? Or do you think the current strength is more of that like a quick bounce back and then it
could slow to more historical levels?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean, obviously, when you hit a peak, it's a peak, right? I mean we've never achieved that level.
So we're very proud of that effort in Q2 to meet or exceed that on any given quarter. It will obviously be
a big effort. And so we'd anticipated probably being a little bit less. But with the demand side, as we've
mentioned earlier in some of other remarks, it's very, very strong. So we still anticipate good growth over
the next 1.5 years to 2 years with the retailer demand in place.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes, Caitlin, I think the way we continue to think about it is you'll see anchors lead the way until it hits
that sort of historical high occupancy levels. And then once that hits that, you'll see the small shops
actually start to pick up the slack. And so that's the way we think about it. Typically, the small shops
around an anchor lease up once the anchor has been leased. And so that's what we continue to think will
play out.

Operator

The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So 2 questions. First, on the cap rate side. You guys did the prep deal in San Antonio. And just curious,
when you -- as you guys see the acquisition market, are you seeing sellers may be reluctant to sell
because either they want to stabilize their NOI or they view the cap rates or sell in which case we should
expect to see more sort of partial investments like prep deals or JV stakes with the option to buy out
eventually? Or do you see that sellers are willing to just outright transact even though there's a view that
fundamentals are getting better and that cap rates are going to continue to compress?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

I think it's -- every circumstance is a little bit different. So as evidenced by the amount of transactions
that have occurred, there are plenty of owners that are willing and have been executing on dispositions.
They see that the market continues to work in their favor. The financeability of these assets has never
been greater with interest rates where they are. So it is a very good time if you're a seller, to take
advantage of all-time low interest rates and thus, cap rates.

At the same time, there is an opportunity for owners that have the capital and the financial wherewithal
to reinvest in assets to try to stabilize cash flows if they were be down a little bit during the COVID,
depending on what type of tenancy they had. So you're seeing certain decisions potentially being delayed
for a period of time. And you always have to compete with the opportunity for an owner to refinance their
assets because, as I mentioned, the financeability of those assets is very much available.

So every circumstance is unique, but we're finding plenty of opportunities. We do think that we'll continue
to see structured investments with the preferred equity and the mezz financing present themselves. We'll
continue to be very disciplined and only look to invest in those assets where we feel very good about
the basis, our current return. And then, of course, it has to check the box as to an asset that we would
potentially look to own in the future, and that's where we secure a right-of-first refusal or right-of-first
offer. So we've intentionally not put out any sort of mandate on the amount that we're going to invest in

that program. But to the extent that those opportunities present themselves, we're ready and excited to
do that.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then the next one is -- sorry, go.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

You go ahead, Alex.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Sorry. Next question is for Glenn. Just sorry for all the confusion, I didn't go to CTA school. So I
apologize on accounts receivable and reserved rents. But big picture, you're collecting north of 96% of the
rents. And yet you have 51% of your AR reserved.

So big picture, what it sounds like is that basically almost all your tenants are healthy operating. It's just a
matter of when you can get paid up for past bills and then that comes down to I guess, either a payment
plan or if you guys are going to say, look, for a tenant who just doesn't have the wherewithal to pay the
back stuff, just wash that clean and pay the rent going forward. So just trying to reconcile sort of north of
96% collected but you have 50% reserved.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, it's a good question, Alex. To help you a little bit of it 36% of the AR is -- or the cash basis tenants
that haven't paid yet. So a big portion of the reserve is really related to the cash basis tenants. The other
portion of the reserve just comes down to timing and our own policies around CAM and tax bills and
disputes. So those are really the 2 big pieces that make up what the reserve is.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So the 36% of AR that is -- that is part of that little 4% of rents that haven't been collected?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Well, the -- again, when you look at total AR, it's a culmination month after month of what hasn't been
collected. Some of it -- it's fully reserved. Remember, all cash basis tenants that haven't paid, they're
100% reserved. So it's a buildup of total.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Right. But basically, some of those tenants are still in the portfolio. They may be paying you now. So I
mean, when you say 96% collected in the second quarter, that includes -- that's what I'm just trying to
understand.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, that includes the cash basis tenants that paid. So as we mentioned, 8.8% of the tenants or the ABR
that we have is on a cash basis. Of that amount, 77% of those tenants paid during the quarter. It was
about -- I think the number -- I think it was about $9 million that wasn't paid by those cash basis tenants
during the quarter, and they are fully reserved in the number.

Alexander David Goldfarb

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. So that's the 36% in other words.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

In total, when you look at the total AR number, 36% is related to cash basis tenants. So we're still
accruing them. They're just fully reserved.

Kathleen Thayer
Vice President of Corporate Accounting

But that 36% is a cumulative number. So during -- when COVID was really high back in Q2 and Q3 of
2020, that AR wasn't at the 96%, still in the high -- in the high 80s. So that balance is still sitting in that
AR so you're putting a reserve on that old balance as well. And then to your point, that's between the 96%
continues to get a reserve on it.

The next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird.

Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I just had a question on when do you think paying occupancy will bottom? And how much of an impact will
the eviction moratoriums have on occupancy? And then one last one there would be, you still have a lot of
abatements, about $5 million. When will those start to burn off?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes, sorry, I just missed the very first part of that. It was a word and then occupancy.

Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I'm looking for -- yes, paying occupancy. When do you think that will bottom? I understand that you have
some people that may still be in the occupancy number, but there could be an eviction moratorium? Just
trying to quantify the impact of that in actual?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes, sure. At this point, the impact of that should be fairly small, it's not immaterial. There are obviously
moratoriums on the West Coast that are still in place that I believe California lifts towards the end of
September. So we would anticipate that there is some modest impact to that, but nothing that would
believe too meaningful on a go-forward basis. And then what was your second question? Second part of
your question?

Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. The second one was regarding the abatements. You still have some abatements running through the
numbers, just seeing when those will end?

CEO & Director

Yes, just to give you a little bit further color the abatements that were booked during the quarter were
$5 million, but only about $2 million of that related to second quarter rent. So to Dave's point, it's really
starting to whittle down, and we expect it to be lower as we go through the balance of the year.

Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then I guess one more big picture question. Do you have a sense of what percent of the
new leasing is being driven by demand that emerged during the pandemic, such as the last mile, the first-
ring suburb. And is it more concentrated in shops or anchors at the moment?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Well, our demand, obviously, the increase in the occupancy of the anchors, you could see it more on the
demand side with the anchors, which was anticipated. They usually have a quicker recovery rate then will
be trailed by the small shops. It's really hard to narrow it down to whether or not it was as a result of one
specific category of last mile distribution and pandemic demand versus just general growth and revision
or adjustments to their retail strategy, but it's really a culmination of all these things referencing back to
a few of the points I made earlier between identifying lessons learned to historic growth opportunities to
expansion to new markets to sort of all culminates into higher demand.

Operator

The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So I appreciate the comments earlier about your desire to pursue more preferred investments as they
present themselves. But I haven't heard any mention of the returns there. So maybe can you share more
on the return on the investment in that -- the room asset, the $55 million is there? What are the returns
you're targeting there? And how do they compare versus comparable asset quality acquisition yields?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. each deal, obviously, is an individual negotiation. But I would say from a more macro level, the
difference between preferred and mezzanine. In the preferred investments, we typically look for a high
single-digit current return on our investment, but we do participate in the back-end profit assuming that
the asset performs the way that we've underwritten, there's usually back-end participation that can juice
that return somewhere into the teens from an IRR perspective.

On the mezzanine financing, oftentimes, those are higher coupons, but don't necessarily have the back-
end participation. So we're getting double digits current or sometimes even into the teens. But it very
much depends on each asset. As it relates to the RIM, that one is a preferred equity investment.

So like I said, we got very high single digits current. But when we look at the opportunity on that asset
and some of the things that we think can occur in terms of occupancy increases and maybe some
repositioning and just the general strength of that asset in the market, we think that we will certainly see
some participation on the profit on the back end. So typically looking for, at a minimum, teens IRRs.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. Great. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And just going back to Albertsons for a second. I'm curious,
I understand there's no need to tap into the stock here given the lack of near-term debt maturities, the
liquidity you talked about before. But I guess, I'm curious under what scenario or scenarios that thinking
could change? Are you waiting more for opportunistic deals perhaps -- or is it waiting maybe another year

or 2 and as you start to approach some of those debt maturities? Just curious, as you have this liquidity,
how the available options that you're considering could perhaps drive a change in thinking there?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

It's a great question, Haendel. I mean the good part, as you point out, is there is very little in terms of
debt maturities in the near term. So there's no emergency or real need necessarily today to monetize it.
Two, we still have to manage our REIT taxable income position. The good news is the -- and I think we've
talked about this previously, the built-in gain actually burns off next month. So the federal income tax
piece of it is -- will no longer be an issue. But we still have to manage our REIT taxable income.

In addition, there still are certain lockups related to our investment with our partners. So in order to
monetize it today, we would need -- it would be subject to a marketed sale in agreement with the rest of
our partners. Come June of '22, there are no further restrictions on the investment. And then we'll also
-- and when we look into 2022, we know we have 2 preferreds that are callable. We have bond that will
come due. So there's lots of opportunities to use that capital to further deleverage the balance sheet.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste

The next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Quick, I guess, a follow-up question in terms of cap rates. I understand this big institutional portfolio from
Bentall Kennedy. I think it's just trading or about to trade $800 million price tag, sub-5.5% cap rates from
market sources. As you look at -- obviously on Weingarten, you're hanging at higher cap rates.

Do you think there's -- the disconnect between private and public real estate. Can you maybe give
some comments on that? Also, what kind of implied cap rates are you valuing the RIM transaction at?
And maybe you mentioned something else about JVs, obviously, you know your JV assets better than
others. As you look forward, is there an opportunity to buy out JV stakes in your portfolio and for that
matter, in the Weingarten portfolio, which has, I think, something like 39 -- or 31 or somewhere in
that neighborhood of JV assets? And if you can comment on that? And do you have provisions in there,
whether you have the right-of-first offer in your JVs typically?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure. Happy to address some of that. And I'm going to kind of keep it at a high level rather than
commenting directly on the Weingarten specific questions. But there's no doubt that we think that there's
still a disconnect between public and private pricing. When we look at NAVs of ourselves and some other
peers versus, like you said, some of the transactions that are happening in the low 5s, and we're also
starting to see them dipping into the high 4s. There is still very much a spread between those 2. But the
Bentall and GreenOak portfolio, very high-quality, grocery-anchored product and it was not surprising
to see a very strong demand and many bidders and multiple rounds of bidding before that deal was
ultimately awarded. And I think we're going to continue to see more of that.

In terms of partnership buyouts, I mean that is something that we have taken advantage of in the past.
Oftentimes, it's difficult to model or forecast or predict. When those opportunities present themselves, all
of our partners have different investment horizons and reasons for why they may look to exit, but we do
stay ready. We stay in very close communication with our partners, and we have a pretty good sense as to
when they may look to exit or what might trigger that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we
do think that there's going to be some of that in the relatively near future.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

And as it relates to our ability to have sort of a right-of-first offer, right-of-first refusal, there's no doubt
that for these assets that we're managing and that we're operating day in and day out. We are the logical
buyer. We can move quicker than any other third party can given the fact that we know the assets inside
and out.

So typically, it's a win-win. If it's an asset that we view as a long-term hold and for 1 reason or another,
our partner is looking to exit, it's a great chance for us to buy out the remainder and for our partners to
have a very smooth and quick execution. So again, we'll see more of that as time goes on over the next
year or so.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Maybe do you see anything imminent happening in any of these potentially in your JVs over the next 12
months?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

I think that's very possible.

Operator

The next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just a quick one on guidance. So it looks like ex the Weingarten charge, the midpoint of the guidance went
up around $0.08. I'm assuming about $0.02 of that is tied to the prior period collections. But can you walk
through the major components of that increase?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Sure, Mike. The bulk of it really is coming from just the improvement in credit loss. That's really -- that is
really the driver. So we had credit loss built in, in our guidance all along. Credit loss in total, including the
impact on straight-line rents for the quarter, it was about $800,000 versus what we had been budgeting.
So the bulk of it really is coming from credit loss improvement. That's the driver.

Operator

The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just 2 follow-up questions. Glenn, just going back to the guidance. As it relates to the bad debt number
you have provided earlier of a range of $5 million to $20 million for the back half of the year. Are there
any offsets to that, meaning like prior period rent or deferral payments that are included in that sort of --
that offset that number? Or is that a gross number?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

So it's all built into that, Chris. We've been, as we mentioned, we collected $7 million of rents from prior
periods, but also during the current quarter, there are cash basis tenants that didn't pay. So that, as I
mentioned, we collected 77% from the cash basis tenants. That other 23% was not collected. So we'll
have to see how that goes during the third and fourth quarters. But the expectation in guidance is that at
the high end of our range, we would incur a total of about $5 million of credit loss and towards the lower
end of the range, it could be as much as $20 million. But again, based on where things are headed today,
we feel more comfortable towards the upper end of the range.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just on the move from cash to accrual, the straight-line impact that was mentioned earlier
as a possible tailwind. Is that -- do you have an assumption built in on that as it relates to your guidance
as well?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

That no, we really haven't because we haven't -- today, we really don't know exactly who we're going to
move them? When we're going to move them? So we have not built that in. So should we start moving
some in, in the straight line, there would be some uplift from straight-line rent.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then last question for me. Conor, you've talked about the tenant demand. And I guess I'm just
trying to think through the whole process of how much insight you have, how much sort of visibility you
have in terms of demand, given that I'm assuming that retailers are making their open to buys this year
for store openings in '23, '24 and given what you're hearing from them, what's your confidence level that
this demand remains as strong as it has been so far, first half of '21?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, that's right, Chris. We have -- since we've been virtual for most of this pandemic, we've been able
to do more virtual portfolio reviews and talk with more tenants on the regular on expansion plans and
looking for space throughout the portfolio. One thing -- you're right about the cadence there, but one
thing we found is that many of our retailers that are well capitalized, have actually come to us and say,
"Hey, we actually need a few more deals for this year or we need -- so there's actually a bit of that going
on as well. So it's broad-based, which I like to see. Clearly, grocery continues to expand and is quite hot.

But then you've got the other categories that we like to see that complement the cross-shopping, which
typically is led by off-price and then you've got the home improvement, home bid section continues to
be very, very strong. And it goes on from there. The interesting part, I think, is the pent-up demand
for probably the most impacted categories that we're seeing. So the entertainment, the fitness and the
restaurant side of it have really come back strong, faster than we anticipated. And we think that, that
bodes well for the recovery of those sectors.

And obviously, we're not out of the woods yet, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we want to
be careful about how we talk about the future because we still got the Delta variant that's causing a lot of
issues, but we have a playbook now. We have the Kimco branded curbside pickup program that's on the
entire portfolio. And we have a battle-tested team that I think can really manage through this. And the
customer is more aware of how to go about utilizing last mile retail in more ways than one. So I think our
portfolio is well positioned to weather the -- whatever storm comes our way.

Operator

The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.

Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Based on your earlier comments, it seems like there's a pull forward of demand for core assets given the
validation of necessity-based in grocery-anchored retail and then still low interest rates. How does that
impact your view on potentially increasing disposition activity in this favorable environment?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. It doesn't really move the needle for us in that regard. We look at the portfolio every day, every
week. We look at where there's risk, where there's opportunity, where there's concern where democrats
may be shifting, and that's really what motivates our decisions. The good news is that we've done a
tremendous amount of heavy lifts over the last 5 to 7 years to put the portfolio in a position that it's in.

And when you look at the numbers that we were able to put up this quarter, I think it speaks to the fact
that the portfolio is in very good shape. It's performing well. And we'll continue to prune here and there
where we see specific assets that don't necessarily make sense from a long-term hold scenario. But when
we think of it from a macro level, it doesn't move our decision-making and feeling very confident in the
portfolio that we own today.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

And Linda, I would just add that it's been -- we're in a very fortunate position, right? We've gone through
a massive transformation of the portfolio. We've derisked the portfolio. We've really -- now we're at, I
think, a sweet spot where we can look and see across the portfolio that -- what sites are flattish in terms
of growth and use those for recycling capital. And they're not necessarily low quality because some of
those might be single-tenant type ground leases or some of those might be assets that we've squeezed all
the juice out of, but we're in a very fortunate position to be where we are as our disposition strategy can
be used for incremental growth.

Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then when you think about last mile distribution, it seems like most retailers start with making
changes within the 4 walls of their existing boxes to accommodate on-site fulfillment. That said, are
you seeing more instances of retailers making physical changes to existing boxes vis-a-vis physical
expansions?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. It's either expansion or modification of utilizing the square footage within the 4 walls. Some examples
are those that create a pickup point, obviously, in front of the store. We've all seen it, if you go to a
restaurant, shop or otherwise, they just -- it's a couple of shelves to do the curbside pickup or just to walk
in and pick up. But on the back of house with some of the -- the bigger formats, they've repurposed some
of their back of house for distribution and fulfillment, while others are still doing big pick and pack within
the stores. So again, each retailer is trying to do what's best for them based on how they logistically are
set up.

And I think we'll just continue to see that this trend evolves, layer on technology and the efficiencies there
to manage stocking and inventory levels, it's going to be I think, a hyperefficient system as we progress
through the coming years.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

We've started to see some tenants, and this is early, but started to see them lease adjacent space for
almost like sortation centers. So that's an incremental new demand factor, and we're watching that closely
to see if that's going to have an impact. And hopefully, it's a new demand source for us.
