With that, I'll now turn the call over to Valentin.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our results and strategic initiatives, I want to address how IPG
is navigating the effects of the novel coronavirus outbreak. The well-being of our people, our customers
and our partners is our highest priority. IPG employees who can work from home and are doing so. In
all regions, we continue to manufacture and service our solutions. Although there are some restrictions
to U.S. production, the impact to date has not been material, given our products are used across a wide
variety of critical infrastructure sectors. In Germany we didn't stop work practically at all. In Russia, it
was only 1 week vacation during these 2 months. In order to safeguard our people, we have employed
additional distancing and cleaning measures in our facilities, sourced 100,000 masks for use in our
production. We introduced very effective UV means for total disinfection of air in all production and office
rooms, and temporarily increased wages for our hourly employees who continue to work on site.

As a result, up to date, we are proud to report that IPG did not have any COVID-19 infected cases on
all our world locations, in spite of more than 80% of our staff [ traveled ] to work on-site practically all
these 2 months. IPG was trying to help also to create to local communities, communities elsewhere --
everywhere.

In China, we have donated approximately RMB 1 million to help those affected by this worldwide epidemic.
And in the U.S., we have donated many tens of thousand masks to local hospitals in need. In Russia,
we donated a modern CT imaging system to local hospital as well as mask and other needs. Eugene will
discuss the impact on COVID-19 in our operation in greater details. I want to assure you that at IPG, we
are doing all we can to help safeguard our people and communities.

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

During this time of uncertainty, which is unlike any that we have faced before, it is unclear what will
happen to global demand over the coming weeks and months. This uncertainty makes forecasting our
business very challenging in the near- to medium-term. Nonetheless, our strong balance sheet, ample
cash reserves and minimal debt provides us flexibility in responding to coronavirus-related disruptions,
and to emerge from the crisis with the ability to seize the many opportunities we expect to see. We plan
to continue investment in strategic research and capital project that will drive the next leg of market share
capture for our fiber laser technology. Because our fiber lasers are a key enabler of automated precision
manufacturing, we expect to disproportionately benefit from an eventual recovery in the industrial cycle.

Turning to results, we delivered first quarter revenue at the high end of our guidance range on better-
than-expected performance in China and strength in new products. Despite the weaker demand
environment, we have seen strong customer interest in a number of our leading-edge laser solutions.
In cutting and welding applications, our ultra high-power lasers of at 12, 15 or 20 kilowatts have
demonstrated superior attributes to competing products, including faster cutting and welding speeds,
better beam parameters, higher wall plug efficiency and significantly better reliability. IPG lasers continue
to deliver peace of mind and to lower lifetime costs by enhancing end-user productivity. We received our
first volume order for our Adjustable Mode Beam lasers for electric vehicle battery welding. As a reminder,
our AMB lasers permit the broadest range of beam tunability, enabling spatterless welding. In addition,
we more than doubled sales of high-power nanosecond pulsed lasers at 300 and 500 watts, used for
foil cutting in electric vehicle battery processing applications. IPG remains the only reliable laser source
supplier of these products, and we continue to expect strong growth for -- in this application during the
year.

Product innovation remains core IPG for -- to IPG's success. During the first quarter emerging product
and application sales were 23% of total revenue, increasing more than 20% year-over-year despite a
softer demand environment for IPG laser systems due to COVID-19. Sales of the green pulsed lasers,
used to improve solar cell efficiency, increased by more than 50% year-over-year. Sales of ultrafast pulsed
lasers increased modestly, as customer acceptance and traction was curtailed by the uncertain demand
environment. However, we continue to target more than 50 new projects for these lasers across a wide
range of applications processing glass, ceramic, circuit boards, OLED films, batteries and solar cells.
Sales of medical lasers were a record $10 million in Q1, increasing more than 500% year-over-year. We
continue to ramp sales of our Thulium Laser solution for urology and other soft tissue applications from
the partnerships we seeded several years ago, and an FDA approval late last year.

Our medical laser business includes sales of consumable fibers, a recurring revenue stream that will grow
as the number of installed system increases. Advanced application revenue more than doubled year-
over-year, with strong growth in government, semiconductor and scientific applications. We will continue
to invest in transformative new products, including new medical treatments, mid-infrared lasers for
spectroscopy, inspection and sensing applications, ultra high-power single mode laser for aerospace and
defense. These new solutions will enhance our growth and margin profile, and provide greater geographic
and end market diversification.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the IPG team for their outstanding performance during this most
challenging time. I believe their execution, combined with our laser technology leadership and robust
balance sheet, will enable IPG to capitalize on the long-term secular growth in laser technology, and to
deliver on our mission to make our fiber laser technology the tool of choice in mass production.

With that, I will turn the call over to Eugene.

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Thank you, Valentin, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by discussing the effects of COVID-19
on our production. Currently, all 3 of our major production facilities in Germany, the U.S. and Russia
remain open. However, we have scaled back production in Massachusetts to those product required to
support essential businesses. These includes lasers and laser systems used in the transportation, medical,
agriculture, communications and defense end markets among them. Our German operations are operating
on a more normalized basis, albeit with social distancing measures in place. In Russia, our employees are

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

working on a rotating basis to limit contact. Our highest priority remains the safety of our employees, their
families, our business partners and community. And as Valentin noted, we have put in place additional
health safety and workplace measures to safeguard the health and well-being of our valued employees
and colleagues.

Our vertical integration production model continues to provide us with critical advantages in this time of
supply chain disruption. Also, we saw certain raw materials from third party. We internally produce more
complex components and modules used in our technology. Our leading-edge components and modules are
the critical technical, performance and cost differentiator between IPG and our competition. We continue
to leverage this advantage demand from more than 20 years of investment in technology, people and
processes. Many of our third-party suppliers remain open, providing us components we need. However,
the supply chain constraints we face are primarily related to logistics, including available air cargo space
and higher freight rates. Available cargo space on flights between the U.S. and Europe, and Europe and
Asia is more limited, so shipments are taking longer. In addition, shipments within Europe are limited
within countries worse affected by COVID-19, and experiencing some delays in other places due to checks
at border crossing. Recognizing that this situation is fluid and subject to change, we believe we have the
ability to meet near-term demand for our products.

In total, manufacturing and operating expenses were approximately $20 million lower in Q1 compared
to the peak level in Q2 2019. Although some of this reduction is due to the lower level of activity, it is
primarily attributed to the cost reduction actions we undertook in the second half of 2019. We remain
committed to managing our cost structure and working capital to the business environment.

Examining our performance by region. Revenue in China decreased 40% year-over-year and represented
approximately 28% of total sales. As we had expected, performance was impacted by weaker demand
due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, though we did see a strong recovery in orders during the later half
of March and April. We continue to face aggressive price competition in the region; however, pricing was
more stable in the sequential basis.

In Europe, where industrial demand environment remains very challenging, revenue decreased 15% year-
over-year. Revenue in North America increased 4% year-on-year with strong growth in medical lasers
and advanced applications. Our growth in North America illustrates the benefits of our diversified portfolio
strategy, where increasing the adoption of emerging laser solution and applications offset softness
within industrial markets. Sales in Japan decreased 12% year-over-year, given ongoing macroeconomic
weakness in the region. Sales in Korea decreased 26% year-over-year due to the effect of COVID-19
within the region. And sales in Turkey decreased 36% year-over-year due to the virus and other
macroeconomic challenges affecting cutting business in the region.

With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter.

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Eugene, and good morning, everyone. Revenue in the first quarter declined 21% year-over-
year to $249 million. Revenue from materials processing applications decreased 28% year-over-year,
and revenue from other applications increased 123%. Sales of high-power CW lasers decreased 33%
year-over-year, and represented approximately 48% of total revenue. Sales of ultra high power lasers
at 6 kilowatts or greater represented nearly 50% of total high-power CW laser sales. Pulsed laser sales
increased 1% year-over-year, with growth in green and high power pulsed lasers partially offset by lower
sales of lower power pulsed lasers for marking applications. Systems sales decreased 43% year-over-
year, as growth in systems for medical device manufacturing was offset by lower sales of other IPG laser
systems and Genesis non-laser systems. Medium power laser sales decreased 28% on continued softness
in additive manufacturing, and the transition to kilowatt-scale lasers in cutting, while QCW laser sales
decreased 30% year-over-year. Other product sales increased 38% year-over-year, driven by growth in
medical laser sales and total service revenue. Q1 GAAP gross margin was 41%, which declined 600 basis
points year-over-year. Compared with the year-ago period, the year-over-year decline in gross margin
was driven by the following factors: 200 basis points from less favorable absorption of manufacturing
expenses; 190 basis points from higher inventory reserves; 90 basis points from an increase in shipping

costs; 20 basis points from foreign exchange; and 100 basis points from other factors including lower
product pricing.

First quarter GAAP operating income was $45 million, and operating margin was 18%. During the quarter,
we recognized a foreign exchange gain of $20 million primarily related to the revaluation of U.S. dollar
cash and other assets in Russia, given the depreciation of the ruble versus the U.S. dollar. Excluding this
foreign exchange gain, operating margin was 10%. Q1 net income was $36 million or $0.68 per diluted
share. The previously referenced foreign exchange gains increased EPS by $0.28. The effective tax rate in
the quarter was 23%. If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we
would have expected revenue to be $5 million higher and gross profit to be $3 million higher. We ended
the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.2 billion, and total debt of $41
million. As Valentin noted earlier, our strong balance sheet provides us with ample flexibility in responding
to coronavirus-related disruptions, particularly around investing for future growth opportunities. Effective
operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $57 million during the quarter. Capital
expenditures were $18 million in the quarter, and are trending below our target of $115 million to $125
million for 2020. During the quarter, we repurchased 109,000 shares for $13 million.

Today, IPG also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to $200 million
of IPG common stock in open market transactions or otherwise, subject to market conditions and other
relevant factors. This new authorization is in addition to the company's existing $125 million stock
repurchase program authorized in February 2019, of which approximately $60 million remains available
under that prior program. In March and April, we extended our credit lines with Bank of America and
Deutsche Bank for 5 and 3 additional years, respectively. Bank of America also increased the total
unsecured availability to $75 million from $50 million.

First quarter book-to-bill was meaningfully greater than 1, and above normal seasonality, reflecting solid
bookings growth and the weaker revenue quarter in China. Normally, this would have translated into
stronger guidance for the second quarter, but the global demand environment remains very uncertain
given the effects of COVID-19 on manufacturing facilities and customer confidence around the world.
While we have seen a rebound in China-based order volumes in the latter half of March and April, this
has coincided with declining bookings in other regions, including Western Europe, North America and
other countries in Asia. As such, visibility into a recovery in global demand remains uncertain at this time.
Despite the uncertain near-term demand environment, we continue to target significant longer-term
growth opportunities in laser welding, electric vehicle battery processing and our portfolio of new products.
Our strong balance sheet will help us through the crisis, and emerge with the ability to capitalize on the
many opportunities we have ahead.

For the second quarter of 2020, IPG expects revenue of $260 million to $290 million. The company
expects the second quarter tax rate to be approximately 26%. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per
diluted share in the range of $0.40 to $0.70, with 53.1 million basic common shares outstanding and 53.7
million diluted common shares outstanding. Financial guidance provided this quarter is subject to greater
risk and uncertainty, given the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impact to the global business
environment and government policies.

As discussed in the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release, actual results may differ from
our guidance due to factors including, but not limited to, goodwill and other impairment charges, product
demand, order cancellation and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policies, health epidemics and general
economic conditions. Our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes
exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company's
reports with the SEC.
With that, Valentin and Eugene and I will be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Marchetti with Stifel.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I was just wondering, Valentin, if you could comment a little bit or add some color to your pricing
commentary about the China market? It sounded like pricing there at least was a little bit more stable on
a quarter-over-quarter basis. I'm curious if you think that is something that's somewhat more sustainable?
Or if it has to do more with the restrictions that we saw in place in -- during the March quarter?

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Okay. Chinese market now demonstrate more stability than it was 2 years, say, in '18. In '19, the price
is now much less than before battery prices becoming more stable. And the situation, of course, very
uncertain and so on. But in total trend for us now, it looks very much more better than we expected.
So during the -- for example, last 2 months, we received order for mid power lasers much, much more
than before the time. It's only during 2 months we received order of about last year. It was half of last
year. So it is -- if it's [ par amount ] the same trend, so we can expect to double the business in the mid
power lasers this year to compare to '19. Of course, situation, certainly, nobody can predict what happens
next month, but even very pessimistic case looks very promising. But still we introduced, especially with
competition on beam in the -- to compare to our Chinese competition in second half this year. When we
introduced new generation mid-power lasers much more perfect and much more higher functionality and
the whole other [ compare point ] to compare with the family, which we developed in '18, and now we sell
in the market. So situation for high power is in China also growing fast. They purchase more and more
high-power laser, more than 10-kilowatt power, special frame orders is huge. It's all growing now. So let's
say we still -- as a result, our now production facility [ now this is ], especially in Germany and Russia,
which serves Chinese market, now over busy. So we're now watching 80% of people in the -- working on-
site, and we see overtime, not enough people to procure in current order. For new product, we introduced
mainly -- developed in the U.S. now, introduced now that we have to deal with new production line.
Product -- market accepts very well, but now we still have problem to produce in volume. We're working
everywhere to increase -- create new production line. Especially in China, they work very well.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then, Tim, maybe just a quick one for you. Last quarter, you talked about an expected impact
of around $45 million. I'm curious how that actually played out in the quarter? If you were above, below
that or in line there? And maybe, with the guidance that you're giving, if you can maybe quantify a little
bit what you actually think the revenue impact and maybe the EPS impact of the ongoing virus situation
is?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

So given that we came in at the top end of the guidance range we gave for Q1, the actual impact in
the first quarter was slightly below the $45 million that we had framed Q1 guidance around. That really
was based upon a strong rebound in demand in China in March, having really lost February as a month.
That was a -- I characterize it as a lost month. And overall demand actually in Europe was reasonably
strong in Q1 with total order flow. And as you saw, given North America actually grew a little bit year-
over-year, particularly with the strength on the new medical applications. That demand environment held
up reasonably well. Within our Q2 guidance number, we're not going to give a specific estimates of how
much it's impacted. It's more difficult to do because, whilst you're seeing strength and significant strength

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

that Valentin has just talked about in Europe, the demand environment, at least at the moment -- sorry,
significant strength in China, the demand environment in Europe and order flow there, as we mentioned,
has weakened. It's also weaker in North America, and there's a bit more uncertainty as well for Japan
relative to the original forecast that we had there. So the overall impact, though, on Q2 is more than
the $45 million that we guided to for Q1, but we're not going to go and give a specific number around it.
The drop-through to EPS is probably a bit more difficult to quantify, given that we're not giving a specific
revenue number, but it will result in gross margins being lower than they would otherwise have been. And
certainly, earnings per share being reduced below the level that we were expecting in the second quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Regarding the pickup that you saw in demand in China in March and April, is that, do you think, to support
the current demand for these manufacturers as they've emerged from lockdown? Or does this appear to
be them adding additional manufacturing capacity for business there, perhaps assuming it's coming in, in
Q2, Q3?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Jim, I mean, some of it is a rebound from very little demand happening for a 6-week period. But I
think it's, in part -- it's not necessarily new capacity coming on board. It's that -- of probably all of the
economies that have gone through the coronavirus and COVID-19, China went into it earlier. China is
certainly exhibiting at this point in time more of perhaps a V-shaped recovery in terms of the letters
that everyone is talking about. It's probably, as Valentin said, total demand for some of the lower power
kilowatt scale lasers has rebounded very strongly. We've seen also good demand from higher power pulsed
lasers for EV, higher power lasers for welding, we referenced the AMB. I think like everybody, it's not
entirely certain how sustainable this can be. Valentin's comment was, that if it is sustained, it does point
to a nice recovery in our business over -- a reasonable recovery in Q2, and potentially that picking up in
Q3. I think there's just so much uncertainty out there at the moment about whether a V-shaped recovery
in China will be sustained or what kind of recovery we'll see in Europe, North America and other Asian
countries as we get out of this. But certainly, we've been surprised by the strength of the demand, and it's
been a positive thing coming into this quarter from China.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. With respect to the systems business, down pretty significantly in Q1. I guess, is it fair to say this
is mainly more a U.S. business, to a lesser extent, European? Is this -- was the decline more concentrated
in medical device manufacturing? And you've got some tougher comps as you look out at the back half.
Is this an area of the business that perhaps has more uncertainty to it? Or do you see some recovery off
these low levels?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

No. So in fact, the demand for the medical device systems used to manufacture medical devices, draw
a distinction between that and the medical lasers we sell for medical procedures, right? There's the ILT
acquisition, which services medical device manufacturing. Demand within that application has actually held
up reasonably well. Demand for our more specialized multiaccess systems that are used in fine processing
has also held up well. The weakness has really been on the system side for the smaller form compact
cutting system, where that has certainly been impacted by people pushing out investment decisions.
So that would be used more on the job shop and less advanced applications. And with Genesis welding
systems, particularly on the non-laser side, where again, it's sometimes a significant investment decision.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Certainly, that business has shown a slowdown. So I'd characterize it as some of the non-laser welding
applications for Genesis, and the more basic cutting systems, small-form compact cutting systems.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

And now we -- in this system business, we are changing with ILT, and with Genesis, we're changing the
time, a new product line, which includes laser also [ sources for it ] and so on increased share in total
system with laser. ILT, for example, they developed using our new ultra custom lasers, new generation of
machine for stent making. And before, there was a very small sell with former product without laser. Now
with laser, new with some laser, now this qualification is going very well. Right now, we see demand start
to grow very fast for this machine. Second also, for ILT, for example, for the -- all the sales was within
U.S. And now we extend the ILT marketing, ILT system in Europe, also, Eastern Europe and going even to
the East, because new generation such machines, very competitive. Becoming very competitive in quality
and also in cost to compare to this local manufacturer.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

So it sounds like you're suggesting this business may be bottoming here and should improve with the new
products in the back half?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

I think what we're saying is we're seeing strength from some of the more advanced and newer products
that we're introducing. And as we introduce more of those newer products, that's really been the target of
the business strategically, is to drive that growth from those areas. So it is to introduce more laser-based
welding systems with Genesis, and to grow the medical device manufacturing capability that we acquired
as well. So perhaps a slight nuance to what you're saying, Jim, but pretty similar.

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

With changes, it's more longer to make this new version machine in mobile [ ing ], but the process is
going very well. So we expect end of this year, next year, will be -- we'll enter the market in new way,
efficient, very effective and higher performance machine, with way sooner wait time processing.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. Just wondering, based on the cost-cutting that Eugene referenced earlier, I was wondering, Tim, is
there a change to the long-term target model from a margin point of view? Are you still in that 45% to
50% range, do you think?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

At the moment, we're not taking a lot -- changing the long-term target model. We're clearly operating
at revenue levels below our even medium- and longer-term targets, and that's really why the current
performance is below that range. At this point in time, we are still trying to manage the business and
definitely targeting trying to get back to the 45% to 50% range.

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Okay. And then, just another question on the COVID impact on capacity. It sounds like it's not really
impacting you right now as much as maybe it would be if you were at full production. Curious, is there
some way to quantify the impact to your capacity either through having to do social spacing or supplier
constraints?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Eugene, do you want to address that question from an operations perspective?

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Yes. In principle, I already mentioned that we didn't get any big problem in Germany because our capacity
was -- we used approximately 90% of our capacity without some strong limitations. In other countries,
also, I mentioned that in Massachusetts, we only produced products which are required to support
essential businesses. In Russia, of course, it's other situation, but our main production now in Germany. I
think we have a lot of, today, orders. And we definitely will ship these orders in time. It's no risk. And from
the future, we'll see. If it will be necessary, we can introduce some additional measures, like second shifts,
some additional people and so on. Again, from a production point of view, I don't see any big risk. Only
one risk that exist, maybe in the future, we will not have enough orders. But if orders will come, we will
definitely proceed all these orders.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

[ Now the green full. ] For current product, we have enough capacity for current product. For new
products, we introduced now the same, but visible green laser, UV laser, ultra short lasers and so on. We
still don't have enough capacity, have to build looking for people and creating new production line. We're
still in the first phase this year and next year, we've got to install here mass production. Then today, we
would be realizing whole potential. Now current capacity not able to support this demand. What do you
need? We don't need equipment. We don't need the facility. We have this. We need people. We need to
train people in electronics energy, optic engineers, technician, high-quality. In the U.S. and in Germany,
it's very difficult -- available the people, so we transfer more and more of this production to Eastern
Europe to Russia, and we built new very large mass production capacity in Belarussia, in Minsk.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America.

Michael J. Feniger
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

The gross margin actually picked up in Q1 versus the fourth quarter, even with the sequential drop in
revenue. If I go back a few years, your Q1 margin sequentially actually goes down. So I was hoping
you could kind of address some of the measures you were able to put in place to actually show that
improvement? And with the revenue recovering in Q2 and hopefully in Q3, I'm just wondering if, on that
target gross margin, has the revenue that you need to get to, has that changed in terms of hitting $300
million or $350 million or $400 million mark? Has that changed the paradigm in terms of what gross
margin ranges could be?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Michael, the first part of the question there about Q1 gross margin, I think we were pleased, given the
revenue level, with the gross margin that we achieved, particularly given that we also had some higher
inventory provisions. So the performance, even relative to our guidance, was better. I've not really tracked
it as to comparably what gross margin does Q1 to Q4. I don't tend to focus on that so much. What I will
say is in Q1, we've referenced that we've had these cost reduction initiatives that were started really in
Q3 2019. It accelerated in Q4, so one of the benefits we had in the first quarter with those cost reduction

initiatives flowed more completely and fully through the business model. As Eugene mentioned, the total
amount of expenses that we incurred in the first quarter were both manufacturing and operating, we
haven't split it out between the 2, was $20 million lower. A significant part of that compared, for example,
to the middle of last year, was on the manufacturing side. So partly due to lower activity, but lower
headcount because some of the restructuring, fewer contractors used in certain locations. So it's really
around the way that we try to manage the cost base of the business, and some of that wasn't even really
clearly -- because we started this last year -- it wasn't related to the pandemic taking hold. These were
operational initiatives that we had started to execute upon over the last 6 and 9 months.

With regard to the future, I think the thing that's most pertinent to that -- so we're not fundamentally
changing the range of revenue that needs to be achieved for the business model to show decent leverage
in it. I think as we get back above $300 million, transition to $330 million, $350 million, we get into a
much more comfortable position. And if we can grow revenue to $370 million or $400 million, we think
that we will be again getting back towards close to 50% margin, in particular if some of that growth comes
from our leading-edge products that we're introducing to the market. Whether it's -- not just the higher
power lasers for cutting, but some of the AMB lasers for welding, the new product in ultrafast, the green
lasers, the more advanced systems, the medical devices, the devices for medical procedures. So all of
those are -- as those have started to show strength in the -- some of the defense applications, we shipped
another 100-kilowatt laser this quarter. These are all things that over time should benefit the business
model. So there's no fundamental change in seeing some accretion and leverage out of gross margin that
we expect to happen as revenue starts to recover.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

In old product -- current product like mid-power lasers, high-power lasers, 1-micron range. This year,
we introduced new generation laser with 1/4 of them manufacturing costs would be 20%, 30% less than
current product. Performance would be better, but the cost would be 20%, 30% less, so we expect -- so
with this product, we will increase gross margin essential from this mass product.

Michael J. Feniger
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

That's helpful. Longer term, I'd love to get a sense of how you think COVID impacts your customer base
with manufacturing facilities? But also just the supply chain? With social distancing, do new facilities need
more automation and laser technology for safety concerns? Do you see with what we've seen play out in
other markets with supply chains? Do you think they've got to -- do we have to see them get reoriented?
And maybe some manufacturing facilities have to move out of China or be rebuilt locally in other regions.
Just curious if you've seen any of that.

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

I mean, I think, from a productivity perspective within our own systems, the safety and cleaning and
even some of Valentin references this sort of UV light cleansing that we're using. We're not seeing a
fundamental change in the ability to use our space or the productivity from it. Some of the things that
you reference are actions and initiatives that we've already taken and been investing in for several years.
So increased use of automation in diode manufacturing and packaging are all part of our strategies. It's
one of the reasons that we have a supply chain that is really focused in either North America, Germany or
Russia, and why we don't use lower cost labor in other areas around the world. So certainly, automation
is an area where we think that potentially IPG will use more of it over time, and some of our customers
will use more of it over time. That continued transition towards automation will help laser-based sales,
particularly as they're integrated within robotic and other systems. Some of your other questions, I think,
have broader-based economic and supply chain strategic and logistics decisions that companies may
make. One of the outcomes of this is, given the disruption of being able to get components from different
places around the world, is that you may see a reversion from just simply concentrating manufacturing
in low-cost countries like China and other areas in Asia because the actual cost of doing so is higher than
having your supply chain more distributed. So you may well see some investments around component

manufacturing in North America and Europe. And that, again, may be over the longer term, a benefit to
IPG.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

And our strategic target, our -- the mass production, we start making more and more -- our target to
make in for East Europe. East Europe means Russia and Belarussia. New very large production facility. It's
for China for the East, for low cost product and so on. For -- but America, U.S., and the Germany would
be major for the development of new product, introduction in the market this product qualification and
so on, to serve this East -- Western Europe and American market only. But mass production, we move
[ for more cost ]. And cost of production, for example, now Belarussia would be cheaper than in China. It's
much more protected, much more higher quality and people are very well organized with this facility. We
have built already 30,000 -- 300,000 square feet. We have built with that [ a start ] production. But next
year, it will start to work in full, so that will help us to review mass production, to make in -- with a very
low cost, very high quality and so on, well protected against any political and other problems.

Our next question comes from the line of Jed Dorsheimer with Canaccord Genuity.

Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

It's nice to see a positive outlook here. I guess a question regarding the uptick with respect to what I
presume is pent-up demand from things being shut down over in China. I'm curious, if we look at China's
GDP being largely export, and we look at the rest of the world largely seeing a decline in GDP from a
consumption perspective. I'm just curious, how you reconcile the pickup in manufacturing capacity? Is
it a function of utilization? Or you see -- or is it upgrades in existing facilities that is attributing to the
demand?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

So first of all, I think that there continues to be uncertainty as to how global GDP and China GDP, North
America, European GDP will recover over the next 6 to 9 months. I think that remains the uncertain
question in some of the outlook there. With regard to the China rebound in demand specifically, yes,
some of the China investments relate to exports, but don't forget that the Chinese government has been
pursuing a strategy of trying to drive local consumption and demand. So that may be driving part of this
recovery. Many of the industries we also serve are not so much export-orientated, whether it be electric
vehicle manufacturing to supply local demand, the housing sector, consumer durable goods. Of course,
some of the consumer electronics stuff is exported, but there's also strong local demand there as well.
So I think perhaps some of the supply chains that we serve are not just solely export-focused. They are
also driven by internal China demand. I think over the medium term, clearly, the data points that we're
going to be looking at are how regional and global PMIs trend? What export data looks like for robotic
orders coming out of other Asian countries and machine tool data exports? So whilst we're pleased with
the overall performance in Q1 with revenue coming at the top end of the range, I'm pleased to be able to
guide at least sequentially higher. It's not as though we or the global economy is out of the woods yet. I
think there remains some uncertainty on that, Jed.

Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, and you -- may have missed this, I jumped on a little bit late on the
call. But the -- with the price stabilization, particularly in the low- to mid-power range, where we've
seen intense price pressure over the past year or so, is that -- do you attribute the stabilization to less
competitors? Are we seeing attrition that's finally playing out? Or are you seeing we've just hit a bottom
in terms of that pricing? Or maybe just a little bit more color on the pricing dynamic in what was a more
competitive segment of the market?

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Well, first of all, we do not price essentially [ what ] China stimulates this drop of prices over to win this
market, win the market worldwide. When we had this challenge and we also dropped the prices, despite
our product much higher quality, much more reliable and so and so on. But our prices [ compares ] to
Chinese prices, especially -- for that we dropped very essential cost of this upgrade the design. And
now our price is very low price, very competitive. Chinese could not drop more because, in other case,
they're near bankrupt -- many of them without government support are near bankruptcy now, very low
gross margin and artificial, even. They continue with gross margin much less than reported even most
of them, because government supports on this compensation. But we, without any compensation are
providing similar with no big difference in price. By the way, from the point any European, any American
can be competitors now. [ Why ] they are not able to compete it already, not only with our quality, but
also prices. [ For practical, ] China remained only competitor for IPG in this area. And they could not drop
prices more essentially, because it would be [ effort ] for them and why it is so, they generate only more
-- the trade can only artificially support some -- a growth figure like 35% gross margin, but it's artificial,
not real margin, gross margin. So no more way to go down.

But we still -- still I add one. Even with these prices, we now with new our design, we -- our gross margin
will increase again. It dropped like 40%, 50%. Now we increase again up to 60% and even 70%. So a real
gross margin, so on. So we're very competitive now, even with such price and profitable.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company.

Mark S. Miller
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

I just was wondering about the supply chain again. Are you seeing any impact? You mentioned air
shipments in terms of component supply? Or are you being impacted by some of your customers, their
problems related to the virus?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Eugene, do you want to take that question on supply chain and components?

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Yes. From the point of component supply, we didn't get any problems because we made some measures
before. It means we have enough components to our continuous operation of our stock, our main
components. And for -- of course, COVID-19 influence for our customers sometimes. And this is why some
of them, they delay the orders, and also to ask us to delay shipment for some existing orders. These are
our main problems. But in principle, we don't see any big problems today connected to COVID-19 in the
supply chain.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Due to our policy because first of all, we're shipping outside much less components than any our
competitors. Most components, especially expensive with so on, critical we produce it in-house. Now
produce account and not only optical, electrical, metallic parts, anything [ gets sold ]. Soon maybe 80%,
90% plus, we will buy -- will be making inside, only 10%, 15% outside, number one. Second, we hold our
typical policy to hold 3-month storage, so for serious product. The outside help for the 1-month shortage,
2-month shortage, we have now most cases, put in-house in storage. So it's only very few problems we
have really now are with components, which still waiting from that, especially for new product, but not for
mass product.

You mentioned ultrafast lasers were strong. I was wondering if you could estimate what percent of
recently introduced products were -- what percent did they represent of total sales? Is it around 20%?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The ultrafast product as a percentage of total sales is still relatively small, Mark. I think what
Valentin was referencing was that there's good progress being made on numerous different projects.
You mentioned one specifically that IPG's subsidiary, ILT, has developed a new system for stent cutting
using our own ultrafast lasers. So the numerous projects we have there are moving well. Ultrafast was
reasonably a -- performed reasonably in the quarter, but it's certainly nowhere near the level we want it to
get to.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Our first product -- major product we introduced to market on the end of last year, beginning this year. It's
all testing customer. We won very well customer, very wide, and more customers we provide for sale. They
very liked the product. They promise very serious orders. But our problem now to install mass production.
Now we produce not enough even for current demand. During this year, we have installed production up
to the couple thousand per year, then it would be real. It will become serious business. But it's still -- it's
a complicated. Assembly need very trained people and so on for this. This major problem are people now,
not -- and there is so much production.

look at it and see how it might affect us. So I don't have an answer to that question right now.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. No worries. And then a second question, I just wanted to find out on the June quarter sequential
uptake, can you just tell us which product lines are going to grow more than others? And are you seeing
your typical seasonal uptick you see in pulsed lasers because of the consumer electronics end market?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

I mean we don't normally get that granular on it. We expect obviously to see high-power pick up because
of the demand from China. QCW will see some increase, but it's not a fundamental investment cycle that
we normally see from consumer electronics. But that we'd expect to see some pickup. And pulsed, maybe
some additional marking, but again, it's -- you're not -- you haven't got a major consumer electronics
investment cycle that is driving [ how a ] sequential improvement in Q2. And as I said, even though it's
great to see a bit of a sequential improvement compared to what guidance may have been without COVID
and the demands that we were seeing, it's still a relatively weak performance.
