Operator

And welcome to Invesco's Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. And now
I would like to turn the conference call over to your speakers for today Marty Flanagan, President and CEO
of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer.

Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining, and Happy New Year to everybody. I think we're
all very ready to turn the page on what was a very challenging 2020. And while the global pandemic
remains very pervasive, we do all see light at the end of the tunnel, and we look forward to 2021 with
cautious optimism that conditions will improve.

Throughout 2020, we focused on executing our long-term strategy of recognizing the necessity to focus on
employee health and safety, finding new ways to work in serving and delivering expected outcomes to our
clients. I would like to thank all our employees and our clients during what has been a challenging period.

Over the past decade, we've been successful investing ahead of shifts in client demand, placing us in
a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future. Our investments in these
capabilities and our tremendous focus on our clients is now again producing good momentum in our
business that became more visible as the year progressed. By working better to anticipate, understand
and meet client needs during the challenging times, we've achieved 6 straight months of net long-term
inflows, totaling nearly $18 billion in the second half of 2020, with progress across channels, geographies
and asset classes.

Retail flows improved in the second half significantly. Our solutions-enabled institutional pipeline remain
near record levels. We saw net inflows in Asia Pacific totaling $17 billion in the second half of the year and
improving flows in EMEA and the Americas over this time frame.

And net long-term flows in the fixed income remained robust during that period. All of these factors
combined build a strong foundation as we head into 2021. And maybe a few highlights of the fourth
quarter on Slide 4, if you happen to be following along.

More specifically during the quarter, investment performance for a large portion of our high demand
capabilities were in the upper quartiles. We had net long-term inflows of nearly $10 billion during
the quarter. Long-term inflows and fixed income capabilities continued, while we saw client demand
for equities within ETFs, quantitative and index strategies, in particular. We saw another quarter of
strong inflows in Asia Pacific region and flows in the Americas turned positive. Allison will provide more

information in a few minutes on the flows, strategic evaluation, more details of the quarter. But I would
like to note that we also improved our operating leverage during the period, paid our credit facility to 0
and made progress improving our cash position.

I would like to spend a few minutes on Slides 5 and 6 to talk about our competitive strength and key
capabilities in areas with high client demand and our focus for 2021.

Slide 5 illustrates the market opportunities we see for these key growth areas and demonstrates
the majority of our investment capabilities are aligned with these opportunities. In these areas, our
investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. And as we
move into 2021, we plan to further expand our market-leading position in ETFs in the U.S. and EMEA, in
particular, and build our passive presence in Asia Pacific.

We are the fourth largest ETF provider globally, and our capabilities span passive, active strategies
and established and developing spectrum of ETF -- ESG ETFs. And building on our 15-year legacy of
innovation, we continue to develop new products in this space as demonstrated by the launch of the
QQQ innovation suite and our first nontransparent ETFs that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Strong
alternative platform, and our focus is growing our private markets business, led by our market-leading
real estate and bank loan businesses

[Audio Gap]

Active fixed income and global equity remains areas of opportunity for us, and our offerings are well
positioned with strong investment performance and high client demand. In addition, we are focused on our
solutions efforts. And as we have seen by the contribution to the institutional pipeline, clients value the
service, the ability to offer solutions that builds -- that's built on the full power of our competitive set of
capability and services to clients continue to be a priority for us during 2021.

We continue to invest in our leadership position in Greater China. We've been managing dedicated Chinese
products for nearly 40 years. We have already seen the benefits of our early mover advantage in the China
onshore market through our joint venture, which was the first sino-foreign joint venture in the industry
established almost 20 years ago.

Turning to Slide 6. As we noted in the third quarter, we see opportunities to invest in areas of growth
aligned with our strategic plan. These areas include ETF, alternatives, active fixed income, global equities,
which includes emerging markets. And we will build on our market-leading position in the fast-growing
China market and further develop our leading solutions and asset allocation offerings.

Given our investment in the business over the past decade, our most recent efforts to better align the
organization with our strategy, I'm confident we have the talent, the capabilities and the resources and
momentum to drive the future growth and success. We're optimistic about the new year and remain
focused on helping our clients achieve their desired outcomes, regardless of where the markets take us.

And with that, I will turn it over to Allison to get into further details.

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7. We had 61% and 70% of actively managed
funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global
equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see
demand from clients globally.

Looking at our AUM on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM. Of the $132 billion in AUM
growth, approximately $95 billion is a function of increased market values.

Turning to flows on Slide 9. Our diversified platform generated long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter
of $9.8 billion, representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, which generated positive net inflows and
active AUM of $400 million and passive AUM of $9.4 billion. Our ETFs experienced net inflows of $6.1
billion, including $4.7 billion in long-term ETFs and $1.4 billion in our QQs.

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

Our U.S.-listed ETFS, excluding the QQQs, had their best quarter in their 15-year history. We saw net
long-term ETF flows in the U.S.-focused on equities in the fourth quarter, including a high level of interest
in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which had $2.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 2 of our top 5
inflowing ETFs were ESG related. We continue to see momentum in our ETF business and demand for ESG
funds. And as Marty highlighted, the market opportunity is significant for this key growth area in 2021.

Retail net outflows were $800 million in the quarter, helped by the positive ETF flows. On the institutional
side, we had net inflows of $10.6 billion. I'll provide a little more color on these flows on the next few
slides, but importantly, the growth in our passive AUM and our institutional AUM is meaningful for the firm
and contributed to the positive operating leverage we generated in the period. Also, as Marty noted earlier,
we're seeing the mix of ETF inflows being weighted towards higher fee-generating products.

Looking at flows by geography, you'll note that the Americas had net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter,
an improvement of $6.6 billion from the prior quarter. This improvement was driven by net inflows into
ETF, institutional inflows, various fixed income strategies and importantly, focused sales efforts and
improvement in redemption rates. Our global equity products improved by over $1 billion or 37% from Q3,
driven by our developing markets fund, which returned to positive net flows in the fourth quarter following
negative net flows in the first 3 quarters of the year.

The U.K. experienced net outflows of $100 million in the quarter as positive flows into our institutional
quantitative equity capability were offset by net outflows in multi-asset and U.K. equities. EMEA net
outflows were $1.4 billion, driven by institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows, largely in our S&P 500 and
NASDAQ 100 used ETFs.

And finally, I noted last quarter that Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net
inflows of $8 billion. In the fourth quarter, net inflows were even higher at $9.1 billion. Net inflows were
diversified across the Asia Pacific region. $4 billion of these net flows were from Japan, $3.8 billion arose
from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the
region. It's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets
in the fourth quarter, with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion. This following net long-term inflows of $8.8
billion in the third quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter. It's also important to note that of the $26.1
billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, $25 billion of these net inflows were from active fixed income
capabilities. Active fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020 and remains a key investment area
in 2021.

Now moving to Slide 10. Our institutional pipeline remains robust at $30.5 billion on the heels of strong
pull-through in the institutional pipeline during the fourth quarter. This pipeline is diversified across asset
classes and geographies, and our solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our
institutional network, warranting our continued investment in this key capability in 2021.

Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our revenues increased $135 million or 12.4% from the third quarter,
driven by higher average AUM in Q4 as well as a meaningful increase in performance fees. Net revenue
yield ex performance fees was 36 basis points flat and flat at the third -- at the Q3 yield level. The impact
of rising markets on our yield was offset by a modest fee rate decline from the mix shift we experienced
across products in the quarter as well as the impact of nonmanagement fee earning AUM.

We recorded performance fees of $78 million in the fourth quarter, $48 million of these performance fees
arose from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business and our China JV, 2 of
our key growth areas. Seasonally, we tend to see higher performance fees in the fourth quarter.

Total adjusted operating expenses increased 8.3% in Q4. The $57 million increase in operating expenses
was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of both market growth and compensation related
to the performance fees in the quarter. Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity
levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations
that persisted in the quarter. That being said, we did see a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as
expected.

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

Moving to Slide 12. We wanted to update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation.
As we noted previously, we conducted a strategic evaluation across 4 key areas of our expense base. Our
organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and
operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed
income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. While creating permanent net improvements of
$200 million in our normalized operating expense base. As we noted, a large element of the savings will
be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our non-client-facing workforce to support key
areas of growth and repositioning to lower-cost locations.

In the fourth quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $7 million of these savings were related
to compensation expense, as depicted on Slide 12. The remaining $500,000 in savings were related to
facilities, which are shown in the property, office and technology category. The $7.5 million in cost savings
were $30 million annualized, is 15% of our $200 million net savings expectation. Of the remaining $170
million in net savings, we anticipate we will realize roughly 50% of the savings through compensation
expense.

The remaining 50% was spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. As it relates to timing, we still
expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year,
with the remainder recognized by the end of '22. We estimate that we will realize roughly 75% of the
anticipated compensation reductions in 2021, roughly 50% of the anticipated reduction in occupancy
expense also in 2021 and all of the reduction in G&A this year.

The majority of efficiencies identified in our tech spend will not be realized until 2022. In the fourth
quarter, we incurred $104 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs.
We expect the remaining transaction cost for the realization of this program to be in a range of $150
million to $175 million over the next 2 years, with roughly 2/3 of this remaining amount occurring in 2021.
As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.

With respect to Q1, after improved market performance and asset inflows in the fourth quarter, we start
the year with over $1.3 trillion in AUM. Given the market improvement was more back-end weighted
towards the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues, excluding performance fees, and the
associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter. This reflects the follow-through
from the market and flow growth that occurred over the course of the fourth quarter, even as we assume
no change in markets from year-end.

On the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation and the seasonal increase
in payroll taxes. Partially offset by lower compensation-related to the seasonal decline in performance fees
and the execution of our targeted cost savings.

Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income improved $78 million to $485 million for the quarter,
driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin include 230 basis points as compared
to the third quarter to 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our model. This helped drive the
$0.19 increase in adjusted EPS to $0.72 a share.

In addition, we benefited from higher nonoperating income and lower nonoperating expenses in the
quarter. Nonoperating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $15.2
million in net gains last quarter. The increase was driven by unrealized gains primarily in our seed money
holdings. Interest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the prior quarter. Q3 was the final quarter
in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, a portion of which we settled in
January, with the remaining portion to be settled in April of 2021.

Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%. The reduction in the rate reflects the lower taxes on
unrealized gains in our seed portfolio due to the jurisdiction of our holdings. We estimate our 2021 non-
GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this
estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items.

A few comments on Slide 14. As Marty mentioned, we reduced our revolver balance by $90 million to 0 in
the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile.

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial
flexibility. To that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter from
$1.1 billion at the end of Q3. $764 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. I will note,
we paid $117 million earlier in January to settle a portion of the forward share repurchase liability with
the remaining liability of $177 million to be settled in April. We believe we're making solid progress in
our efforts to build financial flexibility. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning
capital to shareholders longer-term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share
repurchases.

In summary, Marty walked through our key capabilities, the organic growth opportunity each presents
and our focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We're also focused on our strategic
evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth, and we remain prudent and cautious
in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our
platform, combined with the work we have done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of
capabilities put Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to
continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

My question is on the fee rates and kind of the outlook. First, just I guess, in terms of the fourth quarter,
is there anything abnormal in this period? Obviously, mix and beta were positive. So I just want to clarify
that this is a good exit kind of run rate for the fee rate. And then thinking about next year, assuming flat
markets and the mix of business that you're seeing in terms of demand and institutionally and otherwise,
how we should think about the trends in the fee rates for next year?

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Sure. Dan. So I'd take first on the fourth quarter, your question around was anything abnormal. Let
me just start with, obviously, we had pretty high performance fees in the fourth quarter. So excluding
performance fees, as you saw, net revenue yield was flat at 36 basis points in both the third quarter and
the fourth quarter. I mean it's fairly straightforward in terms of what was driving that. You've got the
impact of the rising markets on our yield. And then that's which was a positive, of course. And then we've
got some offset there, given the modest pressure we continue to see just from the client demand and
the mix shift that's there. We've got, consistent with industry, high interest in our passive capabilities and
some churn within our active, and that does put some downward pressure on net revenue yield. And this
was a quarter where the impact of really strong market growth helped offset that.

In terms of what does that mean for this year, I would say that trend right there, we would expect to
continue. I do expect we will continue to see high interest in our passive capabilities and some continued
churn within active. What does that mean for net revenue yield going forward? It's very difficult to predict,
as you know. What I would point you to is that our focus is not simply on net revenue yield. We've really
got the breadth of capabilities to serve our clients well. I think that's really starting to be demonstrated in
the results over the last couple of quarters. And as we focus on that, we really are focusing on operating
margin and making sure that we are managing our expense base to the top line of the firm and really
driving profitable growth across our platform.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just as a follow-up on expenses and your commentary sequentially, both an increase in
revenue and expenses. So obviously, performance fees will be lower given the seasonality. So I just want
to clarify the -- you're still talking sequential comp increase from a dollar perspective in the first quarter.
And then also on the synergies -- or not the kind of expense savings, just the cadence as we think about
the year, are they more back-end loaded in terms of the realization? I get the exit by year-end numbers
you gave, but just thinking about kind of the flow-through through the year, how we should think about
the timing throughout '21?

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Sure. So yes, let me start with Q1, and there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about it, just given
the really strong growth that we saw in the back half of the fourth quarter. That market growth, excluding
performance fee, really did come in the back half of the year, and we started the year with a very high
level of AUM.

And you see what I see in terms of the markets thus far that we enter with strong revenue growth as
that maintains, and we hope that maintains. And then along with that, we've got the associated variable

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

compensation, and that does drive compensation higher, all things being equal for the quarter. And then
we have the seasonality of payroll taxes and some pension expenses that occur in the first quarter of the
year. Now those are going to be offset by the -- what we're doing in terms of our targeted cost saves and
of course, the lower compensation that we would have in this quarter, excluding performance fees.

The net of all of that, the puts and takes, hard to say exactly, given the strong run-up in revenue and the
associated expenses. But it's, I would say, flattish, and I'm talking total expenses fourth quarter. In terms
of the cadence of the cost saves, I think it's reasonable to look at those as being spread relatively equally
over the year. There may be a little bit of front-end loading into the first half of the year, but relatively
equal.

Operator

And our next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Crédit Suisse.

Christopher Shutler

I wanted to see if you could update us on your M&A priorities. And specifically, what investment
capabilities or distribution efforts would Invesco target or be interested in adding?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Craig. So our perspective really has not changed. As we look at M&A, it always has to start has
be strategic. It has to be additive to the business in areas of client demand, where we just really don't
have a competitive capability or have the scale to compete. We also very much focus on the culture of the
organization. As I've pointed out, historically, you have to have culture alignment to be successful. And
that will continue to be our criteria. And what we don't think makes sense is sort of the roll-ups where
there's just a lot of duplication. Clients don't like it. Shareholders don't like it. It's just really hard. And so
we will continue to stay away from that.

Craig William Siegenthaler
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And then just as my follow-up, when we think of potential M&A targets in the various sizes of
different businesses, I'm wondering what are the largest managers by AUM that investment could target?
Or what is the upper band of the universe of firms that you would consider acquiring?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Look, Craig, it's always facts and circumstances. And I think size is a factor, but size the level of
complexity is quite different with any organization. So it would really be facts and circumstances as
opposed to some hard and fast rule.

Operator

Our next question is from Glenn Schorr from Evercore.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So a lot of good things to point to in the quarter. I do want to get a little more color on a lot of the flows
coming on the institutional side, retail seemed in the flat range. So wondering what efforts you can do to
spur growth there? And then also, if you can focus on the outflows on the alternative side and what the
plan is for private markets from here?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

10

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

Yes. A couple of things. So again, as you saw, gross flows were a record high for us. And taking them
region by region, channel by channel, Allison, I think, went through that pretty clearly. We continue to see
momentum in the retail channels. It did slow down [ AP ] and EMEA as Allison spoke of, some of that was
Brexit-related sort of risk of -- as it came down to final negotiations. And quite frankly, there was some
look over to the elections in the United States.

The U.S. retail channel is really starting to make tremendous change in progress. We're not where we
want to be, that's for sure. But the momentum's there, the gross flows are there. We're seeing flows as
you look into the year outside of ETFs in the traditional asset classes, munis, short-duration fixed income.
Emerging markets is actually picking up, which is really good news. That's back in the flow. So cautiously
optimistic.

Within alternatives, it's largely been on GTR, and that was really the driver this past quarter. Bank loans
were also an area that were still in outflows. As we look into this year, we'll see what the opportunities
are with bank loans, in particular. But again, we're obviously very, very focused on any area where we're
relatively underperforming.

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

The only thing I'd add to that on the alternative outflows was the third area we saw some outflows would
be in real estate dispositions, and that would be somewhat in the normal course of that business, but it
did contribute to the negative flows there. And I'd say one positive point as it relates to our retail flows
is if we look at our active U.S. retail net outflows, they were actually $2.6 billion better than the third
quarter. Now they were still negative at $6.7 billion, but that was an improvement of $2.6 billion over the
prior quarter, really on the heels of higher gross sales and redemption levels that were significantly lower
than what we saw across the industry. So signs of growth and improvement there.

Craig William Siegenthaler
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Appreciate all that color. Just maybe one little follow-up on the alternative side. Do you feel like you have
the suite of proxy you want to -- Marty, as you said, compete and scale effectively as growth continues
there? Or is that one of the areas where you could see Invesco head into over time, right place, right fit
obviously?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes, good question. So look, we clearly have a leadership position in real estate and bank loans. Private
credit has been an area where it's -- have some good performance. We don't have the scale that we would
have wanted. Team is very strong, turning to a 3-year track record. So that's an important opportunity for
us as we look forward. And again, we'll just continue to focus on expanding that business over this next
year.

Operator

Our next question is from Robert Lee from KBW.

Robert Andrew Lee

I was wondering if maybe Marty, put a little bit -- I guess, a little bit more meat on the bone, if I think
of the areas for growth, I mean, you talked about leveraging solutions, client engagement, sales. But
can you maybe dig into that a little bit? I mean, is that about leveraging technology? Is it reorganization
of sales function or reengineering of it? Kind of maybe give a little more feel for what that is and what's
driving it?

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

Yes. Okay. So look, this has been in the making for, I don't know, 4 years now. And so all of a sudden,
it's an overnight success. Our approach has been to have a very talented, quantitative solutions team.
It's very strong at asset allocation, building anything from models to customize solutions for clients and
also advisory to clients, whether it be in sort of the big corner office suites in the retail channel, but quite
frankly, large pension plans around the world.

And our approach has been to use our capabilities, whether it be our passive capabilities, our factor
capabilities all the way through alternative capabilities. So it's not a duplicative set of skills. It's literally
using what we've had in existence. We have built what is a very, very strong analytical tool that we use
with clients as a way to help them analyze their portfolios. That's how the engagements happen. And any
one of those outcomes can happen simply from an advice engagement to building a customized solution.
During that journey, as you build it out, how you engage, how you face off with clients, there are clearly
modifications to how you do that.

And we seem to have found ourselves in a situation where we seem to have the formula right based on
the outcomes that we're seeing. And I come back to -- this really is the fundamental topic that is driving
the change in the industry is that clients are working with fewer money managers that are expecting more
from money managers. So if you don't have that breadth of capability and if you don't have the ability to
serve clients through these engagements, you're truly disadvantaged.

And so it is really making a difference for us, and we expect that will be the case in the years ahead. So
hopefully, that gives you a little more color.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Yes. So maybe a quick follow-up just on capital management. Can you update us, I mean, your intention
to form contract has pretty much in -- revolver is down to 0, you had reset the dividend, you're building
liquidity. Once you get through the April payment, how are you thinking at that point about your capital
management priorities? Should we think that you may go back to starting to kind of to restart some
dividend growth or reengage and share repurchases, how should we think of kind of the priorities kind of
post-April on payment?

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Sure. Rob, I'll take that. So look, as we think about just sort of where we are now. And as I think about
rolling forward over the next couple of quarters, you'll note, we built our cash balances. I'll also just
remind everyone, we do have seasonality and comp expense that is -- seasonality and cash-flow-related
comp expense in the first quarter. Historically, the company has drawn on the revolver in the first quarter.
We've obviously managed our cash balances a little bit higher. There is strong cash flow, just given the
AUM dynamics that we see right now. I don't know what that will look like exactly as we work through the
quarter, and we do have the liability to settle in April. All that said, we're in a very strong position. And I
continue -- I expect us to continue to build our cash balances longer-term and improved net leverage.

And then as I think about just what does that mean for the financial flexibility that we're looking to
achieve and returning capital to shareholders. We are committed to that financial flexibility. We do want
to invest in the business, first and foremost, to support future growth in the business. We do remain
committed to strengthening our balance sheet. And ultimately, we want to be in a position to return
excess cash to shareholders. And I do expect that we'll be doing that through a stable and modestly
growing dividend and eventually share repurchases.

And so we are coming up soon here on the 1 year of having made some decisions around that. And we've
got the opportunity to think about what our capital -- our return of capital to shareholders looks like, and
we will be working through that in the coming months. We're -- I'll say that we're pleased to be in a very
strong position to be having those conversations and look forward to sharing more.

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

And our next question is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Long-term organic asset growth was, I think, 3.9% in the quarter. Can you estimate the organic
revenue growth in the quarter? There's lots of cross-current inflows, outflows by different products and
geographies. So how does it all shake out from an organic revenue perspective and then maybe I'll
sneak in my follow-up at the same time. As we think about the shift from active to passive, how is that
impacting your margins? So you're cutting costs, equity markets have appreciated meaningfully. FX is now
helping. But if we exclude those and just focus on these inflows and outflows and migration to passive and
solutions in your mix, does that end up helping margins? And if so, to what degree is that helping?

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Okay. Let me take your first one around the long-term organic revenue growth. I mean, I guess, that's
not a number we would disclose or think about exactly. But if you think about what you're looking at is
excluding market. And you surely look at the fee rate associated with where interest is, as we point to
every quarter, you continue to see a little bit of mix shift from some of the higher fee products to some of
the lower fee products.

So that is -- that does put pressure on your organic fee growth. No question, without some market
improvement in there, you would see downward pressure there. Our focus then really does shift to
profitability. So I'll come to your second question.

How do we think about the profitability given those dynamics because markets go up and markets go
down, and we've seen the pressure that can put on the top line. As we think about the profitability, and
I'm not sure I'm going to answer your question exactly, I'm not sure I caught all the different puts and
takes you were thinking about there, but I guess I would answer it this way. While the absolute fee rate
of some of our lower fee products would be lower, so take an ETF, for example, in the United States,
the absolute fee rate there would be about half of a U.S.-based mutual fund. That said, the margin
contribution is about the same, very similar because you have lower servicing costs. And so the margin on
both are neutral to positive to our overall firm margins. And it really then becomes a function of volume
because while the margin is the same, the absolute operating income yield would be lower. And so you
have to drive more volume over a lower fee product to contribute the same dollar of operating income that
you would over a higher fee product.

And that's really how we think about it. I mean these are just the facts of our business and the fact of
where demand is and making sure we're positioned to capture all of that demand and then making sure
we're well positioned to maintain our margins at a minimum even in markets where we could be under
pressure.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's super helpful. But I guess part of the core of this, and maybe you can opine on this for
a second. The organic growth -- organic asset growth was like quite good this quarter, like 3.9%. Is that
contributing to revenue? Or is the underlying mix such that even though it was a solid 3.9% asset growth,
is that actually just detracting from revenues? Because it happens to be, EMEA was out, some alts were
out, you've got high fee ETFs, but they're not quite high enough and even 3.9% asset growth isn't enough
to boost revenue growth. I guess that's kind of what I was really hoping to get. And I'm still not sure I
have a sense of that answer.

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

In a quarter like this, the 3.9% organic growth is contributing to revenue. That's -- yes, it's contributing
to revenue. And then obviously, even contributing more as we look at the positive operating leverage

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

that comes from it. But you do get positive contribution. It is -- the high fee, low fee products are not
necessarily always obvious as to what category they're in, and you do see revenue contribution in a
quarter like we just had.

Operator

Our next question is from Bill Katz from Citigroup.

William Raymond Katz
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

So first question is a 2-part question for Allison. And then I have a follow-up for Marty. Allison, can you
just unpack the compensation dynamics between the fourth quarter and the first quarter? Maybe help
us understand what might roll off for the performance fees since they were so elevated and maybe the
seasonal increase if you will, just trying to get to sort of like a level of how to think about maybe the exit
pacing for the second quarter?

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Yes. So I'll do my best to unpack that. I mean if you look at just the performance fees and the
compensation expense that's associated with those, it's going to be kind of closer to 50%. So it comes at
a higher rate than what you would see in terms of the compensation associated with other elements of
revenue. So that's a roll-off.

And then in terms of what would be higher, the seasonality of payroll taxes and some benefits. So that's
somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range. Then you've got the targeted cost saves that will be
in there somewhere. We're not giving specific guidance around that any more so than what I've already
provided. And I think that's probably the best way to think about it.

The one thing that is not totally the same is the run-up in the fourth quarter is what -- we only have
that for, kind of, call it, 6 weeks or so at the end of the quarter. If asset levels hold where they began the
year, and we've certainly seen them hold through thus far into the month, you can expect that revenue
and the associated compensation expense with that would be higher than what you would see in the
fourth quarter, and that's just thinking about the typical relationship between revenue and compensation
expense.

William Raymond Katz
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. And then just you have mentioned in terms of building cash. Where are you in terms of your excess
cash goal?

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Our cash balances at the end of the year were $1.4 billion. We have $764 million of that is committed to
European regulatory and liquidity requirements.

Operator

Our next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.

Patrick Davitt
Autonomous Research LLP

So bond flows have obviously been a bright spot for you and others, but concern around kind of taper
tantrum or even more significant rate shock has grown over the last few weeks. With investors seemingly
particularly worried about how large bond complexes will perform through that. So through that lens,
could you remind us of Invesco's experience in the 2013 tantrum? And maybe compare and contrast how
you feel Invesco is now positioned for another tantrum or even bigger rate shock from here?

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

It's a interesting question. 2013 was a long time ago, but is -- we did fine through it, and I suspect what's
really going to matter, I think, and the question is, where are the concentrations within your fixed income,
if there's something like that. And if you look at the range of fixed income capabilities that we have, it
really is quite broad and a heavy concentration in an area where sort of long duration shock could be quite
painful to the organization. So that's my initial reflection on the question, if that's helpful.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

First one is on ESG. You mentioned that as a potential increase in contributor to '21. If you can talk a
little bit about what you think your ESG dedicated AUM is as of now, I know it's being integrated more
thoroughly throughout the organization. And then talk about how much do you think that can potentially
contribute to your institutional pipeline and whether you see it becoming a bigger factor in the U.S. as
well?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So look, let me start with the bigger question then specific. ESG is something that we're integrating
throughout all our investment management teams, probably most advanced through our capabilities in
EMEA, our fixed income teams, real estate. So we're pretty well into it right now. We're not done. But
that is something that is absolutely a top focus of ours as an organization. The reality is, if you are not
skilled at managing ESG capabilities, even within your traditional asset classes, you really are going to
be challenged in EMEA. I'd say in the United States, it is moving beyond what was a conversation 12, 18
months ago, so being something very, very real, and you're seeing commercial implications of it. And that
is the same thing in Asia Pacific.

Specifically using that more narrow definition that we have, so we have about $34 billion in ESG AUM,
but it's really quite broad. We have about 90 ESG funds or mandates that comes through. And I think the
other area where we're seeing outside of institutional is really picking up on a retail basis. And right now,
we're the second largest provider of ESG ETFs in the United States, and there's about $9 billion in those
assets. So again, more to go. As I said, we have a developed capability, but it's also developing, and we're
really being quite aggressive in the area.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. That's super helpful. And then just a follow-up is on M&A. I guess from 2 different sides, thanks for
the commentary about reiterating the -- your stance on that. From a product perspective, how would you
view adding a beta ETF franchise as opposed to a smart beta suite that you have right now? And then just
in terms of overall stock price that we've seen for the asset managers in the last few years that we had
a peak in early 2018, and very few managers have been able to make it back to that peak. You've tripled
your stock price since the lows of last summer. But I guess, what's your confidence in being able to get
stock back to that peak early 2018 level organically?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

So let me start with the stock price. And again, I have to be careful that you're working up mine. What
drives stock price is operating outcomes and business momentum and as Allison's been talking about
today, you're just seeing a markedly different set of outcomes in the last couple of quarters. As you look
into 2021, again, about getting into forward guidance, it is many more tailwinds behind the organization

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.

15

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

than I've seen since 2018. And it's quite broad, by region and by channel and also within various
capabilities where we pointed out, there's very, very high demand.

Now that said, there's always areas we have where we have areas for improvement. We'll continue to do
that. But again, the tailwinds are very different than what we've seen since the middle of 2018. So from
my perspective, that's going to drive stock price.

With regard to adding a beta provider through M&A, again, I'll just answer the question as I have before,
it all depends on facts and circumstances. It has to be additive to the organization. It can't be something
that is a net negative through the combination. So again, just really depends on the situation.

Operator

And our next question is from Brennan Hawken from UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

The operating metrics in Great Wall look impressive, and thanks for providing the flow. Definitely a big
contributor. But what are the options for your stake with that entity? Marty, I think in the past, you've
referenced getting your ownership above 49%. But I think your last comment on that was a little over a
year ago. So is that still on the table? And what would be the time frame for that? How should we think
about the potential impact of you getting over 50% there?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Good question. So let me answer that in 2 parts. So I think what has been differentiated, which is
important to recall is even at 49%, we uniquely have management control. And so it is really operated
as part of Invesco. So we operate as Invesco in total within Mainland China, and that has helped our
institutional business there for our traditional Invesco and also we go through Invesco Great Wall
institutional also and retail.

So that's really the success is because we've been able to operate as really a single organization there.
With regard to the 49%, it is a conversation we continue to have with one on -- it's obviously slowed
down, I'd say the conversations between the U.S.-China were not helpful in advancing that. So we'll just
have to see. I really can't put a time frame on it. As clarity between the relationship between U.S. and
China, if it eases, I think that will be a net positive.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's fair. I...

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

The bottom line there just, it's not getting in the way of our business success. So I think that's really the
bottom line that I want to make.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Well, that is clear from the results. But thanks for that, Marty. Follow-up is a 2-parter. So first, you've
got some questions so far today and a bunch in the past on M&A and Invesco as a buyer. But just to be
provocative, how should we think about you as a seller? I mean I know you're -- the company is large.
And so the list isn't really long of who could buy you, but there are some large buyers out there talking
pretty vocally about writing checks. So curious about how you would think about that.

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

And I believe you have had -- there's been at least one Board meeting since Nelson Peltz and Ed Garden
joined Board. So could you add maybe some color on what kind of impact that has had on the Board
dynamic and any incremental details about plans or areas of focus for your new Board members?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Good questions. It's a good way to get 3 questions in that too, but very good, you've done this
before. So look, with regard to let's be very, very clear, the Board is absolutely dedicated to drive the
success of this organization. They value Invesco being an independent global asset manager. And again,
the results are, as I said, you can see the momentum, and we anticipate -- we're on a good track. So
that's the first point.

And secondly, within any conversation around M&A, my comments would be very similar to somebody
looking at any money manager. And if it's not strategic, if there's a lot of overlap, if it's inconsistent with
what clients want, it is very hard to do. And so as you say, that would get you to even narrow set of
options, if you consider something like that. So again, the criteria works both ways, and I think that's
important to understand.

And then with regard to the Board, again, we've had a very strong board. And Nelson, Ed and Tom Finke
from Barings have joined. All 3 are very, very talented. Tom was the former CEO of Barings. Nelson
had been around the space for a very long time. They know the space. They obviously are -- been very
outspoken about the opportunities that they see within the asset management space. The dynamic has
been very good. I mean you brought 3 new experts on to the Board. And again, just making sure we as
an organization are laser-focused on providing for clients and shareholders. And with the existing Board
members, I think if anybody owns a stock, they should feel really good about it.

Operator

Our next question is from Mike Carrier from Bank of America.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just one question, just on growth versus value. On the performance charts in the appendix, it looks like
growth performance remains strong, the value continues to be on the weaker side. So just wanted to get
your thoughts if you continue to get a shift towards value, do you have some active products that are
performing well that can benefit from flows versus maybe what we see in that chart, which is just the
average across the full category.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the value-related equity capabilities have been the area of focus for us as an organization. There's
no question about it relative performance. We're absolutely focused on making sure that the portfolios
are in a position to perform. And again, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but if you look at that
value suite during the fourth quarter, the relative performance was really, really quite strong. And that
said, let's be clear, it's a quarter. It's not 1 year, 3 year, 5 years, but it was important to see that within the
fourth quarter.

Operator

Chris, your line is open.

Christopher Meo Harris
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Great. Question on operating margin. You guys have a target in mind for this as you execute on your
expense savings plan? And then related, what do you think is the long-term potential for this business as
it relates to operating margin?

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 26, 2021

Laura Allison Dukes
Senior MD & CFO

Good question. We have not set a targeted operating margin coming out of this. Our focus has really been
to think about the continued dynamics that are really driving client demand and thinking about getting our
business oriented to capture that demand and make sure we're doing so in the most profitable way. And
we continue to see how the trends are playing out. What do I think is long term, I think that's a hard one
to answer because I think we continue to see some of these shifts. We remain committed to our active
capabilities, and we do believe we will continue to see interest there and demand there. And we could see
even more positive growth coming from that. So as client preferences continue to evolve, we're going to
continue to evolve our platform to operate at the highest profitability we can with it.

Operator

And our next question is from Chris Shutler from William Blair.

Christopher Shutler

Marty, what are your thoughts on the potential for direct or custom indexing? And is this a place that
Invesco plans to participate in, if so, how?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Sorry, I didn't get the question. I apologize.

Craig William Siegenthaler
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Sorry about that. Just direct or custom indexing, is that a place Invesco plans to participate?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, we have a self-indexing capability, and it actually has been an area of growing success recently.
We just turned our attention to it a couple of years ago. And where it's really been -- it's with -- through
the solutions group, where we had the greatest success in building unique indexes for clients. So again,
we look at it as a real area going forward and what we're really looking for is just really building that
deeper relevance for our clients, and it's off to a very strong start.

Christopher Shutler

Okay. And then separately, just on the registered investment adviser space, maybe -- or just the financial
adviser space overall. Can you give us an update on Jemstep and TeleFlow and what's been going at those
platforms, how are they growing? And at some -- at what point should we expect those to generate some
meaningful flows for Invesco?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a good question. There's about $900 billion in assets under administration right now. And the
last year has been really focused on pulling together that platform through the last couple of acquisitions.
And so we're looking for this year to be the beginning of some additive growth after a period of just really
building out that platform. So again, we'll have more to say later in the year. But we're hopeful that we're
at that spot right now.
