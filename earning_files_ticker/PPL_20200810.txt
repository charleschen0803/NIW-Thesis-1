PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day and welcome to the PPL Corporation second quarter earnings conference call and webcast.
[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.

Andy Ludwig
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on second quarter 2020
financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation and our earnings release issued earlier
today on the Investors section of our website. Our remarks this morning may contain forward-looking
statements about future operating results or other future events, including today's announcement to
launch a process to sell PPL's U.K. business.

Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of
our presentation and PPL's SEC filings for our discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ
from forward-looking statements. During the call, we will also refer to earnings from ongoing operations, a
non-GAAP measure. For reconciliations to the appropriate GAAP measure, please refer to the appendix of
this presentation and our earnings release.

I'll now turn the call over to Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO.

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be leading my first earnings call as CEO, as
we certainly have a lot to talk about this morning. With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial
Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our
Kentucky utility business; and Phil Swift, who leads WPD, our electric distribution business in the U.K.

Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning's call with comments on today's announcement to initiate a
process to sell our operations in the U.K. Then I'll discuss some quarterly highlights and operational
updates, including our continued strong performance during COVID-19 pandemic and some thoughts
around Ofgem's latest publications on the RIIO-2 process. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of
the second quarter financial update and as always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.

So turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced after completing a comprehensive strategic review with our
Board of Directors, that we are going to initiate a process to sell our U.K. business, WPD. We've engaged
JPMorgan to lead that process for us. The sale would strategically reposition PPL as a purely U.S. utility
holding company, sharpening our focus on rate-regulated assets in the U.S. and improving our ability to
invest in sustainable energy solutions. We expect the proceeds from the sale would be used to strengthen
our balance sheet, and enhance our long-term earnings growth, which could include supporting U.S. asset
acquisitions and returning capital to shareowners.

We believe there are multiple ways in which this transaction will create shareowner value. First, we
strongly believe the sale price, net of any tax, will be higher than the sum of the parts value currently
embedded in PPL stock price. Second, we believe we will have a much stronger balance sheet post sale.
Targeting mid- teens FFO to debt metric. Third, we believe we can target an EPS growth rate more in
line with our U.S. utility peers. And finally, assuming we acquire another U.S. utility, we believe we can
leverage our operational excellence and efficient business model to create even more value for both
customers and shareowners.

PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

We've been very transparent with investors that while we constantly analyze strategic alternatives, we
would not engage in M&A unless we could do it in a way that would create shareholder value. We firmly
believe that the sale of WPD at this time will unlock value for our shareowners. As we've been saying
for a number of years, we believe WPD represents the premier asset group with an extremely high-
performing management team in the best energy subsector in the U.K., i.e., electric distribution. We are
more confident than ever that the road to net-zero carbon emissions in the U.K. will flow through electric
distribution.

And significant investment will be required in that sector, if the U.K. is going to achieve its net-zero goals,
which Ofgem reaffirmed over a week ago in the electric distribution subsector consultation. I expect that
WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during
RIIO-ED2 and well beyond that. As such, the decision to sell WPD is in no way a negative reflection on our
WPD team or the WPD business. In fact, it's quite the opposite. We are extremely proud of the financial
and operational results that WPD has achieved over the past 2 decades, and we are confident they will
continue to deliver in the future.

And while we believe the public market continues to discount the value of WPD and our share price, we
firmly expect that a wide range of strategic and financial buyers will demonstrate significant interest in this
highly attractive asset. There are several recent precedent transactions of regulated networks in the U.K.
and across broader Europe that support our position.

Given the relative attractiveness of electric distribution and the superior quality of the WPD business,
we would expect WPD to attract a premium valuation. We expect to evaluate a variety of offers for the
purchase of WPD, including all cash or a combination of cash and U.S. utility assets. Regarding timing, we
would intend to announce a transaction within the first half of next year. Let me just end by saying the
plan to sell WPD as part of a broader strategic repositioning of the company, which we believe will result
in a new PPL with a stronger balance sheet, a more focused growth strategy in the U.S. and an improved
position to reduce its carbon footprint.

We believe this will lead to a stronger outlook for the company with a competitive TSR and compelling
growth prospects. The dividend has been and will remain an important part of total shareowner return for
PPL investors. There's no change in the dividend as a result of the announcement this morning. The Board
will assess the dividend at the appropriate time in connection with the resulting transaction.

Now let me make some high-level comments on the quarterly results before turning it over to Joe for the
more detailed quarterly review. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings
of $0.45 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were
$0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share a year ago.

Turning to a brief update on the impacts of COVID-19. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver
electricity and natural gas safely and reliably as our customers navigate the challenges of this pandemic.
As we highlighted on our first quarter call, we acted swiftly and aggressively to implement social
distancing and minimize the spread of the virus within our company. This included shifting about 35%
to 40% of our workforce or more than 4,500 employees to work from home, and creating additional
separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their jobs.

With health and safety, our top priority, these steps remain in place today, even as restrictions have
begun to ease in the regions in which we operate. And while we continue to plan for what reentry to the
workplace will look like for those now at home, we plan to move very cautiously and continue to follow
guidance from the CDC and state and local health departments. As a result of the measures we've taken,
we've been very effective in minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce and our operations.

While the most recent tropical storm, Isaias, has impacted about 70,000 of our customers in Pennsylvania,
we were able to restore power to most of them within 24 hours and all of them within 48 hours,
reinforcing, again, little to no impact from COVID-19 on our ability to serve our customers even in the
worst of conditions.

PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

Further, we remain well positioned from a supply chain perspective, and our capital plans remain on track
if we've experienced minimal delays, apart from the early lockdown phase in the U.K.

Finally, from a financial perspective, we've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our
cash receipts have remained steady and minimal impact on our allowance for bad debt.

Turning to a U.K. regulatory update. We've seen some recent developments pertaining to the next
price control period, RIIO-2. First, we were not surprised at all by the recent outcomes of the draft
determinations for gas and transmission published in early July. Ofgem has been very clear about 3
things in their RIIO-2 messaging. They are going to incentivize investment that supports the U.K.'s net-
zero carbon ambitions, they will ensure customer bills remain affordable, and there will be significant
investment required in electric distribution over at least the next decade.

We've said all along that Ofgem was going to deemphasize the gas and transmission sectors in favor of
electric distribution, not because they are picking winners and losers, but because they fundamentally
know the electric distribution networks will require significant investment going forward. In order for
customers to afford that level of investment, they need to build headroom into customer bills, with lower
returns and lower investment levels in gas and transmission. We believe that is why Ofgem has been
so critical of the investment plans of both the gas and transmission subsectors. On average, Ofgem cut
the gas investment plans by about 20% and cut the transmission plans by about 45%. While Ofgem
indicated there would be potential opportunity for some of that investment to be approved in the final
determinations, which will come out later this year, I don't believe Ofgem is going to make it easy on
these sectors.

WPD is in the fortunate position, however, to be able to follow the gas and transmission process through to
the end, prior to us having to submit our business plans mid next year. Therefore, we are expecting that
the RIIO-ED2 process for WPD will be much smoother and more successful.

The sector-specific methodology consultation on electric distribution that was released just over a week
ago was also largely in line with our expectations. Ofgem made it clear that the DNOs were going to
be critical to supporting the decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net-zero economy. And we
continue to agree that we are best positioned to deliver on those objectives. While we are still in the early
stages of this process, WPD is very focused and engaged with our stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure
we deliver a plan that will achieve these goals. We've led the way in RIIO-1 in terms of stakeholder
engagement, and we'll continue to lead in this area as we begin our business planning process towards the
end of this year.

While many of the parameters are still being developed, let me talk a little bit about our expectations
for the electric distribution incentive package. Based on our recent discussions with Ofgem, we expect
the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for the electric
distribution sector, much more significant compared to gas and transmission. In addition to the reliability
and customer incentives we're accustomed to, I would expect to see significant output measures for
low-carbon initiatives, promoting flexibility of the network and other net-zero-related outputs. So while
incentives are not a significant component of the gas and transmission subsector reviews, we absolutely
continue to expect it to be meaningful for ED2.

And finally, regarding our 2020 earnings forecast, while COVID-19 has had an impact on our year-to-date
financial results and we expect it to negatively impact the remainder of the year as well, we continue to
believe the full year impact will be manageable. Therefore, we reiterated our earnings guidance range for
2020 of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with results expected to track towards the lower end of our forecast
range given COVID and unfavorable weather in the first half of the year.

In a positive sign, we began to see a gradual easing of restrictions later in the quarter that dampened
some of the impact we were seeing in April from strict lockdown measures. Residential load continues to
be stronger than planned as a result of the continued work-from-home measures. And while C&I is still
below plan in all 3 business units, it is not as bad as we were originally expecting it to be.

PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

Regarding 2021, we are withdrawing our prior 2021 forecast as a result of today's announcement
regarding the potential sale of the U.K. business, and we will provide an updated 2021 forecast at the
conclusion of the process, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2021.

I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our second quarter segment results on Slide 6.
First, I'd like to highlight that the estimated impact from COVID on our second quarter results was about
$0.06 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue
in Kentucky. As we outlined in our projections on the first quarter call, about 2/3 of the impact or $0.04
per share is recoverable through the U.K. decoupling mechanism on a 2-year lag. I'll discuss further the
impacts of COVID on the quarterly sales volumes in more detail in a few moments.

Turning to the quarterly walk and starting with Q2 2019 ongoing results on the left, we first reflect
adjustments for weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During
the second quarter, we experienced a $0.01 favorable variance due to weather compared to the second
quarter of 2019, primarily in Pennsylvania. Compared to our forecast, weather in the second quarter was
about $0.01 unfavorable variance with stronger load in Pennsylvania being offset by more mild weather
in the U.K. and Kentucky versus normal conditions. In terms of dilution, we saw a $0.03 impact in the
quarter primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts.

Moving to the segment drivers, excluding these items, our U.K. regulated segment earned $0.33 per share
in the second quarter 2020. This represents a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. The decline was
primarily due to lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower other income
due to lower pension income. These decreases were partially offset by higher realized foreign currency
exchange rates compared to the prior period, with Q2 2020 average rates of $1.63 per pound compared
to $1.36 per pound in Q2 2019. I'll note that we layered on additional hedges since our last quarterly call,
and are now hedged at 95% for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.47 per pound. And in
light of today's announcement, we do not plan to add additional earnings hedges to 2021.

Moving to Pennsylvania, we earned $0.15 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results
in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from
returns on additional capital investments in transmission. This increase was partially offset by higher
operation and maintenance expense.

I'll note that our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19, as our positive impact from
our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the
C&I sectors.

Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment. We earned $0.10 per share a $0.03 decrease from our results
1 year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact
of COVID-19 and higher income taxes due to a tax credit recognized in the second quarter of 2019. These
decreases were partially offset by higher retail rates that were effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate
and Other were $0.01 higher compared with a year ago, driven by several factors, none of which were
individually significant.

Turning to Slide 7. We outline the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer
class. As expected and reflected in the financial results, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially
offset by higher demand in the residential space in each of our service territories. In addition, as Vince
pointed out, the reopenings that we observed, primarily in June, substantially reduced the impact on load.
For example, in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, we went from 15% to 20% C&I load declines at the peak of
the lockdowns in April to more modest declines of 8% and 2%, respectively, for the month of June.

In the U.K., we saw some positive momentum as the U.K. government downgraded its alert level
midmonth, although the recovery was more modest, with June demand down about 11% versus the
prior year. I'll note for this slide, the quarterly information presented for the U.K. aligns with our financial

statement presentation on a 1-month lag and shows the period-over-period variances from March, April
and May. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the recovery we've seen in June, which gives us more
comfort in reaffirming the 2020 forecast today, albeit at the lower end of the range. We expect the
annualized load sensitivities by segment that we provided last quarter, will remain as good guide as we
move through the balance of the year. That concludes my prepared remarks.

And I'll turn the call back over to Vince.

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Joe. Let me conclude today's remarks with an outline of some of my key areas of focus for the
company and my excitement for PPL's bright future. As I've mentioned to many of you over the past
few months, I'm extremely proud of our operational excellence at PPL, which is core to our mission of
delivering safe and reliable service at an affordable price. This has been and will continue to be a priority
for the company as it has led to continuous innovation and operational improvements that are driving our
premier customer service and satisfaction levels. One of my goals is to take this culture of operational
excellence and find ways to leverage it to drive additional value for our customers and shareowners.
Another one of my goals is to improve our overall TSR performance and the strategic repositioning
announced this morning as one step in that direction.

I'm sure our decision to launch a sale process for WPD doesn't become as a surprise to investors, given
PPL's stock performance over the past few years. We believe today's announcement creates the best
path forward to improve our TSR by simplifying the business mix, reducing our leverage, improving our
earnings growth rate and enhancing our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions.

Another key area of focus will be to reduce the carbon footprint of the company. We've already
communicated our targets of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 70% by 2040, and at least 80% by 2050.
With the declining cost of renewable energy, we believe there will be a real opportunity to accelerate
decarbonization of our Kentucky fleet under regulatory oversight and with economic benefit for our
customers.

In closing, I'm very excited for the future of PPL. I firmly believe that the company's organic growth
opportunities and strengthened financial flexibility expected from today's announced strategic
repositioning, best position PPL to deliver long-term value to both our shareowners and our customers. We
look forward to providing further updates at the conclusion of the process or as appropriate.
With that, operator, let's open the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

James Kennedy
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

It's actually James for Shar. I guess just sort of following on your comments there, Vince, if we could start
at a high level on the sale process. I mean what gave you and the Board the sense that this is really the
time to do this, kind of why now? Is it the internal management? Is it external factors like post-Brexit,
pre-RIIO-ED2? Kind of what were the factors that went into the decision?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So I think there's been quite a bit of change, actually, right? We've been very transparent with the
market and our investors that while we constantly review strategic options to maximize value, that we
would not engage in M&A unless we thought, right, that it would create value for our shareowners. And
as I said in my prepared remarks, at this point, we believe that the market has shifted and that executing
a sale of WPD will, in fact, create not only immediate value for shareowners, but will set the company up
going forward for longer-term growth with a stronger balance sheet.

In terms of the market backdrop, right, last year, we had the general election in the U.K. Corbyn election
they had failed. Re-nationalization risk is in the rearview mirror. We believe there's been additional clarity
around the RIIO-2 process, primarily for electric distribution, which supports what we've been saying from
the beginning in terms of supporting electric distribution and the road to 0 kind of flowing through that
subsector. So we've gotten some clarity on all that. Unfortunately, that additional clarity really has not
improved our stock price performance, certainly not to the level we would have expected. And in fact, the
discount has widened compared to our peers. So again, the market also on the buy side for these types of
assets is pretty strong right now in Europe. There has been a number of comps that we saw starting with
gas distribution in the U.K., electric distribution in the U.K. and then some other electric assets in broader
Europe that have yielded some very strong results. So we think given the quality of the U.K. business and
the management team and again, the subsector that we're dealing with, we firmly believe that the process
will be successful, and will garner a greater value for WPD and a sale process then will be recognized in
the share price.

James Kennedy
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got you. And then, I guess, could you give us a sense on whether there are any market power concerns
in the U.K.? Would that preclude some of your neighbors from eventually acquiring the systems? And then
are you open to selling the WPD region's piecemeal? Or is it really just a single sale?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I don't want to get into necessarily specifics on who the names that might be interested or the
structures. I think what we've done today with the announcement has created maximum flexibility around
that. So I think you're going to see some creativity on the part of buyers, whether it's cash, a combination
of cash and perhaps assets in the U.S., that certainly we will entertain as those start coming in, and we
will work with JPMorgan on all of that stuff. So at this point, I don't know that market power would be a
top concern. But certainly, we'll deal with that if appropriate.

PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

Got you. And then just one quick one, states side. Can you give us any updates on Project Compass? Is
there any movement there?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

No. That's -- we pretty much stopped working actively on Compass.

James Kennedy
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. Congrats on the announcement.

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Operator

And the next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Congrats on the potential transactions that you said. I wanted to follow up here with a couple of
considerations here. Just wanted to elaborate on your commentary on the script, around dividends and
just reaffirmation therein? I know, today, you guys obviously are about just considerations. And then
secondly, you have some very interesting wording around cash and/or assets, and U.S. utility assets of
that, the extent to which you are not necessarily successful in gaining an asset swap or what have you,
how do you see this leading potentially to a second stage U.S. utility combination as well, just 1 step
versus 2 steps? I'd love to hear your expanded thoughts.

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So on the generic use of proceeds, Julien, maybe let me just talk about how we're kind of thinking
about that. I kind of put it into 4 main buckets, right? The first will be to strengthen the balance sheet,
better position us moving forward. And again, I think, targeting a mid-teens FFO to debt based on our
discussions with the agencies, we think that maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings, where we are
currently coming out of this with a lot more flexibility and levers to pull as we think about future growth of
the company moving forward. So that would kind of the bucket #1.

The second, which is kind of to your point, looking at future long-term earnings growth with investments
in regulated utility assets. As we think about the operating model that we've deployed at PPL and
the efficiency of that model. We think we can acquire some U.S. utility assets, whether it's part of
the consideration coming from the deal or to your point, a potential follow-on and create significant
shareholder and customer value. I'll just use PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania as an example of
what we've been able to accomplish.

Since 2011, we've grown our rate base CAGR in PA by about 12% at the same time, our O&M has grown
less than 1%. And our average PPL Electric Utility rate is about 25% less than the average in the Mid-
Atlantic region. We've improved our customer satisfaction score from J.D. Power by about 20%. And of
course, improved reliability at the same time by about 30%. So the kind of the strategy that underpinned
that was a clear focus on hardening our system as we were making these investments, including advanced
market technology and grid automation, of course, looking at a better integration of distributed energy
resources, including distributed energy resource management system. So the software side of that as well.

And then moving to digital technologies on the IT front has done a lot to actually reduce the O&M and
drive that less than 1% CAGR that I talked about. And so all of that kind of results in our ability to become

10

PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

more efficient, deploy that capital into the network and bring the network into a state that's more flexible,
more automated and more friendly to distributed energy resources and green sources of power.

So we think at this point that we've gotten that model that to a point where we could replicate that. And
so again, if we're able to acquire an asset in the U.S., either through the consideration or a follow-on,
we think that would be another opportunity to create long-term value, again, both for shareholders and
customers.

Kind of the third bucket...

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Let me...

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes? Go ahead.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

No. No. No. Go. Go.

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

The third bucket, just given the strengthening of the balance sheet, we could think about renewables a
bit differently than we do today, which would have a direct impact on reducing our carbon footprint and
enhancing the growth profile, quite frankly, just given the credit metrics that we have today, that hasn't
really been a lever that we've been able to pull in any significant way.

And then return of capital to shareholders would be kind of that fourth bucket. Although I would say our
strong preference is to redeploy the proceeds into U.S. growth assets as opposed to return of capital.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

If I can clarify your U.S. utility as you frame an acquisition, I mean could this be a sale and/or merger of
equals? I just want to understand a little bit of your philosophy. And maybe at the end of the day, what's
your philosophy in terms of EPS accretion of any deal? Just to give you guys the opportunity to clarify.

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, I don't think it's appropriate to speculate on the buy side M&A at this point since we're just
launching the process on the sell-side for WPD. And maybe I'll just comment, Julien, and take a big step
back and make a couple of comments that I recognize that announcing the launch of the process today
as opposed to making this announcement when we have a deal, we recognize that we're not going to
have all the answers to your questions, right? And a lot of your questions may depend on what the actual
transaction is, the proceeds and then the use of those proceeds. But given the amount of questions that
we've gotten from investors and from sell-side over the years, specifically regarding strategic alternatives
for WPD. We just wanted to be transparent with the market and announced the process. It also has
benefits in terms of the process itself. It is common in Europe to announce these types of sale processes
at the time you launch it as opposed to waiting. And so we believe the buyer universe will be those that
-- or will include those that have played in that European market. So having a process that's more into
what they're accustomed to, we think, will help with the process itself. So we think we've just maximized
the flexibility. We think there'll be a lot of interest and just improves the probability that we'll be able to
execute it. So I just wanted to just make a general comment on that. But recognizing that we really don't

have specifics on a transaction or the proceeds or the use of those proceeds. I think it's a bit premature to
speculate on the buy side uses of that -- to your question.

Congrats again. Absolutely look forward to it.

And the next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Vince, so just I guess in the event that you're able to find a transaction that includes U.S. assets,
utility assets from a buyer, could that potentially be like a like-kind exchange treatment for that portion
where you could defer tax or not clear?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Not likely that we would get like-kind exchange treatment, Steve, but we -- one of the issues we've
discussed in the past was just tax leakage on a transaction. And maybe I'll let Joe talk a little bit about
kind of our views on that. So we do think we've identified with ways to minimize that burden, but I don't
think like-kind exchange would be the way to do it. But go ahead, Joe.

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Thanks. So tax has been one of the limiting factors for us previously. And as we've said many times,
this is an area that we would continue to focus on. So as a result of some changes that came about from
the TCJA, we believe that there's some transaction structures that will allow us to offset a significant
portion of the tax burden. So those changes, along with our NOL balance, we believe we're in a much
better position today than we were previously.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Oh, that's good. Okay. Okay. So to a degree, assets might be involved, it would just be because you like
the value of that, it wouldn't have any other real rationale versus cash, I guess? And I guess it's a direct
reinvestment, too, so when it's dilution risk?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean, look, we're going to look at right various different structures and look at maximizing
shareowner return whether that's all cash or a combination of cash and assets -- way too early to tell.
But look, at the end of the day, we are -- the goal here is to maximize shareholder value, but it's also
to set the company up for long-term growth and value for investors as well. So we'll factor all that
in. I think if you look at our track record of M&A, whether it was acquiring Kentucky in 2010 and the
Midlands acquisition in 2011 and then spinning off the Genco in 2015, right, all of those created significant
shareholder value at the time we're done. So we'll deal with this in a very thoughtful way with the Board
and our advisers, and ultimately pick the best structure that optimizes long-term growth and value.

PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

Okay. And then just on the dividend, could you just be maybe a little more clear on the dividend post this
whole transaction? Kind of how you're thinking about that? Is it just something where you'll assess all the
pieces at the time and determine what to do with it? Or just is there any more color you could just give on
that to fill out the picture?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, I just think it's too early, Steve, to get into any specifics on it if there would be an adjustment,
if any, to the dividend. To your point, we'll take a look at all of this at the time we announced the
transaction and then the Board will assess the dividend at that time. But as a result of the announcement
today, we're not adjusting the dividend at all. And that will continue to remain an important part of our
overall TSR, which has always been the case for PPL and will continue. I just think it's too early to get into
really any specific scenarios around the dividend.

The next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Maybe just, Joe, can you go back to the tax basis issue? Sort of if I remember this sort of being a hurdle
to get the deal done. So what exactly -- so with TCJA, you're actually in a much favorable position? And
then I heard you say NOLs, perhaps, were bigger than they were when you evaluated this perhaps maybe
12, 16, 24 months ago. But just can you elaborate any more color on what changed with TCJA?

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Sure. So first of all, the NOL balance really hasn't changed. It's just I think we would, in all likelihood,
be utilizing that NOL balance in the transaction, but we'll have to see ultimately what the transaction is. As
far as the TCJA changes go, as you could -- I'm sure you can appreciate, as with most things tax-related,
it's complicated. It's also very technical, and the reality is it's transaction specific. So given the flexibility
that we're creating and talking about today around the potential transactions, we're not going to get into
specifics on any of the details at this time. I would just say, though, that these are very low-risk strategies
that we found, and so we feel comfortable with our ability to utilize them.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. But...

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Durgesh, this is Vince. I would just say that the tax component of this that Joe talked about is just one
component. I think at the end of the day, when we think about the current market for these types of
assets in Europe and even in the U.K., we just think the after-tax proceeds that we would expect today
are quite a bit higher than we would have 18 to 24 months ago when re-nationalization risk was in the
middle of all the discussion, and Corbyn was in the middle of it all. So I think that while the tax component
is certainly helping, it's the total net after-tax proceeds that we just think is much stronger now than it
was.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. But just to be clear, you still expect a tax leakage. You just think from a tax, specifically, tax
perspective, you're better now versus, let's say, 24 months ago. And you also think the U.K. assets would
fetch you better value here than perhaps 24 -- 16, 24 months ago?

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Correct on both points.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just one last follow-up, Vince. The timing first half of '21, is there -- did you just
officially kickstart the process? Or have you been actively talking to parties? It just seems like you're
pretty confident in that the first half of '21 schedule. Am I reading too much into it?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Well, the regulatory process in the U.K. is much shorter than in the U.S. So getting from announcement
to a deal to close could take as little as 30 to 68, as opposed to what we're accustomed to here in the
U.S. So all we're doing with that kind of first half of '21 commentary is providing enough time. So we
are launching the process today. So we need to do all of the activities that go into actually launching the
process and then likely a couple of rounds of bids and then a couple of months of allotment for approval
time should -- we should be able to get that done through -- between now and the middle of next year.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That's great, Vince. And congratulations on your first earnings call as CEO, and good luck.

Thanks so much.

And the next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Just -- so just to sort of clarify the tax situation. For the most part, it sounds like you plan on offsetting
through a variety of work in terms of structuring the transaction and NOLs that there really won't be any
significant tax leakage. Is that right?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Joe you want to take that?

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Certainly, through the transaction structuring on the NOL, we think we can offset a significant portion,
ultimately, what the resulting tax will be. I think we'll just have to wait and see what the transaction is and
what -- given that we're open to a variety of transaction structures that we'll obviously, where we end up
at the end of the day.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then just you're launching the formal process. Was there an informal process? Have you put
any feelers out? Or anything else that sort of -- or is this pretty much just you're really just starting the
process in general here, there's no -- you haven't had any preliminary discussions or anything?

No, just between us and our advisers, no outreach to do.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then finally, the credit rating for the new entity, assuming the transaction happens and
everything and the -- how should we think about how you guys want to be -- if there's any particularly
change in credit rating metric or credit rating itself, goals or anything, has that changed?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes, go ahead, Joe.

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. No. No changes to those objectives, Paul. We would, as Vince mentioned in his remarks, we would
expect to target FFO to debt in the mid-teens and certainly lowering our holdco debt to total debt
percentage as part of that. So maintaining our current credit ratings and improving the credit metrics is
one of the objectives.

Operator

The next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just curious, can you remind us what's the size of the NOL currently? I'm just trying to think about the
ramifications of an all-cash deal.

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. It's -- at the end of 2019, it was about USD 1.5 billion.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And would you think about it, are there just the time line of that, how do you think about from the time
you make a deal announcement to the time of an actual close? Like what have you seen in the U.K. in
terms of just process-wise from announced deals or closing one?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So when we announced the acquisition of Midlands, Michael, it was 38.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. So you expect a relatively quick close for a buyer. So a potential buyer doesn't have to go 6 to 9
months or so, like you often see in the U.S., if not longer, before being able to close and therefore, have a
role in the RIIO process?

PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

Yes. I think that depends on who the buyer is. But either way, I don't think you're looking at the length of
the process that we're seeing in the U.S.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then last on Kentucky. I've asked on this a bit in prior earnings calls. How do you look at
your Kentucky fleet right now? How much of the coal-generating capacity there? What percent roughly?
Do you think comprised -- is made up of smaller, less kind of uneconomic units that lack economy really
lack economy of scale of the coal fleet.

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I mean, Paul, I think you're on -- I don't know if you have specifics on some of the smaller parts of
the fleet. I mean, I think, for the most part, with the 1,200 megawatts that we've retired, Michael, those
are pretty well out of the fleet. But Paul, any thoughts on that?

Paul W. Thompson
CEO & President of LG&E and KU Energy LLC

Right. I would say, Michael, that the fleet that we have today is larger, more economic, by and large, as
Vince just indicated. Over the last few years, we have retired smaller, older units. And so what we have
today on the margin is very efficient and effective, all in compliance, but obviously, there is a progression
of smaller units existing to larger. And as some of the regulations and economic may change, we'll
continue to look at retiring those at the appropriate time and with the appropriate approvals. But I guess I
would leave you with the thought that today, the fossil fleet is a pretty efficient one.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And how about the regulatory politics of retiring existing coal units and what is still somewhat of a
coal state like Kentucky, and replacing them with either gas or wind.

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean economics are going to drive that. We -- again, we've done 1,200 megawatts over the last
5 years, and have had no issues dealing with the commission and the state on that, but economics is
what drove that. So as we think about -- and this is kind of a follow-on to Paul's comment as we look
at renewables or if there are -- if Biden wins the election and the Senate flips to Democrats. Biden's
plan is calling for net carbon neutral from the power sector by 2035. So that would likely require a more
aggressive coal retirement strategy than what we're currently working under current regulation and
legislation. So I think a lot of things could factor into that, Michael. But for the most part, the commission
has been, again, if there's a regulatory requirement to do it, then we have to do it. Absent that, it's
economics. So Paul, I don't know if you have any additional thoughts on that.

Paul W. Thompson
CEO & President of LG&E and KU Energy LLC

No. I would just reiterate what you're saying. We've had a good process on everything that we've done
heretofore. And so I would expect that to continue as the conditions change for whatever reasons.

PPL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2020

And congratulations on the announcement. I was hoping you could maybe a little bit more specific on the
FFO to debt. We have you, I think, in the 14% to 15% range. Are you looking -- when you say mid-teens,
are you looking to maintain that? Or are you looking for that to go up? And if it's going up by roughly by
how much?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Joe, let's take that.

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Paul, I think it's too early to say. I think the point that we want to make today is that we would target
FFO to debt metric in the mid-teens and we look to maintain our current credit ratings. Our ratings have
been and will continue to be important to us, and we've taken the necessary steps to maintain those
ratings and this transaction would be no different. So I think our current credit ratings, we're happy with
where they are, and we'd be willing to maintain them, and that may include improving our current metric
of it to do so. But we'll have to see what the transaction looks like at the end before we can get into more
details.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And is that because one of the rating agencies, at least, looks at the U.K. business as having lower
business risk than the U.S. utilities?

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Both of the agencies view the U.K. favorably in our credit rating. So selling the U.K., how they view the
stand-alone business, I think we have to have discussions with them about that. And then, of course, what
assets could potentially come along with the transaction would be another factor there. So I just -- I think
at this point, it's really too early to get into details around the specific credit metric other than to say that
we want to maintain our current credit ratings.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And then can you provide what would you consider to be sort of comps? You mentioned sort of generically
what some of the recent comps look like, but can you -- what transactions would you consider to be
similar to yours?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Well, like I said, you have the gas distribution networks that National Grid sold a couple of years ago,
E&W sold within the last couple of years. There's been some other electric distribution networks that have
sold in other parts of Europe, actually more recently than that. So those are kind of the assets that we're
talking about and the businesses, the comps that we're talking about.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And then last question for me. I guess what would you consider to be an appropriate payout on sort of a
U.S.-regulated electric?

Vincent Sorgi

Sorry, are you referring to a dividend payout?

The next question will come from Ryan Levine with Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

To the extent you're looking to return capital to shareholders as a result of this transaction. Can you
comment on preliminary thoughts around efficient ways to return capital to shareholders, buybacks or
special dividends given where the assets are held?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Joe, do you want to take that?

Joseph P. Bergstein
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Ryan, I think, again, it's too early to say how that would play out, although I think today, I'd
say the preference would be buybacks rather than a special dividend, but we'll have to, again, see what it
looks like when we get there.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

And then what is the regulatory process differences that there would be if the U.K. business was
transacted in pieces versus a whole? And is there anything that would prevent PPL from keeping a smaller
part of the U.K. business longer term?

Vincent Sorgi
President, CEO & Director

I mean I would just say that our intention in launching the process is a full exit of the business, so I don't
know that there's anything that would preclude us from owning a part of WPD going forward other than
our intention. We think the -- again, we think the interest level in this business will be high. The market is
hot right now for infrastructure assets. So we think these assets will be in demand. And we do recognize
this will be a large equity check, given the size of the WPD business, but that's where potentially, including
U.S. asset as consideration improves the probability of getting it done because it reduces the amount of
cash that's required. So again, we think just maximum flexibility in kicking this process off just improves
the probability of getting to the end result that we're shooting for, which is a full exit of the business.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Appreciate that. And just one to follow up. To the extent that your intent to sell the entire business, are
there any tax advantages if you were to sell a part as opposed to the whole, given the NOLs and your
legacy assets?

believe this will create shareholder value, not only in the near-term for our shareowners, but sets the
company up for the long term as well with stronger balance sheet, better earnings growth and more
opportunity to deploy capital, whether that's in the clean energy sector or within our utility. So really
