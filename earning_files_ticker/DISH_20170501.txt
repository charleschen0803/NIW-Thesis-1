During the first quarter, DISH completed a transaction with EchoStar which was (01:30)
EchoStar transferred to us certain assets and operations of the EchoStar technologies and EchoStar broadcasting businesses
These businesses and their associated IP design, develop and distribute set-top boxes, provide satellite uplinking services and develop streaming video technologies
In addition, we received investments in high frequency spectrum bonuses, joint ventures such as NagraStar (01:57), certain real estate, as well as the remaining 10% interest in Sling TV
In exchange, we transferred to EchoStar our tracking stock, representing an 80% economic interest in the Hughes residential retail satellite broadband business
We believe that this transaction will give DISH more direct control over the product development of our Pay-TV business, which includes Sling TV and it is projected to be modestly accretive to free cash flow due to the elimination of EchoStar's profit margin as well as other efficiency initiatives
Because the transaction was between entities that are under common control, accounting rules require us to recast our numbers as of the earliest period presented to include the impact of this transaction
The impact of recasting the first quarter of 2016 increased our equipment revenue by $40 million primarily due to international set-top box sales to third-parties
Our next income increased by $10.6 million primarily due to the margin on those international equipment sales and the elimination of the margin on the transferred products and services we previously purchased from EchoStar
To build your financial models, the 2016 recasted income statements by quarter are presented in the MD&A section of our 10-Q
Regarding the balance sheet, the transferred assets were recorded at net book value and the tracking stock was removed with the difference booked (03:32) capital
Also similar to the P&L, we adjusted PP&E and inventory to remove the set-top box and accessories margin which we had previously paid to EchoStar
Separately, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement which Hughes, which allows us to market and install the Hughes broadband service
Hughes will make certain payments to us for each sale and installation
Please note, subscribers acquired under this agreement will be Hughes branded retail subscribers and therefore, will not be included in our broadband subscriber count
As a result, our broadband subscriber count related to the Hughes service will decline through customer attrition
More broadly, with only wholesale economics, we believe this is the right time for us economically and for our Pay-TV customers to pivot away from the wholesale model
A model in which we pay acquisition costs but has significantly lower margins relative to our competitors
For additional information, please see our 10-Q that was filed this morning
With that, Isaac, we will now open up the call for, first, analyst Q&A and then media Q&A
Question-and-Answer Session
Phil, so unfortunately, I can't quantify the litigation impact because these settlements were confidential
I can say that even without the litigation impacts, we would have been down year-over-year on the G&A line
For ARPU, you're right
Sling TV subscribers on average purchase the lower-price programming compared to DBS
So therefore, as Sling TV subscribers increase, the weighted average Pay-TV ARPU will be lower
For DBS, we are seeing some subscribers shift to smaller, less expense packaging, commonly, as you know, known as cord shaving
Seeing that these customers want less robust packages, we did add Flex Pack, which is a skinny bundle option
And while the Flex Pack adds pressure to ARPU growth on the DBS side, we believe the function of Flex Pack as a churn-reducing save tactic increases margins in the instances where we had previously offered customers loyalty credits

Got it
So, Marci, on SAC
On a per subscriber basis, the SAC has been relatively stable if you will, per addition on the underlying DBS ads as well as the Sling ads
It really depends on the mix associated with Sling relative to DBS
Just taking a step back and looking at the strategy
For DBS, we have been saying for several quarters now we are acquiring and retaining higher quality customers by refocusing on worldwide of these
We're more disciplined on credit and we're executing on several costs and revenue initiatives
And as we've already mentioned on the Sling side, we expect to see ARPU and margin expansion as it gains scale
For instance, we haven't fully monetized our Sling addressable advertising revenue opportunity yet
And then lastly, I already mentioned this in my preamble but for dishNET, given the wholesale economics, we believe it's the right time for us economically, which impacts SAC, and for our Pay-TV customers to pivot away from the wholesale model
So you'll see less absolute dollars running through the P&L associated with the dishNET ads, as we pivot away from the wholesale model
