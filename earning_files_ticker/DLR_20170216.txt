Thank you, Bill
Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. Our total bookings for the fourth quarter were approximately $33 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $7.5 million contribution from interconnection
We signed new leases for space and power totaling $25 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $7 million colocation contribution
Our fourth quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win a robust, get profitable demand from a diverse global customer set
Fourth quarter wins included multiple top cloud service providers signing across multiple continents
They also included strong customer demand from several of our other key verticals, including cable and network, a rapidly growing ridesharing company, connected caller applications, IT service providers and a few diverse customers within our financial services vertical
We added a total of 50 new logos during the fourth quarter
The lion's share of these new logos were landed by our colocation and interconnection business which has consistently contributed more than $13 million of bookings every quarter since our acquisition of Telx in late 2015. This consistent performance helps smooth out some of the lumpiness inherent in our traditional large footprint leasing particularly in the hyperscale age
The complementary nature of the colocation and interconnection business with our existing platform was a key part of the strategic rationale for the Telx transaction
That rationale has been proven out over the first year of our stewardship as shown on the M&A scorecard here on page 8. The Telx business generated $99 million of revenue during the fourth quarter, although revenues remain split 50-50 roughly, interconnection continues to outpace colocation with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%
We expect interconnection revenue will grow faster in 2017 than 2016. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $42 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter
We made substantial headways towards realizing the embedded growth potential within the Telx portfolio as evidenced by the 480 basis point pickup in same-store utilization
This successful lease-up enabled us to achieve 99% of our full year 2016 revenue target
Executing on our revenue plan combined with our performance and operational and corporate cost containment enabled us to significantly exceed our full year 2016 cash EBITDA target of $148 million prior to synergies in addition to our $15 million expense synergy target
We also laid the ground work for realization of revenue synergies in 2017 and beyond as we began the process of expanding our colocation and the interconnection footprint across eight markets in North America, representing nearly 7 megawatts of incremental capacity
In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and we look forward to continue progress as we refine our go-to-market strategy, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and across our global Connected Campus network
In terms of the portfolio of eight European data centers we acquired last year, we are likewise well underway towards a smooth integration
We're able to consolidate all the corporate employees from the acquired business into our existing office
And Rob Coupland, who's appointment as Managing Director for the region was announced last September, is now managing one team out of our combined European headquarters on Gracechurch Street in London
We are stabilized and on track with our initial underwriting assumptions
By the end of 2017, we expect to have fully integrated the eight new properties into our portfolio
Turning to our backlog on page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $78 million
The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements reminded healthy at just three months, well below the historical average of approximately six months
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We retained 75% of fourth quarter lease expirations, roughly in line with our historical average, and we signed $47 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed
Cash re-leasing spreads were positive 3.5% for the fourth quarter and positive 2.6% for full year 2016. During the quarter cash re-leasing spreads were positive across all property types, including a solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals
We do still have pockets of above market rents remaining throughout the portfolio, primarily in the Northeast region
So, we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter
On balance, however, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2016, and we expect cash re-leasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations
In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially to 89.4%, primarily due to taking assignment of a colocation reseller customers PBB lease at 350 East Cermak in Chicago, which we discussed on our third quarter call
We are actively negotiating the lease for roughly 25% of the former customer's capacity that will bring us back to breakeven, and we expect to create additional value for our shareholders from lease-up of the rest of this capacity over the next several quarters
You may recall, as part of this transaction, we took ownership of the former customer's data center improvement and infrastructure with an original cost basis of approximately $85 million, and a current fair market value of approximately $30 million
This transaction explains the bulk of the $33 million of other revenue on the face of our P&L this quarter
The gain on this lease termination is included in NAREIT defined FFO, but is excluded from core FFO
dollar continued to strengthen during the fourth quarter, and FX represented a 150 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective
Although our global footprint does expose our reported earnings to currency translation movements, it enables us to satisfy the growing data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we view as a key competitive advantage
Same capital cash NOI growth was flat for the fourth quarter and up 1.4% on a constant currency basis
For the full year, same capital cash NOI growth was a positive 2.7% on a reported basis, and up 3.6% on a constant currency basis
For 2017, same capital cash NOI growth is expected to be similar to full year 2016, both as reported and on a constant currency basis
As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $5.72 for the full-year, an increase of nearly 9% on a reported basis, and up a little over 10% on a constant currency basis
Growth in AFFO per share was better than 20% for the full year, driven by greater cash flow contribution from our core business, accretion from the Telx acquisition, continued burn-off of straight line rent and lower than expected recurring CapEx spend
Our current AFFO payout ratio is sub-70%, and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital, the current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth
As usual, we expect our board of directors will revisit the dividend policy at the February Board Meeting later this month
In 2017, we expect AFFO per share growth to much more closely match FFO per share growth
None of these assumptions underline our 2017 guidance have changed since we provided our initial outlook just over a month ago
And we are reiterating guidance for 2017. Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning with our sources and uses here on page 12. During the fourth quarter, we prepaid $108 million of mortgage debt at a weighted average coupon of a little over 6%
We now have just $3 million of secured debt remaining or well under 1% of total debt outstanding
Subsequent to year-end, we retired the final $50 million tranche of the 5.73% Prudential Unsecured Senior Notes at maturity in January
Our 6.625% Series F of Preferred Stock is callable in April and we expect to fund the $182.5 million redemption by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares, subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May
Aside from the remainder of the forward equity offering and barring any unforeseen acquisition activity, our plan does not contemplate any additional common equity issuance in 2017. Even so, we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA will remain below five times throughout the entire year
We also expect to capitalize on the current strength of the data center investment sales market by continuing to prune our portfolio and selling up to another $200 million of assets this year
In addition, we expect to generate approximately $400 million of cash flow from operations after dividends
Finally, we expect to raise another $500 million of long-term fixed rate financing later this year
As you can see from the bubbles in the map on page 13, we have the most foreign currency exposure to the British pound
Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to further our FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling denominated debt later this year
In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we've also mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing
Over the course of the year, we brought our floating rate debt exposure down by more than a half to a little less than 10% of total debt outstanding at year-end, as shown in the pie charts on the right side of page 14. On the left side of the page 14, it appears that we have – it is apparent that we've also cleared the runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall thereafter
Finally, we reduced leverage from 5.2 times at the end of 2015 to 4.8 times at the end of 2016. Our balance sheet is primed for growth consistent with our long-term financing strategy
This concludes our prepared remarks
And now we will be pleased to take your questions
Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Question-and-Answer Session
And, Jordan, just to add on there, just chime-in for one second
And, I think we had – to be fair, we've had some successful partners in the last quarter, new partner that landed a fairly sizable deal with us in North America, supporting a publicly-listed healthcare company
I think one of the financial elements I think you'll see, and be it – Dan's been here for three months, so don't count on it tomorrow
But an acceleration of sales and revenue on the back – without a commensurate acceleration of sales head count is a way to financially see our results for the partners and channels kind of bearing fruit
So we – on a year-over-year basis, we've – our interconnection revenue, it's grown more than double – just more than double-digit, just because we've added some incremental capacity
But on just a pure same-store basis it's kind of low-teens, outpacing the pure colocation growth
And, well, I would say kind of part and parcel with our expanding the footprint and the opportunities for additional colocation, interconnection opportunities
We expect a modest pickup in that growth, in the revenue on a year-over-year basis
Mike, I'll take – try to take both of those
So, on the balance sheet standpoint, we have a financial strategy of kind of having a balance sheet that's positioned for growth; and we kind of first and foremost target a leverage metric around 5-ish times debt to EBITDA
Now it's gotten – in the past it's been a little bit higher than that, probably up to 5.5 times
Today, we stand kind of a little below that, roughly 4.8 times
We philosophically think for our business mix and being an active developer, that's the right way to run the capitalization of the company
We are also hopeful though of obviously a rising rate environment finally coming to bear
And the way we try to think about protecting against that is one, minimizing our floating rate debt as much as possible
So today we stand, I believe 10% of our debt is floating rate, which is primarily borrowings outstanding under our revolver and that's been literally cut in half over the last year
And two, mitigating our maturity risk, so kind of matching the duration of our cash flows and our assets with long-term fixed rate debt financing
So if you look at our debt maturity schedule, you won't see much of any debt covenant due before 2020. And then thereafter we try to stagger the bars, so that we're not kind of putting any risk on the balance sheet
And those things hold for me as the CFO in a rising rate environment or quite frankly in many different rate environments
Going to your second question, the CapEx spend, the CapEx implied by the guidance at the end of the year relative to where we came out
Quite honestly, probably we're trending sub to the midpoint of that guidance going into the end of the year
It's really a product of timing
We – some projects slipped over into 2017, let's call it maybe a $100 million of that spend is kind of a calendar year slip
We are still seeing that even with that we did have a marked increase in CapEx year-over-year spent from 2015 to 2016 and our 2016 to 2017 midpoint does imply another increase
I think that's a product of two things
We've had a fair bit of success on the scale side of the business, building our campuses, expanding our customer footprint and helping them grow to the various buildings we have on other campuses
And 2017 and onto 2018 is going to have two new more demonstrative markets that they really had no contribution in prior years with Frankfurt, Germany in Europe and Osaka, Japan in Asia
Sure
This quarter the integration costs are more heavily weighted towards the European portfolio
Quite frankly, a large chunk of it is – we hired a consultant firm to kind of help us through the integration process
So we have outside third-party advisors, with that domain expertise across all the multiple functions that touch the combined company
So a large of that is paying consultants to kind of help us facilitate that integration
There maybe a little bit on the Telx side on that, but I would say that's not a larger or a material amount to spend
And in terms of tracking, we've always set budgets at the time of the acquisition and then refresh moving into our 2017 spend
I'd say we're tracking slightly below budget, but overall these are not massive dollar spends in any regards in terms of integration
I think especially as it relates to the European portfolio, where it was really an absorption of their team without tremendous overlap given their colocation interconnection expertise and our scale expertise
So, it's not a huge dollar integration bucket to begin with
Maybe I'll touch on the dividend first
So on the dividend, obviously, as you know, it is ultimately in the board's hands and management will make a recommendation to the board to accept or approve
But as you've seen from the growth in our cash flow and our AFFO, and where our payoff stands today, I think there is a fairly decent chance that the dividend increase will accelerate or be greater than the prior year's dividend increase
While – with the one caveat being this, Colby, that while we're not the developer, I do view retaining capital as an attractive source versus going out to the market
So every dollar I can retain and redeploy into our active development pipeline that we develop to 10 to 12 returns is an accretive use of that capital
So I don't think you'll see our payout ratio move wildly
At the same time, I do think the dividend is going to increase a little bit more this year than last year
When I talk about signings, I mean, we have internal numbers where we have really market-by-market based on what we see the pipeline demand, and how that lines up with our available supply and our timing of bringing new supply coming onboard
We obviously did not give you that – a line item for that in our table, in our guidance, although we do give a fairly robust disclosure
It's something that's a little bit subjective, because as you move through the year, different markets heat up and different markets cool down, and different lines of our business be it scale or colo kind of move in the same degree
So, we're interested in focusing on winning demand at attractive rates to generate profitable returns on our capital
My goal was more and more every quarter, the best I – the most I can
I don't think we have like a specific internal goal we want to share, as in terms of a leasing volume number here on this call
Listen, Colby, what I would say is, listen, we've just finished the fourth quarter
Some of the fourth quarter signs obviously have implications on the rest of how 2017 goes
We're halfway through the first quarter
And right here on this call we're reiterating our guidance that we gave you on January 3. So based on everything we've signed in 4Q, based on everything we know we signed so far in 1Q, we think we're on a signings momentum or velocity that's going to generate that FFO growth you just mentioned
Hey, Vin
This is Andy
I'm pretty sure you're referring to an article that described Dallas as 2016 Chicago
I would say a little bit different dynamic there
It feels like there's more competitors
There's more competitors with supply
At the same time, we've had some pretty good traction recently in terms of signings in that market and pipeline of additional deals in that market
But I have not seen anything that necessarily unlock the flood gate in Dallas
And you can just pull up public disclosure you'll notice that it does have a fairly wide competitive set that we're competing within that market
Sure
So I think that the thing you didn't mention, which is a little bit of anomaly is that the fourth quarter had a 1.4% constant currency growth quarter-over-quarter
I would say it's probably another 100 basis point higher than that due to some anomalies around some tax assessment or refunds I should say that we received in the prior year, which makes for a tough comp
And we did receive some impact from that PBB lease we took back and obviously are re-leasing right now
So it's probably 100 basis points higher than the 1.4% on a constant currency basis
On a full year basis, I think, we're towards the higher end of our initial guidance at 2.7% as reported and 3.6% constant currency, so fairly happy with that
I would say it was a smaller pull this year because we tried to be intellectually honest with how we treated Telx in that analysis
Moving to 2017, I'd say the biggest impact will be including the Telx contribution, will be the pooling that's a lot more meaningful and the larger component of our company
So it will give you a better read through as to same capital look for all more of digital than it did during 2016.
Hey, Jon, this is Andy
So, I don't have a pinpoint on the actual year for those leases
I would say they both probably go back call it 5 to 10 years
I don't think – I mean, as you look through our Turn-Key, which is predominantly larger footprint, longer-term leases, they almost all have some type of annual escalation of call it 2%, 2.5%, 3% over that duration, be it 7 or 10 years
So they've been increasing for many years now
We have not gone to a point where we've had massive spiky uplifts upon the cash mark-to-markets
I think that's a product of being on the scale customer, they're bigger deals, they've had escalations for a longer time period and I don't think we've gotten to the expiration or the extension time for really trough rates yet at least
It feels like it, but I would say that the payments are little bit – the customers will very often come, they want to come and do a long-term extension well before their actual contractual extension
So there is potential for customers to come early to do renewals, but it does feel like what you're looking for maybe a couple of more years out there
Sure, Matt
I would – I mean, I would say the key variables on that range are one of execution rate and it's probably more on the scale side execution and then the colocation interconnection side in our – performance just given the mix of our business, and the stacks of the size of the deals on the scale side, can be – tend to be a lot larger and bigger impactors
And the other thing, I would say, FX, I believe, could have another impact there
And going back several years, you probably wouldn't have heard us talk about this much, but we're living in an environment where the pounds drop from a $1.45 to $1.20, and we have a large piece of our business in the UK, that obviously has a – can create a large headwind to our top line growth
Now, as I mentioned, we hedged that having, new – to couple sterling bond offerings north of $1 billion dollars, there's multi-currency revolver and term loan so that headwind doesn't 100% flow through to our bottom line, but it would – can put some variability into the top line growth
Sure
So, the deliveries you mentioned – sorry, go ahead, Matt
So, the deliveries you mentioned that came out of the pool on the scale side I believe were 88% leased
So, they're almost 90% leased by the time we actually finished the construction of the building
We have a slide in the deck that kind of highlights our three North America core active development markets that did 10 to 15 megawatts per month in the last 12 months of deliveries and those are all kind of 88 to 94 or so percent leased upon the time we opened up
You are correct, the active development pipeline has increased a fair bit
I think it's a roughly $250-ish million versus the prior quarter in terms of total projects
That includes some of those – I mean obviously we've been increasing with our global footprint expanding in Europe and Asia
Some colo projects which are a little smaller dollars have been added to the list
Those typically obviously did not have much preleasing before they open up
I think we feel pretty confident on bringing those on in time at attractive cost to us and be able to lease a significant share up by the time we open the doors
Many of those projects actually are like the last buildings on some of our major campuses, be it the K building or H building down in Ashburn before we move on to the next parcel of land; or the 9377 building in Chicago
So, we're kind of rounding out some of our large campuses and now having to move to the next door property for our next phase of growth
And in that case, that's often customers that have already been in our building, wanting to really stack up that last piece of inventory so that their engineers don't even have to cross the road even though it's a short distance
So, I think we feel pretty good about that
At the same time, if you would stop all the – stop the music and everyone has to find a chair, I think our committed spend on that pipeline, meaning the spend we have to spend or would be in default on is about $190 million
So, it's 0.2, 3.3 turns of EBITDA and we can easily address it with our revolver that's got $200 million outstanding
You want me to start or you want to go?
So maybe I'll just touch on Telx holistically and kind of a year-end checkup kind of thing and then I'll let Scott talk to kind of risk adjusted returns, whether – from an investment kind of hat
I mean, obviously, Jordan, or maybe not obviously, I think we're pretty proud of what I call successful acquisition financing and more – most of the integration
I mean, we've navigated a substantial re-org that generates significant expense synergies
We either met or exceeded our underwriting targets, we've unified the team under one Digital Realty brand and we also leveraged some new found expertise and adopted market-leading customer portal
And then, on the new future, I think, we're generating revenue synergies with the footprint expansion to markets like Ashburn, Richardson and also just growing the footprint some of our gateways be it Chicago or LA or Phoenix
So, all-in-all I think we're on track
And I think it's been a fruitful, I mean, a good overall experience
And I think we're building momentum that's going to bear fruit into 2017 and beyond
