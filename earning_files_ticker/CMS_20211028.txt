CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the CMS Energy Third Quarter 2021 results. The earnings
release issued earlier today, and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's
website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded.

[Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call beginning today
at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through November 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is
available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance
and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Srikanth Maddipati
VP of IR & Finance and Treasurer

Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick
Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer.

This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please
refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of
these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted
on our website.

Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share we've delivered
another strong quarter and continue to be ahead of plan for the year. I'll walk through the specifics in
a moment, but I couldn't be more pleased with the strong execution demonstrated by the team, both
operationally and financially. We continue to deliver every day for our customers, coworkers and for you,
our investors.

Earlier this month, we completed the sale of EnerBank, grossing over $1 billion in proceeds. I want to
thank the entire team that brought this to close. The sale of the bank simplifies and focuses our business
model squarely on energy, primarily the regulated utility, an important step as we continue to lead the
clean energy transformation.

The proceeds from this sale will fund key initiatives in our utility business related to safety, reliability,
resiliency and our clean energy transformation. As shared in previous calls, we have eliminated our equity
needs from 2022 through 2024. Furthermore, Rejji will highlight in his prepared remarks while we have
continued to reduce this year's equity needs as well. The keyword there, continued.

As we double down on the clean energy transformation, I'm also pleased to share that we received
approval for our Voluntary Green Pricing program, which would add an additional 1,000 megawatts of
owned renewable generation to our growing renewable portfolio. This program is in high demand and
currently oversubscribed. And more importantly, it's what our customers are asking for, an important step
in offering renewable energy solutions for our customers.

As we prepare for the grid of the future, we have a highly visible and detailed capital plans outlined in our
recently filed electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. This plan provides a 5-year view of the

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

projects down to the circuit level where we plan to invest to ensure the reliability and resiliency of our
electric infrastructure and aligns with our operational and financial plans.

As always, we balance these investments with customer affordability. Our prices remain competitive as the
average residential customer pays about $2 a day to heat their home and $4 a day to keep the lights on.
And because we know our most vulnerable customers still struggle, our team has mobilized resources at
the state and federal levels to ensure their protection.

In fact, as we approach the winter heating season, our 90-day arrears are back to prepandemic levels
with an 80% reduction in our uncollectible accounts. Our commitment to identifying and eliminating waste
means that we keep our prices affordable. This commitment is evident in our results. In the first 9 months
of this year, we surpassed our full year cost reduction target of more than $40 million. The CE Way is in
our DNA, and we continue to deliver savings in the near term and well into the future.

Speaking of the future, this year, we grew our EV program with PowerMIFleet. This is part of our long-term
planning in collaboration with Michigan businesses, governments and school systems looking to electrify
their vehicle fleets. Within just a few months of the program introduction, we were working with nearly 20
different customers on their fleets and have another 50 who have indicated interest in the next tranche,
exceeding our expectations. This is an important contribution to our long-term sales growth.

And finally, one of my favorites which speaks to our culture, our coworkers and our ability to attract the
best talent. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be recognized nationwide
and most recently by Forbes, where we were ranked the #1 utility in the U.S. for both America's best
employers for women and #1 for diversity, delivering excellence every day continues to position the
business for sustainable long-term growth.

Strong execution leads to strong results. but 2 are linked. One drives the other. In early August, we
experienced one of the worst storms in our company's history. Our team established and into command
structure to deploy resources and took decisive action to restore customers. We had a record number of
crews on our system. The speed of our response led to the highest positive customer sentiment we have
ever received during a major storm. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank all our coworkers who
responded to the call.

During the storm, we had more than 3,700 members of our team working around the clock to safely
restore customers. Like we do every year, through storms, pandemics, and on seasonal weather, we
continue to deliver. And when there's upside, we reinvest. This is the CMS model of responding to
changing conditions that allows us to deliver consistently year after year.

Year-to-date, we've delivered ahead of plan with adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 for continuing
operations. Our strong performance, coupled with the completion of the EnerBank transaction and the
financial flexibility that provides -- gives us further confidence in our ability to meet our full year guidance,
which we've raised to $2.63 to $2.65 from $2.61 to $2.65 for continuing operations.

For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. And our
continued strong performance in 2021 builds momentum for 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we are
committed to growing our adjusted EPS toward the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range as we
highlighted on our Q2 call. As previously stated, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022 and
beyond. That's what you expect, why you own us, and we know it's a big part of our value. As we move
forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about
60% over time.

Many of you have asked about gas prices and the impact on our business and more importantly, our
customers. Let me tell you about our gas business. We have one of the largest storage field in the U.S.
and compressing resources to match. That is a significant advantage. We started putting natural gas
into our storage field in April and continued throughout the summer when natural gas prices were low.
Right now, our fields are full and ready to deliver for our customers' heating needs throughout the winter
months.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Most of the gas is already locked in at just under $3 per thousand cubic feet, which is well below current
levels in the spot market and offers tremendous customer value. Given the operational certainty of storage
as well as the financial protection of a pass-through clause, our customers stay safe and warm all winter
long and have affordable bills. Heat in Michigan is not an option. And we don't leave it up to the market.
We buy, store and deliver. That's what we do.

Michigan's strong regulatory construct is known across the industry as one of the best. It includes the
integrated resource plan process, which is a result of legislation designed to ensure timely recovery of the
necessary investments to advance safe, reliable and clean energy in our state. Michigan's forward-looking
test years and 3-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process gives visibility on our future growth. It
enables the company and the commission to align on long-term generation supply planning and provide
certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation.

Here's what I like about our recently filed IRP. There is a win in it for everyone. It is a remarkable plan
that addresses many of the interests of our stakeholders and ensure supply reliability. It reduces costs
and it delivers industry-leading carbon emission reductions. It's clean. We continue to have constructive
dialogue with the staff and other stakeholders, and we anticipate seeing their positions later today.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to offer the details of another strong
quarter of financial performance at CMS, as a result of solid execution across the company. As a brief
reminder, throughout our materials, we report the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued
operations thereby removing it as a reportable segment in reporting our quarterly and year-to-date results
from continuing operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Now on to the results. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $156 million or $0.54 per
share. The key drivers for the quarter were higher service restoration expenses, attributable to the August
storms that Garrick mentioned and planned increases in other operating and maintenance expenses in
support of key customer and operational initiatives. These sources of negative variance for the quarter
were partially offset by favorable weather, the continued recovery of commercial and industrial sales in our
electric business and higher rate relief net of investment-related expenses.

Year-to-date, we've delivered adjusted net income of $628 million or $2.18 per share, which is up $0.19
per share versus the first 9 months of 2020, exclusive of EnerBank's financial performance. All in, we
continue to trend ahead of plan and have substantial financial flexibility heading into the fourth quarter.

The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial
performance versus 2020. For the first 9 months of the year, rate relief continues to be the primary driver
of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.45 per share given the constructive regulatory
outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses.

As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation and
amortization, property taxes and funding costs at the utility. This upside has been partially offset by the
aforementioned storms in the quarter, which drove $0.16 per share of negative variance versus the third
quarter of 2020 and $0.11 per share of downside on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in
2020.

To round out the customer initiatives bucket, planned increases in our operating and maintenance
expenses to fund safety, reliability and decarbonization initiatives added the balance of spend for the first
9 months of the year, which, in addition to the August storm activity, added $0.35 per share of negative
variance versus the comparable period in 2020.

As a reminder, these cost categories are still net of cost savings realized to date, which as Garrick
mentioned, have already exceeded our target for the year with more upside to come. To close out our
year-to-date performance, we also benefited from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

$0.07 per share and another $0.02 per share of upside, largely driven by recovering commercial and
industrial load.

As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path for delivering on
our EPS guidance range, which has been revised upward to $2.63 to $2.65 per share, as Garrick noted. As
we look ahead, we continue to plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.06 per share of
positive variance, given the absence of the unfavorable weather experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We'll also continue to benefit from the residual impact of our 2020 rate orders, which equates to $0.07 per
share and is not subject to any further MPSC actions. And we'll make steady progress on our operational
and customer-related initiatives which are forecasted to have a financial impact of roughly $0.07 per share
of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020.

Lastly, we'll assume the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales assumptions and our nonutility
segment performance. All in, we are pleased with our strong execution to date in 2021 and are well
positioned for the remainder of the year.

Turning to Slide 9. I'm pleased to highlight that this year's financing plan has been completed ahead of
schedule. In the third quarter, we issued $300 million of first mortgage bonds at a coupon rate of 2.65%,
one of the lowest rates ever achieved at Consumers Energy. We also remarketed $35 million of tax-
exempt revenue bonds earlier this month at a rate of under 1% through 2026.

Due to the strong execution implied by these record-setting issuances coupled with the EnerBank sale,
which provided approximately $60 million of upside relative to the sale price announced at signing, we
now have the flexibility to reduce our equity needs for the year even further, which will now be limited to
the $57 million of equity forwards we have already contracted.

And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A.

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach
going forward. It is -- it's grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders, enables us
to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. As we've highlighted today, we've executed on our
commitment to the triple bottom line through the first 9 months of the year. We're pleased to have
delivered strong results. We're positioned well to continue that momentum into the last 3 months of the
year as we move past the sale of the bank and continue progress to the IRP process. This is an exciting
time at CMS Energy. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Constantine Lednev
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

It's actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on a challenging but successful quarter. I have a quick
question on the cadence of the long-term growth that you reiterated today. So the '22 guidance implies
top of the range performance, as you mentioned, and kind of you expect to execute at the high end. And
one of the opportunities, obviously, the IRP, but that may take some time for approval or execution.

Just -- does the 8% growth imply some incremental CapEx for the prior plan or any kind of financing
items? And is there any change to the glide path or timing for the offset of kind of the near-term dilution
from the business optimizations?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Well, let me tag team this with Rejji, but here's what I'll offer and here's what you should hear from this
call. High confidence in 2021 and that momentum carries into 2022. And we reaffirmed our guidance for
that time period, $2.85 to $2.87. And as we said in previous calls, when I look out at office 2022 base,
it continues to be at this growth rate of 6% to 8%, and I would expect us to be towards the high end of
that.

Now you know we plan conservatively. And in Q4, we'll provide our capital plan. We expect that capital
plan to grow with the things you would be familiar with, the gas system, the electric system and the
supply system. However, the IRP, and particularly the Covert plan in 2023 and the dig assets in 2025
are upside to that plan. And once we have complete certainty on that IRP process, those provide the
opportunity for upside to the plan.

And so I mean that's the -- there's a great deal of confidence that I have about our -- this 5-year window.
When I look at from 2021 through 2025. But certainly, Rejji jump in to add some additional context.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Garrick, I think you laid it out well. And Constantine, the only thing I would add just to give you a bit
more specifics around the numbers, so our current plan that we're executing on for 5 years or '21 through
2025, it's about $13.2 billion. We have not changed that, but we are assuming that we'll increase that by
about $1 billion next year and the next vintage, into Garrick's comments. That does not presuppose any
outcome for the IRP, and there's about $1.3 billion of additional capital investment opportunities that is on
the outside looking in, which just gives us more confidence in the plan.

We also are not planning to issue equity. And so there's a funding efficiency that will also be accretive
to our financial performance as we see it. And what's also not in the plan from a capital investment
perspective that Garrick offered in his prepared remarks, was a voluntary Green Pricing program that we
got approval on, which offers about a gigawatt of capital investment opportunities, specifically renewable
spend that we would own from '24 through '27. And so all of that's in the outside looking in. So you can
see why we have great confidence in our ability to deliver towards that high end off of the 2022 base.

Constantine Lednev
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Perfect. I think that's very comprehensive. And maybe just shifting to the regulatory process for a bit. Just
on the IRP, can you talk about how you're building kind of some of the stakeholder comfort with the kind
of asset retirement and reg acid treatment and the kind of the mechanisms that you're proposing? And

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

does any of the thinking changed around the generation portfolio in light of the commodity shifts that we
have seen?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Offer this one -- and then just credit to the team here at Consumers Energy and CMS Energy, there's been
an extensive stakeholder process and engagement with staff, with interveners, with the public that's led
up to the filing and has continued through the filing process. And so I feel really confident about -- the
messages and the testimony are strong and solid and will yield really good outcomes.

But in my prepared remarks, I said there's a win in this for everyone, and I really believe that. When you
look at this plan, our 2018-2019 IRP was a great plan. This is even better. The resiliency and reliability of
our electric supply, we've done the modeling, it's more reliable plan than the past. It's more affordable.
$650 million of savings in this plan over the previous plan. And we cut carbon emissions by 60% by 2025,
well ahead of the Paris accord, the equivalent of taking 12.5 million cars off the road.

And from my standpoint here in the regulatory asset treatment, as I shared in the Q2 call, great
testimony, and I think we're going to have a constructive dialogue and certainly a supportive dialogue,
we'll see this afternoon in the intervenor comments. And so -- there is a win in here for everyone. And
when there's a win in there for everyone, there's a great path to a great outcome. And I believe that we
saw that in 2018 and 2019. And so I'm looking forward to seeing staff and intervener's testimony this
afternoon. It's going to be supportive. It will be balanced. It will be constructive and where there are
differences, we've done that before. And just look at our 2018, 2019 IRP. I feel good about where we're at
in the process.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just want to pick up on the CapEx side here. And I just wanted to see how you're thinking about grid
hardening investments at this point. And specifically, do you think in reaction to the storms this summer,
we could kind of see more movement on this side?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Let me offer this. As I shared in my prepared remarks, we had a great response during the storm. And
I'll be really clear, the fact pattern of storms has been different across the state. We've had one major
storm. But if you stand back and look at the big picture and look forward from a strategy perspective,
there certainly is a call for greater resiliency and grid hardening. And that's an opportunity, opportunity
from an investment perspective and an opportunity to create greater value for our customers. And so I
think there's a couple of things driving that.

One, we're seeing more severe weather, not just in Michigan, but across the U.S. And so that is certainly a
driver in the equation. And then two, when we think about this transition to electric vehicles and be able to
support those vehicles, not only do we need the capacity out there to be able to do that. But also, we want
to ensure that when we do have an interruption in service. Today, it's just the refrigerator. Tomorrow, it's
the refrigerator and the EV and their ability to get to work. That's a whole new standard of performance.
And so again, big picture perspective, looking at towards the future, I see this as an opportunity and an
inflection point where we spend more time on thinking about resiliency and grid hardening.

I'll share one last point on this. I've had the opportunity, post-storm, to talk with the governor to talk with
the chair scripts. And I can't speak for them, but certainly a positive direction when we talked about how
do we design the grid for the future with climate change and with severe weather in mind. And so again,
it's an opportunity for investors and an opportunity to create additional value for our customers.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe just thinking about load as we exit the pandemic here. Just
wondering if you could provide thoughts I guess, as far as trends by class. And really, on the residential
side, how you're seeing, I guess, stickiness there? And just any thoughts that you could share on that
side.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Jeremy, this is Rejji. I can offer some color there. And we do have a slide in our appendix of the
presentation, which is helpful. Slide 13. I'll point you to also the detailed 15-page digest also. It has some
good content and load. But what I can say at a very high level is we continue to be encouraged by the
residential weather-normalized load we're seeing.

So you probably saw year-to-date down roughly 2%, but that certainly compares favorable to plan where
we assumed a more aggressive return to facilities for workers. And so we do think that this sort of hybrid
format or mass teleworking trend should carry on and potentially be part of a new normal. And so in our
budget, we had much more bearish expectations.

This year, we actually thought there'd be a quicker recovery and you see this down 2%. That's in excess
of plan. And so we see performance to the upside there. And then we also compare it to the prepandemic
level. And relative to 2019, we're up about 2.5%. And so we do think there's a very nice bit of resiliency
to the residential load. And again, it offers a higher margin relative to the other customer classes as you
know.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Insoo Kim at Goldman Sachs.

Tingjia Yuan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

It's Rebecca on for Insoo. So for the ALJ decision on your rate case, it was roughly 25% of your requested
revenue increase. So can you describe which items constitute the difference? And then if this gets
adopted, would this impact your '22 and '23 growth trajectory?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll offer this. I really view this PFD from the ALJ as a bookend. And Michigan's constructive
regulatory environment and this commission and previous commissions have really shown a balanced
and constructive approach. And I can't speak for the commissioners, but my interaction with the
commissioners would suggest this, that they believe and support healthy utilities, good outcomes from
electric and gas rate cases. And when you have those and similar goals, it leads to good outcomes. And so
I view we're going to get an outcome in this electric order that's in December, that's both constructive and
balanced, good for Michigan's residents, Michigan -- our customers, and frankly, good for CMS Energy. But
Rejji, do you want to just jump into some of the differences.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Rebecca, thanks for the question. And so what I would add there is you do have a few sources or, I'll
say, buckets of variants that lead to that delta between what we requested and where the PFD ended up.
And so I would say cost of capital is a component. So we asked for a 10.5% ROE. The ALJ was at [ 9.7 ].
And so that makes up a good portion of the difference. Also, you see a difference in equity thickness. And
so we were at 52% equity relative to debt. And the PFD was about 1 point lower than that, I call it, 51%
and change.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

And so those are the primary sources of difference. There also were differences in opinion on the capital
required to really strengthen and harden the system. And so I think -- if memory serves me, there's about
$0.25 billion of capital investments that we were proposing for resiliency and reliability, which obviously
we think is critically important, particularly on the heels of the August storm activity we saw. And we saw
that also as a recommended disallowance of future spend. And so I'd say those are the major buckets
there. And I think once you normalize for the prevailing ROE and equity thickness, you start to tighten
that gap, but it's primarily to those buckets.

Tingjia Yuan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then for the EDIIP, how much of that is in your 5-year base plan? And would that be
incremental to your rate base or earnings growth?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

I'm sorry, I missed the first part. You said for your what?

Tingjia Yuan
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

EDIIP filing. Is that in your 5-year base plan.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the $4 billion, that does a lot of capital, to be clear, the $4 billion of capital attributable to the
EDIIP and for everyone else out there, it's the Electric Distribution Infrastructure Investment Plan. That
does align -- with the spend rate we've been on for some time. And so in our current 5-year capital
plan of $13.2 billion, about $5.5 billion of that is attributable to electric distribution. And so we're on the
sort of run rate of over $1 billion a year -- $1 billion per year of capital investment, and we think that's
appropriate to balance resilience, reliability as well as affordability. And so that's effectively what this
EDIIP proposes.

Operator

Our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research.

Jonathan Philip Arnold

Could you just -- Rejji, you mentioned on the roll forward of the capital plan, you would -- it was probably
about $1 billion associated with that. Could you just -- is that the Voluntary Green Pricing being rolled in?
Is it something else? Is that -- would the VGP be incremental? Maybe a little more color on that comment?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure, Jonathan. So to be clear, the $1 billion that we'll likely add to our next 5-year plan from 2022
to 2026, that does not include the VGP and the opportunity there for that gigawatt of renewables, nor
does it include any of the potential capital investment opportunity associated with the IRP. What it will
likely entail is, as you may recall, we had -- when we rolled out our 10-year plan, in say, the back half
of 2019, if memory serves me, we said we had about $3 billion to $4 billion of upside capital investment
opportunities, which were not part of that 10-year, $25 billion plan, and it largely had to do with electric
and gas infrastructure modernization.

And so those will be the likely components that are added to the capital plan going forward and represent
that, call it, roughly $1 billion of upside. I also think we're going to obviously roll forward our IRP-related
solar investments that are part of just the existing IRP that we're executing on. So you'll probably see

some of that come into the plan as well as we add another year to our 5-year rolling CapEx plan. Is that
helpful?

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes. Very helpful, Rejji. So said another way, that $3 billion to $4 billion is still there despite the VGP and
the IRP.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

That's exactly right.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then can I just push -- you mentioned that the VGP is already oversubscribed. Give us any
flavor of sort of by how much? And what's the pathway to potentially expanding that?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'd offer this, one, some of those are nondisclosure agreements, but just some public
announcements. On Earth Day of this year, I was with the governor, and we announced that we're
supporting the state facilities and then move to renewable energy. So that's an example.

I'll share with you that I was with a large customer just yesterday, a global company, and they were
looking at their large manufacturing facilities here in Michigan and looking at renewable type options.
And so -- we're seeing a definite directional -- a direction in terms of sustainability among our large
industrial customers, and this serves their needs. And so I'm not going to get into how much or from
an oversubscription standpoint. But hopefully, those examples provide some color on the context of
opportunity there.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

And Jonathan, the only thing I would add is if the spirit of your question is whether there will be sufficient
demand for that gigawatt of opportunity, we certainly feel very confident that there will be requisite
demand to meet the gigawatt of opportunities for the Voluntary Green program...

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

No, the spirit of the question was a bit more, if you're oversubscribed, how you -- then you need to add to
it in order to keep having those conversations?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

And as we see it, that's what the Voluntary Green program would offer up, about a gigawatt of additional
capacity that we would own in the form of most likely [ solar ] rebuild.

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

So at this point -- I mean, to answer your question, Jonathan, at this point, we don't need to add to it.
There's some runway there, and we'd look to construct these renewable assets in the '24 to '27 timeline.
So it's oversubscribed from what we have right now, and this will make up a good portion of that 1,000
megawatts, but there's more room to grow there.

Our next question today comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Sorry to put you on the spot a little bit here, but just seeing some of these filings start to come in on the
IRP. It looks like some of the environmental parties pushing back on the gas plant additions. I guess is
that surprising to you guys at all and ways to kind of come to some sort of agreement with them, path
forward? Any thoughts there?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

I would offer this. When I say there's a win in there forever one, it's clear that the environmental
community loves the fact that we're eliminating coal and would like natural gas, not to be the substitute.
But here's what we know that the only way that you can deliver the resiliency and the supply side of the
business and make sure we don't have an interruption in service like it was evident in Texas is to have
natural gas as part of the solution.

And so -- like I said, the staff and other interveners are certainly mindful of the resiliency and the
importance of natural gas within the state. So there's a lot of give and take within these. And I would just
offer this in 2018 and in 2019, we had a lot of different points of view from an intervenor perspective, and
we settled that case. And so differences are expected, and we worked through those, just like we have
done, and we have a track record of doing that.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Makes sense. And yes, just sticking with the IRP, the other key focus area, I think you touched on a little
was the regulatory asset treatment. Any parties in particular, you would expect to maybe push back on
that initially as we start to see the testimony?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Again, I would offer this, and I've said this on the Q2 call and then in other settings. This is an integrated
resource plan, and it's not a buffet. We've put together a great plan for Michigan. There is a win in it for
everyone. And so we've been really clear about the need for recovery of, and on the asset. And so going
forward, I mean, that's part of the plan. And we've got testimony to support that. And as I stated earlier,
when there's a win in there for everyone, there's a path to a good order and a good outcome. And so --
and where there's differences, we've shown, we have the ability to work with everyone. And so again, I
just see a nice positive outcome here next year in 2022.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just in brief here, if we can talk about the supportive commentary you brought up a moment ago
around the testimony here. Can you elaborate a little bit of -- specifically what your expectations are
this afternoon and perhaps more specifically, as you stated, supportive, I imagine that you see perhaps
latitude towards the settlement here. I just want to make sure I'm equating one towards the other, right? I
mean in terms of what this translates to next, in terms of order?

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Well, I would offer this. I mean I don't have a visibility into the testimony until it's published. And so I
mean, obviously, we had a great discussion with a number of the intervenors. We know some of their
points of view where there might be good support and where there might be small differences.

And so again, I would reflect on it this way. Again, we've done this in the past many times on rate cases
and the like, and we've certainly done this with an IRP. Where there's differences, we find a way to work
through those. And again, I think this afternoon, we're going to see -- and I look forward to reading it, I
think we're going to see supportive comments in general. And so again, when there's a win in there for
everyone, there's a path to a successful outcome.

Now I don't know if it's going to go down the path of settlement or we'll take it to the full order, but again,
when there's a win there, there's an opportunity for success. And that's what I'm confident about.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Excellent. All right. And then just coming back to the rate case a little bit here, given the discrepancy
between the ALJ and the staff, does that reform your strategy heading into your next filing here in Q1 at
all? I mean, obviously, there's some specific deltas there that you alluded to a moment ago, Rejji, but can
you elaborate a little bit more and maybe how you move forward, especially in the next cases, if there's
anything yet?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

This is a constructive regulatory environment. Julien, you know that. I know that. And I really see this PFD
as a book end, as I stated earlier. And so the conversations that we have with staff and outside of cases is
really how do we continue to ensure a safe and reliable natural gas system, how do we ensure and bring
clean energy to Michigan, how do we ensure the reliability and resiliency in electric grid. And so those are
in line with our goals and what we want to do as well. And so we'll continue to be thoughtful about that
process to make sure we balance customers' affordability with that. But I don't see any real change in
plans as a result of specific ALJ, PFD at all.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

And Julien, this is...

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. No, I appreciate your -- go for it.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Julien, this is Rejji. The only thing I would add is, at the end of the day, it also speaks to just the benefit
of the Michigan regulatory construct and the legislation in that. In the event, there is a misalignment,
because ultimately, at the end of the day, the commission's order will dictate where we end up. But in
the event there is a misalignment, there's a forward-looking test year. And so obviously, we have not
incurred the expenses on the capital or the O&M side. And so if we see a misalignment in terms of where
we'd like to go versus where the commission ends up then we can toggle the capital and spend program
accordingly. So again, it just speaks to the constructive nature, not just the decisions we've seen in the
past but also the rate construct and the legislation itself.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Excellent. Yes, I hear you. Book end is the keyword here.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

And the next question today comes from Travis Miller at Morningstar.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I have 2 questions going back to the storms. First one is, in your discussions that you referenced with
regulators, the governor, either within or outside of the rate case, has there been any talk in addition to
some of the public comments about fines or penalties or other kinds of pushback on the storm response.
That's my first question.

And then the second question was the $0.16. Can you kind of break that down in terms of how you offset
that to stay on track with the guidance for this year?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Well, we'll 2 part this one between -- I'll let Rejji take the second question and I'll take the first piece.
I would offer this, one, again, conversation with the Governor's office and with Chair scripts have been
constructive. And again, I don't want to speak for the chair, but I would offer this, the commission has
been supportive of both our electric reliability spend as of recent, the capital investments as well as
increased forestry spend. We increased our forestry spend this year by a little over 60%. And that was
supported through a rate case process by the commission. And the commissioners understand that
we're in the first year of that. The #1 cause for outages is tree trimming. And we have a very aggressive
program now in place, which will benefit our customers.

And so our commissioners, I believe, understand that we're in the early years of these larger investments
and operational maintenance expense, which will help our customers. And so I think there's full
recognition of that. I have not heard any talk at all, 0 from the Governor's office or from the commission
on any sort of penalties associated with the storms in August.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

And Travis, the only thing I would add is with respect to the $0.16 of negative variance that I noted in my
prepared remarks for Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year, it was, in large part, offset as a result of just
good weather we saw throughout the quarter. It was quite warm in the month of August, and that offset
a lot of the incremental service restoration costs that we incurred. And I also want to give credit where
credit is due. I think the fact that we've already exceeded our expectations on cost savings across the
organization was also quite helpful in offsetting some of the service restoration.

And then lastly, again, as I mentioned, residential down 2% year-to-date roughly, versus year-to-date last
year, but it's ahead of plan, too. And so you've got a little favorable mix as well versus plan. So all of those
factors have largely offset the service restoration expense that we saw in Q3.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Great. Yes. And just a quick clarification on the $0.16. That was incremental to plan, or did that include
typical storm-related expenses, I assume, you include in all of your plans?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, the $0.16 was incremental to Q3 of 2020, so it's just -- that's a historical comp, and that's what
that estimate is predicated on, versus planned, a little higher than planned. But remember, in addition
to having a decent amount of service restoration in our budget. We also utilized some regulatory
mechanisms, both what we call a voluntary refund mechanism that we put in place at the end of 2020 that
provided additional budgetary support.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

And then we also shared a gain on the sale of some assets related to our transmission assets in 2020 that
offered additional, I'll say, regulatory liability support that provided additional budgetary installation for
the service restoration expense this year.

Operator

And our next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

One on financing proposal, or in your plan, it looks like you reduced your equity needs for this year
by about $43 million. Can you walk us through what's the driver of that? And how much has really
contributed to the purchase price adjustment for the recent asset sale? And if there's any other factors
that are driving that number, if there's some conservatism baked in there?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Ryan, thanks for the question. So the EnerBank sale gross proceeds and the upside associated there
with was the key driver that enabled us to reduce our equity financing needs for the year. And the way
it works, and it's a little nuance. So I've been doing M&A for almost 20 years, but for fincos or financial
service companies, you have your traditional adjustments from sign to close on the working capital side,
but for the financial service companies, you also get credit if the book equity of the business increases
from sign to close.

And we saw that with EnerBank's outperformance over those handful of months. And so that led to about
$60 million of upside from the gross proceeds we announced at signing, which was $960 million, not to
the amount that we ultimately saw at closing, which was over $1 billion, call it, just under $1.20 billion.
And so that's what gave us the upside and financial flexibility to reduce the equity needs. And so it's really
a function of just that really strong performance at the bank that accreted their book equity that gave us
more proceeds at close.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I mean that's a bigger number than the amount of equity you reduced. So is there some conservative
baked into your reduction in equity needs? Or is this effectively a few million dollars worth of prefunding of
future equity needs or future capital needs?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So remember, we have about $57 million of equity forwards that we've already put in place, and we
have been putting those in place even before we announced the sale of the bank. And so that gives you
effectively for how low you're going to go because at some point, we will settle that. And so that's why we
stopped at that sort of $57 million. It's because of the existing equity forwards we already have in place.

Operator

Okay great. So I guess that helps you for future years for capital needs.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

That's right.
