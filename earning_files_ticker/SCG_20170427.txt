Thanks, Iris and thank you all for joining us today
I will begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the first quarter of 2017 were $1.19 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the same quarter of 2016. Increased electric margins primarily from a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as higher gas margins due to customer growth and rate increases at SCE&G and PSNC were more than offset by the impact of significantly milder weather when compared to the same quarter of last year
Additionally, positive variances in O&M and other income were offset by CapEx-related items, including depreciation and property taxes
In the footnote, you will notice that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.24 per share in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in a negative $0.19 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter
Now on Slide 4, I would like to briefly review the earnings results for our principal lines of business
SCE&G’s first quarter of 2017 earnings decreased versus the same quarter of 2016 due primarily to the aforementioned significantly milder weather, which was partially offset by increases in electric margins from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA
Additionally, gas margins at SCE&G increased as a result of a rate increase and customer growth
PSNC’s earnings saw increases versus the same period of the prior year due principally to customer growth and the rate increase
SCANA Energy’s earnings decreased due to significantly milder weather in the first quarter of 2017 versus the same quarter of 2016. I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 5. Through the first quarter of 2017, company’s announced plans to invest approximately $200 million, with the expectation of creating over 1,700 jobs in our North and South Carolina territories
At the bottom of this slide, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of March 2017 and 2016. South Carolina’s unemployment rate is 4.4%
Attesting to our state’s strong economic growth, over 50,000 or 2.5% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago
The other states in which we have service territories, North Carolina and Georgia, continue to see stable unemployment rates of 4.9% and 5.1%, respectively
The Carolinas, and especially South Carolina, continue to be seen as a favorable place to do business
As businesses have grown and expanded, they have nearly saturated our state’s workforce, giving way to all-time highs in workforce and employment numbers with little change to unemployment levels
This continued success in turn has been a key factor in our strong customer growth
On Slide 6, we present customer growth and electric sales statistics
The top half of the slide shows the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses
SCE&G’s electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%
Our regulated gas businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.6% respectively
We are pleased to continue to see strong customer growth in the region
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017. Sales were up over the previous 12-month period due to the abnormally hot summer, which offset the recent abnormally mild winter
Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were relatively flat on a 12-month ended basis, consistent with our planned expectations
Please now look to Slide 7, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns
The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $11 billion
As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business
In the box on the right, you will see SCE&G’s base electric business in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity
The adjusted earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017 and the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher
This mitigates the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy
Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. With the approval of our 2015 petition, the allowed ROE was revised down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates, which applied to the requests that went into effect at the end of November 2016. Under the terms of our most recent order, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for prospective requests for revised rates
As a reminder, we are allowed a return on equity of 9.7% and 10.25% on our gas LDCs in North and South Carolina respectively
As you will recall, in South Carolina, the rates for our gas business are set according to the Rate Stabilization Act
Under that mechanism, the ROE is evaluated annually
If the earned ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside of a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, we file to adjust rates in June, with the updated rates, if approved, becoming effective in November
On the slide, we present the ROE as of December 31, 2016 as we prepare the information as of the end of this quarter for the RSA filing
For this 12-month period, the earned return for SCE&G Gas was 8.47%
In North Carolina, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for an annual $19 million revenue increase at PSNC Energy, which was effective on November 1, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, the 12-month earned return for PSNC Energy was 9.44%
Slide 8 presents our CapEx forecast
This forecast reflects the company’s CapEx projections through 2019 and is consistent with last quarter’s call
This forecast shows projected spending under the fixed price contract and does not include any revisions from our ongoing review of the new nuclear schedule and cost estimates
At the bottom of the slide, we have recapped the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated
Now please turn to Slide 9 to review our estimated financing plan through 2019. This plan includes the expected impact of the Section 174 income tax deductions as well as debt and equity issuances and is also consistent with last quarter’s call
As a reminder, during the interim transition and evaluation period for the new nuclear project, we are making weekly payments
The projected spend on the project during the interim period is relatively consistent with what has been forecasted in this financing plan
It is unlikely that these debt and equity issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes on our funding needs for planned project expenses
We will update this financing plan and the CapEx plan shown on the prior slide once we complete our evaluation of the path forward for the new nuclear construction project
On Slide 10, we are reaffirming our 2017 GAAP adjusted weather normalized earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.35 per share and our internal target of $4.25 per share
Our long-term GAAP adjusted weather normalized annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 years to 5 years using a base of 2016’s GAAP adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.97 per share
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our new nuclear project
Hello Nick
We really don’t yet, that’s yet to be determined
Of course first, we got to determine what the damages would be and then have some discussions around the timing
Okay
Really none of that Travis, so that’s just related to the electric business
The weather impact in the two LDCs in the Carolinas is really captured already within the quarter in the accounting
So the cash of it may be a little later but that’s all captured in the accounting, so that $0.24 versus normal is all related to the electric business
Yes, Michael, it’s Jimmy
I am sure that, that could be and in fact, it would surprise me if it doesn’t start out that way
But I would say that we have got a pretty good track record of being able to come to reasonable conclusions
And you can just look at how the history of the project over almost a decade now when we have had differences, so not to say that we will at this time, but that would certainly be our approach, but it takes reasonable people on both sides
Sure, go ahead Steve
And I think you just about answered your question, which is we really expect to wait over in probably in Q4, so the idea is to use these credits to mitigate each annual BLRA revised rate increase and to use part of it to ensure that the business stays – the base business stays in a reasonable return of that 9% and 10% in a quarter
As you can see, what we filed there on the – what we have on the slide there is we estimate it’s a little higher than 9.75%
So it’s still well within that range that we suggest as a reasonable return on the base business and that’s despite some historically mild weather in the first quarter
That’s right
And Ashar, it would really – what we would do is any adjustment we will make would really impact it in the fourth quarter and forward
BLRA quarterly report, that’s correct
I am sorry our plan is to file that end of next week
So we are going to file the report as we should update what we know at the end of March, but we are not going to have any conclusions of this analysis at that point
Well, I wouldn’t say that
I think they have a lot of value in that they point out areas of concern and that kind of thing
We are complying with the regulatory orders, but you have to form your own opinion about the value of them
Good afternoon Paul
Yes
I will tell you, Paul that we had always looked at a longer period than 30 days to do the evaluation
But going back to when we were putting this in place, a very, very short timeframe leading up to an impending bankruptcy
And we want to get everything prepackaged such that it could be filed easily with the bankruptcy court and that made coordination not just between ourselves and Westinghouse, but also Southern Company
So we got that finished
Going forward however, there is – we don’t view there to be necessarily a link between a Southern agreement and our agreement so that we can really do our own thing in the next 60-day period
So we had sort of a vision a 60-day to 90-day period all along, but we had to get the thing done initially in order to get the time – filing timeframe for this bankruptcy proceeding
So that 30 days was the agreed upon amount, so we are doing exactly what we anticipated we would do
Well, I just think as we go through this evaluation, I don’t know how significant a risk is, but there is some risk that the two current partners in the arrangement could end up at different evaluations of the different options that Steve outlined earlier
So again, not putting any – not suggesting that will happen, but it’s just cautionary
Neil, it’s Jimmy
So there is at least three different routes as how they might move through
There is – in the very near-term, there is going to be in the next week or two weeks, likely a continuing resolution to continue to fund the Federal government
There is some possibility that they are a part of that
If not, there is a possibility that they are part of a more comprehensive tax reform
And then a third channel at least is just the bills get introduced on the floor standalone, so any of those three might happen
And then as far as your question about criticality, I mean there is three large influencers over the viability of these projects
One is the validation of the estimated cost
The second is the recovery of the response of – financial responsibility from Westinghouse/Toshiba
And then third are these tax credits
And all three of those are in the billions of dollars, so they are all critically important
And we have impressed upon everyone that has a vested interest in South Carolina and in nuclear and in America that listen to us that the timeliness of this is very, very important to this evaluation
So I can’t say absolutely that absent those, part or all of the unit would go forward
But it is very, very, important to the viability
Sure
No, it’s the latter
It just affects the lower rate base, so the ROE is higher
You’re welcome
Well, thank you
We remain focused and are working diligently to determine the most prudent path for our nuclear project
Our goal is to reach a decision that addresses the needs of our customers and all of our stakeholders
During this complex transition and evaluation period, we remain committed to providing you with timely information and updates as we move towards a decision
As always, we continue to focus on operating all of our businesses in a safe, reliable and efficient manner
We thank you for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA
Have a good day
