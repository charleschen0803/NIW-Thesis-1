Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Phillips 66 Earnings Conference Call. My name is David, and I will be
your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I
will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to Phillips 66 first quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's
call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, Executive Vice President and CFO;
Bob Herman, Executive Vice President, Refining; Brian Mandell, Executive Vice President, Marketing and
Commercial; and Tim Roberts, Executive Vice President, Midstream.

Today's presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website
along with supplemental financial and operating information. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement.
We will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results
may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included
here as well as in our SEC filings.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before addressing the quarter,
we want to comment on the current environment. First and foremost, our focus continues to be on the
well-being of our employees and their families, our communities, maintaining safe and reliable operations
and ensuring the financial and operational strength of our company. Our business is essential, and we're
focused on providing critical energy products and services for our customers. The safety and health of
our workforce is our top priority. Phillips 66 has implemented appropriate steps to protect our workforce
that are consistent with CDC, national, state and local directives. We've limited our operating facilities
to business-critical staff and implemented strict protocols to prevent introduction and spread for the
coronavirus.

In our Houston and Bartlesville offices, over 95% of our employees are working remotely. Our employees
have stepped up to the challenge during these unprecedented times and are adopting new ways of
working to ensure business continuity.

Our plan today for our company, we have them in place to ensure a safe return to our normal operations.
We contributed $3 million to COVID-19 relief efforts in the communities where we live and operate.
The funds will provide essential support for first responders, food banks, health care and other critical
organizations serving vulnerable populations. We recently announced actions in response to the
challenging business environment. We're focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity to
manage through this unprecedented down cycle. We secured a $2 billion term loan facility and issued $1
billion of senior unsecured notes.

We suspended share repurchases in March. We've taken action to reduce costs by $500 million this year.
The organization is doing a great job of identifying opportunities and efficiencies, and we're leveraging
our AdvantEdge66 initiatives to achieve these cost savings. We're reducing consolidated capital spending
by $700 million. This reduction will be partly offset by $400 million increase, as DCP Midstream will not
be exercising its option to participate in Sweeny Fracs 2 and 3 this year. At Midstream, we've deferred
the Red Oak pipeline and Sweeny Frac 4 projects. Phillips 66 partners has also deferred Liberty pipeline
and postponed its final investment decision on the Ace pipeline. In refining, we're deferring and canceling
certain discretionary projects. We continue to fund sustaining capital to ensure safe and reliable operations

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

and we're executing the in-flight projects that are near completion. We deferred some turnarounds until
later this year and also into 2021. We reduced refinery runs across the system in response to lower
product demand and margins. In April, our proved capacity utilization was in the high 60% range.

These steps provide additional liquidity and flexibility as we navigate this global crisis. By doing so, we're
protecting the company, the security of the dividend and our strong investment-grade credit rating.
We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and creating long-term value for our shareholders.
In the first quarter, total adjusted earnings were $450 million or $1.02 per share. We generated $217
million of operating cash flow or $736 million, excluding working capital. We returned $839 million to our
shareholders.

During the quarter, we achieved strong safety performance. We continue to strive toward a zero incident,
zero accident workplace. We're executing our strategy and progressing major growth projects. The Gray
Oak Pipeline commenced full operations of West Texas service on April 1. And more recently, the Eagle
Ford segment of the pipeline started operations, marking completion of the project. At the Beaumont
Terminal, we added 2.2 million barrels of fully contracted crude oil storage, increasing the terminal's total
crude and product storage capacity to 16.8 million barrels.

We continue to advance midstream growth projects scheduled for completion this year, including Sweeny
Fracs 2 and 3, Beaumont 0.4 as well as PSXP's Clemens Caverns expansion and the South Texas Gateway
Terminal. These projects are progressing well as planned.

In chemicals, CPChem and Qatar Petroleum are jointly pursuing development of petrochemical facilities on
the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Qatar. CPChem continued front-end engineering design for its U.S. Gulf Coast
project and advanced joint venture discussions with its partner. CPChem has deferred a final investment
decision on the Gulf Coast project.

In refining, we completed the FCC unit upgrade at the Sweeny refinery to increase production of higher-
value petrochemical products and higher-octane gasoline. The project was completed on time and
within budget. In marketing, our West Coast retail joint venture is expected to close on the acquisition
of approximately 100 sites in the second quarter of 2020, as previously announced. The joint venture
enables increased long-term placement of our refinery production and increases exposure to retail
margins.

In closing, we're honored that 5 of our refineries were recently recognized by AFPM for their 2019
safety performance. Our Ferndale, Santa Maria, Borger, Lake Charles and Bayway refineries received
distinguished safety awards. This is the highest annual safety award in our industry and the fourth year in
a row that our refineries have received this honor. AFPM also recognized CPChem's Borger, Conroe, Orange
and Port Arthur facilities for exemplary 2019 safety performance. So congratulations to all those facilities,
we're proud of you. Really well done.

And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to go through the financials.

Kevin J. Mitchell
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial
results. We reported a first quarter loss of $2.5 billion. We had special items amounting to an after-tax
loss of $2.9 billion. This includes a $1.8 billion impairment of refining segment goodwill and a $1.2 billion
pretax impairment of the company's investment in DCP Midstream. After excluding special items, adjusted
earnings were $450 million or $1.02 per share. Operating cash flow was $736 million, excluding working
capital. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $900 million, including $644 million for growth
projects. We returned $839 million to shareholders through $396 million of dividends and $443 million of
share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 437 million shares outstanding.

Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in pretax income by segment from the fourth quarter to
the first quarter. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $239 million, driven by lower results in
Refining. The first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 4%. The lower rate was primarily due to a higher
proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and foreign operations relative to domestic

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

results in a low earnings environment. Our rate was further reduced by impacts from state taxes and
recent tax changes under the CARES Act.

Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $460 million, an increase
of $55 million from the previous quarter. Transportation adjusted pretax income was $200 million, down
$50 million from the previous quarter. The decrease was due to lower equity affiliate earnings, largely
reflecting reduced volume commitments on the REX Pipeline. In addition, decreased refinery utilization
impacted volumes on our pipelines and terminals. On April 1, the Gray Oak Pipeline began the full
operation of West Texas service, and later in April, the Eagle Ford segment came online. The pipeline is
now fully operational.

NGL and other delivered record adjusted pretax income of $179 million. The $59 million increase from
the prior quarter was due to propane and butane trading activity as well as record margins at the Sweeny
Hub. The Freeport LPG export facility averaged 13 cargoes per month and the fractionator ran at 114%
utilization. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $81 million was up $46 million from the previous
quarter. The increase reflects hedging gains driven by lower commodity prices as well as lower operating
costs. In response to the challenging environment, DCP Midstream is reducing costs, reducing growth
capital by 75% and recently cut the quarterly distribution by 50%.

Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. First quarter adjusted pretax income was $193 million, up $20 million
from the fourth quarter. Olefins and polyolefins adjusted pretax income was $193 million. The $39 million
increase from the previous quarter is due to higher polyethylene sales volumes, reflecting increased
demand in the first quarter, primarily for food packaging and medical supplies, following lower seasonal
fourth quarter demand. Global O&P utilization was 98%. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S decreased $23
million due to lower margins and higher turnaround activity. During the first quarter, we received $33
million in cash distributions from CPChem. CPChem is taking steps to reduce 2020 capital by $600 million
and operating costs by $300 million.

Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining first quarter adjusted pretax loss was $401 million, down from
adjusted pretax income of $345 million last quarter. Across our system, the weaker results were largely
due to lower realized margins and volumes as well as higher turnaround costs. Realized margins for
the quarter decreased by 25% to $7.11 per barrel. Crude utilization was 83% compared with 97% last
quarter. The first quarter was impacted by significant turnaround activity, economic run cuts as well as
unplanned downtime. We completed turnarounds at the Alliance, Sweeny and Los Angeles refineries. In
addition, we had outages at the Bayway and Ponca City refineries. Pretax turnaround costs were $329
million, an increase of $97 million from the previous quarter. The first quarter clean product yield was
82%, a decrease from the prior quarter due to downtime on secondary units.

Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the first quarter was $9.82 per barrel compared
to $12.45 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Realized margin was $7.11 per barrel and resulted in an overall
market capture of 72%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 76%. Market capture is impacted by
refinery configuration. We made less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack.

During the quarter, the distillate crack decreased approximately $4 per barrel and the gasoline crack
declined by almost $2 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.32 per barrel improved $1.03 per
barrel from the previous quarter due to falling crude prices. Losses from feedstock were $0.21 per barrel.
Feedstock advantage declined $1.23 per barrel from the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to
timing of crude purchases relative to crude runs. The other category reduced realized margins by $0.17
per barrel. This was an improvement of $0.37 per barrel from the prior quarter, driven by clean product
price realizations.

Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted first quarter pretax income was $488 million,
$201 million higher than the fourth quarter. Marketing and other increased $197 million from higher
realized margins, reflecting the impact of falling refined product spot prices, partly offset by lower
volumes. Specialties increased $4 million due to higher finished lubricant margins. We reimaged 250
domestic branded sites during the first quarter, bringing the total to approximately 4,440 since the start
of the program. In our international marketing business, we reimaged 11 European sites, bringing the

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

total to approximately 90 since the program's inception. Refined product exports in the first quarter were
160,000 barrels per day compared with 157,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter.

On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax cost of $197 million, an improvement
of $14 million from the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee-related expenses,
partially offset by higher charitable contributions.

Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the quarter. We started the year with $1.6 billion in cash
on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $736 million, excluding working capital. There was a
working capital use of $519 million. Consolidated debt increased by $1.2 billion. We funded $900 million of
adjusted capital spending and returned $839 million to shareholders, including $443 million through share
repurchases. On March 18, we suspended our share repurchase program. Our ending cash balance was
$1.2 billion.

We are focused on conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity in the current environment. At March
31, we had $6.9 billion of liquidity, reflecting $1.2 billion of consolidated cash, a $5 billion revolving credit
facility at Phillips 66 and the $750 million revolving credit facility at Phillips 66 Partners. Phillips 66 has a
commercial paper program for short-term funding needs. In April, we paid off $525 million of maturing
debt, executed $1 billion in bond issuances and secured $1 billion of incremental term loan capacity, which
is currently undrawn. S&P and Moody's reaffirmed Phillips 66 investment-grade credit ratings of BBB+ and
A3, respectively.

This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In
Chemicals, we expect the second quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining,
crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions.
In April, utilization was in the high 60% range. We expect second quarter pretax turnaround expenses to
be between $45 million and $70 million. We anticipate second quarter Corporate and Other costs to come
in between $200 million and $220 million pretax. With that, we'll now open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

The first one is just around what you guys are seeing real-time on demand. You have a large marketing
system, so any real-time data points would be valuable. And then if you could tie that into your comments
on utilization. You ran in the high 60s in April. And recognizing there's probably some commercial
limitations in terms of how you're able to talk about how you expect that to go forward. Any thoughts as
you think about planning for May and June on the utilization side?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Brian?

Brian M. Mandell
Executive Vice President of Marketing & Commercial

Neil, thanks for the question. We have line of sight in Western Europe where we have stores and also
in the U.S., so we'll start with Western Europe. At the worst of the demand destruction, we were down
about 70%. We've seen things come back to about 50% now. In Germany and Austria, they're starting to
open up those communities a little bit. Bigger stores can now open. If you come over to the U.S., we were
seeing 40%, 50% demand destruction, depending on rural or urban areas. Now that's up to about 35% so
things are getting better.

In terms of refinery utilization, we are matching our utilization with demand. So as demand moves up,
we are moving up our utilization as well. We got down to about 65% utilization when demand was at its
worst.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

So Neil, as you think about gasoline demand, consumer-driven, roughly 35% of gasoline demand is
driving to and from work. And recent statistics show over 90% of the U.S. population under some form
of lockdown and the pace of recovery is going to be driven by the impact of COVID-19 and the relief from
these policies. About 16 states have scheduled to lift stay-at-home policies and public opinion's starting
to rally towards restarting the economy. As people come back to work and start driving, they'll be greeted
with lower gasoline prices, down about 40% year-on-year at retail and support from a $6 trillion stimulus
package, which should support recovery as well.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

The follow-up is on the marketing side of the business, where earnings came in better than at least our
model for the first quarter. Just any guidance or the way we should think about that as we go into 2Q and
3Q, recognizing volumes would be down. And any thoughts in terms of how you see the next 6 months
from a margin standpoint and whether that could be an offset?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Neil. Certainly, marketing speaks to the benefit of diversity in our portfolio. And as you might
know, in Europe, where we had very, very strong margins, we have -- 80% of our stores in Western

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

Europe are retail-owned -- company-owned stores. So we get the benefit of the retail margin in that
segment. And the retail margin was very, very strong.

I'll say, for the first quarter until about mid-March when COVID hit, we were running above volumes,
budget volumes. And when COVID hit, we came off. But for the quarter, probably about 90% of volumes,
but margins, 2 to 3x what we had budgeted for margins. So very, very strong margins, typical of falling
flat price. So really did a good job there. And in the U.S., where most of our stores are jobber-owned or
wholesale-owned stores, still decent volumes in the U.S., margin is not as good as overseas but we had
good margins in the U.S., too, with falling prices.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.

Douglas Todd Terreson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So Greg, you guys have been an originator of the disciplined capital management approach, and it's
obviously served your shareholders well during the upturn and now the downturn, too. So kudos to
the team for that. And while you reiterated your commitment today, we're in an unusual period of high
industry stress, which is usually associated with consolidation if financial and strategic merit is available.
So my question is while you've historically used your internal capital management program to drive
value, and you guys have obviously been successful, peers have often used acquisitions, and so I want
to see how you frame the strategic opportunity set today, whether you think it's that different from prior
downturns. And also any other notable color or philosophy that you can share on this topic?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Thanks, Doug. Well, this is 40 years for me in the business. This is my first global pandemic but
I've been through several economic crises. So -- and what I always tell people is that single point in time
forecast in the middle of the crisis are always dangerous and often wrong. And that was true if crude was
$100 and crude is $20. And we always view our business through the lens of mid-cycle, Doug. We think
that's the appropriate way to do it. We've had this 60-40 allocation framework, 60% kind of reinvest it
back in our business and 40% return to shareholders. We still think that's a good framework. Obviously,
there's times when you're going to be on other side of that. And like in the current crisis, liquidity is king.
You've seen us take the steps to defend liquidity. But the real purpose of that is protect investment-grade
credit rating and protect the dividend as we go through that. But we're going to come out of this on the
other side of this.

As I -- so as I think about $6 billion to $7 billion of cash flow at mid-cycle, and I acknowledge we're
certainly not mid-cycle today, but we always start with the sustaining capital. That's the first dollar, that's
$1 billion a year. And our dividend's second at $1.6 billion. And then we've kind of guided to $1 billion to
$2.5 billion of share repurchase, $1 billion to $2.5 billion of growth capital. But as I look at all the CapEx
cuts that I'm seeing in the Upstream business, 30% in that range or higher for some, I think that the
Midstream investable opportunities are going to be challenged in 2021. And so while we're a long way
to December when we would normally set our capital budget, today, I would tell you, we would probably
guide to the low end of that, and just in terms of the organic investable opportunities that meet our hurdle
rates.

And then as you think about that, if we're -- we think as we get into 2021, we're back towards more mid-
cycle conditions for the most part in terms of Refining margins, Chemical margins, et cetera. So cash,
certainly, generation will improve. So we'll probably pay down some debt, have the opportunity to restart
the share repurchase program. As I think about the dividend today at $1.6 billion, it's very affordable for
us.

In our normal cycle, we would look at probably increasing the dividend at kind of midyear, and this is
certainly the prerogative of the Board. But as you think about we're 3x the 10-year average dividend yield
of S&P 100, I don't think there's a necessity for us to do something immediately. As we get in the back

9

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

half of the year, we'll have a lot of opportunities to think about what do we do with the dividend in terms
of increasing it in the back half.

To your question around M&A or acquisitions, so first point is never try to catch a falling knife, obviously.
And as I think about PSX and how we're positioned, great diverse portfolio, strong balance sheet, we're
well positioned to do what we need to do. The best thing is we don't have to do anything on the M&A
front. We have great opportunities to create value for our shareholders. So we can be highly selective.
There's a lot of examples out there today of folks who have done the M&A side of it, and it's really hard
to create value doing that. And so while I do think that there will be consolidation that comes, both in
Upstream and Midstream through the balance of this year and into 2021, just given the stress levels that
people have, so there could be opportunity just to pick up assets, if not even whole companies. And so
I think you'll see us look at everything, but we'll be very, very careful and very selective about what we
might do, Doug.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from BofA.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I'm a bit reticent, I want to check you can hear me okay.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. I'm having some -- yes. I think Chevron cut their IT budget, it seems. But anyway, so I just got
a couple of questions. I guess, first of all, Greg, when you look at what's happening to gasoline and
distillate, they've got kind of contrasting fortunes right now. Valero made a comment on their call the
other day that they expect the market or the industry to move quickly to rebalance the distillate side of
the equation. I just wonder if you could offer your thoughts as to what Phillips thinks of that situation and
how you might try and address it at your level. And I've got a follow-up, please.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Let me just make some overarching comments and then Brian or Jeff can come in. I actually think
that if you think about the energy space and energy sector, Doug, I actually think refining may well lead
that space out of this. And I suspect, in the U.S., it's going to be around gasoline. People have been
cooped up, they want to drive. I think they're going to be reluctant to go get in the middle seat on an
airplane at first. And I think that will come. We saw that certainly after 9/11, and people, it took a while to
get back in the space.

But I think being in quarantine and being cooped up and just going crazy in the house, people are going to
want to get out. And that should actually bring gasoline back pretty good. And indeed, we've seen gasoline
fracs move up, not quite on parity with distillate. But then as the company starts to pick up, my view is
that digital demand, it's also going to pick up as we get the economy moving again. And so I mean the
real answer to the dilemma that we're facing today and energy impact for many companies, is we've got
to get demand going again.

So Brian or Jeff, if you want to comment on top of that, please do.

Brian M. Mandell
Executive Vice President of Marketing & Commercial

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

So I would say, too, Doug, if you take a look at Refinery yields between January and April in the U.S.,
you could see gasoline was down from 50% to 44%. Jet was down from 11% to 5%. Half as much jet
made. And distillate was up 9% from 29% to 38%. So a lot of the jet into the distillate refiners moved
from a gasoline economy to a distillate economy. And as a refiner, we continue to watch the cracks. As
an example, now gasoline is over distillate in the West Coast, so we think about that and we think about
opportunities to move our refineries to make the products that people want. And I think you also see
some gasoline come out of storage now, and you'll see some distillate go into storage as demand starts
to continue to increase. Distillate, if you take a look at the distillate contango and the crude contango, it's
about the same from prompt to December. So there's incentive to store distillate as well, and I think you'll
see some storage as well.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

That's really helpful color. I guess my follow-up is, we've all been asking, at least in those who have
reported so far, the E&Ps, how they respond to price signals in terms of how quickly they'll go back to
putting rigs back to work and all the rest of it, and I realize that's a longer-dated question, but I wanted to
ask you the same question about refinery utilization because the export market has obviously been a big
sink for, I guess, excess product for a number of years now. So given the uncertainty in the global market,
whether you've got maybe a more specific issue here in the U.S., how do you think about -- I mean, would
you -- when you see margins rebound, how quickly do you think you'll move your utilization up? Would
you also be a little bit more paced or measured in the way that you respond to allow those margins to
maybe get themselves a little stability at a higher level before you start moving to a higher level? I just
want to think of behavioral -- from a behavioral standpoint, how you guys are anticipating coming out the
other side of this.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Maybe I'll -- I mean, first of all, the margins will lead us where we'll go, Doug. I mean, it will tell us where
we need to increase rates or not. You just -- you want to just increase rates to increase rates, I think.

Maybe it'd be good, Bob, if you -- we've really prepared the refineries to bring them back if we need to.
And you may want to talk a little bit about that, and then I'll let Jeff come in over the top and then talk.
But Bob, if you would?

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes. So as we ramped our refineries down, we actually found ways to get down to lower utilization than
we would have ever imagined, I think, going into this, Doug. And we've been pretty careful about how
we park the units that we've shut down completely, and we do have some FCCs down and reformers to
unmake gasoline in the list, but we've kept our subject matter experts busy, making sure that we're ready
to run when the signals are there.

I think we're going to be pretty careful, though, about not bringing capacity back on too quickly because
the last thing we or anybody else wants to start it up and then shut it down a week later or a couple of
weeks later. So I think we're going to look for a pretty strong and a pretty stable demand signal from the
market before we start ramping up units that might be idled right now.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. I think as we think about demand, it's really the combination of domestic demand and exports into
the international market. So it's a combination of both. And as you know, China kind of had the COVID
first and it's recovering. We're seeing that 80%, 90% back up, so strong recovery in China. Europe
and then the U.S. kind of got hit next, and those are starting -- markets are starting to improve. Latin
America, Central America were the last ones to get hit with the COVID impact. And so we're seeing a little

bit of weakness there. But it's really a holistic approach to demand overall that we're using as a guide to
run our refineries at the rate that matches that recovery.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just kind of following up a little bit on Doug's question there about how things come back and all that. Do
you have a feeling for what is the inventory overage as you think about it from the refining down to the
retail level? I mean, obviously, we get the gasoline stats every week. But would your view be that, that a
stack full of inventory is everything else we look at, or that, that might be a little bit better? I'm just trying
to think of the timing of recovery here as demand slowly starts to pick back up.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. I think as we look at inventories as a percent of shale capacity, crude inventories running at a higher
percentage than products. And especially at Cushing, there's about 92 million barrels a day of shale
capacity there. If you look historically, Cushing inventories have kind of maxed out about 75% of shell, so
that would be about 70 million barrels at Cushing, and we're currently at 63 million barrels. So that's an
area where crude inventories are high relative to the capacity that's available.

Gasoline distillate, some of the products, lower utilization of shell capacity at this point. But obviously,
regional and local dynamics are extremely important. And we're factoring that into how we run the
refineries to meet demand and the infrastructure that's available there.

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

And we have the addition of a flywheel for gasoline because PADD 1 is an import market, Roger. And if
you take a look at just the last DOEs, 160,000 barrels of gasoline came into PADD 1. That's about 25% at
this time of year that less -- or 75% less, 25% of what typically comes in, in PADD 1. So that's kind of the
flywheel as we think about gasoline demand in the U.S. But I think -- and the bottom line is refiners will
produce just what demand is. We won't overproduce, and that will keep us from filling up. We're far from
filling up now globally or U.S.-wide. So we don't have any concerns on clean products.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then, Greg, this question is probably for you. The performance of chemical utilization in
Q1, the guidance for a pretty strong Q2. Can you give us an idea of what's driving that? Why Chemicals
has been managed or is managing to stay a lot stronger on demand side than what we're seeing across
most of the rest of the business ops?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think you kind of just start with a geographically diverse sales mix for CPChem and the fact that the
high-density products that they make go into more consumer type markets. A lot of the chemical peers
have a lot more exposure in automotive and automotive has been hit really hard. But if you think about
detergent bottles and bleach bottles and hand sanitizer bottles, those things are flying off the shelf, and
those are the kinds of things that CPChem makes. And then you're seeing a resurgence of disposable
packaging as communities ban reusable bags and go back to the disposable bags. And so I mean that's
been it. And I think that one of the things we've seen is really strong demand across all segments of all
geographies. So good demand in Asia, good demand in Europe and good demand in the U.S. So it's really
product portfolio-driven.

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. First question I have is probably best for Kevin. I just want to get some of your thoughts on the
moving pieces here in the first quarter on cash flow. Free cash flow was negative in the quarter. There
were some line items in CFO that looked negative there that didn't really have much of a descriptions in
them. But also then, as I think about the underlying performance, the Refining capture rates, pretty varied
depending on the region. So just any underlying color you could give on the performance in the quarter
there.

Kevin J. Mitchell
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Yes, Phil. I mean, it's -- so Q1 is usually a weak cash generation quarter anyway. And you're right that
on the cash flow statement, if you dig into the details, so deferred taxes was a use of cash and normally
that's an add back. That is specifically associated with the DCP impairment. And so if you sort of normalize
for that, you would've had a sort of modest $200 million inflow on cash on that particular line item. So
there are certain details like that, that have an impact on the overall.

But I would say, I think we're pretty pleased that our -- from a working capital standpoint, typically a use
of cash in the first quarter, it was this time, but probably less than what we've historically seen. Some of
that's a function of -- you may remember, in fourth quarter, we did not recover all of our 2019 working
capital the way we had anticipated. And the reality is a lot of the inventory drawdown in the fourth quarter
rolled into Q1 of this year from a cash standpoint just based on the timing of when those barrels were
sold.

We've also been pretty aggressive in looking at other opportunities to sort of optimize around working
capital. And then the other comment, just from an overall standpoint, we announced actions to reduce
capital, reduce costs. But in the context of the first quarter, our spending really was -- those activities
were already sort of set in place and very little ability to directly influence capital. So it's on a -- if you
annualize our capital number for 1Q, you'll get quite a higher number than what we expect the full year
to be. And there's no doubt, we did consume cash. We issued $1.2 billion of debt over the quarter and we
ended the quarter with less cash than we started. So that is the reality of the environment. It was a tough
environment. And of course, the high Refining turnaround costs are a drag as well that you typically don't
have in a normal steady state quarter. So I think I'll leave it at that.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. No, that's helpful. My second question is on Chemicals. Probably for Greg, given your experience
in this business for a long period of time. We've clearly seen oil prices come down, naphtha feedstocks
getting more competitive. You announced that you're deferring the decision on the 2 crackers to 2021.
But is there anything about this situation that you think has structurally changed in any way the feedstock
advantage of your facilities vis-à-vis naphtha-based facilities longer term? And as we look at the current
environment, how do you think about trough fundamentals for Chemicals for your business? I mean, are
we essentially there at this point?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So first of all, there's no question as crude prices have come down, that spread between, let's say,
natural gas and crude has certainly diminished for LPG crackers such as CPChem, and that's true, Middle
East or U.S. Gulf Coast. I would also say $20 crude is not sustainable in our view, and we think crude will
ultimately normalize, and then we'll see that spread opportunity capture come back to us. And today, our

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

view is there's certainly sufficient NGLs to crack. But when you look at the cracks play today, naphtha is
pretty competitive in that crack space. C5, C4s are very competitive in that crack space.

One of the things that we're seeing in Chemicals today, though, that's unusual is given the automotive
downturn, we're not consuming tires. And so making the butadiene go away is becoming a bigger and
bigger issue. And as you know, naphtha makes a lot of coproducts, which butadiene is one of them. And
so industry is looking -- the tanks are full, industry is looking at co-cracking butadiene now just to make
it go away. And so that will ultimately start to impact the economics of naphtha in that mix because it's so
highly dependent on the value of the coproducts.

So I would suggest that for the balance this year, you should expect the feedstocks in that chemicals
chain to be quite volatile. But they've all kind of converged around that same space. There's still 1 million
barrels a day probably of ethane in rejection. And so we're still highly confident that this next wave of
crackers coming on, there's going to be plenty of LPG feedstocks, albeit that they're going to be competing
head-on-head with naphtha, at least through the balance of this year until crude gets back to a normal.
Robert, you've had a lot of experience in chemicals also. You want to add anything to that?

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

I think you've got it, Greg. I think this is for a moment. I think it's just a moment. Crude has to, I
think it's going to work its way back up. And you'll get that typical normal delta will come back from an
advantaged feedstock.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Phil, one thing I would say is we're starting to see delays in the construction of new capacity, both
domestically and in Asia. So pushing out the start-up of planned capacity. Secondly, I'd just say that the
polyethylene chain margin that we reported in our supplement was $0.178 per pound in 1Q. The April
index is about $0.14 a pound. So that's kind of where we are today.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

It could go single digits. So we've seen it there before. And so I think we'll just have to watch as we go
through the year. The fortunate thing is that demand has really held up well across that chain and that
should be good.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Two questions. Greg, if I look beyond just this year and next year, say, going into, say, 2022, 2023, in the
post-COVID world, is there in energy front that change your investment criteria and your outlook for the
logistics? And then when we argue that the budget cuts on the Upstream company probably at, say, going
to see at least 2 million barrels a day of the oil production drop, except the excess between late last year
to end of next year. And we probably won't get back to early this year production level until maybe 2024
or even 2025. So is that a change in your view about that business at all?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we probably look at exit over exit in a 2 million to 3 million barrel range, Paul. We're probably
maybe a little north of you on 2 million of where we see the exit rates. We do think that we're in a
recovery phase. It's probably less investable opportunities in Midstream. And I think that forces us to
rethink our Midstream growth opportunities. But you've seen us do this before. In '15, we were circa $6

14

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

billion of consolidated capital. And in '17, we cut that to $1.8 billion. And so we're certainly willing to do
that again if that's what the market tells us to do and we can't find investable opportunities, Paul.

But longer term, I think we -- I keep coming back, this pandemic will be over, there could be another
one in the future we just don't know about. But the last one was 1917. So I mean the odds are good
that we're going to get back on a growth trajectory here. There's still literally hundreds of millions of
people that are coming into the middle class. There are going to be consumers, there are going to be
petrochemicals, there are going to be consumers of energy. I think directionally, that should be positive
for a return to growth. What we don't know is, does the growth go back to where it was or do we start
growing from where we're at today? So I think that's the real question that is to be answered in front of
us.

Jeff, I don't know if you want to come in as you're thinking about out in '23 and '24, you're seeing
anything different?

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

No. I think that was well said.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Okay.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And the second question is for Kevin, that you guys always have a conservative balance sheet. But after
the COVID-19, as we're looking out, again, there's not so much about this year, next year, but on a longer
term. Is your financial parameter, whether it's on the debt level, asset capital ratio or anything, or even
that how you deal the PSXP as a vehicle for you, how those -- is there any shape of that being changed?

Kevin J. Mitchell
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Yes, Paul, I don't think, long term, we would change our view on expectations around the balance sheet
and leverage. We have historically talked about, at the PSX level, a leverage ratio, sort of 30% debt-to-
cap ratio, 25% to 30%. And obviously, we're higher than that right now. And we've been working both
sides of that equation between the write-downs, had an impact on the denominator. And obviously, we've
added some debt and so we're sitting above that. But one of the reasons why we target what a lot would
consider a very conservative leverage is so that when we come into times like this, we have the ability,
the capacity to issue some incremental debt, weather the storm, come through that the other end and not
have a detrimental impact on credit ratings and our ability to access debt markets. And so I think we feel
very good that our financial strategy has really played out the way we would expect in times like this.

I do think that as cash flow improves, we will have short-term debt coming out of this. Greg mentioned
earlier, we will put priority on eliminating that debt. And we would expect that over time, we would get
leverage back to within its -- our sort of target level range.

Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from Crédit Suisse.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just want to come back maybe 4 or 5 years. You sold a refining asset on the East Coast, which was then
specifically reconfigured to produce jet fuel. I'm trying to understand what happens to these assets across
the world which were specifically designed to produce jet fuel in the current environment in which we are?

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We're all looking at each other. Who wants to answer that question? So I guess I'll lead off. I'm glad
we sold it when we did. It's really hard, and Bob may want to comment, but it's really hard to move that
configuration a lot to produce jet. I'm not sure that the refinery is running that much different in terms of
its output today or yield structure than -- at least at the margins.

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes. I think if you just look at it over time, they've prioritized making jet fuel, even when maybe the
margins didn't drive them to do that because of their ownership structures. But there's only so many
kerosene molecules in a barrel of oil, and it's hard to get anything else than that done and they trade
away the rest of the products for jet fuel, and that's kind of their business model. So we don't have
any insight to what they're doing today when nobody -- when they don't want the jet fuel, their parent
company doesn't want the jet fuel and nobody wants to trade them for jet fuel.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. A quick follow-up is we were monitoring global capacity additions for the next 2, 3 years. And
I think Jeff mentioned this on the Chemical side. Is there a probability that some of these refinery
expansions also get delayed, postponed or just completely scrapped off because of the credit crunch and
other issues that we are seeing on the Refining side?

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. I think that's right. Typically, even in a profitable market with open financial markets, those projects
-- new projects tend to get delayed and start-up periods tend to be longer than anticipated. But that's
especially the case with COVID activities impacting labor forces and construction and the financial markets
not quite as generous as what they have been. So we would definitely expect to see refining projects get
pushed out. This year, we're expecting something comfortably under 1 million barrels a day of capacity
adds and probably trending lower at this point. So yes, I think you've got a good point that both on the
Refining side and the Chemical side, new capacity additions are getting pushed out.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Obviously, April was a crazy month in the crude markets that play on the physical side. I was just curious
if you could talk about how Phillips, how much you guys were able to sort of capture those discounts, both
in terms of the sort of regional basis and then also in terms of the contango that we've seen? And then
how long you think that, that sort of thing can go on for?

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

Well, I'll say that one of the great things we did and we talked about at Investor Day as part of
AdvantEdge66, we had a group called the Value Chain Strategy and Optimization Group, 36 employees,
best and the brightest from around our different segments, and they were able to, really during this period
of time, it was very fortuitous that we had them in place, think about how to optimize the entire system.
So I'll give you an example. When prices for crude really fell, we were able to push barrels around into
the refinery, use storage in the refinery that we might not have used new storage, third-party storage and
take advantage of really strong contango in the market. So contango is good for refiners. There's other
things that are in play when you're analyzing value for refiners. But we were able to take advantage of a

16

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

lot of the opportunities. We also have midstream assets where we can store product when they're a large
contango. So it was good for us.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Brad, I might just add, contango is typically a benefit for refiners on crude purchases but we do have
a number of different domestic crude contracts that impact or reflect the impact of contango and
backwardation. But there's a number of other variables that impact pricing and margins, the timing of
crude purchases versus product sales, location and transportation differentials, quality differentials and
product placement options all influence market capture relative to the 3:2:1 benchmark cracks that you
guys follow. So there are a number of complexities to consider.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then you guys touched some oil export barrels. I'm just curious on how you think the outlook
for that looks, both in terms of the demand for U.S. crude, given the, obviously, weakness in global
product demand, but also sort of what happens if we see significant shut-in volumes?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Well, obviously, if we see a lot of shut-in, we're seeing probably 30% shut-in right now, there'll be less
exports. We think there will be less exports, probably in the 2.5 million barrels a day range going forward.
But our crude's still needed. And as Jeff mentioned, Asia's starting to come back, and particularly China,
South Korea, Japan and Thailand. So I think you'll see barrels continue to be exported. We export some of
our light crudes, Bakken crudes and others overseas, and I think you'll see that continue.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask a question first about the potential recovery in refinery margins. As investors try to figure
out how long that takes, I think a useful corollary is prior recessions and downturns, and in the past few
recessions, it's taken a couple of years for refining margins, global margins to really come off their lows
based off that we're looking at. So can you just discuss some of maybe the similarities and differences
between the current situation we're in, in past recessions and how that's going to impact the recovery in
refining margins?

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. So I think it will be a factor of demand recovery and how rapidly demand recovers. In a number
of previous cycles, there's been an oil price spike in front of the recessionary period that's really had a
big and long-lasting impact on demand, whereas this has been much more around the COVID impact.
And so I think as businesses get back to work and consumers drive to and from work, that we'll see
demand recover. And that, that will really drive the margin environment. We're likely to be in a supply long
environment for a period of time, which is supportive of positive demand elasticity as well as low cost of
goods sold for refiners. So I think there are some reasons for optimism in this cycle relative to previous
cycles.

PHILLIPS 66 FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 01, 2020

One thing I want to add -- maybe one thing I'd add on that, too, just if you think about Refining margins,
in a $30 crude environment, a $15 margin is a lot more advantageous to refiners than it was maybe in
past times when we came out and we had $80 crude or $100 crude just because of the coproduct impacts.
So I think you could see refining margins rebound quickly.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Fair. And then just moving over to the marketing business that was touched upon earlier in the Q&A. But
we don't really have good visibility into what margins are doing right now. Clearly, the first quarter was
very strong, given the rapid decline in crude prices, but how are Refining margins trending now as oil
prices have stabilized? And then also, if you could extend the comments to how volumes are doing relative
to what you've discussed in terms of overall demand destruction?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

So was your question on marketing margins or Refining margins?

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

On marketing margins, yes.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So the margins in Western Europe are still very, very strong. We expect them to remain relatively
strong. In the U.S., the margins are starting to stabilize some, but we still see them as being relatively
good. Now remember, in the U.S., a lot of our volume is wholesale volume and wholesale margins are
smaller than the retail margins overseas. But we would expect demand to continue to increase and the
margins to come off in the U.S. and that's it.
