Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone
For the fourth quarter of 2016, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 10.9%, which is an increase of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015. On the dollar basis, SG&A costs were $378 million in the fourth quarter, or $35 million higher than in the prior year period
The increased SG&A costs on both the margin and dollar basis are almost entirely related to higher costs for our incentive compensation plans, because we outperformed the goals set for the year
SG&A costs during the quarter also included a charge for executive severance costs, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.01 per share
So when we look at fourth quarter income from operations and operating EBITDA margin, the year-over-year comparison would have been 100 basis points better without the increase in these incentive compensation and severance costs
For the full year, we held our SG&A costs flat on a percent of revenue basis at 10.4% as we offset increased incentive compensation costs and higher SG&A costs from large acquisitions by reducing back office spend and finding greater efficiencies in our processes
We will continue to focus on our continuous improvement objectives and managing SG&A costs in the year to come and expect to hold SG&A costs flat in 2017 and for SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue to improve by about 40 basis points
Turning to cash flow
In the fourth quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $753 million compared to $526 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This growth in operating cash flow was driven in part by an increase in operating EBITDA of $54 million, and this reflects the strength of our core operating performance in the year
For the full year, cash provided by operating activities increased $462 million to almost $3 billion
Again, operating EBITDA was the primary driver of the increase year-over-year, contributing $277 million of increased cash flow
During the fourth quarter, we spent $377 million on capital expenditures, and for the full year, we spent $1.34 billion, which is an increase of $106 million from 2015. When we gave our guidance for capital spending at the end of the third quarter, we expected to spend about $1.4 billion in 2016. Due to permit and construction delays that were beyond our control with three of our capital projects, we pushed $50 million of this spend from 2016 into 2017. This $50 million deferral is included in our 2017 projected capital expenditures, which Jim will discuss
So combined in the fourth quarter, we generated $387 million of free cash flow and this is a $199 million increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, our free cash flow increased by $254 million, or 18% to $1.66 billion
This is the highest amount of free cash flow that the company has ever generated, if you exclude the proceeds from the divestiture of Wheelabrator in 2014. As I mentioned, in 2016, our free cash flow growth was driven by the 8.1% increase in operating EBITDA
While this bodes well for continued cash flow growth from core operations in the year to come, in 2017, we have some headwinds to overcome, but they're incorporated in our guidance that Jim is going to discuss
In 2016, we had a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross currency hedge that will not repeat
We also expect cash taxes to increase, capital expenditures to be higher and our cash payout for incentive compensation to be up in 2017. That said, our focus in 2017 will not change
We will grow revenue and manage our costs, maintain capital spending discipline and drive efficiency and working capital to generate high and sustainable levels of free cash flow
In 2016, we continued our commitment to returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, returning a total of $1.45 billion during the year
In the fourth quarter, we paid $180 million in dividends to our shareholders, and we repurchased $225 million of our shares
For the full year, we paid $726 million in dividends and repurchased $725 million of our shares
During 2016, we allocated cash to capital investments for the organic growth of our business, acquired core solid waste businesses to enhance growth and return value to shareholders, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet
At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.53. Our weighted-average cost of debt for the quarter was 4.17%, and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 14% at the end of the quarter
For 2017, we currently expect that interest expense and cash interest paid will be relatively flat with the full year of 2016. The effective tax rate was approximately 34.4% in the quarter
And on an as adjusted basis, the full-year tax rate was also 34.4%, which is in line with our expectations
We have built our 2017 projections using current tax law, and we currently expect our 2017 tax rate to be about 36.5%
The increase in our projected tax rate for 2017 is due to expectations for higher operating and pre-tax income, which reduces the benefit from our tax credit
I will now turn the call back over to Jim to discuss our strategic outlook and 2017 guidance
From a comparison perspective, the one thing I would add is that in the first quarter of 2016, we did see some MSW volume benefits from some of the waste-to-energy facilities, meeting their maximum capacity
And that will prove to be a bit of a tough comparison, but that's not something that would impact the full year
It just really impacted the first quarter
Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
And your commercial is very strong
What are your thoughts on that into 2017, because obviously that's an important piece to the puzzle?
And then to the extent that it's impacting the way that sellers think about the landscape for moving forward with transactions at this point, we definitely think – as we've talked internally, we do think that our sellers are going to be influenced by the evolution of tax policy
And it certainly is going to be a factor in the way that they think about the optimal time to move away from their businesses
So, it's too early for us to say whether or not it can impact our ability to execute on that targeted $100 million to $200 million of tuck-in acquisitions or any other potential acquisitions that we may look at in the future
But we do think that with tax reform, you're going to see some sellers more motivated to move forward potentially, given that they'll likely have lower taxes to pay as a result of a transaction
So cash taxes paid in 2016 were $470 million
We expect those to increase by about $125 million in 2017, and of course that will vary depending upon our pre-tax income and how the year actually comes in
So, I wouldn't say that 2016 is a normal year because we had a $100 million realization from the debt restructuring that we carried forward into 2016. So, look for 2017, again, it's too early to say what tax reform will do, but look for 2017 to be a more normal year at that $600 million level
We're thinking about revenues being just north of $14 billion in 2017.
I would say on the low end of that, Michael
So, I would say the way that we're looking at it is the build of volumes of 1.2% to 1.6% price of right – or yields of right around 2%
And then we're not building in anything specific under recycling line of business from commodity price
We're not building in anything from foreign currency, either, and we also leave fuel flat
So, ultimately, that's what builds from this year's 13.6% to 14.05% to 100%, basically I would say
That's a great point, Jim
And the other piece of that, Michael, that might be helpful is that we've got to think about yield as being off of an $11 billion base of revenue rather than the $13 billion
