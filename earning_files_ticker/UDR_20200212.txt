UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to UDR's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host,
Director of Investor Relations, Trent Trujillo. Thank you, Mr. Trujillo. You may begin.

Trent Nathan Trujillo
Director of Investor Relations

Welcome to UDR's Quarterly Financial Results Conference Call. Our press release and supplemental
disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of
our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the
most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Reg G requirements. Statements
made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although
we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable
assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk
factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any
duty to update any forward-looking statement.

[Operator Instructions]

Management will be available after the call for your questions that did not get answered on the call.

I will now turn the call over to UDR's Chairman and CEO, Tom Toomey.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Trent, and welcome to UDR's Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. On the call with me today
are Jerry Davis, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will
discuss our results. As well as senior officers, Warren Troupe and Harry Alcock, who will be available
during the Q&A portion of the call.

Our fourth quarter results, highlighted by robust same-store NOI growth of 4.1% and FFO as adjusted
per share growth of 7%, continued to demonstrate strong execution across all aspects of our business.
To recap, 2019 was a very good year for UDR and our shareholders. First, we continue to perform well on
operations, which drove approximately 65% of our 2019 FFOA per share growth. The year was highlighted
by the ongoing development and execution of our next-gen operating platform, which allows our current
and prospective customers to engage with us online and in a self-service manner they have demanded
across most aspects of their lives. Second, our capital sourcing and allocation remained disciplined, using
equity priced at a premium to NAV and low-cost debt to accretively grow our business through $1.8 billion
in acquisitions. These acquisitions have significant operational and investment upside, are in markets
targeted for expansion and will produce outsized FFOA growth in 2020 and beyond.

Third, we wound down KFH JV and halved our relationship with MetLife to be an accretive asset swap.
These actions simplified our business and added more high-quality real estate on balance sheet. Fourth,
we proactively and accretively derisked our enterprise through well-timed issuance and prepayments
that extended our duration and improved our liquidity. And last, we accomplished these goals while
dramatically improving our resident satisfaction scores, maintaining strong employee engagement and
completing a wide variety of ESG-related initiatives that enhanced our returns.

In summary, 2019 was a very good year and representative of what investors can expect from UDR as we
continue to execute our long-term strategies. My thanks to the UDR team for their hard work in making
2019 a very special year.

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Turning to 2020. Our business is strong as the fundamental landscape for apartments look like it will be
fairly similar to that of 2019. Specifically, we expect a relatively robust economy and balanced supply-
demand environment, set against volatility that we've all come to see as normal. But whatever the macro
environment, we believe we have the right strategy, portfolio and team in place to grow FFOA and the
dividend per share at an elevated rate over time through a variety of value creation mechanisms. For
2020, we are expecting 6% FFOA per share growth at the midpoint of our guidance and announced a 5%
year-over-year increase in our dividend per share.

Last, Warren Troupe, our Senior Executive Vice President, will be transitioning to a consulting role with
UDR effective April 1. I've worked closely with Warren for 18 years, and I'm thankful that UDR and its
investors will continue to reap the benefits of his expertise in transactions, legal, risk management and
capital markets activities for years to come.

With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce another quarter and full year of
strong operating results. Fourth quarter same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth rates were 3.3%,
1.3% and 4.1%. Full year 2019 same-store growth rates were 3.6%, 2.5% and 4%, respectively. As Tom
alluded to in his prepared remarks, UDR's primary operating objectives are to consistently generate above
peer average same-store growth while also expanding our/ operating margin, both of which drive FFOA
per share growth over time. Over the years, we have successfully executed these objectives in a variety
of ways. Prior to 2019, we primarily focused on top line growth initiatives, such as parking, short-term
furnished rentals and common area rentals.

In 2019, these top line growth initiatives continue to produce outstanding results, but we also pivoted
our strategy to more actively minimize controllable expense growth through the implementation of our
next-gen operating platform. Why did our focus shift? Three reasons. First, our customer increasingly
expects to conduct business with us on their time across a wide variety of industries. Intuitive, easy-to-
use self-service apps have come to define high-quality service. Interacting with our customers should
be no different, which is why the backbone of our next-gen operating platform is built on self-service.
Second, centralizing certain operating functions, outsourcing others, providing better self-service to our
current and prospective customers and more actively utilizing the data we collect will result in greater
efficiencies throughout our cost structure. By 2022, we expect these efforts will expand our controllable
margin by 150 to 200 basis points, which translates into $15 million to $20 million in incremental run rate
NOI or $300 million to $450 million in value creation at a 22x multiple.

Third, the consistent adoption and execution of operating initiatives that boost revenue growth,
constrained expense growth and enhanced FFOA per share growth is ingrained in UDR's cultural DNA.
But the next-gen platform is and will remain somewhat of a distraction to our teams in the field and at
corporate until fully implemented by the end of 2021. As we consider the sequencing of growth initiatives
over the coming years, cost efficiency will be the focal point in 2020, with additional revenue growth
initiatives beginning to come online in 2021 and beyond, once our property, technology and data analytics
platforms are fully built out.

Moving on, we are now 1.5 years into the implementation of the platform and have achieved
approximately 25% of the original underwritten NOI improvement. Thus far, our controllable margin has
expanded by 60 basis points and site level head count has been reduced by more than 15% through
natural attrition. After reducing our same-store controllable expenses by 0.4% in 2018, 2019 controllable
expense growth was just 0.9%, resulting in average annual growth of only 0.3% over the last 2 years
versus 1.8% for the peer group. For 2020, we expect our controllable expense growth to be at or below
this level. At the same time, 2019 resident satisfaction scores improved by 11%, and we anticipate further
improvement in 2020. As such, expanding our margin through cost and head count reductions is clearly
not resulting in a decline in actual or perceived customer service. Rather, it is more efficiently delivering a
superior all-around experience to our customers.

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Our next-gen operating platform is proving to be a win-win for UDR, our associates, our residents and
our investors. We are excited to update you on continued -- on our continued progress and expected
economics throughout 2020 and beyond.

Next, 2020 has started well. Occupancy remains high at 96.9% and our $1.8 billion of 2019 acquisitions
are ahead of underwriting expectations. As a reminder, we expect the weighted average yield on these
acquisitions to improve from a trailing 4.7% at purchase to above 5.5% by year 3. These accretive
investments will continue to drive our FFO growth and value creation for years to come.

Looking ahead, full year 2020 same-store revenue, expense and NOI growth ranges are 2.7% to 3.7%,
2.2% to 3.0% and 2.9% to 3.9%, respectively. Drivers of our revenue growth include higher rents,
including SmartHome contribution and slightly higher occupancy, offset by a lower contribution from
other income as the growth rates from initiatives rolled out over the past several years, such as parking,
short-term furnished rentals moderate and lower utility expenses reduce our reimbursement revenue. It
is important to note that as 2020 unfolds, our quarterly same-store growth rates will be higher than our
year-to-date same-store growth rates, as 2019 acquisitions move into our quarterly same-store pools.

In addition, the MetLife JV communities, acquired in 2019, are included in our full year 2020 same-store
pool. These are not expected to significantly impact the same-store growth rates. Their inclusion will
provide more transparency through 2020, beginning with our first quarter supplement. At the market
level, we expect 2020 top line growth rates will exhibit less variability than in years past. The Monterey
Peninsula, Portland and Boston markets are forecast to grow same-store revenue at a rate above the
high end of our 2.7 to 3.7 portfolio growth rate range in 2020. New York, Baltimore and Orange County
should come in below the low end. All other markets are forecast to grow revenue within the collars of our
portfolio growth ranges.

Regarding accelerating versus decelerating markets in 2020 versus 2019, we expect that Portland, Tampa
and New York will generate the highest year-over-year acceleration in 2020 same-store growth; and San
Francisco, Seattle and Baltimore are forecast to decelerate the most.

In closing, I would like to thank all UDR associates in the field and at corporate for producing another year
of robust operating growth, successfully integrating $1.8 billion of acquisitions and continuing to embrace
the future in the form of our next-gen operating platform. 2019 was an eventful and very rewarding year.
I'm immensely proud of each of you.

With that, I will turn it over to Joe.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Jerry. The topics I will cover today include our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, full
year 2020 guidance expectations, a transactions and capital markets update, and a balance sheet update.

Our fourth quarter earnings results came in at the midpoints of previously provided guidance ranges.
FFO's adjusted per share was $0.54, approximately 7% higher year-over-year and driven by strong same-
store and lease-up performance, accretive capital deployment and lower interest rates. Full year FFOA
per share was $2.08, representing year-over-year growth of over 6% and driven by factors similar to our
quarterly results.

Next, our full year 2020 guidance. Full year FFOA per share guidance is $2.18 to $2.22, driven by
continued strong operations, 2019 capital deployment and interest expense savings. Primary drivers of
the $0.12 of growth between our 2019 FFO of $2.08 and our 2020 midpoint of $2.20 per share include
a positive impact of approximately $0.07 from same-store, stabilized JVs and commercial operations, a
positive impact of approximately $0.05 from transactional activity, DCP, development and redevelopment,
a positive impact of approximately $0.03 from lower financing costs, flat year-over-year G&A and a
negative impact of approximately $0.03 from a variety of other core items, including ground lease resets
and the amortization of certain next-gen operating platform investments. A full guidance update, including
sources and uses, expectations and first quarter guidance ranges is available on attachment 15 of our
supplement.

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Moving on to transactions and capital markets. During 2019, we acquired approximately $1.8 billion
communities at share at a weighted average trailing yield of 4.7%, with equity priced at a premium to
NAV and low cost debt. As Jerry mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see this weighted average yield
growing to above 5.5% by year 3, generating an additional 10% NOI growth above and beyond a 3%
annual market rate growth we used in our underwriting. This encapsulates UDR's value proposition when
we are able to overlay our well-tuned operating platform, combined with targeted CapEx investment
on under-managed assets that are located in markets targeted for expansion. In short, we can buy
assets at market prices but drive above-market returns and growth over time. We utilized this value
creation equation again subsequent to quarter end by purchasing The Slade at Channelside, a 294-home
community in Tampa for $85 million or $290,000 per home.

Similar to our 2019 acquisitions, we anticipate The Slade deal growing from 4.6% in year 1 to 5.3%
by year 3. Next, during the quarter, we prefunded the majority of the acquisition of Brio, 259-home
community in Bellevue, Washington, on which we have a $170 million fixed purchase price option in 2021,
with a $115 million note at a 4.75% interest rate. This property is contiguous to our existing elements and
elements to properties in Belvieu. And after stabilization, will be operated as a face of those properties,
thereby garnering operating efficiencies.

Regarding the developer capital program, subsequent to quarter end, we exercised our purchase option
to buy the 51% we did not already own of The Arbory, a west coast development JV community, with
276 homes in suburban Portland. Our cash outlay for the transaction totaled $54 million, including the
payoff of debt. The Arbory is expected to generate a year 1 FFO yield of approximately 5.4% on our all-in
blended price.

Finally, on the topic of transactions. During the fourth quarter, we closed a $1.8 billion UDR-MetLife joint
venture transaction that was originally announced in August, which effectively halved our relationship with
MetLife. We believe this deal was a win-win for both sides and continued to value our partnership with
Met.

Turning to 2020. We will remain disciplined with our capital sourcing and allocation and pivot to
investments that provide the best risk-adjusted return, should we have an advantageous cost of capital
and can match fund. If further external growth opportunities present themselves in 2020, we will continue
to evaluate all capital sources. Currently, we have approximately $300 million of assets being marketed for
sale. Regarding capital markets, in December, we settled all 1.3 million shares, sold under our previously
announced forward sales agreement at a forward price of $47.41 for net proceeds of $63.5 million. No
additional equity was issued during or subsequent to the quarter.

During the fourth quarter and as previously announced, we continue to take advantage of the low interest
rate environment by issuing $400 million of unsecured debt at a weighted average effective rate of 3.1%
with a weighted average of 13.9 years to maturity. $300 million of this debt qualified as a green bond
and represented our first use of this ESG-friendly product. Proceeds were used to prepay $400 million of
4.625% unsecured debt. Please see our supplement for further details on our transactional and capital
markets activity.

Moving on to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our liquidity, as measured by cash and credit facility
capacity, net of the commercial paper balance, was $867 million. Our consolidated financial leverage was
34% on undepreciated book value and 26% on enterprise value, inclusive of joint ventures. Consolidated
net debt-to-EBITDA ROE was 6.1x and inclusive of joint ventures was 6.0x. Our consolidated leverage
metrics at year-end looks slightly elevated due to only having 1 month of NOI from the acquired MetLife
communities, set against the full debt load of those communities.

Normalizing for this would bring our consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA ROE down to approximately 5.8x
and within our targeted range. Over the next 3 years, less than 3% of our debt comes due after excluding
our commercial paper facility and working capital credit facility. Additionally, our weighted average
duration is now over 7 years. Both of these put us in an advantageous position regarding 3-year liquidity.
We remain comfortable with our credit metrics and don't plan to actively lever up or down.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Jerry, you talked about the same-store revenue growth assumptions. What's embedded in guidance in
terms of blended lease rate growth? And if you can discuss new and renewals expected in 2020.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes, Nick, this is Jerry. Blended lease rate growth is expected to be fairly comparable to last year, right
around that 3% range, with renewals in low the 5, and the new probably in that 1% or so range. And what
was your second question?

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

No, that was that entire question. I was then going to ask about the new lease rate growth in fourth
quarter we saw it turn negative and the spread between that and the previous year widen. So I was
wondering if you could provide some more color on that.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes. Really, when you look at that, Nick, 4Q '18 was a pretty exceptional year where you didn't see the
normal seasonal softness that we've witnessed in prior years. We look at 4Q '19, new lease rate growth
was negative 0.5%. That compares to negative 0.5% in 4Q of '17 and to a flat in 4Q of '16. So '18 at
1% was more the aberration. In that quarter, we didn't feel the effects of new supply that we've seen
in the other 3 years in the past 4. I will tell you, when you look at January though, we've seen a normal
seasonal acceleration. Blended growth is up 2.4%, which is higher than it was in the fourth quarter, but
honestly, it's 60 basis points higher than it was in December. So you are seeing good sequential monthly
acceleration, but it still is 40 basis points less than it was in January of last year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Just going to the guidance, Jerry, just a couple of questions. I think you said that for 2020, obviously, the
same-store pool is changing a lot. But did you say that there's no real benefit or detriment from having a
higher pool, meaning that if you didn't change the pool, your same-store numbers would be similar?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes. What I said was the inclusion of the MetLife portfolio into the full year same stores, the delta to
revenue and expenses is fairly immaterial. What we're really saying is as you see the sequential or each
quarterly growth rate as the year rolls on. Acquisitions we made last year will be rolling into the pool. So
those are expected to have higher growth rates than the full year pool of same stores.

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Nick, this is Joe. Maybe just to add to that a little bit in terms of MetLife. That goes back to one of the
reasons that we had talked about in terms of why we liked the assets that we acquired, meaning that they
had less near-term supply pressure. So I think investors are used to see a MetLife portfolio underperform
a little bit relative to legacy same-store. But to Jerry's comments, you're seeing that the MetLife assets
that we acquired are right there in line with our same-store legacy portfolio. And we'll end up breaking
that out for you on Attachment 5, starting in 1Q of '20, so you can see legacy MetLife as well as the
combined, which is what we guided to.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then I don't know if I missed this, but can you just quantify what the impact is
from rent control initiatives in New York and California on 2020 same-store revenue?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes. So it's in that 10 to 15 basis point range. I think back in the third quarter, we told everybody New
York was $500 million to $1 million range, AB 1482. We did the calculation after they came out; it is about
$300,000 or so. And then the other thing that's impacting us is the anti-gouging laws that went into effect
in California in response to wildfires in the fourth quarter and a bit of an effect on 2020 as far as short-
term furnished rentals in California of a couple of hundred thousand dollars.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Just one last question is going back to 2019, the final number on same-store NOI growth. It looks
like you ended up hitting the bottom of your guidance range? And I think you also revised it up a little bit
that range in the third quarter. So what happened that ended up driving you to the low end of the revised
range?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's really a couple of things, primarily. One is, we had 2 significant fires in the portfolio that took -- in
October that took somewhere in the 40 to 50 unit range out of service for the entire quarter, which drove
down our occupancy a bit. Secondly, as I said, on the California anti-gouging laws were in place from late
October through late November. It had not only an effect on short-term furnished rental income in the
first quarter of 2020 but also some impact in the last month or 2 of 2019. And we had elevated levels of
insurance expense as well as some elevated electricity cost.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Shirley Wu with Bank of America.

Shirley Wu
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So I guess my first question have to do with occupancy. So this coming year, you're thinking a little bit
higher in occupancy. Is that a function of kind of bringing those 40 to 50 units back online? Or is that a
little bit of a shift in strategy in maintaining your occupancy by pulling back on rates?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

It's really not pulling back on rates. I'd tell you, we're -- as we get more information on data analytics, the
third phase of our platform is data science. And there's a couple of things we've been able to determine
as we had first looks at this. We think it's going to allow us to reduce the number of days units that's
vacant from when a resident moves out to when they move in. Every day, we can reduce that. It's about

10

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

12 basis points of occupancy pickup. So it's really more focused on that than anything we're playing with
rate versus occupancy.

Shirley Wu
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And so my second question is on your SmartHome initiative. So you guys have
gone around 60% of the homes so far. So can you talk a little bit about your cadence in 2020 and the
contribution to revenue growth from this initiative?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Yes. In 2020, our expectation is to add another, call it, 7,000 to 10,000 homes, probably most of those will
be completed in the first half of this year. So as the earning comes in, the expectation when you look at
how much it's going to contribute to that portion of rent growth, it's, call it, 60 basis points and you factor
in the follow-through from what we did last year as well as the new leases that go into effect in 2020

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a quick question on next-gen OP, and there's an impact to FFO and then you're going to capitalize
certain parts of the total cost. So can you just walk us through sort of the accounting there? And maybe
how much of the amortization of certain expenses is hitting FFO and just break it down that way, really
quickly?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Rich, it's Joe. So in terms of the, call it, $30 million that we've laid out for expenditures for the
platform that's being spent in 2019 and 2020, we ended up capitalizing that. And depending on the actual
investment, it typically averages out to about 5 to 6 years of amortization. So once that's prepared and
ready to be put into service, we start the amortization period, which is really starting to kick in here in the
first quarter, as we bring more of the process or project online. In terms of the impact, it starts out at, call
it, between $0.01 and $0.02 this year and ramps up to around $0.02 on a go-forward basis until it burns
off and we kind of eat through it all. So it's a noncash impact. It's just non-REO depreciation that works
against us from a FFOA head point.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a little bit bigger-picture question as we contemplate 2020. If you had
to pick 1 or 2 factors, maybe across supply growth, job growth or changing customer preferences as we
think about maybe move-outs to home purchase and things like that, where do you think the biggest risk
to your forecast could be at this time?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I think more so on the job growth than wage front. I think on the supply side, we have a pretty good
handle in terms of where we're leveling out there in terms of supply being up, call it, flat to up 10% in our
markets. On the rational pricing front, we really haven't seen any on a market-wide basis. Of course, there
is some -- some of that taking place on a submarket specific basis. So I think we have a good handle on
the supply front. The demand front is where we'd be more concerned, either to the upside or downside
that could drive pricing power in either direction, but obviously, the job support in the last couple of

it at this point, but that's probably the bigger variable for this year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just to clarify on the same-store results that you have this year. So it sounds like the quarterly results will
be higher than the full year figure, just given the acquisitions from last year being added to the pool. And
I was wondering if you could just quantify what that difference may be if you could average the quarterlies
versus the full year?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

I don't have that number right in front of me. We'll probably have to give you a call back with that unless
Joe has it?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

No, it's -- we'll come back to you on kind of the quarterly impact, but you'll probably see between 10 and
20 bps pick up between quarterly pool and full year pool as we go throughout the year.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. I guess it's been a couple of months since the press reported your interest in the Mack-Cali's
multifamily portfolio, and obviously, it's not in your guidance. But do you want to describe what the
situation is like as far as your relationship to the deal that was reported?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

John, it's Joe. Obviously, I'm not going to make any comments on rumors that are out there in the
market. So I don't think we're in a position to talk on that front. I guess, what we would say is,
generically, when it comes to external growth and capital deployment, we've laid out a pretty clear set
of parameters by which we have operated and tend to continue to operate. Be that, making sure we get
near-term FFO growth and accretion, make sure that we're match-funded, leverage-neutral, risk-neutral
and making sure the assets we look to acquire have NOI and platform upside to help drive some of that
accretion. So none of that has really changed. The other piece with external growth to think about. We've
talked in the past about development pipeline where we want that to trend towards. We spent most of the
cycle at $1 billion plus. We've talked about getting back to 2% to 3% of enterprise value. I think when
you look at the current pipeline of $300 million plus land that we have and opportunities that we have
internally, I think we have a good path to get back to that. So that's kind of the comments that we can
make on external growth at this time.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Jerry, when you guys did your budgeting for 2020, what markets had the widest bands between the likely
top and bottom, in terms of possible outcomes on same-store revenue?

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Yes, probably Seattle. Seattle is one, every year, you look at it and those projected to have significant
supply impact, but job growth always seems to come in and surprise to the upside. We also have been
very adept in recent years to push through and get high penetration levels on our other income initiatives.
But it's one of those -- I can tell you, for example, in Redmond, we have one asset. There's a couple of
thousand units coming online there. Right now, we're not feeling as much of an impact from that as you
would have expected. So it's just interesting to watch, especially on that east side of Metro Seattle, their
ability to both take supply, but because of the significant job growth that you see in places like Bellevue,
Redmond, Kirkland, that it gets absorbed so quickly at such high rates. This past quarter, our Bellevue
assets had revenue growth of 5.2%. Now you look at Amazon, which has jumped across Lake Washington
to there and there's -- they have 2,000 jobs in Bellevue today, going to increase it by another 2,500 by
the end of this year. And I believe they've taken well over 3 million to 3.9 million square feet of space
that could accommodate eventually 25,000 associates on that side of the lake. You compound that with
other tech companies that are coming over into the east side, whether it's Facebook, Microsoft expanding
their campus, Google, things just feel very strong. So that would be the one that I would say probably
has the widest variance followed by San Francisco. We've told you fourth quarter, we began to see or feel
the impact of new supply, both in SoMa as well as down in Santa Clara. San Francisco is another market
that if you don't feel irrational pricing, and we're not feeling it yet today, that job growth and its quality job
growth can absorb those units very quickly. So that's another one, I would say, that can surprise to the
upside.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then when you guys look at supply in your California markets over the next, whatever, 18, 24
months or whatever you guys have good data on, how much of this stuff has condo maps? And do you
guys expect that the various legislation and ballot initiatives in California are going to make condo projects
and/or conversions more attractive, which could also help a little bit on the supply side on the rentals?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Rob, it's Joe. So when we look at a supply, when we track the permitting data that is out there, I'd say
California, generally, is probably one of the markets that has trended lower from a permitting activity. So
over the last 3 to 6 months, you've seen permits nationally took higher, really led by more of the sunbelt
markets and a little bit on the east coast, but west coast has been looking better. As it relates to the condo
mapping, we have not gone to that level of detail to figure out how much of that supply or permanent
activity is related to that. So really, no comments on that front.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. Because presumably, your high-rise off in these west coast markets is the stuff that where if you
have supply coming online, it's probably the easiest to do condos, right? I mean -- and so some of your
supply that you're going to get hit with would make the best condo conversions or condo sales just right
out of the box at that time?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, potentially.

Harry G. Alcock
Chief Investment Officer & Senior VP

Wes, this is Harry. Right now, we have a land loan in this project that we've had for a couple of years. The
land loan matures at the end of March. The developer continues to work through final pricing and the like.
We have an option upon satisfying certain conditions to provide sort of permanent DCP in that, but we're
not in a position yet to be able to comment on it.

Wesley Keith Golladay
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And would a potential extension may happen? Would that be a potential assumption there?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Wes, this is Toomey. Certainly, that would be one consideration. We'll look at what Harry highlighted when
the numbers come in. But what we're excited about Alameda is, in August, I believe, the ferry starts its
operations, and so that whole corridor is going to be activated. And we like the price point relative to the
markets around it. So I think it's going to be an area to keep your eye on, and we're hopeful we can find a
deal inside of that.

Harry G. Alcock
Chief Investment Officer & Senior VP

And Wes, I guess, I'll just comment. The project itself has made tremendous progress in terms of
infrastructure, in terms of the road now connecting the rest of Alameda to the waterfront, the first market-
rate apartment project has started construction in the first 2 townhome or sold projects has started
construction. So it has now turned into a real viable project at this point.

Wesley Keith Golladay
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then looking at Brio, could you have just bought that asset today and done the lease-up
yourself? Looks like you guys would do a much better job on the lease-up than a developer. So how do
you think about that versus doing a secured loan for a year?

Harry G. Alcock
Chief Investment Officer & Senior VP

Wes, this is Harry. So the structure is that we funded $115 million at 4.75% with an option to acquire the
property 1 year post TCO, which will happen sometime next year. UDR, if we are managing the lease-
up, we get some new significant operational synergies on this. And the structure allows us to mitigate
lease-up dilution, while still managing the lease-up gives us a fixed price option next year. We fund 75%
of the purchase price today. We've done business with this developer in the past. We like the asset and the
location.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I would add to that. Harry said, we'll get synergies. Just to let you know, this deal is in Bellevue. I
just gave you an update of all the positive things happening in over in Bellevue, Redmond and Kirkland.
But what makes this deal more enticing to us is it's contiguous to 2 additional phases of the Elements
buildings that were built by the same developer. We have price point differential between Brio and the
10-year and I guess 9-year-old product that will be run with, but as Harry said, you'll get synergies. We
think we'll be able to run this property on stabilization, maybe one extra person in the office and one
extra person in maintenance. So quite a bit of a benefit being located right there, being able to lay on our
operating platform.

Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Jerry, you mentioned that you plan to turn the focus back to revenue initiatives in 2021, you'll still be
reaping the benefits, I guess, from the expense efficiencies over the next 3 years. But can you give us a
sense of what those new revenue initiatives are that you're exploring and the potential magnitude of that
opportunity?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Austin, this is Toomey. Maybe I'd step back, and I'll get to let Jerry answer that question, but a couple of
things come to mind. And I've been at this 25-plus years, and I have seen over that trend, developments
and vectors, focus, shift away from development, capabilities, consolidations to market mix, to the last 5
years, it has probably been around revenue. But our strategy, in our view, has always been that long-term
value creation, share price appreciation comes from cash flow growth. And you've got 7 companies today
that are really good, and you can see it in the convergence of our revenue on top of each other and very
little differentiation. But ultimately, starting in '17, we started to look at it and say, where is our customer
going, where is our margin going, because mature businesses eventually arrive at that conclusion. And
after '17 concluded and started implementing in '18, our operating platform, and whether you have $1
billion of revenue or $3 billion, 100 to 300 basis point margin expansion is a heck of a lot of value on
the table. And I'm really happy that we're after that. You can see our progress that Jerry and team are
reporting on that front, and I think the best days lie ahead. But when I look back at the last years, one
thing I'm struck by is, in '18, we grew cash flow 6%; '19, 6%; and '20 at the midpoint 6%. I'd like to keep
that trend goal. And I think what Jerry and the team are all working on with respect to the initiatives in
the platform, certainly, are going to be the biggest driver of that going forward. So I think the industry is
arriving at a new door of opportunity. We're all going to go through it. There is no doubt in my mind about
that because our customers already stepped through that door. And how we implement it and the speed in
which we implement it will be the differentiating point. But you talked about revenue and potentials off of
the platform. I'll kick it back to Jerry and let him talk about where he's headed.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes. I answered some of this earlier. But when we look at the data science component of the next-gen
operating platform, I tell you everybody here that I got first glimpse of it; it has gotten pretty excited.
We see opportunities to better price our homes. When you can see things spatially through heat maps,
opportunities jump off the page at you, and you can just identify and really quantify where there's
opportunities that you were missing when information was either in a spreadsheet or just not quite as
visible. The other thing I think we're going to be able to do much better job on is improving resident
retention as we are able to accumulate more information about our residents and where is the best place
we can go acquire those residents in the future, I think it's going to help us drive down turnover, increase
retention. And I think we're also going to be able to gain more and more data, compare communities to
each other, find best practices to reduce the time it takes to reoccupy homes or the way we always say,
let's reduce the number of vacant days. So I think what you're going to see is most of it's going to come
on the true occupancy and rent side, not other income initiatives that we're going to find through this data
science.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. I appreciate all the commentary and thoughts there. And I guess that kind of goes a little
bit into the next question. Given the ability to acquire market cap rates and generate upside and cash flow
growth. At this point, your acquisitions, though, have been largely one-off, more surgical opportunities
over the last couple of years and spread out fairly well geographically. But just wondering if there are any

markets where you feel like you're significantly underexposed or under-indexed to that you'd like to take a
little bit more of a concentrated run at, potentially through a larger transaction or a series of one-offs?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Austin, it's Joe. Yes, I think our diversified approach continues to stand in terms of when we deploy capital
over the last 12, 18 months. You've seen us all up and down the east coast. You've seen us down in the
Florida markets. We just talked about Brio and what we're doing there in Seattle. I do think we'd like to be
more active in SoCal but trying to kind of map out the risk/reward and the cap rates that you get there,
which are fairly compressed. So I think you'll see us continue to be diversified in the approach and spread
our bets and try to match fund those and go get the NOI upside out of the platform.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Austin, I'd just say, there's a lot of opportunity when you think about our footprint today and the buying
the one next door, buying the one down the street. We don't lack for an opportunity set. We just have to
be very disciplined about making sure that we accrete the value and not the seller. And so we're going to
stay focused on what we've been doing, and it's worked.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Joe, I think this might be a question for you, given it's maybe a little bit of a guidance question. But it
sounds like you guys are getting much, much smarter on your next-gen OP, big data. So I'm wondering,
as we think about that 3.4% full year NOI guide, how are we supposed to think about that cadence? Is
it still very time to peak leasing season? Or are we supposed to think that as you get smarter and more
efficient, that we're going to start to see some acceleration in the back half of the year?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Rich, it's Joe. We've traditionally now provided quarter-by-quarter guidance as it relates to same store. So
probably not going to start at this point. We provided 1Q FFO guidance. So if I'm going to leave it at that,
and then you'll see the cadence develop throughout the year.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I figured I tried, Joe. I'm not asking for guidance.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Nice try.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I do -- understood. Understood. So coming back to the development, I think we have chatted in the past
that maybe that could get up to $500 million versus the $1 billion at the peak. So -- and I think you've
referenced some land deals that are starting to pencil out a little bit more. Can you just walk us through
what's driving that increase and development potentially?

16

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Maybe just some quick historical context, maybe Harry will jump in, too. We had been at $1 billion-plus
for most of the cycle. And so we've been very disciplined around making sure we get that 150 to 200
basis points. We haven't been focused on maintaining $1 billion at all costs. So you saw that $1 billion
shrink to 0 kind of from the 2016 to 2019 time frame as deals completed. At this point in time, we've been
working on land for quite a while. You saw the Denver parcel that we acquired last year. You saw the Union
Market deal in D.C. that we acquired last year, both of which have been worked on for an extended period
of time. Today, we got the $300 million pipeline across 3 deals. Union Market is not in the active pipeline
as of quarter end, but we expect it to be shortly. It's about 140-plus or minus deal. So that will take the
pipeline up. In addition, Vitruvian through the MetLife transaction, where we had Vitruvian West 1 and
now 2 in the pipeline, we've been getting good yields with those in the mid-6s. And so we have Vitruvian
West 3 that we think we'll be able to move forward with here in short order. So that will get you back to
that plus or minus $0.5 billion. I think, depending on circumstances, cost of capital and opportunities that
probably took a little bit higher than that, in that 2% to 3% range of enterprise, so call it, $500 million,
$600 million, $700 million, $800 million. But that's easy to fund when you think about the cadence of it
and the free cash flow that we throw off of $125 million, $150 million a year, the leverage capacity that
we have each and every year, and then the dispositions that we typically put out there is normal course of
business. So definitely not anything insurmountable from a funding standpoint.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And just for clarification, this is in addition to and not lieu of the CDP program, right?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

That is -- it's a stand-alone. So when we talk about $500 million to $700 million, that is typically ground
up consolidated development that we're speaking to. When you look at DCP, we've traditionally thrown out
there kind of $300 million, $350 million, $400 million type of number, of which we sit in the high 2s today.
So we have some capacity to add there as well.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. I'm sorry for the confusing question. What I really meant was, you wouldn't be reducing your
development capital program to increase development. It would be development increasing while the
development -- while the development capital program stays where it is, maybe even increasing a little bit
more.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Correct.

Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

First, just congrats to Warren. So well done. So 2 questions. Jerry, on the SmartHome technology front,
in answering one of the earlier questions, you mentioned the revenue opportunities, occupancy and
expenses. The expenses I get, obviously, you guys have talked about personnel retention, being able to
retain your better employees and not have to go through the people who are cycling in and out. But as
far as occupancy and rent, you guys are like 96% plus. The industry has had YieldStar or LRO adding
number of the pricing systems, and you said that this really isn't about driving other income. Can you just
elaborate more where the SmartHome -- I get it on the operational, on the expense side, but where on
the revenue side -- if you've had really good occupancy, and you've had really good rent growth through
the systems, where the SmartHome will help you grow on the revenue side?

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

In reality, the SmartHome, we get a rent increase at new lease terms, call it, that $20 range. We do
think there's efficiency that we gain either through our maintenance people, our prospective residents
being able to do some kind of tours and be able to utilize smart homes. Implementing leak-detection
devices, drives down R&M as well as insurance costs. But I don't foresee smart homes are going to drive
occupancy. I think there is that rent pickup that you get as you add that amenity, that again allows a lot
more flexibility for entering your apartment, having a dog sitter or somebody like that to have access to
it. But when we look back as we've installed these smart homes and look at what our market rents have
done in those communities from the time before we install till after, we're comfortable that we're getting
that $20, $25 pop in rents.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then, Joe, just the perfunctory rent control. Obviously, the latest from Albany is if you are
looking at CPI plus 3, which is slight better than the CPI plus 1.5%, but still, obviously, would not be a
positive thing. Maybe you can just give your latest on your thoughts on what will happen in Albany? And
then also how that is affecting you guys looking at New York City, if you're still actively looking in New
York? Or if your interest in the region is now exclusively in the suburbs?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Alex. So maybe just to clarify on Albany. You may have more information than we do on this. But I think
the way we looked at it, it was the greater of CPI times 1.5 or 3%. So it seemed like they were setting
a 3% floor on renewals, but you still have vacancy decontrol. So just want to clarify that. So if that's the
scenario and you still have vacancy decontrol, you still have the upside on news and you get 3% renewals
as a floor. It's not what we'd ideally like to see. We'd like to see a more constructive discussion around
public-private partnerships, up zoning, densification, less regulation, things of that nature. But it is a
factor that plays into our thinking when we're thinking about New York City and allocation there as well as
the broader region as well. It goes into a qualitative factor, but that's pretty consistent nationally as well.
We're seeing increased activity nationally, and so it goes into our thinking everywhere, but that's why we
like the diversified platform that we have.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

But would you still consider buying in New York or you're more focused on New Jersey?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

We'd still consider New York. We'd consider New Jersey as you saw with One William last year. New Jersey
also was talking about CPI plus 5%, I believe. So I think there's a number of markets out there that are
looking at that. So we'll take into account each time we look at a transaction.

Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

First, I want to touch on capital allocation. Given your track record, very good operating ability and capital
costs, both on equity and debt that are favorable, just maybe could you talk about why the acquisition
or potential acquisition outlook in your guidance was pretty light, and also, if you have anything you're
potentially looking at right now? That would be great.

UDR, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Senior VP & CFO

Neil, it's Joe. In terms of guidance, historically, our practice has been to not guide to speculative activity.
If you go back to our guidance last year, clearly, we surpassed that from an acquisition standpoint. We
were able to find accretive opportunities and match to fund those with well-priced equity and debt. So the
acquisition guidance, you see there on Attachment 15, $140 million. That's really just for The Slade at
Channelside that we announced as well as the buyout of Arbory and Wolff joint venture. So going forward,
we'll continue to do what we've done over the last 12 or 18 months, which is: look at the pipeline, try to
find opportunities that can drive additional upside as we did this year and drive more earnings accretion
and growth. And if we can do that, we'll figure out where to pivot towards in terms of the source of
capital. I did mention that we have $300 million of assets in the market today. So generally normal course
of business for us, but we have a pretty diverse swath of markets and cap rate ranges that we're looking
at. We like the feedback we're getting so far. So we're looking at that as well as a source of capital.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. But you can't -- I mean are you -- you talked about $300 million of assets on the block to sell. But I
mean, in terms of the pipeline or the pool of assets that are potential acquisition candidates, I mean, has
that trended higher, just in terms of how the market blows your cost of capital?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

No, it's -- I think we were saying, back in November, the pipeline had dried up a little bit. But I don't know
if you were down to NMHC, the other week. Typically, that's when you start to see more activity coming to
market. So typically, pipelines start to pick up around that time. So we'd expect to see more deals coming
to market. But again, we're going to keep disciplined around the parameters that we've got to see and not
just simply go out there and buy just to utilize the cost of capital.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then the other one for me is, could you just talk about your outlook for supply in Northern
California and Seattle. The data vendors, there seems to be a fair amount of disconnect between the data
vendors, what aspects it talked about. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in those markets or what
you expect to see for 2020.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think when you look at both Northern California and Seattle, when we look at third-party data,
permit data in terms of the regression approach that we take and then talking to individuals on the ground
as we work through our budget process, both of those markets are expected to be up generally. Seattle
is a little bit more flattish at a market level. I think San Fran, overall, probably a little bit more first-half
weighted, dependent on the slippage that we see there. And then when you flip over to kind of the longer-
term look and think about what we see going forward, the permanent inactivity in Northern California has
dropped off quite a bit more over the last 3 to 6 months versus where it had trended, whereas Seattle has
remained a little bit more static.

acquire something that's a $2 billion portfolio, I'm not saying it's the Mack-Cali one or not. But if you were

to take on a deal like that, how much more could you lever up? Or what's the appetite to lever up if you
have an opportunity like that, that makes sense? And is those current leverage kind of inhibiting you or
driving you to not make those decisions because of where it is?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Maybe it's good to just kind of lay out what we've communicated in the past in terms of the goals on
the balance sheet. We've talked about 5 to 6x debt to EBITDA, fairly consistently and our desire to stay
within that range. The plan calls for that. So I guess, if you say, on an adjusted basis, we're at 5.8x. I
guess, you could say that we have the ability to lever up 0.2x to get to our plan or stay within the range
we've laid out. So we really don't have any intent or desire to lever up at this point in time. We like to be
in the solid BBB+, Baa1, like the cost of capital that affords us. And we've really been focused beyond debt
to EBITDA on a lot of other metrics, i.e. fixed charge, free cash flow, duration, 3-year liquidity, et cetera.
So in totality, I think it's important to take a holistic approach thinking about the balance sheet, not just
locking in on that debt-to-EBITDA metric, which did tick up but obviously due to onetime issues related to
MetLife timing. So I wouldn't say you should expect us to lever up for transactions.

Hardik Goel
Zelman & Associates LLC

Got it. So I guess, maybe taking a slightly different way, if there was to be an attractive deal out there
that required a lot of capital, you would need to also have the cost of equity to kind of take it down
because as you mentioned, your balance sheet only allows you a 0.2 turn.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

It's either an attractive cost of equity or we have dispositions. We have free cash flow. We have other
levers to pull as we look out over the next 2 to 3-year business plan. So it's not always dependent on cost
of equity. We have multiple sources of capital to tap into.

Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I guess most of mine have been asked, but I've got a couple of market-specific questions. First, on
Boston, a market that you guys have outlined, you expect to grow at a pace better than the overall
portfolio asset, a market that is expecting to see a lot of supply come online this year. So just curious
-- and by the way, in the urban core, where I believe you do have a number of assets. So just curious,
what gives you the confidence for that kind of statement, facing that kind of supply and then maybe some
comments on the lease-up over at Garrison?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Haendel, this is Jerry. Yes, I think we would agree with your assessment that there is going to be supply
pressures downtown. We're feeling them in Seaport, we felt it there in the fourth quarter where Pier 4
had revenue growth of just 2.1%. Our properties, though, that are in the North Shore as well as down in
the Salisbury should encounter less supply pressures and do it better. So really going to be dependent on
which assets you're looking at. The only property that's in our same-store pool that's downtown is Pier
4 for full year same-store. So again, we would agree that there is going to be supply downtown. There's
going to be a bit less when you get out to the suburbs, especially when you're looking at some of the B
product that we have that's up in the North Shore.

Garrison lease-up is -- it's doing well. It's at 82%, 84% physically occupied. We finished the renovation
of the amenity building that was part of that redev. We're looking to re-engage on unit turns again in

the next couple of months. And we anticipate, while we're leasing up against a lot of new supply, that
location in the back bay is highly desirable. I think as the construction moves out of that small area or
site, meaning the construction that we do during the renovation period that it's going to be a great asset.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Appreciate that, Jerry. What type of spread are you projecting? Or as you think about the revenue outlook
for Boston in terms of the urban versus suburban?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Spread between those is -- I think it's about 200 basis points.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Okay. And second question on Baltimore. I recall spending a lot of time last year or last summer, I
think we visited talking about your market predictive model and how it's leading you to be a bit more
enthusiastic about Baltimore, a market where a lot of your peers seem to be shying away from. So can
you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in Baltimore today calling you to -- leading you to call out as
a market that you expect to see some of the most deceleration. It doesn't look like there's a lot of supply
coming online in that market this year. So maybe you could talk about what's perhaps changed in your
view on Baltimore over the last 6-or-so months? And what was perhaps underappreciated in your market
revenue model?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Haendel, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it over to Jerry for some more specifics. As it relates to the predictive
analytics piece and how we were looking at that a year ago and what drove us to think about that, that's
a quantitative approach. So it shines a light on markets that we think are set for outperformance, but
you still have to take a qualitative approach and make sure that the expectations on the ground actually
meet up with what the model or the machine tells you. So things that got us excited about Baltimore:
historically, it's a very stable job growth, typically in line with national averages, we're seeing that
continue; from an affordability standpoint, one of the most affordable east coast cities out there; job
diversification-wise, when you look at it, especially in the cybersecurity and defense side, very strong
there, but they also have good biomedical, health care, education, government. So you have a good
stabilizing factor in terms of volatility of performance in Baltimore, which is good from a portfolio of
construct standpoint. And then you have a very highly educated workforce. They are top-tenant stem
jobs, top-tenant graduate degrees as a percentage of workforce. So there's a lot of things that we're doing
for the MSA as a whole. And then you obviously have to narrow it down to a submarket call, which is
what we did with Rogers Sports. So we're not necessarily at Baltimore-proper. So we had to pick the right
submarket. So that's kind of what led us there over the long term. Short-term volatility, obviously, comes
through in results, but it's more of a long-term play. So maybe Jerry wants to close it out.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes, I would just add, it is one of the markets we see where there's going to be elevated supply this
year versus last year, a couple of thousand units. When we look at our submarkets, we've got about 700
of those units are coming within a mile of our property, in the Towson area. So last year, we did 3.1%
revenue growth. This year, we expect it to be down in the 2s. So again, I think, as Joe said, we like the
market, but that's more of a mid- and long term, not a -- how is it going to do better in a year. And I think
over the next year, we're going to be...

Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

John, are you there? You might be on mute.

Operator, do we have anyone else left in the queue?

Operator

Yes, we do. Our next person in queue is John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Harry, hoping you could describe for us on the DCP front and the bid intents year-end. Just the last 3 to 6
months, how the competition has fared one way or the other?

Harry G. Alcock
Chief Investment Officer & Senior VP

Sure, John. I think you've seen supply has been relatively stable. There continues to be demand from
developers. There's also additional competition from a number of debt funds. It's been the same in the
past 12 or 18 months. We're continuing to find opportunities that sort of fit our parameters in terms of
assets that we want to own long term. They fit our return hurdles. You saw in the close of deal in Oakland
last year. We have others that we're looking as we look to not only backfill our core pipeline but also add
incrementals.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

As of pricing, within that solid deal flow, does the pricing on deals become more competitive?

Harry G. Alcock
Chief Investment Officer & Senior VP

I think there are circumstances where it has been. Again, just as you have more players in this space.
But the deals we're doing, we're underwriting a consistent IRR. We're always looking for deals that fit our
parameters. So our expectation is that the transactions we enter into, the returns will be very consistent
to what we've done historically.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr.
Toomey for closing remarks.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Well, a quick closing. I want to thank you for your time and interest in UDR. Clearly, you can hear that
we're excited about 2020, and certainly, our future beyond that. We have the right team, the right plan,
just look forward to executing on it. And we look forward to seeing many of you in the conferences in the
near future. Take care.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You
may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.
