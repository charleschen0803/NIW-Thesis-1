Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Evergy
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being
recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lori Wright, Vice President, Corporate
Planning, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Lori A. Wright
VP of Corporate Planning, Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Evergy's fourth quarter call. Thank you
for joining us this morning.

Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the disclosure in our SEC
filings contain a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our
expectations and include additional information on non-GAAP financial measures.

We issued our fourth quarter earnings release and 2019 10-K earlier this morning. These items are
available along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information for the quarter on the
main page of our website at evergyinc.com.

On the call today, we have Terry Bassham, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tony Somma,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are with us and will
be available during the question-and-answer portion of the call.

As summarized on Slide 3, Terry will recap the year and provide a strategic business update. Tony will
update you on the details of our latest financial results and 2020 drivers.

With that, I'll hand the call to Terry.

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Lori, and good morning, everybody. Let's start on Slide 5. .

We reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.79 per share compared to $2.50 per share earned in 2018.
Adjusted earnings per share were $2.89 in 2019 compared to $2.54 per share a year ago. The fair results
were driven by reducing operating expenses, fewer shares outstanding and rate case outcomes, partially
offset by higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. Our ability to overcome headwinds and execute
our merger plan, particularly through the disciplined cost management allowed us to deliver consistently
throughout the year.

2019 was successful on many fronts. Let me touch on a few of the highlights. We exceeded our 2019
net merger savings target of $110 million, ending the year at $150 million or 36% above target and
drove our adjusted O&M down over 9% on a year-over-year basis. We raised our dividend by 6.3% to an
indicated annual rate of $2.02 per share. We executed our capital allocation plan by investing $1.2 billion
in infrastructure to maintain customer liability as well as continued our share repurchase program that
was announced as part of our merger plan. We returned almost $2.1 billion in capital to our shareholders
with $1.6 billion coming through share repurchases and another $463 million in the form of dividends.
We elected Plant in Service Accounting, or PISA, in Missouri and initiated infrastructure spending that
is incentivized by the legislation. We rebranded our operating utilities to provide consistency across our
service territory. And now all customers across Kansas and Missouri, know us as Evergy.

We advanced our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and announced the new
carbon reduction commitment that will reduce CO2 emissions 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels. We

EVERGY, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 02, 2020

maintained our strong customer reliability metrics, and lastly and importantly, we continue to build the
Evergy culture by staying true our 4 core values of safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability. I want to
thank our entire team for their continued focus and teamwork on these accomplishments.

Now looking at Slide 6. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in November, we have been
evaluating additional capital investment opportunities and believe that there were significant additional
infrastructure investment opportunities in Missouri. With a full year of post merger capital planning under
our belts, we've used a rigorous allocation process to identify and prioritize projects that enhance grid
reliability while reducing operations and maintenance expense. As a result of our work, we're announcing
$1.5 billion of incremental infrastructure spending opportunities through 2024 in areas including renewable
generation and grid modernization. This raises our 5-year CapEx plan from $6.1 billion to $7.6 billion.

With PISA enacted in Missouri, which is designed to encourage enhanced infrastructure investment,
majority of the incremental spend or approximately $1 billion will be directed towards PISA-qualified
projects. This update to our capital plan will increase our rate base growth to 3% to 4% over this period
relative to our prior guidance of 2% to 3%. This enables us to undertake critical investments that will
improve the service we provide to our customers while also delivering what we believe is a more attractive
and balanced growth profile for our shareholders.

With the increased capital investment, we have elected to halt the remainder of our share repurchase
program. As of the end of 2019, we had completed 75% of our repurchase program, repurchasing 45
million of the 60 million share authorization. Halting the final 15 million shares is expected to be credit
positive and creates balance sheet capacity to make infrastructure investments.

I want to reiterate that our overall objective of targeting competitive shareholder returns, maintaining
reliability and keeping customer rights competitive has not changed. We believe our updated capital
allocation strategy will drive greater benefits for our customers and communities from enhanced reliability
and grid resiliency while aligning with Missouri's initiative of building infrastructure and creating jobs. This
is a true win-win across the board.

Moving on to Slide 7. I'll update you on our merger savings. A large part of our merger thesis was built
upon leveraging the synergies of neighboring service territories and creating value for all shareholders.
At the time of our merger, both legacy companies had room for improvement from a cost perspective.
Our progress thus far has already surpassed our original benchmarking. As I mentioned earlier, we've
exceeded our estimated 2019 $110 million original net merger savings target by 36%, and we'll continue
to focus on overachieving these original targets, which were established during our merger regulatory
proceeding.

We've identified additional opportunities for performance improvement. We've evaluated our
benchmarking performance in 2018 and now have 2019 results. This has yielded a positive trend in our
cost performance as we've seen a significant decline in our costs, particularly when adjusting for cost
that were a result of the merger. To maintain the momentum of our positive cost trajectory, we'll continue
to focus on opportunities to streamline, automate, digitize and otherwise enhance our processes and
performance execution.

While the merger provided a platform for synergies, our intensity around cost management remains
paramount, as evidenced by our expected 5% to 8% O&M reduction in 2020. We continue to execute on
the opportunities that were identified in the merger, and we'll continue to focus on future cost reduction
opportunities. Our team is engaged in ongoing continuous improvement to drive value for our stakeholders
through aggressive cost management.

Now looking at Slide 8. Beyond our strong financial and operations results, we're continuing our focus on
being good stewards of the environment. We've already reduced carbon emissions by 45% from the 2005
levels. And as we announced on our third quarter call, we expect to achieve at least 80% carbon reduction
through natural retirements. However, we'll continue to evaluate and consider additional opportunities to
execute on these plans sooner if possible and appropriate.

EVERGY, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 02, 2020

As part of providing [indiscernible] energy to customers, we're continuously looking for new ways to make
renewable energy available. As you may have seen in our recent press release, we've contracted 660
megawatts of wind to fulfill a large commercial and industrial customer demand on new special green
tariffs that we worked hard to put in place during our 2018 rate cases. The 4 announced wind farms,
which were originally identified through the RFP process, conducted right after our merger in late '18
will be added via purchase power agreement consistent with the tariffs in Missouri and Kansas. Again,
as evidenced by our carbon target, we will continuously decarbonize our generation mix, consistent with
providing reliable and affordable service to our customers and currently have included 500 million of rate
base renewables in our 5-year plan.

Our next triennial IRP filing in both Kansas and Missouri is scheduled for 2021. This will be our first long
filing as Evergy as well as our first-time's filing in Kansas.

The green tariffs are an important economic development tool that our team has been marketing in order
to retain top customers and attract large customers that otherwise may not locate in our service territory.

Before I turn it over to Tony, I'd like to discuss the agreement we announced this morning with Elliott
Management. As part of the agreement, Paul Keglevic, former Chief Executive Officer; Energy Future
Holdings and Kirk Andrews, current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NRG Energy,
have been appointed to the board as new independent directors. At the time of the 2020 Annual Meeting
of Shareholders in May, the size of the board will be reduced to 13 directors, following the retirement of 4
current Evergy directors. We will provide additional information regarding the 13 directors who will stand
for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting in our proxy in the coming weeks.

Further, we're forming a strategic review and operations committee, I will be on the committee along with
Art Stall, Paul Keglevic and Kirk Andrews, the committee will explore ways to enhance shareholder value.
The committee plans to complete its review and make any relevant recommendations to the Evergy board
in the first half of 2020.

Given the mandate of the strategic review and operations committee, we will hold off on issuing current
year and long-term earnings guidance while the committee conducts its review. While we expect to
provide comprehensive updated guidance at the conclusion of the committee's work, we'll provide
more details today regarding some of our expected 2020 drivers, including the enhanced capital plan.
We welcome the new directors and the vast experience they bring in the utility and power industry to
support the work we have underway and enhance long-term shareholder value and serve our customers,
communities and employees. And Elliot recognizes our commitment to serve the best interest of all
Evergy's stakeholders. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us as we look to build upon the
momentum we've created since the merger closed in June of 2018, and we look forward to executing on
the plan.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tony.

Anthony D. Somma
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Terry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results on Slide 10 of the presentation.

This morning, we reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share compared to $0.07 per
share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Increase in EPS is primarily due to lower O&M, lower shares outstands
and tax benefits from higher amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes, which were partially
offset by higher depreciation expense. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings were $0.32 per share compared to
$0.15 per share in the same period a year ago.

As shown in the chart on Slide 11, adjusted EPS was driven primarily by fewer shares outstanding and
lower O&M and was partially offset by unfavorable weather and higher depreciation expense.

For the quarter, residential sales were down 3%, while commercial and industrial sales fell 1% and
1.8%, respectively. Lower sales in the quarter were primarily due to weather, which we estimate natively
impacted earnings by $0.04 compared to last year and about $0.01 when compared to normal.

EVERGY, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 02, 2020

Moving on to Slide 12. I'll touch on full year results. For the year, GAAP earnings were $670 million or
$2.79 per share compared to the $536 million or $2.50 per share last year. 2019 GAAP results were
driven by the full year impact of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West results and lower operating and
maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and lower retail sales, driven by
unfavorable weather compared to 2018.

Adjusted earnings were $694 million or $2.89 per share compared to 2018 adjusted earnings of $681
million or $2.50 per share. As detailed on the slide, the increase in adjusted earnings when compared to
last year was primarily driven by a reduction in O&M of about $120 million; a decrease of more than 9%,
new retail rates and accretion from fewer shares outstanding. Partially offsetting this increase was higher
depreciation expense of around $84 million and lower sales due to less favorable weather.

The 2019 weather impact was less favorable than 2018, and pro forma retail sales declined as a result.
Residential sales fell 4.3%, and commercial sales were down 1.7%. We estimate weather costs us $0.22
when compared to last year but was a benefit of about $0.10 when compared to normal.

Pro forma industrial sales were down 1% compared to last year, due primarily to 2 large customers in the
chemical and oil sectors that saw decreased demand at their plants throughout the year. If we remove the
impact of these 2 large low-margin customers, industrial sales were up 20 basis points.

Overall, growth in the number of customers continued, making the ninth straight year of customer growth
for our company.

Moving on to Slide 13, let me touch on our latest financing activities. As Terry mentioned, we have ceased
future share repurchases, given our identification of incremental capital projects that drive value for
customers. Since initiating the program in August of 2018, we have repurchased just over 45 million
shares. This program was put in place to rebalance the consolidated capital structure and was a key
driver of EPS growth on the front end of our merger plan as we've been working through our rate stay-out
period.

Looking forward to financing activities this year, Evergy Central Kansas (sic) [ Evergy Kansas Central ] has
$250 million, a 5.1% first mortgage bonds maturing in July that we'll look to refinance. We expect this will
be the only long-term debt financing activity in 2020.

Wrapping up on Slide 14, let me give some details on our 2020 drivers. As Terry mentioned, we are not
issuing 2020 EPS guidance today, I'd like to provide you with a few drivers for the year. Consistent with
2019, we're expecting weather-normalized sales to be between flat and 50 basis points of growth. On
the back of strong O&M cost performance in 2019, we're targeting an additional 5% to 8% reduction in
adjusted O&M in 2020. Our continued infrastructure spending will drive depreciation and amortization
expense $10 million to $20 million higher. We're expecting COLI proceeds to be approximately $20 million.
We're forecasting an effective income tax rate of 12% to 14%. And lastly, our year-end 2019 share count
was 227 million shares.

We remain confident in the opportunities in front of us, our team will keep our eye on the ball of running
the business while the strategic review and operations committee conducts its evaluation.

With that, I will turn the call back over to Terry.

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director
Okay. We'll open up the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just a couple of questions here. With the strategic or operational review results. 1H 2020 seems
like a very quick turnaround. Any incremental, Terry, you can provide as far as what you're thinking?
Obviously, given this quick turnaround, I have to assume you have some sort of a sense on where things
are heading. And just on the word "strategic, "could that mean that Evergy looks at further consolidation?
Or is that kind of off the table? And I have a follow-up.

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, not to predetermine what the committee would come up with, I would say that the focus is on all
things that could improve long-term shareholder value. So those can include several things. And we would
expect to review those. I think the idea was to do that quickly. So to be efficient and to get those done in
a way that makes sense for all parties. So looking forward to the work, looking forward to working with
our 2 new directors on it. And we would be -- look forward to get started quickly.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the CapEx. It's a big increase with $1 billion from Missouri under
PISA. Also, obviously, a very big healthy O&M cut. Just curious, why not have pulled more spending
forward in Kansas. I mean just a rough math, with $80 million O&M reduction, that should translate into
like $0.5 billion in annual capital opportunities without impacting retail rates. So why not spend more in
Kansas with the O&M levers? And then I didn't get sense from the slides if the incremental CapEx, what
the profile of it is, whether it's front-end loaded or spread evenly? Just maybe get a sense there.

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Okay. On the first question, I would say, obviously that with the capacity from PISA, which we've talked
about as early as second quarter call and began in the third quarter call, obviously that provides a focus
from the state of Missouri on infrastructure spend, jobs, those kinds of things. So it makes more sense to
focus on the recovery mechanism there. We have to continue to be cautious in Kansas because of the lag
time between spend and recovery. That's not to say we wouldn't spend additional in Kansas as well, but
we obviously want to be more measured, and the immediate focus would be on PISA. .

In terms of what kind of projects? I'll let Kevin give you some color on what kind of things we're looking at
from that perspective.

Kevin E. Bryant
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Shar, so it's pretty balanced. I mean, the increase is across all 5 years. Obviously, we have to be
mindful of the rate cases we have in Missouri in the 2021 time frame. But the types of projects, fairly
evenly split on -- in the grid-mod area across distribution and transmission. We've got condition-based
asset replacements that we're focused on along with adding automation across our system. So it's a pretty
balanced increase across the -- across our grid, and we plan to manage that through the 5-year time
frame.

EVERGY, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 02, 2020

Got it. And then just lastly on sort of the merger savings you guys are -- you've almost hit your target
there. Is there any opportunities because you attained it relatively quickly?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean, I think we believe that our focus from executing on the very clear process we went through
from a merger connotation to ongoing process improvement. So we've continued to look for opportunities
there. And we think there is additional opportunity that will help, not only drive those O&M costs down,
but create headroom for additional CapEx that we've talked about today.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Congrats on Kirk Andrews, that's a great add to your team.

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Thank you much.

Operator

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Congratulations on all the development.

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just to pick up where Shar left off. If I can follow-up. These O&M got contemplated here. How do you
think about your earned ROE through the forecast period? And also, how does this reconcile with earlier
commitments in Kansas? I imagine -- from the last transaction, I imagine, to a large extent, those have
rolled off, but I just want to be very clear about that?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Yes, let me take a shot at that and be sure I understood your question. We continue to expect to earn
our allowed ROEs. I think one of the things that we're trying to be clear about and proud of is that even
though we had 2 regulatory orders that created a bit of a headwind last fall, we've been able to drive
additional O&M savings to overcome that. So we continue to believe we'll earn our allowed ROEs in our
utilities as we planned originally.

And then you kind of faded out the back end of your question is, what was the...

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes, just about the Kansas commitments, if you can. Just from the deal, to the extent at which that there
were certain involuntary reduction commitment at that time? I imagine implicit in this announcement that
you're still in compliance with that as well, and the commitments are -- the cost savings wherever they
are to be found are independent from any other commitments you made?

EVERGY, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 02, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Yes. We obviously have commitments in both states around our mergers, and everything we've discussed
today is in the context of keeping our commitments to our customers, our regulators and our states. No
doubt about it.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And to the extent to which that you've created a strategic effort here and obviously announced process,
have you vetted this with Kansas and Missouri in whatever fashion?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Well, obviously, we just made the announcement today. So we'll be obviously talking to all of our
stakeholders going forward about what it means, what the process is and keeping them informed. We
have very good regulatory relationships, and we would continue to work with them to be sure we answer
any of their questions.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Excellent. And sorry, last question here, if I can. Just as you think about the cadence of CapEx involved
here. How do you think about equity and balance sheet needs, particularly given the share buyback
cancellation? Obviously, you had a certain projection. I just want to be very clear about this, about what
your equity needs for the full 5-year period are?

Anthony D. Somma
Executive VP & CFO

Julien, this is Tony. We don't anticipate issuing equity to fund the capital plan that we announced today.

Operator

And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just on the committee, the board committee that's been formed. In the release, it talks about among
options looking at strategic combinations? Like, could you maybe give a little bit of color on how that
would work? Are you actually -- is that an invite for people to present stuff? Are you going to go outward
to people on that? Or how are you going to look at that aspect?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Well, we -- obviously, the committee hasn't even met yet. So from a process perspective, we're yet
to work through that. But obviously, with our time period in place, we'll be putting together a plan to
evaluate both of the path that we've talked about. So don't have a lot of details. And wouldn't want to get
ahead of the committee in terms of specific process before they even had their first meeting.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then there is -- the committee is made up of 2 current board members and 2 board -- new
board members? Like what happens if there is a 2-2 and they don't necessarily agree, is there like a
process for that?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

EVERGY, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 02, 2020

There is. There's a process set up to make sure that we're very transparent about any disagreement
among the committee and ultimately what the Board decides. Ultimately, recommendations would go to
the Board, and the Board would make a decision. But to the extent there was a disagreement, we would
want to be transparent about what the recommendations were, and that's built into the agreement we
have.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then just one technical question. The Sibley case and the appeal of that. Is that -- could you
give an update if there's any timing or update on the Sibley case?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

No, it's still early in that process. Unfortunately, appeals from the commission is a very, very slow delivery
process. So it wouldn't be in the near term.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. I actually have one other question, sorry. The -- at a high level and ignoring kind of 2020, but just
long term, is it fair to say that redirecting more money to CapEx relative to the buyback is additive to your
plan?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Long -- obviously, long -- short term, obviously, not buying back the shares in the next 6 months
would affect near-term earnings per share. Long term, we believe this is a better allocation of capital and
will drive long-term shareholder value, no doubt.

Operator

And our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Just to sort of get a better picture on the CapEx improvement. Obviously, you guys are aware of the
arbitrage of the last question and sort of the benefits of CapEx versus the buyback. I'm just sort of trying
to get a sense as to the substantial increase. What -- what's driven the revised outlook, if you follow me? I
mean what was sort of the trigger that got you guys to come up with so much of an increase in CapEx?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Well, obviously, as we started through the buyback program coming out of the merger, we had an over
equitized capital structure, and we had a plan for driving EPS growth in the near term through the
buyback while not overspending or not spending additional CapEx that would drive either lag or increases
in customers' rates. But as we work through the plan, and again, we're about 75% through that original
buyback process, we looked at opportunities for long-term growth. And as PISA kicked in, it became a lot
more clear to us, PISA, as a tool, was very helpful. We talked about again as early as our second quarter
call about there being up to maybe $1 billion of capacity there that we were evaluating, and we worked on
specific projects that we could make as part of that. And so we began to work on the transition from the
buyback into additional CapEx spend that would be grid modernization and types of projects that would
reduce O&M, all focused on being more efficient and lower cost for our customers. That's kind of the --
that's the high-level version. Does that make sense?

Paul Patterson

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

EVERGY, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 02, 2020

Okay. No, I think so. So just in terms of the O&M reduction that would be associated with the improved
CapEx. Can you give us any sort of rough quantification as to what that might be? Like how much savings
in O&M are resulting from the CapEx deployment?

Anthony D. Somma
Executive VP & CFO

Paul, this is Tony. So we've given some drivers for near term for 2020, but we're not going to go out
further than that until the committee kind of finishes its work and its review. And obviously, we're focused
on cost management and we'll -- that will continue to be a focus of this team.

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Obviously, in terms of O&M improvement, though, there are some things that would naturally happen from
that kind of investment. I don't know, Kevin, you got any...

Kevin E. Bryant
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So Paul, I mean embedded in the 2020 drivers is that 5% to 8% reduction that Tony referenced.
So that's the order of magnitude, what we'd expect to see this next year moving forward. And moving
forward, headcount is a big piece of it. We've talked about managing our headcount down through
attrition. We're doing it consistent with the merger commitments. We're getting more efficient in that
regard. We're still seeing savings in our back office. We call them merger savings, but it's in the supply
chain area and benefits, insurance, all those normal corporate overheads. And we continue to look for
efficiencies at Wolf Creek. So we got pretty strong confidence. We had a strong year in 2019. We expect
significant performance in 2020, and we'll keep looking for opportunities moving forward.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Yes, absolutely. I was just wondering on the CapEx side, if there was some sort of rule of thumb or some
sort of sense. In other words, I guess what I'm saying is, I -- you guys have obviously executed quite well
on the merger synergies and all the other things that you're looking at. I'm just trying to get a sense as to
when you're looking at that kind of CapEx -- when we look at the CapEx, how much of a reduction, if you
guys have it, if you don't -- if it's too early, that's okay. But if there was any sort of rule of thumb, so to
speak, if we're putting as much CapEx in this push cost might be coming out kind of thing on O&M sort of
basis? Is there anything like that?

Kevin E. Bryant
Executive VP & COO

I don't have a great rule of thumb for you, Paul. I mean it all depends on where the CapEx is going. Our
system starting on at a fairly reliable place. So we expect to see savings, but it's hard to quantify it.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the strategic review. I mean, is that pretty much all of the above? I
mean everything is on the table kind of thing? Or I mean, these are sort of vague terms, if you know? Sort
of trying to get, like, if you -- can you elaborate a little bit more on that? Or...

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Well, only to say that, obviously, everything would be on the table, but there's obviously a focus that's
been discussed, which, given the time frame, there will be a focus to start off with, if we begin to work
and see other opportunities. I'm sure the committee would want to look into that, but there's clearly a
focus as we start the committee work.

EVERGY, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 02, 2020

Operator

And our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Terry, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You will file rate cases in 2021 in all jurisdictions in
Kansas and Missouri?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

No, we're not filing rate cases until '22, '23 in the 2 jurisdictions.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

The 2 being...

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Missouri and Kansas.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I'm sorry, but the individual businesses, the -- and Missouri, you got like 2, you'll file both of those in
2022.

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Right.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I'm glad I asked that, I m misheard that. Okay. And then I guess as a follow-up to that. You
obviously have ties in Missouri, a positive. In Kansas, you did get treated unfairly, I think, in my opinion,
in Kansas late last year on Jeffrey. The staff support of your position, the commission went their own
way. What gives you the confidence going forward that especially with this bump in CapEx that you'll get
treated a little more fairly in Kansas?

Terry D. Bassham
President, CEO & Director

Well, again, I think we do have a good relationship, both with the commission and with the staff. But the
staff, in particular, as you said, agreed with us on that particular ruling. That was not a typical rate --
CapEx investment inclusion in rate case. It was a unique situation where we had a lease that had been in
place for a long time that was converting. So it was a unique situation, and we were disappointed that the
commission didn't agree with us and the staff. But I don't think anything about that suggests to us that
our typical CapEx investment in infrastructure that drives reliability and service to our customers would be
viewed any differently in Kansas than it would in Missouri. And historically, in our rate cases, we've seen
that result.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. You certainly made things interesting in Kansas and Missouri.
