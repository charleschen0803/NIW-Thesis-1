MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. My name is Jacqueline and I will be your operator
for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn
the call over to Doug Wendt. Doug, you may begin.

Douglas Wendt;Manager, Investor Relations

Thank you, Jacqueline. Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings
Conference Call.

The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the
Investors tab.

On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, CFO; Mike Hennigan, CEO of MPLX
as well as other members of the executive team. As you know, Kristina Kazarian typically hosts this call. I
am doing that today because Kristina is celebrating the arrival of a baby girl 1.5 weeks ago. Both Kristina
and baby Agnes are doing well.

We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making
forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results
may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are
included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.

Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks and highlights on Slide 3.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thanks, Doug, and good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I too would like to congratulate
Kristina and look forward to her return in a few weeks.

If you please would turn to Slide #3. Earlier today, we reported adjusted net income of $1 billion or $1.56
per diluted share. This quarter's performance demonstrates our continued ability to execute across all
aspects of our business and capture incremental synergies at an accelerated pace.

In Refining & Marketing, the team's commercial acumen, coupled with our geographically diverse footprint,
drove tremendous capture results of 105%. Key drivers of capture for the quarter included strong gasoline
price realizations, leveraging our integrated assets and scale to capture geographic base price dislocations
compared to broader market benchmarks and the impact of our strong synergy delivery.

Our refining team executed turnarounds, performed engineering projects and completed major
maintenance at multiple refineries. At Garyville, the crude revamp project and the first phase of the
corporate expansion project were commissioned, allowing us to realize higher coker unit rates from the
expanded drum size. The second phase of the coker project is on schedule to be completed in the first
quarter of 2020.

Early operating results in the first quarter coker have been very positive, and we have been able to
achieve a 17% capacity increase, exceeding our original project expectations. We expect -- anticipate that
the second phase of the project -- to achieve a similar rate increase.

Our Speedway team also executed well this quarter. They delivered strong results while also exceeding our
cumulative store conversion target, with over 700 stores converted to the Speedway platform since the
combination.

In the Midstream segment, we progressed strategic long-haul pipeline projects that are key to the
development of our integrated Permian to Gulf Coast logistics system. Additionally, Northeast gathered,

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

processed and fractionated volumes were up 18%, 14% and 12%, respectively, in 2019 versus 2018,
demonstrating continued growth and strong performance in this region.

Our team's execution this quarter continued the trend of a very impressive synergy capture. We have
realized over $420 million of synergies in the fourth quarter. It has been over a year since the combination
with Andeavor. As a result of our focus on integration and outstanding execution over that period, our
full year realized synergies now have totaled $1.1 billion. We believe MPC will build upon this platform
and continue to capture substantial incremental value in 2020 and beyond. Don will provide more details
around our synergy capture later on the call.

Now let me briefly share some thoughts on the macro environment. While current U.S. gasoline inventory
levels have been high in the first few weeks of the year, we believe this is a function of healthy supply
and high utilization in the fourth quarter. We anticipate inventory levels to moderate with the upcoming
seasonal RVP transition. We expect U.S. gasoline demand to remain similar to last year's levels, supported
by a steady economic outlook and stable labor market.

Overall, U.S. diesel inventory levels remain relatively constructive, trending slightly below the midpoint of
the 5-year average. Warmer-than-normal temperatures in the northeast have recently weakened distillate
demand, but we do not expect this near-term weakness to persist as underlying fundamentals for light
products remain supportive.

Continuing to support this constructive outlook, spring turnaround activity globally is expected to be
close to last year's record levels, peaking at 8 million to 9 million barrels per day of crude capacity off-
line in March and April. Furthermore, we believe the impact of additional global refining capacity will be
moderated by low utilization for less complex foreign refineries due to the collapse of high sulfur fuel oil
prices.

Turning to crude. We have seen the WCS differential widen since October, partly supported by easing of
mandated production cuts and incremental rail loadings. On the light sweet side, we anticipate a slight
narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread through the rest of the year as new pipeline takeaway and Gulf Coast
export capacity comes online. Prompt medium and heavy sour differentials are currently narrower than
expected in a post-IMO world primarily due to supply constraints, geopolitical instability and strong U.S.
and Asian demand. However, we anticipate heavy sour prices to weaken as HSFO continues to become a
discounted alternative feedstock.

We are focused on minimizing our exposure to weak HSFO product pricing by destroying the vast majority
of internally produced resid in our own system, aided by the successful expansion at our Garyville coker.
We are also importing third-party HSFO into our West Coast facilities as an advantaged feedstock for
our cokers. With low sulfur fuel oil prices meaningfully elevated relative to gasoline and diesel, we are
also utilizing our robust coastal logistics systems to opportunistically export low sulfur VGO and other
components into the bunker market at a premium. We expect refining margins to strengthen throughout
the first quarter from seasonal factors in transportation markets and the industry's continued response to
IMO implementation. We are optimistic about the prospects for our business. With continuous progress of
high-grading our Midstream project backlog, we are targeting positive free cash flow generation across the
MPLX business in 2021.

In Retail, our team is making good progress on the Speedway separation while continuing to identify
opportunities to grow merchandise margin through store conversions and remodels. In refining, we
have made significant enhancements in the operations and reliability of the assets we acquired, and we
continue to believe that the configuration and upgrade capacity at our coastal refineries positions us well
to capture the market opportunities that are expected to arise from the implementation of IMO 2020
regulations. Coupled with our impressive synergy capture so far and the opportunities we have before
us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering compelling financial results and maximizing
shareholder value.

Let me conclude my comments providing an update on some of our recent strategic actions. Our work on
Speedway is progressing as planned, and we are targeting early fourth quarter for the completion of the
separation. The Midstream special committee is advancing its work as we continue to expect -- provide an

update during the first quarter. And the CEO search committee is also progressing their work on schedule,
with expectations to be complete in the latter part of the first quarter.

Now let me turn the call over to Mike who will provide an update on our Midstream segment. Mike?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Gary.

Turning to Slide 4. Today, we updated MPLX' 2020 growth capital target to approximately $1.5 billion,
down from the approximately $2 billion target shared last quarter. This reduction shows our ongoing
commitment to high grade our project portfolio. We are also targeting growth capital of approximately $1
billion for 2021. We continue to emphasize the growth of the L&S segment. We also remain focused on
advancing our strategy of creating integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian
to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

For the past several years, we have been committed to funding our growth project portfolio without
issuing equity. Given our attractive growth capital project portfolio, we have historically funded around
50% of our growth needs with debt. We have done so while maintaining healthy distribution coverage
of around 1.4x and investment-grade leverage of approximately 4x. Assuming continued growth in our
earnings and growth capital of approximately $1.5 billion and approximately $1 billion in 2020 and 2021,
respectively, we are expecting to achieve positive excess free cash flow generation in 2021.

The targeted reduction in capital is expected to allow the funding of our distribution and capital program
entirely from internally generated cash flow as well as provide us with improved capital allocation flexibility
to pursue opportunities, including leverage reduction or unit repurchases. With continued earnings growth
and investment discipline, we believe that we will be positioned to pursue incremental capital allocation
opportunities, broadening our value creation options and enhancing long-term flexibility.

Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover financial highlights for the quarter.

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike.

Slide 5 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported adjusted
earnings of $1.56 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion for the quarter. Operating cash flow
before working capital was approximately $2.7 billion. We returned $409 million to shareholders in the
fourth quarter, bringing the total to $3.3 billion of capital returned to shareholders in 2019, including
approximately $2 billion in share repurchases.

Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from third quarter to fourth quarter. Adjusted
EBITDA was up approximately $100 million quarter-over-quarter driven by higher earnings in all segments
of the business. Fourth quarter results included a noncash impairment charge of approximately $1.2 billion
related to goodwill associated with gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor
combination.

Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 51%. This is significantly higher than our historical rate
due to the effects of the nontaxable -- nontax-deductible Midstream goodwill impairment and a biodiesel
tax credit included in pretax income. Excluding these items, our overall adjusted tax rate for the quarter
would have been approximately 17.5%. This adjusted rate was also lower than our normal 21% effective
tax rate primarily as a result of discrete tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter.

Before reviewing the details of each segment, I would like to discuss our synergy capture for the quarter.
As shown on Slide 7, we realized $420 million of synergies in the fourth quarter, including $91 million of
onetime synergies, offset by $48 million of system integration costs. For the full year, we realized over
$1.1 billion of synergies. The full year results substantially exceed the $600 million of gross run rate
synergies targeted for 2019.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Slide 8 provides additional insight into our synergy capture for the quarter and full year. For the fourth
quarter, more than 80% of our synergies were in the Refining & Marketing segment. This included
$62 million from catalyst formulation improvements at multiple refineries, $55 million in crude supply
optimization in the Mid-Continent region and $15 million in Marine optimization.

For the full year 2019, the majority of the synergy capture related to operational and commercial
performance in the Refining & Marketing segment. This included: $128 million in catalyst formulation
enhancements at 7 refineries; $76 million in turnaround execution improvements at Los Angeles, Martinez
and St. Paul Park refineries; $127 million in crude supply optimization in the Mid-Continent region; and
$25 million in improved crude sourcing for the West Coast refineries. We also realized $121 million of
synergies in the Retail segment associated with economies of scale and implementation of the Speedway
labor and merchandise models at the newly converted stores. Lastly, we realized $24 million of synergies
in the Midstream segment and $109 million of net corporate synergies. The corporate synergies were
driven by cost eliminations and contract negotiations made possible by the combination.

Moving to our segment results. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third
quarter 2019. MPLX EBITDA increased $3 million versus the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, MPLX
had strong terminal and pipeline throughputs. MPLX also successfully brought online 3 new gas processing
plants and a new fractionator.

We also continued to progress the reversal of the Capline pipeline with the purge of the main line
completed in the fourth quarter. In Texas, the Gray Oak pipeline began initial start-up in the fourth
quarter, and we expect the pipeline to be in full service in the second quarter of 2020.

Slide 10 provides an overview of our Retail segment results. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $636 million.
Retail fuel margins were nearly $0.29 per gallon for the quarter. Merchandise margins decreased by
$47 million compared to the third quarter, reflecting typical seasonality. We continue to see strong
merchandise performance with a 4.7% year-over-year increase in same-store sales. Operating expenses
decreased by $12 million in the fourth quarter.

The increase in the Other column of the walk is due both -- is due to both an asset sale gain as well as a
new commercial diesel branding agreement with Pilot Travel Centers that began in the fourth quarter. The
fuel volumes and associated income related to this agreement are now reflected in the Other portion of
the segment rather than in fuel margin. More details on this agreement can be found in the appendix.

Speedway continues to execute its brand expansion strategy through store conversions. We converted 158
sites in the fourth quarter, bringing the cumulative store conversion count to 708 locations, exceeding our
goal of 700 total cumulative store conversions by the end of 2019.

Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment results. R&M performed very well
despite declines in crack spreads in all regions. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, an
increase of approximately $51 million versus the third quarter.

Despite a $4 per barrel decrease in the Chicago WTI 3-2-1 crack spread, our Mid-Con margin remained
relatively flat for the quarter, reflecting our ability to leverage our diverse geographic footprint to capture
regional market opportunities, particularly in the Salt Lake City and Southwest regions.

In the Gulf Coast region, the reduction in overall margin dollars was primarily related to lower throughputs
associated with planned work at our Garyville refinery.

On the West Coast, our team did an extraordinary job, capturing a $19.44 per barrel margin, an
increase of over $3 per barrel from the third quarter despite a relatively flat indicator crack spread. This
performance demonstrates our ability to use our operational and commercial expertise to [ drive ] value in
this market.

Strong performance across all 3 of our regions led to capture of 105% for the quarter. Slide 21 in the
appendix provides additional details on some of the primary drivers for capture.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Fourth quarter results included a benefit of $153 million for the biodiesel blender's credit attributable to
volumes blended in 2018 and the first 3 quarters of 2019. The benefit was recognized in the fourth quarter
because the legislation authorizing the credit was enacted in December 2019. Refining operating costs
increased versus the third quarter primarily due to planned project work at our Garyville and Los Angeles
facilities.

Slide 12 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash
at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.5 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working
capital was a $2.7 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $334 million use of cash in
the quarter primarily due to changes in inventory levels. Return of capital to MPC shareholders via share
repurchases and dividends totaled $409 million, with $65 million worth of shares acquired in the quarter.

In 2019, we returned $3.3 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. You will recall
that at our Investor Day in December 2018, we articulated our target of returning at least 50% of MPC's
operating cash flow, after maintenance and regulatory capital, to our shareholders. The $3.3 billion we
returned to investors during 2019 substantially exceeded the approximately $2 billion of growth capital
invested in the MPC businesses, excluding MPLX.

As shown on Slide 13, we have a strong track record of maintaining through-cycle financial discipline. At
quarter end, we had approximately $28.8 billion of total consolidated debt, including $19.7 billion of debt
at MPLX, which is nonrecourse to MPC. MPC's parent level debt of approximately $9.1 billion represents
1.2x the last 12 months of MPC's stand-alone EBITDA. This ratio excludes the debt and EBITDA of MPLX,
but includes distributions received from MPLX.

On Slide 14, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of just under 3
million barrels per day.

Planned turnaround costs are projected to be $425 million. Planned work for the quarter includes
turnarounds at our El Paso and Salt Lake City refineries as well as catalyst changes at our Anacortes and
Garyville facilities. Additionally, we have planned maintenance work related to the completion of the coker
drum upgrade project at Garyville and the expansion of the Wilmington hydrocracker, which is the last
phase of the LARIC project. For the year, we anticipate turnaround spend of roughly $1.1 billion to $1.2
billion.

Total operating costs, including major maintenance, are projected to be $6.05 per barrel for the quarter.
Distribution costs are projected to be $1.3 billion, which is consistent with historic guidance. Corporate
costs are projected to be $225 million for the quarter, which is slightly higher than previous quarters
primarily due to corporate contributions and benefit adjustments that typically occur in the first quarter of
every year.

Slide 15 provides our capital investment plan for 2020, which remains focused on strengthening the
earnings power of our business through growth and margin-enhancing investments across the enterprise.
MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $2.6 billion. The plan includes $1.55 billion
for the Refining & Marketing segment, of which approximately $450 million is for maintenance capital.
Our growth investments in Refining & Marketing are focused on high-return projects that enhance margin,
produce higher-value products and promote resid destruction.

We expect to invest approximately $550 million in the Retail segment primarily to build new Speedway
stores and to rebuild and remodel existing Speedway locations. The plan also includes approximately
$300 million for our Midstream segment and approximately $200 million to support corporate activities.
Midstream segment capital projects include the Capline reversal and the South Texas Gateway terminal
project.

As Mike mentioned earlier, MPLX also announced its 2020 capital investment plan, which includes
approximately $1.5 billion of organic growth capital and $250 million of maintenance capital.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Doug.

Question and Answer

Operator

Our first question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question, Gary, you shared a lot of helpful color on your thoughts on how things are going to
progress here from a macro perspective. Just wanted to hear additional thoughts on high sulfur fuel
oil. You had talked about your expectations that prices would continue to come down there and then
pressure the sweet sour spreads. But obviously, recently, you've seen a rather strong improvement or
strengthening in the high sulfur fuel oil cracks. So what do you think is happening there? And then how do
you foresee this playing out?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. Phil, let me turn that over to Ray Brooks and give you some color on this.

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

As far as high sulfur fuel oil, we have seen that incentive, and we've taken advantage of that with our
system. I kind of want to break that into 2 pieces. The first is our internal production of high sulfur fuel oil
where we don't have coking capacity. What we've done, through our investments at our coking refineries,
is have the logistics that essentially we're taking all that material, and we're taking it to our coastal
refineries for coastal with cokers and [ destructing ] that.

The other thing is we're configured for additional high sulfur fuel oil, and we're taking advantage of that.
The biggest thing, thus far, is out on the West Coast, between LAR and Martinez. We're in the 20,000 to
30,000 barrels a day range of purchase feedstock. We talked earlier on the call about our work in the first
quarter with Garyville completing that coker work. Once that's done, we'll have similar opportunities at
Garyville.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just from a macro perspective, maybe Gary, your thoughts as to why the cracks have
strengthened so much. And do you see a reweakening of high sulfur fuel oil cracks coming?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, this is -- has really been our strategy all along, that we didn't see that we would see a increase in
the cracks due to higher [ distillate ] prices on the front end. We really saw it as a feedstock advantage on
the front end as Ray just discussed.

Now as we go forward and it appears to us, we're getting -- the market is starting to strengthen. And
we're seeing pretty strong compliance with the shipping companies and switching over to the low sulfur
fuel oil. And we think this bodes well. We never expected in the first 3 or 4 weeks of January to have an
acceleration in the distillate cracks. We thought this would come and would be stair-stepped into the year,
and that's still how we feel, Phil.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Okay. Second question would just be on the capital spending where obviously we've seen some reduction
in the planned spending here. The refining growth CapEx is still fairly elevated in 2020. And I know in
the past, Gary, I think you've talked some potential for that to come down further, especially as we look
beyond 2020. So is that something that you would still expect?

And then if I could tie in, just the turnaround spending number is also up quite a bit year-over-year. Is this
just an elevated turnaround year? And is that something you'd also expect to come down more in future
years?

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Phil, this is Don. Let me address sort of CapEx first, and then I'll have Ray talk a little bit about the
turnaround spending.

So you'll recall that in December 2018 at our Investor Day, we targeted about $2.8 billion of capital for
MPC, excluding MPLX. Our target -- and [ also ] targeted basically flat capital spending in 2020 from that
$2.8 billion. So our total capital budget for MPC, excluding MPLX, is down. And as you rightfully say, there
are some projects that are multiyear projects. So about 40% of our refining growth capital is related to
the STAR projects, so that's the one at GBR and the Dickinson renewable diesel project. The Dickinson
renewable diesel project will essentially be complete at the end of the year, so all of that capital will fall
off. And the STAR project, its spending will be substantially less in 2021 than in 2020. So your comment
about some of those ongoing capital projects tapering off is absolutely correct. So let me turn it over then
to Ray to talk a little bit about turnarounds.

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Okay, Phil. Hey, when we did the combination back in 2018, the turnaround spend, go-forward spend, was
not as ratable as we would prefer. 2019, even though we did a lot of work at Los Angeles, Martinez and St.
Paul Park, it was a little lighter than average. 2020 will be a little heavier on average, particularly in the
first quarter, but we're working that our go-forward schedule is going to be more even year in and year
out.

Our biggest work in the first -- is in the first quarter of 2020. We're currently in the latter stages at El Paso
doing a turnaround on the south side of that refinery. And then we'll follow that up with pretty much a full
plant refinery at Salt Lake City. And both of these are 7-year, cycle-ending turnarounds, so not a whole lot
of options to work with there.

And then the other piece that's major in this quarter is we have the second phase of our Garyville coker
max project. It's just starting in a couple of weeks, coupled with the catalyst change. So higher first
quarter, but when margins are low, that's when we really want to load our turnaround spend.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Gary, I have a feeling this might be your last earnings call. And so I just want to wish you all the best, but
also ask you to maybe frame your outlook for the macro going forward.

Specifically, is IMO playing out as you expected? I know you touched on it a few minutes ago, but it seems
things are a little softer, at least on the product side. And I wonder if I could have you elaborate on your
confidence, let's say, that the new capacity additions going forward might be met with run cuts in less-
advantaged areas?

And I've got a follow-up for Don, please. But again, I hope to run into you again, Gary, and thanks for
everything you've done over the years.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Okay. Thank you, Doug. Maybe in the future, you can take me to a proper dinner. That's a long history
with Doug. So Doug, the -- yes, as I just stated, we think IMO is starting off like we had anticipated.
And we were conservative in our views on IMO, did not expect a significant run-up in crack spreads.
Now of course, this has been a bit of a downward move recently with the coronavirus, but I think that
will -- I think distillate demand will certainly pick up quickly in the aftermath of this. But I -- as I said
first, we were looking at feedstocks to be depressed and to give us higher margins being able to run the
feedstocks. That is happening.

We are being able to eradicate all of the resid in our own system by moving it into our coastal refineries
as Ray just mentioned. That's right on target with what we expected. And as I said, we never expected a
immediate run-up in distillate pricing. We think this is going to be more steady and stairstep over the year.
And I think the most positive thing that we're seeing is what appears to be the compliance of the shipping
companies. And -- so yes, I would say, Doug, it's right on target where we expected. Ray wants to add
another comment.

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes. The other thing regarding run cuts. The thing that I would offer -- we talked about resid destruction.
We talked a little bit about diesel. The other factor with IMO is VGO and how it plays into it. So what we've
seen is a very, very strong VGO market. And so we pivoted on that so -- mainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast
where we've taken about 50,000 barrels a day out of our cat crackers and putting that in the VGO market.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

And I would say the last part...

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Go ahead, Gary.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Those coastal refineries of which we believe we have the highest leverage to anyone in the industry. But
the coastal refineries that have the processing ability to handle the heavy resid and destroy that in our
coking system, when you look across the globe, those refineries that have that processing are going to
be advantaged. And we expect probably some East Coast and European refineries who do not have that
capability will have a hard time competing on the front end here.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I appreciate all your comments. I do not want to elaborate on this question too much, but Ray, could I
just touch on your VGO comment? I mean we've all been hoping that might happen. But do you think
it's enough to perhaps clean up the gasoline weakness that we've been seeing here in the last several
quarters?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Doug, I would say, the thing that you're going to see immediately to clean up the gasoline inventories is
the RVP changeover. That will be starting here in just a couple of weeks, and that will accelerate anything
then in VGO. Dave, do you agree with that comment?

Senior Vice President of Light Products Supply & Logistics

Yes. So when we -- we get started actually out west with the RVP turn in a few days really. But additional
to the RVP turn, Gary, is the shutdown schedule coming up. That also tends to put a draw on not only gas,
but diesel inventories.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Does that help?

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. It does indeed, Gary. My follow-up, very quickly, and I will hopefully keep it quick because I've been
talking a long time about this stuff already. Just the capture rates and the synergies, I'm just wondering
if the synergies are flowing through just obviously a little bit quicker. Are we now seeing upside risk, a
permanent reset in your capture rates or maybe the likelihood that you're going to go out with a bang,
Gary, and reset the synergies higher sometime this year? That seems to be where it's trending for sure.
But I'll leave it there. And again, congrats, Gary. I hope to run into you soon.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. You bet, Doug. I'm going to turn it over to Don. But let me say, this is something we've been
talking about for some time, is our synergy capture. I would say this quarter is where you've seen the
accumulation of all the work that we've been doing to really bring the refineries that we just acquired.
Ray and his team have done a tremendous job at accelerating the pace of improving those refineries and
improving the run rates.

I'll have Don to get into the yield improvements. But we think that the catalyst reformulations that we put
in, the technology that we put in these plants on a very accelerated basis, you're now going to see that
yield improvement as a structural change. And I'll have Don go over the capture rate here.

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I echo Gary's comments. What we're doing around synergies, I think, is repeatable. The capture
rate is also impacted by a number of other factors. So this quarter particularly, and you saw it really in
December, when the crack spreads dropped very quickly, there tends to be some stickiness around refined
product capture. So we benefited this quarter from very strong gasoline price realizations. And I think part
of that was due to the very sharp decline in crack spreads.

The other thing that we did this quarter that is -- won't always be recurring is that there can be price
differences in markets particularly compared to the benchmark that we're using. So as I mentioned, Salt
Lake City and some of the Southwest regions were very attractive for a period of time, and we were able
to use our logistics and other integrated model to supply markets where the demand was high and where
the pricing was favorable.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

And one more thing that is clear. Not only did we have yield improvements from the synergies, but our
commercial skills of being able to take all these dislocations around many different markets, you couple
that with our midstream system that is second to none in the industry -- but the key factor, the key
underlying fundamental is the commercial skills we have to be able to capture that value.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And similar to Doug, let me say, Gary, thanks for everything. And good luck not having to talk to us
anymore on earnings calls.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I love talking to you, Roger.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I know. It's just I can't see anybody would actually miss earnings calls all that much. I was wondering if
we could dig in a little bit on the coronavirus. And particularly since you're on the West Coast and they're
talking about limiting flying, just kind of maybe give an idea of exposure to jet fuel as a component of the
distillate side and whether or not that's something we really need to focus on or you've got the flexibility
to move that around as well within your trading ops and all?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. In fact, Dave Whikehart talked to this. Jet fuel is one of the real bright spots in our overall demand
equation within MPC. So Dave, do you want to cover this?

David L. Whikehart
Senior Vice President of Light Products Supply & Logistics

Yes. So on the West Coast, we actually are -- have a short position against our contracted demands and
are importing in order to cover that short. So we're actually -- we're really well positioned for covering
that internally if the markets send us in that direction. So if there is some sort of impact to jet demand,
our position is actually short and should benefit the company.

Brian K. Partee
Senior Vice President of Marketing

Roger, this is Brian Partee. Just -- I wanted to bolt on to that, too. One of the elements of our demand
profile in the U.S. and where we're seeing the growth is actually in the cargo. So commercial travel is one
element, but actually a lot of the growth we're seeing, particularly in PADD 2 and PADD 3, is in air cargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Good. That's helpful. So I guess we will watch it like everybody else, but at least we won't panic at
this particular point.

Second question, a little bit on the unrelated side, as we look at some of the future restructuring that may
occur here in the guidance, obviously on MPLX on lower CapEx going forward and free cash flow. But one
of the thoughts has been, or at least as we've talked to investors, expectations have been for cleaning up
a little bit on asset sales in that segment. So I was just curious if there's been any progress there? Or is
there any sort of time line we should be thinking about as we look into the -- well, the vast majority of this
year?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Roger, this is Mike Hennigan. No, there's not a real lot of progress to report there, mainly because of
the macro backdrop in the gas business. With natural gas dipping under $2, we continue to look in the
market. But as we've said many times, our view is this will only work for us if we think we got a real good

value for the assets. So in the short term, we continue to look. We continue to have an adviser engaged
and helping us look, but I'm not expecting a whole lot of action in the short term.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

And Roger, I think -- I don't want the investors to miss. While the Marcellus and Utica has had kind of an
umbrella of pressure, look at the -- our execution and look at our performance: gathered, processed and
fractionated volumes up 18%, 14% and 12%, respectively, in an area that some people had expected
would be down. I think this just shows the strength of our assets in those regions, the strength of where
they're located and how we have commercially but those transactions together. So I think we're in very
good shape. And we certainly think this is a -- our position there is a gold standard within the natural gas
processing space. So we aren't just going to give assets away.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

No. We don't want you to do that. I was just curious if anything was pending, but I appreciate the clarity
there.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

All right. Thanks, Roger.

Our next question comes from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley.

Benny Wong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just a little bit around the strategic review on Midstream, I understand you guys are looking to give us an
update in the first quarter here. I guess my question is, really, at the same time you guys are looking for a
new CEO, how interconnected or related or those 2 processes? I guess like would you guys need a pretty
good idea of who's coming in as CEO before you make a decision on your Midstream? Or how are you guys
thinking about that?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, Benny, as -- we just had our Board meeting this week, and we're on target in all of the strategic
reviews that we're doing. This is a very thorough review with the Board from an operating, execution and
the governance standpoint. So all those will be taken into context.

Timing-wise, all I can say is we'll see on any overlap. But the structure of the Board is -- we have kept the
Board so much involved. And they're driving -- we have a special committee on the Midstream, a special
committee on the Speedway transaction as well as my successor, and all of them are involved. All of them
understand the game plan, and we'll just see how it plays out.

Benny Wong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Appreciate the color there, Gary. And then my next question is really on Speedway. Within your Retail
budget, I guess, how many store conversions are you guys -- targeted within there this year? And beyond
that, how much more opportunity is there for conversions outside of new acquisitions? And if it's possible,
would it be possible to give us an update in terms of how much those conversions generally cost you? And
what's the associated EBITDA or merchandise uplift you're seeing so far?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

All right. Tim?

Timothy T. Griffith
President of Speedway LLC

Yes. Benny, it's Tim. The -- in terms of the go-forward conversion plans, as you heard, we've converted,
since the close of the acquisition, over 700 locations. There's probably something on the order of about
250 that would be left to be converted this year. We expect to have that probably done on around mid-
year. We haven't given specific guidance on what the earnings potential is per store, what the investment
is, but I can certainly point to the fact that you saw relatively strong merchandise same-store sales.

This is really the first quarter where we had former Andeavor locations in there. You're starting to see
some of that pull-through on the conversions. We go through a little bit of a 2-phase on conversion where
we'll convert to the brand, and then we'll bring in and re-lay out the store, we'll re-lay out the cooler, we'll
put food programs in where appropriate. And we're starting to see some of those impacts in the business.
So I'd say keep an eye on merchandise over the course of the year. I think you're going to continue to see
a lot of that uplift, which is clearly going to be synergy for the business and really put the business in a
good position.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

And Benny, you'll recall when we announced the acquisition, we saw this as one of our biggest
opportunities. A lot of low-hanging fruit in being able to improve the store performance, both front court
and back court, and that certainly is playing out. But an exceptional performance, to get 700 -- over 700
stores converted in this period of time is really exceptional.

Operator

Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Gary, I wanted to focus a little bit on the West Coast. Going back to 1Q '19, throughputs were a little
low, OpEx was high, turnaround expense was high, capture was low. As the year has progressed, every
metric has improved to a point where this quarter, you almost captured $20 in gross margin. So can you
walk us through the measures that have been taken, which is now allowing you to not only capture the
synergies, but operate these assets in a materially better way than they were being operated at the start
of the acquisition?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. Let me ask Ray to talk about that. So it's not only the operations of the physical assets that I want to
-- Dave Whikehart to talk about the commercial side because the commercial side is equally important on
how we have really improved the commercial abilities that were there before to what we're doing today.
So Ray?

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Okay. Hey, you hit on it. In the first quarter of 2019, we did some major work at both LAR and Martinez
doing turnaround work. In the fourth quarter, we were able to take advantage of doing that work.
Specifically, in October when gasoline got very strong, we were able to pivot quickly and maximize our
gasoline production.

One thing I want to focus on at LAR is a couple of things that I'm very proud of the team doing. The first
thing is we were able to defer some coker work that we planned early in the month. We were able to defer

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

that to working with our commercial team by a couple of weeks, so that we could take advantage of the
strong margin environment.

The second thing is one of the synergies we talked about, Gary just talked about, on the call today was
catalyst reformulation synergies. The biggest one that we did was in LAR's cat cracking unit where we did
a complete reformulation. And this is a big unit, 100,000 barrels a day cat cracker. And so it went really
well. Everything we wanted to happen happened. The light product yield went up, the heavy yields went
down, the gasoline octane went up. So we were really able to take advantage of that, and that paid off
well for us in the month of October.

Just one thing I'll say in concluding my part is the West Coast is a very challenging region. And our key
focus has been and will be reliability and then also cost control. Now I'll turn it over to Dave.

David L. Whikehart
Senior Vice President of Light Products Supply & Logistics

So from a commercial standpoint, one of the value adds that we've had managing the West Coast has
actually been to rely on the Gulf Coast for shifting our export barrels from -- mostly from the West Coast,
Northern refineries, over to the Gulf Coast in order to keep that high valued West Coast product in the
West Coast and sell it at those high basis margins. So there's been basically a tripling of the number of
cargoes that we've relocated from the West Coast to the Gulf Coast here since the first quarter. So that's a
pretty significant improvement given the basis differential between those 2 markets.

And I'd say secondly, we had a lot of commercial activity around managing our inventories in that system
and had tremendous success in capturing value in basically trading around the refinery given the market
conditions.

So I think that from a commercial perspective, you've got -- you've really got it coming both ways from --
not only from the folks that are on the ground there and working out at San Antonio, but also our ability to
quickly relocate these cargoes from the West Coast to the Gulf Coast as the market dictates.

Rick D. Hessling
Senior Vice President of Crude Oil Supply & Logistics

Manav, this is Rick Hessling. I just want to add on to Dave's comments. So from a crude perspective, the
story is very similar to what Dave just mentioned. We, with our size, our integration and our flexibility,
had been able to toggle between the Eastern Gulf Coast to the U.S. West Coast with foreign spot and
term barrels. That just -- that optionality wasn't there in the past. So we've added significant value by
optimizing and making those moves as well.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

All these make a lot of sense. Quick follow-up is -- this is more of an IMO question. Gary initially
mentioned [ light ] heavy sours have moved out -- WTI, WCS is 21. We're also seeing Brent [ might ]
trend towards that $10. What I'm trying to understand is if sulfur is the problem, why aren't Mars and
medium discounts slightly wider or -- wider from where they are right now? What's causing those spreads
to be so narrow?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. It's a great question. So there's so many world dynamics going into play with the medium sours:
geopolitical events, the [ Venns ] volume off-line, the Iranian volume off-line. I will tell you as you look
out, our view going forward, as you will see movement there, specifically when we look at the Gulf Coast
and you look at the Mars and the production in the Gulf Coast right around -- right now, it's -- we're
expecting it to exceed 2 million barrels per day in 2020. So that's a good sign. And I would also say when
you look at the Guyana and Brazilian production that is coming online here, well, just recently and more
here in 2020, I think you will see some of that trend play out. But short term, I would say it was -- it

wasn't as geopolitical events beyond anyone's ability to predict. Going forward, we see this as a potential
bright spot.

our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Gary, if I don't talk to you in the next conference call, then best wishes for your retirement. And if you're
in New York, please give me a call.

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thanks, Paul.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

A couple of questions. I think the first one is on -- if I looking at the cash flow, stripping out the MPLX, on
the C-corp level, look like you have -- the cash flow is in excess of your CapEx and your dividend. So the
question is that is there any reason why you were not maybe more aggressive in the buyback?

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Paul. So as you know, we returned a significant amount of capital this year through share
repurchases, nearly $2 billion. Those share repurchases sometimes aren't always ratable. And we also
-- I think you know, we tend to use or have used tools like 10b5 programs to be able to effect share
repurchases. There are times where those type of programs expire in a period where we aren't able to
sort of re-implement the program. So I don't think you should read anything into the amount of share
repurchases that occurred in the fourth quarter and extrapolate it into a view that we're not committed to
returning capital to shareholders. We are absolutely committed to doing so and we'll continue that practice
going forward.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

The second question is for Ray. Ray, can you tell us at which of your refineries you were able to run the
high sulfur fuel oil? And how much you ran in the fourth quarter? And what is the maximum you think you
can run, if not by refinery, but on the total region or total company? And also that, I think you guys have
said that you are exporting some areas VGO in the fourth quarter. How much do you export? And what --
if the current economic sustain, how much more that you would be able to export?

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Okay. As far as HSFO that we ran and what our capacity, what we did in the fourth quarter of 2019 and
the first quarter of 2020 has primarily been on LAR and Martinez, and like I said earlier, running in the
20,000 to 30,000 barrel a day range. Since we're running what we would call a cut resid, that essentially
has to go through the crude unit. So we're running this, we're backing out some crude in the process of
doing that primarily at Martinez. So we think we're in a good spot on the West Coast. Where we have
potential, whether this is an HSFO or additional resid that comes from crude, if the margins so dictate, will
be at the Garyville refinery once we complete the expansion.

And just to give you a little color on that, we did the first expansion in the fourth quarter last year.
And we were targeting to get about a 14% increase in coker rate, and we got 17% to date with our
debottlenecking there. And we expect a similar type of increase when we do the second coker. So when

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

18

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

you put the 2 together, we're going to be talking about 18,000 barrels a day of additional resid destruction
capacity at the Garyville refinery.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Ray, in the Garyville, are you going to run also similar to -- in California, that is going to use the
[indiscernible] into the crude unit? Or that you will have to -- logistic allow you that to directly feed it to
the coker?

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

It depends on what the cargo looks like and the infrastructure at -- on the West Coast at LAR and
Martinez, we're primarily set up to go through the crude unit. At Garyville, we actually put infrastructure
in to take directly into the coker. And we've already done that with our internal production that we've
directed from Catlettsburg down to Garyville. So at Garyville, we'll have the flexibility then to take hot
resid direct to coker. Or if we get a cut resid or an M100 type material, we would take that to the crude
unit.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Any opportunity in Galveston Bay?

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Galveston Bay is a little different animal. First, I'll start off by saying we're keeping our resid destruction
units full. And so at Galveston Bay, we have some coking capacity. So we have an opportunity there
should we choose.

The bigger opportunity at Galveston Bay, as far as resid destruction, is with the resid hydrotreater. And
so when we're running all 3 trains, call that 70,000 barrels a day -- but we got to be very careful there
because resid quality really matters with that unit and from the stability of the unit. So we actually prefer
to fill the RHU unit, the resid hydrocracker, via very defined crudes that we run there. So a little less
optionality at Galveston Bay relative to LAR, Martinez and Garyville.

Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Gary, really wish you well here. And if Kristina's listening, congrats to her on her baby daughter.

I guess the first question is just on the CEO successor process. Can you provide an update on where
we stand? It sounds like we'll get an update at the end of the first quarter. And just in general, in
conversations with the Board, what are the characteristics important in terms of who you're going to pass
the baton to?

Gary R. Heminger
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. As I said in my earlier comments, the Board has a very detailed, very strong governance and a
thorough review process, national search. They're on target, and we expect to give you a -- hopefully an
answer at the latter part of this quarter. But it's moving along very well. And as I said, the Board is very

All right. And then the follow-up is actually for Mike here. I think you had made the comment that you're
evaluating 25 different options in Midstream, but there was no silver bullet. And I think today, you're
saying the environment is tricky for Midstream asset sales. Again, I know you're going to provide a little
more color on this, so I'm not asking you to front run. But is it fair for us to construe that it would be
difficult for you to execute a full spin out of MPLX in the current environment that we're in?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So Neil, like you said, I'm not going to front run the committee. What I can tell you is the committee
is very, very engaged. We've had a lot of detailed discussions, and we continue to do that work. So we're
not quite at a completion. So I won't comment on that.

What I will comment on though that I think this will help you overall is we've announced the goal to be
free cash flow in '21. I would tell you that return on invested capital has always been a high priority for us.
But we did not want to pass on the opportunity for some MPC-backed projects like Whistler and Wink-to-
Webster, et cetera.

Also remind everybody that MPLX does return $3 billion in the form of distributions. But with that though,
we continue to high-grade our portfolio. We're trying to drive to a higher ROIC. And at the end of the day,
I think it will be a very good opportunity for us, long term, to be in that free cash flow positive mode as
quickly as we can get there.
