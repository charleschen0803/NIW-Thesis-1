DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good evening. My name is Andy, and I will be your conference facilitator today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.

Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.

Jim Gustafson
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued
interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me remotely
today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.

Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our second quarter earnings
press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently
available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements.

Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial
measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is
included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website. I'll now turn the
call over to Javier Rodriguez.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter financial
results. First, I want to start, as I did last quarter, by acknowledging and thanking all of our teammates,
especially the thousands of clinicians who provide our patients with life-sustaining care each and every
day. The past several months have been amongst the finest and most exceptional chapters in our history,
reflecting the compassion and the dedication of our teammates.

The company's strong performance this quarter demonstrates the benefits of our patient-centric
comprehensive kidney care platform, beginning with CKD all the way through ESRD and transplant. The
continuity of care that we offer our patients allow us to meet the patient where they are through offering
modality options in the hospital, in the patient's home or in the dialysis center. We're now nearly 6 months
into this pandemic. And if you were to walk into one of our centers, you'd still would experience a high
level of energy and intensity amongst our teammates as they provide for the health and safety of our
patients.

We have supplemented our effective infection control policies by conducting COVID test for patients and
teammates, both within our lab as well as with special partnerships with external labs.

These physician and clinician-led efforts have enabled us to maximize the number of patients treated
outside of the hospital, which, of course, is good for patients and has helped reduce the burden on
hospitals. While we cannot know for certainty what lies ahead, I can say that we feel prepared to continue
our work to keep our patients and our teammates safe.

We had a strong financial second quarter. As a result, we're raising our adjusted earnings per share
guidance for the year by $0.50 to $6.25 to $6.75. Our strong operational performance came despite

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

investments and expenses we incurred in response to COVID, offset by savings associated with COVID in
the form of reduced travel and health benefit expenses, amongst other items, which Joel will explain in
more detail.

Today, I'd like to cover 4 additional items. Let me start off by talking about treatment volumes and
commercial mix, 2 of the largest uncertainties associated with the pandemic that we identified last quarter.
Our patient census has been negatively impacted primarily by COVID-related deaths, delayed-by-patient
starts on dialysis, and we expect our treatment volumes for the remainder of the year to fall below the low
end of the range of 1.5% to 2.5% provided in September.

The patients that unfortunately passed away due to COVID were primarily among our older population
and therefore, were more frequently covered by government insurance. As a result, thus far, we have
not seen a material negative impact on our commercial mix, although with only 3 months of actual data
on job losses, any assessment of our commercial patient population and their ability to access private
versus government health insurance are preliminary. What we do know is that our private pay census
fared better than expected in the quarter as our patients worked hard to maintain their employment and
their insurance coverage. While the long-term impact of COVID remain uncertain, some natural offset
exist, and we believe in the resiliency of our business model.

For the second topic, I'd like to share some exciting developments in our home business. As you know,
we start from a leadership position in home with approximately 14% of our patient population on home
modality and more than 25% utilizing a home modality at some point during their care journey. Our home
growth continues to outpace our in-center dialysis growth by more than 5x and during this pandemic,
we've seen a slight uptick in interest from patients wanting to dialyze at home. We now have over 28,000
home patients, who received training, education, lab drug and medication at over 1,750 programs across
the United States.

In fact, 95% of dialysis patients live within 30 miles of a DaVita home program.

The scale of our home business is the result of many years of investment that we have made in
capabilities, education and technology to help give patients and physicians the option to choose from
dialysis if it is right for them. Let me provide a couple of examples.

First, several years ago, we launched our home remote monitoring platform, which enables daily
monitoring of vitals for approximately 5,000 of our high-risk patients. In addition, early last year, we
released a robust home telehealth platform, which now has a user base of over 19,000 patients. More
recently, we've continued building out these platforms to provide patient support features like virtual
disease management program, virtual patient support groups and capabilities that promote continuity of
care and support return home therapy for hospitalized patients. We believe that these capabilities have
allowed us to significantly increase the frequency of home patient touches to continue to enhance the
quality of care and to help extend the amount of time home patients spend on the therapy. The fact that
we already had telehealth in place has also served as a significant advantage in our ability to keep these
patients and their caregivers connected during the pandemic.

A second example we're excited about is the launch of our artificial intelligence system that helps identify
PD patients that may be at risk for hospitalization, which is one of the largest causes of home patients
switching to in-center dialysis.

Home growth and innovation continue to be amongst my top priorities. And we continue to pilot many
new programs and ideas around the country to help support patients for whom home dialysis is the best
modality. We also believe that our full suite of modality offerings enable us to help patients seamlessly
access the right modality at the right time in their dialysis journeys. Our patients can continue to benefit
from our national footprint, our physician partnerships and our unique capabilities as we seek to lead the
industry in growing home.

My third topic is calcimimetic. As many of you know, we're now moving into the next phase of calcimimetic
reimbursement as CMS proposed, including calcimimetic in the Medicare bundle payment in the recently
issued proposed payment rule for 2021. We believe that the TDAPA period gave CMS sufficient time to

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

observe utilization and pricing data, especially in the light of the mix of IV therapy and oral therapy. Over
the last couple of years, our physicians and our clinical teams developed patient-centric protocols to
achieve our high-quality standards for care, which in this instance also drove down the cost for health care
system because the protocol resulted in a higher mix of low-cost generic drugs and a lower mix of higher
cost IV alternative.

We believe that the new rule will result in similar economics for calcimimetics in 2021 as we have guided
in 2020, which will help to offset the underfunding of the remaining Medicare bundle.

My last topic is Medicare Advantage. As many of you are aware, in 2016, Congress enacted the 21st
Century CARES Act to provide all Medicare eligible patients with the option to enroll in Medicare Advantage
plans, including all ESRD patients.

We believe that the ending of the barriers that have prevented active dialysis patients from enrolling
in Medicare Advantage will be a positive development for many patients, providers and managed care
organizations, as this new rule will expand the opportunity to provide coordinated care to patients
who suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Unfortunately, CMS' recent ruling that loosen MA network
adequacy requirements for only dialysis services calls into question the breadth of the choices available to
dialysis patients. There are many factors that will shape the eventual enrollment in Medicare Advantage
plans. And although we have no clear visibility, we do continue to believe that enrollment in MA plans by
ESRD patients will be gradual over the coming year.

Now I'll pass it on to Joel to provide an update on our Q2 results and to discuss our financial outlook.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter despite the net headwind from our COVID response, primarily as
a result of improved adjusted margins in our core Kidney Care business. Here are some specifics.

Our nonacquired treatment growth slowed from 2.3% in Q1 to 1.6% in Q2. We believe the primary drivers
of this decrease were COVID-related as increased mortality and lower new patient starts were partially
offset by a nationwide decrease in kidney transplants and lower missed treatments.

We expect this net COVID NAG headwind to persist at least until this time next year. Total revenue was in
line with our expectations as a result of lower volumes, offset by higher revenue per treatment. RPT was
up due to normal seasonality in co-insurance and deductibles and the temporary Medicare sequestration
release, partially offset by lower calcimimetics revenue. As Javier said, while the long-term impacts of
COVID remain uncertain, we did not see any net impact on our commercial mix quarter-over-quarter.

There are a number of factors that we believe underlie this dynamic, including, among other things, the
job loss rate for our commercial patient population was lower than the national unemployment rate.
Many of our commercial patients who were initially furloughed have since returned to work or expect to
return to work. And finally, we believe that our patients who were laid off have been enrolling in other
commercial insurance, such as COBRA and exchange plans at a higher rate than we have seen in the past.

Adjusted operating income margin was strong for the quarter at 16%. On a year-over-year basis,
our margin expanded due to strong cost management across the P&L and an improvement in RPT.
Calcimimetics contributed approximately $19 million to our operating income in the second quarter.

Now let me give you some details about the impact of COVID on our financial results. For Q2, we estimate
that we incurred expenses and other negative impacts on our operating income of approximately $85
million. Incremental compensation and benefits to our teammates was the largest contributor to these
costs. Offsets in the quarter to the $85 million include, among other things, decreased travel, lower health
benefits expenses and lower facility and training costs.

We also had the benefit of the temporary halt on Medicare sequestration that started in May. As a result
of these offsets, we estimate that the net impact of COVID on our operating income for the quarter was
between $20 million and $30 million.

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Looking forward to the second half of 2020, the impact of COVID is hard to forecast given the uncertainty
and the progress of the virus and the economic impact. While extreme situations could occur that are
beyond our range, we have incorporated a wide range of scenarios in our updated guidance including
scenarios in which the net financial impact of COVID-19 in each of Q3 and Q4 could be similar to what we
experienced in Q2.

Let me next turn to our 2020 guidance. Given the strength of our first half performance, we are updating
our guidance ranges. We are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range by $0.50
from $6.25 to $6.75. We are raising the guidance range for adjusted operating income margin to 14% to
14.75%. We're increasing our cash flow guidance, $800 million to $1 billion, an increase of $200 million
over our previous guidance range. We are maintaining our guidance range for revenue of $11.5 billion to
$11.7 billion, but we now expect to be below the midpoint of the range due to the anticipated slowdown in
volume growth.

On capital expenditures, we provided an estimated range of $700 million to $750 million.

We now expect to come in at the bottom end of that range as the pandemic has delayed some project
spending. While we will not provide specific guidance on 2021 today, I do want to highlight some of the
larger anticipated headwinds and tailwinds compared to our 2020 non-GAAP adjusted operating income.
Primary anticipated headwinds are the volume and mix implications of COVID. The primary anticipated
tailwinds include the assumed lack of valid initiative defense costs and hopefully, a reduction in net
COVID-related direct impact. On calcimimetics, while we still need to wait for CMS' final rule later this fall,
we do not expect for calcimimetics to be a large headwind or tailwind to adjusted OI.

Finally, on share repurchases. We had indicated in March that we are temporarily suspending share
repurchases. We did not repurchase any shares during Q2 or during the month of July. We are carefully
considering when to restart our share repurchase activity and will do so at the discretion of management
and within the authorization provided by our Board of Directors.
With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Speakers, the first question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

If you can talk a little bit more about operating income guidance. Looking at the first half of the year,
16.2% despite all these COVID costs and looks as though the implied margin for the back half of the year
is sort of between 12% and sort of 13.4%. So a pretty big decline. Can you sort of walk us through sort of
how we would get there?

Is it from the treatment growth sort of slowing down? Just walk us through the details of sort of how we
get to sort of pretty big margin contraction in the back half of the year?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. So Pito, I'll take -- Joel here. So if you take the middle of our range -- well, again, we're not guiding
to OI, but taking the middle of our guidance, I think you would calculate a roughly $175 million decline in
OI from the first half of the year to the second half of the year.

The 3 biggest components of that are the reduction in calcimimetics profits, which, as we've talked about
in the past, most of our number are $40 million to $70 million. And by the way, that we do expect that
number to be in the top half of that range. So most of that comes in the first half of the year.

Second is the ballot initiative in California. We've talked about that as a $0.50 a share cost, and that is
primarily in the back half of the year. And then third, I'd point to COVID that while the costs associated
with COVID could come down over the course of the year, the offsets would also come down. And we're
using a pretty wide range of assumptions around what could happen in the back half of the year with
COVID, but the back half of the year will have 2 quarters' worth of COVID while the first half of the
year really only had 1 quarter's worth of COVID. So if you put those 3 things together, you'll get the
vast majority of that $175 million decline. Couple of other things I'd point out. One is there were some
relatively small onetime things in the front half of the year that aided OI, and those could -- and there
could be some negative onetime things in the back half of the year.

And finally, because of COVID and potentially other dynamics, there are some costs that we didn't incur
in the first half of the year, and we think those could show up in the back half of the year, and that could
be anything from G&A projects to facility maintenance and those would be the other 2 components that
would get you to that $175 million adjusted OI decline at the center of the guidance range.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit more about the final Medicare Advantage rule? Can
you sort of walk us through sort of how that impacts your negotiations with MA plans? When do you think
you'll start seeing impact from the changing rule? Is it a 2021 event? Because of the multiyear contracts
is more spread out. And in your discussions with MA plans, have you had conversations around bonus
payments for better managing patients? Or is it too soon?

And then finally, what's the checks and balances on the MA plans? They don't certify a network that is too
narrow.

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Pito, let me grab that. And Joel, if you want to supplement it, and you had several pieces if I miss
anything, please come at me again. The short answer is we don't know what the implications are. What
we do know is that from a network adequacy, there used to be an objective standard that had time and
distance and now it's subjective standard. It might mean nothing. It might mean that the plan's just now
attest and life goes on as it did in the past. It also might mean that some plans might get aggressive and
not have adequate standards in networks. So it's too early to tell. But from our perspective, it is pulling
out and discriminating against the ESRD patients, because if you don't have the proper network adequacy,
you, in essence, are disencouraging enrollment. And so from our perspective, it's just an unusual thing,
and it goes against the patient's rights. We waited for a very long time to have the ESRD patients be on
equal footing to everyone, and they deserve the right to pick MA just like anyone else. And so that was a
disappointing part.

As it relates to negotiations, as you said, we have multiyear contracts with most of our MA plans. We are
working with them. We think that we, combined, can work well together, can work on MLR and could do
really good things for the patients as it relates to coordination of care. But it is too early to tell as not
many contracts have occurred. Did I miss any of your question?

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

No. But I mean, I guess the last one would be, what are the checks and balances? So if the MA plan has
to self certify, what -- what's the balance to make sure that they don't self certify a network that is too
narrow?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. I mean that's part of the problem. But right now, it goes into some kind of subjective attestation that
they have proper network. And from our perspective, of course, what we're doing is keeping our radar up
to make sure that the spirit of the law is adhered to. But we don't know how it will be enforced.

Operator

The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. Just wanted to maybe follow up on that, I guess, you mentioned most of your contracts are
multiyear contracts. So does that mean that you're entering 2021 with relatively similar economics within
your MA plans as you have today in 2020?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

I think it's fair to say that. Yes, on any given year, you have renegotiations, but it's the same every year.
Once in a while, they overlap. But it is a fair assumption. At this juncture, of course, we still have the back
end of the year to do negotiations. And there is a big appetite from us and from the plans on trying to
do something that is useful and creative to the system so that we take more risk and provide higher end
services to the patients. So we're still in the conversations. We'll see how it pans out.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. And I guess it just happened a couple of months ago, so maybe not many contracts have been
implemented. But I mean, are you at all -- I assume you always have conversations with health plans.

I mean does it sound like they are planning for aggressive changes at this point? Or do you have any
sense?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

CEO & Executive Director

Yes. I think the reality, Kevin, is that everybody is trying to do something constructive as it relates to this
opportunity for the patients to have coordinated care. And so the plans and us are trying to see what risk
appetite they have, what can our systems do, what can their system do, but both sides have big appetite
to do something that's useful for this patient population. And so we'll see how that pans out over time.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And is there a point in time this year where you think you would have a better sense of this on the Q3
call? Will you pretty much have good visibility as far as 2021 goes or do we have to wait until Q4 results?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

I think it will take a little longer to play out because of the interplay of expirations and when contracts
come up, coupled with the fact that I don't know how COVID is going to impact negotiations. So if I had to
guess, I think it's going to take a bit longer than that.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then, Joel, I guess, as far as your calcimimetics point, I guess you're saying that next year, it
will be neutral to earnings. So if you're making close to $70 million this year, the thought is that it should
be a similar number next year. Is that the right way to think about it?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So look, there remains some uncertainty for next year, but there was certainly a scenario where the
OI went to 0. So relative to that, we feel like we're in much better shape and I'd say 70-ish is a reasonable
midpoint of the range. That said, I would highlight one thing that's important for the way we're thinking
about OI going forward, which is we have called out calcimimetics as something that, I guess, I'd call
nonrecurring because of the TDAPA period and the nature of TDAPA reimbursement it is not permanent.
As this enters the bundle next year, I would consider the OI that we are generating from calcimimetics to
now be part of our core OI because it has permanent funding. It's a permanent component of the bundle.
We're going to stop calling it out and in my mind, it will become part of our core earning power of the
business.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

And Kevin, I'll just add one point in case it's not clear for some. The reason why we don't have a precise
number, and Joel will give you a bit of a range, is because CMS is going to adjust the amount with Q4 ASP,
and we don't have an exact number, we have an estimate.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. That all makes sense. And I guess the way to think about it is that in the first half of next year, it
will be a headwind. But in the back half of next year year-over-year, it will be a tailwind because it will be
uniformly spread out throughout the year sort of front-end loaded this year.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I think that's a good way to think about it.

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

All right. And then maybe last question. The -- it wasn't clear to me exactly. You mentioned about why the
commercial mix was strong. I think you made some comments around your patients signing up for COBRA
and buying alternative coverage that makes sense to me. But some of the other comments about less job
loss and things like that. Can you go back over what you were getting at there? And why it would be the
case that maybe so far, at least that the job loss has been less impactful to your patients than it would be
other -- than you would expect?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. So there are 3 dynamics affecting mix. The unemployment question is one of them. So let me tackle
that. And we highlighted 3 things. One is job loss in our population is lower than what we're seeing in
the national averages. And we think that is because the employment mix or not exactly what to call it, of
our commercial population leans more towards things like government and education and less towards
things like hospitality and travel. So the sectors that our employees, our patients work in have been less
impacted by the economic effects of COVID. So that's number one.

Second, lot of the unemployment that we saw in our population was the result of furloughs rather than job
losses and a lot of those have reversed.

So those patients never lost their coverage, and they're now back at work or they expect to be back at
work.

And third, as our patients have lost their employer-based commercial coverage, they have worked hard to
maintain alternative commercial coverage, either through COBRA or the exchanges, and we're seeing that
happening at a rate higher than what we've seen historically. That said, we don't have a lot of historical
experience with exchanges, because the exchanges didn't exist during the Great Recession in '08 and '09.

So that's the -- that's why we're -- why we think we're seeing less of a mix decline on commercial
related to unemployment. I would also point out that mortality is actually beneficial to commercial mix
in the short term, because older patients are passing away at a higher rate than younger patients and
government patients tend to be older and commercial patients tend to be younger.

So that's helping. And then the decline in transplants is also helping.

Commercial patients get transplanted at a much higher rate than government patients.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Kevin, I'd just like to state one thing, an overarching important part that we've learned, and that is that
in talking with our commercial patient, it has really reinforced how hard our patients work to keep their
commercial insurance and how much they value it. And so that has been an absolute clear takeaway from
this period.

Operator

The next question is from Andrew Mok from Barclays.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wanted to follow up on Medicare Advantage.

As we approach the full open enrollment season, what's the awareness level among your traditional
Medicare patients that they're going to have the option to enroll in a private Medicare plan this fall? And
relatedly, what are some of the patient education efforts you're doing on this topic?

CEO & Executive Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Yes. Let me grab that one. The -- as you would expect with any population and anything new, the
information flow is wide in range from the people that are up to speed to the people that are completely
uninformed on it. And what we're working really hard to do is to have totally unbiased and objective
training that is customized to each person. So you can look at it from your personal perspective, because
what's good insurance for one person might not be good insurance for the other, depending on what you
have as a secondary coverage or what your family needs are or where you are in your life. And so our
main objective is for people to have a balanced perspective, that are aware of their choices and actually
gets them to pick what's right for them. And the knowledge base is pretty much all over the place.

Andrew Mok

Got it. Okay. And then just wanted to follow up on the strong cost management in the quarter. Can you
put some numbers around some of the productivity and G&A gains you saw in Q2? And how much of that
you think is sustainable heading into 2021?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So there's nothing in particular, I'd call out on either of those things. The -- there's -- I'd say, on the
G&A, maybe there's a little bit of a question on whether we're going to give some of that back in the back
half of the year, and that's some of that half 1 over half 2 bridge that I put back -- that I pointed out at
the beginning of the call, but there's nothing unusual that I'd call out other than that.

The next question is from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

First, just one more on Medicare Advantage networks. Javier, I was a little surprised when you answered
previous questions saying you might not know how the networks look by your next call.

And the -- my understanding of MA the plans have to put out their products by, I think, it's mid-October. If
they were -- at that point, don't they have to publish their networks? Wouldn't you know whether you're in
or out of the network at that point for 2021, at least?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes, you're absolutely correct, Justin. So maybe I was answering a different question, which is, I think
what I was answering is, well, you understand the sustainability of there's going to be macro changes.
In the short-term networks, I don't anticipate anything major changing. I could be surprised, but I don't
anticipate that. What I was answering is how will it change over time. And I thought that by then, we
would not see how it will behave over an extended period of time.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. So the takeaway is given your conversations and given how late we are in the year already, you
don't think there's much likelihood of DaVita being removed from a network in Medicare Advantage for
2021, but there could be some evaluation over time into 2022 and 2023 in terms of pricing and network
design?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. I mean, said differently, you have some add backs, but you won't have a significant part of the
portfolio or anything. And so that will play over time. And so you are correct in your assumptions that in
the fall, we will have clarity. But as you know, you could be in the network in the fall, and then a month

or 2 later, you can be out of network. So I don't know how much you can bank on that fall in network
statement holding for the future.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. And then I wanted to ask about the -- I apologize if I missed this, Joel, but your revenue per
treatment was up pretty significantly sequentially. Can you give us as much detail and that's with
calcimimetics looking like it's declining. So ex calcimimetics, what's the number there and the sequential
increase? And what are the kind of key drivers that you want us to focus on?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. So ex calcimimetics, it's between $5 and $6. We're talking quarter-over-quarter RPT change.

A lot of that is seasonal. And think of coinsurance and deductibles and some lower bad debt associated
with patients flowing through those, that is, by far, the biggest factor. The other stuff is just some, I'd say,
typical bouncing around of MA mix and commercial mix and a little bit of pricing. It's mostly a seasonal
impact.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Joel, the only thing I would add to that is there's a little sequestration in there as well.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Yes. I forgot about that. Thank you, Javier.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes, me too. So that's a ...

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I am sorry, Justin, just to be clear, the number I gave backed out the sequestration. So that $5 to $6 was
without sequestration. Sequestration is worth about $1.5.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And what was calcimimetics worth? Since we're on this topic.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I know someone was going to ask me that. I think it was $0.50, although I'll get you that exact number.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Is that revenue or profit?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Oh, no, I'm sorry. Ignore the $0.50 number. The RPT from calcimimetics went from $9.55 to $7. So about
a $2.5 decline as a result of calcimimetics RPT. The OI, so the dollar number went from $35 million in Q1
to $19 million in Q2.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then in terms of commercial mix and commercial treatment growth, you're saying mix was flat
and therefore, commercial patient growth was similar to overall patient growth? And mix didn't have much
to do with this in terms of that $5 to $6?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Right.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

And is this a reasonable number to jump off of ex calcimimetics? Is this a -- do you think this is a good
number for 3Q, 4Q that we should think about?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I think it is a reasonable starting point, although I think you'll see that negative seasonality in Q1, you'd
expect to see that next year. So don't use it as an annual run rate, but use it as a number for the next
couple of quarters.

Operator

The next question is from Whit Mayo from UBS.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the implied core growth in the quarter. You guys usually have
tremendous visibility into a lot of the expenses as you set your original plan. And now we're looking at a
number that's much higher. So it certainly seems to implied that something got much better.

So I'm really kind of curious what that is because as we net out the COVID cost in calcimimetics to
sequester, everything you've laid out, I mean, it implies, by my math, that the core OI was up 8% year-
over-year. So I'm just trying to take a crack at this from a cost structure standpoint again. Is there
anything else that you can point to that has come in meaningfully below what your original expectations
were coming into the year?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

So, Whit, if I were to try and to explain why the numbers are better than what we expected, first, it's all
core margin. There's nothing unusual here. The business -- the core business is performing well. I would
point to productivity being a bit better than we expected. Facility costs are a bit better than we expected.
RPT is a little bit better, but that's offset a fair bit by volume being light. So if -- think of core margin
largely driven by good cost management.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Is there any way to put numbers around either the COBRA or the exchange uptake? I mean I
presume you have a lot of data internally around your patients and their coverage. And I'm just sort of
trying to wrap my head around the conversion rate into COBRA because I presume that it's fairly high. So
I thought I'd just maybe ask a little bit more directly, the question.

Javier J. Rodriguez

14

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

I looked at the question you're asking, we don't disclose it in detail. But I think what you're trying to get
to directionally is, do we have a big spike in COBRA that in 18 months or in some date in the future, that
will come to roost. Is that fair where you're going?

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

No, that actually isn't the premise at all. I mean, I think the debate in the marketplace to be perfectly
candid is that you have -- you're very dependent on your commercial mix, and so people have been
concerned. And I think my point is that a lot of these patients find that they have alternative options and a
great number of them, a high percent buying coverage through COBRA. So it was actually -- the premise
was totally the opposite.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. I think what I would say is what we said earlier, which is -- and I think it's consistent to what you're
saying. Yes, our business relies on that patient population in an incredible way. We have been very
impressed with the passion that our patients have to keep their commercial coverage in one way or
another. And as Joel said, there's a big distinction between furloughed versus permanent job loss, and we
have seen that a good chunk of our patients that are working that were furloughed are back to work. And
then out of the ones that had permanent job loss, which the number, again, was less than we anticipated,
many have had alternative coverage. I think that covers the whole spectrum there.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

No, it's helpful. And maybe one last one, and this is perhaps an impossible question, but I thought I'd
ask it. Javier, what is a hypothetical Biden administration mean for DaVita and the industry? I mean the
charitable premium rule has been sitting out at the OMB forever. I mean that was obviously there under
the prior administration, who knows if that revives itself, I have no idea what the status of it is. And we
rarely talked about public option, Medicare expansion on these calls, maybe we're all just smart enough
to be more skeptical on policy like this. But I'd just be curious to hear your general thoughts about what
Biden would mean?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. It's a great question, one that we've talked about. In general, what we try to do, and we've done a
decent job is to make sure that we're talking to both Republican and Democrats because our issue goes
across both sides. I mean the biggest change that we can think of as it relates to the policy, is probably
one of tax and whether they're able -- if there is a Biden administration, whether you also have the Senate
or not will, obviously, be a big driver of tax policy.

As it relates to health care policy, as you know, it is a -- as you said, a much bigger lift to change, and we
will, of course, be a part of it. But what we want to do is continuing to push and advocate for our patients
and for integrated care, regardless of who's in the White House.

Next question is from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan.

Gary Paul Taylor
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to just come back to one topic that's been asked about a few different ways, and I'll ask it a
little bit different, see if I can get a little more help. Obviously, an amazing job on expense management,
maybe 2Q is turning out to be the amazing cost management quarters. But when you had laid out last
quarter up to an incremental $100 million of COVID expenses, which is like $13 a treatment, certainly
didn't think patient care costs would go up $0.62 sequentially. So I've heard the comments about the

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

productivity, the facility costs, health benefits. I guess, could we just talk a little more about the source of
the productivity?

I know you would, even for a period of time, I think were paying an extra $100 a month to a fair number
of your teammates and it's kind of the opposite of productivity, you had set up some split shifts to sort of
isolate COVID positive and suspected patients. So the whole orientation, I guess was this is going to be
the opposite of a really strong productivity quarter and yet you've performed really, really well.

So maybe just some examples of how you're finding this productivity and what sort of facility costs? And
was the health benefits piece, just your own employees, consuming less health care and that was quite
material. I know you've been asked several times. So just anything incremental would just help us sort of
think about modeling going forward.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. There's a lot going on, and we're very proud, Gary, of the cost management situation. So let me try
to be as helpful as possible because there are several things. First, a clarification, yes, on our health care
expenditures, our teammates, just like everybody else, used less benefits on nonessential care. So that
is one. Number two, our caregivers' sense of purpose was really passionate and so therefore, we had less
turnover because people felt that sense of obligation to take care of our patients. And so the combination
of economic need and appreciating a job, while so many people were furloughed and lay off and the sense
of commitment to our patients had less training expense.

And then the last thing that I would say is that also there were some of our teammates that were COVID
positive. And so what we ended up doing is having to have basically in some places like New York and
others, where staffing was really at a premium. And so when you cohorted centers, et cetera, which is
what you're alluding to earlier, sometimes those shifts were not as inefficient as we anticipated because
those shifts tended to be more full than once anticipated. And so if you have a full COVID positive shift,
even though it's cohorted, it's not inefficient. When it's really inefficient is when you have 1 or 2 patients
in it. And so the cumulative math compounded over the quarter, and we were very diligent in trying to
manage it all.

Gary Paul Taylor
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's helpful. 2 more quick ones. On the $35 million legal charge, was that related to any legal issue that
had been historically disclosed in your filings? Or was this professional liability issue? Or is there any other
color on that?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes, I'll take that one, Gary. It was related to shareholder litigation that's been hanging out there for a
bunch of years related to CPA. Our view is what we did was appropriate, but to just clean this up and
move on, we thought it was worth settling this. So it's related to that issue.

Gary Paul Taylor
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then just last one for me. And I've just forgot the difference between your 0.7% increase in
treatments per day and your 1.6% normalized when you have the exact same number of treatment days,
78.0, 78.0, so the calendar isn't driving that, and I don't think there's been divestitures. So I'm just trying
to recall how we square that difference?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. There's a bunch of noise associated with divestitures and some other things, but there is one big
movement that I would highlight there, which is we had a bunch of clinics that we deconsolidated as of the

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

first of the year. And those are treatments that we would back out of NAG, but we don't back them out of
the treatment count. And that's worth, I think about 50 bps of the difference.

Operator

Next question is from Matt Larew from William Blair.

Matthew Richard Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I wanted to ask a little bit about the footprint. I think we heard on the first quarter that in terms of the
footprint build, I think you said maybe wait and see in terms of what happens with industry volumes
and what happens on the home side and obviously, 28 new centers and then maybe added on to that
after a couple of years of kind of a stagnant OUS number. I know there's a lot of rationalization going on.
You've now added about 40 new centers OUS in the last 4 quarters. Maybe just an update in terms of
development, both on the U.S. and OUS side.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I'll take that one, Javier. So most of the action is on the U.S. side, as you would expect, the number
there is a bit of a lagging indicator because it depends on when we get certified by CMS. If you wanted
to think about a number that tracked more carefully with the decision-making and the CapEx number, it
would be based on when the clinics are completed, what we call a certificate of occupancy, and you'd see
that number much lower. So for next year, I don't want to give a range yet, but you'll see that number
come way down again. And I think going forward, people want to understand how we're doing in terms of
building capacity and being capital efficient.

I think the development CapEx number is going to be a better indicator of that than the clinic number that
we've disclosed historically. And that's driven partly by this timing issue. It's also driven by the fact that
we're building more home-only clinics, which tend to be cheaper and aren't in the clinic count that we've
historically disclosed.

So the message is the de novo continues to come down as NAG comes down as we move more to home.
There could be kind of an additional delay associated with COVID, partly because of a temporary decline in
NAG, partly because it's just hard to build clinics in the context of COVID. But relative to the commitment
we made around capital efficiency, I think we're continuing to deliver on what we said we would.

Matthew Richard Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask a little bit about the comment you made around
missed treatments. I know you mentioned that commercial patients tend to be higher in terms of
transplants. But what do you see in terms of discrepancies amongst different payer classes for visit
patterns, did patients in the Medicare population tend to have higher missed treatments during this
period and wasn't missed treatments much lower with commercial? I guess, just what does that look like
amongst payer classes?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. We didn't break it out by payer class. But one of the things that we are very happy about the fact that
missed treatments went down during this period, meaning that our patients who are taking the virus very
seriously, they were taking care of themselves, and then we were able to take care of them outside of the
hospital. And so I would have to say that the math -- the way the math works, that it was across all payer
classes, but I don't know that with certainty because I didn't divide it by payer class. But in general, we
were very happy to see that hospitalizations went down for our chronic population in a significant way.

And then was there any change in terms of referral origin throughout the quarter? Or anything you see
from COVID normally about half your patients start dialysis in the hospital setting, but just curious as
COVID has progressed and hospital visit patterns have changed a little bit, what you're seeing in terms of
origination?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

So I think your question is the way that we get our patients change, meaning if there's less crashers into
the hospital and going into our center first. And the short answer is that we have not seen a change, a
noticeable change in the way that our patients come.

Operator

The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a follow-up on a couple of things. I guess, first, you obviously were at the low end of your treatment
guidance for the quarter. It sounds like you're certainly below that for at least a few more quarters.
How confident are you that this is purely COVID related and not a continuation of the decline, I guess,
that we've been seeing in the last couple of years and you had a much higher growth rate. A few years
ago, you've taken that down a couple of times. What amount of visibility do you have for this? Is this a
temporary thing and we'll get back to the 1.5% to 2.5%?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Kevin, why don't I give you a little of the variables? And then if you want to attest the assumptions,
you can because there is an interplay of several variables. And so in essence, what would happen in
the quarter is mortality increase. And as we've told you, it skewed toward the more older population.
The acute volume -- the acute treatments went down and that's obviously, in our mind, because of
nonessential care being delayed. So we think that, that is absolutely COVID related.

The incidents of our new patients came down as we talked to our nephrologist , we tend to think just in
a high level, "Okay, your kidneys failed, you have to go dialysis." But the reality is that it's more nuanced
than that. That you have some remaining renal function and sometimes your nephrologist has a decision
to make, are you better off starting dialysis with some renal function? So that you do better on that
therapy. And right now, during the pandemic, they're saying, "Is it better to start you off a little later?" So
we saw our new patient incidents decrease.

We, of course, saw no visitors because of travel restrictions. And then we saw a decrease in transplants
because, obviously, transplants were shut temporarily, which, in essence, was an offset and so -- and
then as we already talked about, we saw missed treatments go down, so that it was also an increase to
volume. So when we net all of that, and we give you what we expect in the back end, our assumption is
that over time, this is likely to normalize, except of the impact on mortality over time.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So all that makes sense. Does that then mean, like, just kind of in response to the last question about how
patients are coming in, that you're not seeing more patients crash now, but you think that if this continues
that we will then see that and not that that's a good sign at all, but it would be at least a good sign that
fundamental demand is higher than what you're seeing?

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Yes. And that would be all speculative. I'm just telling you what our nephrologists are telling us about
their practices. And most of the practices for a little while, obviously, were shut down for the nonessential
care that we're still rounding in the hospitals. So what we're anticipating now that we're talking to our
nephrologists and their practices are back open is that they have not seen any dramatic change. And of
course, that's not scientific. We're just telling you what we're hearing from our nephrology practices.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Right. And then I guess you talked earlier about how this quarter is coming better because productivity
has come in better than expected.

Is there a reason to think that these productivity gains cannot be maintained into a more normal operating
environment if COVID starts to go away next year? Can you keep this productivity going? I don't think you
mentioned that as one of the headwinds to 2021.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes, productivity will be interesting. Of course, some of the things will go away. People will end up
going back to the doctor and our benefit expense will go back up. As it relates to training, expenses and
retention, I think that will be highly linked to the economy and how that's doing and how people are
feeling about valuing their job and the sense of purpose that we're giving them. And so I think, in general,
you could say it would -- it could stay and then you could make an argument that it'll go back to what it
was, but I think it will be highly linked to what the broader economy is doing and how COVID is impacting
the time.

The next question is from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

A few follow-ups here. One, Joel, your corporate and ancillary segments look down pretty materially
2Q versus 1Q. Just curious if you can note anything there and how to think about those numbers in the
second half?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I am trying to remember if there's anything in particular. We had a severance charge built in, it was
about $12 million, and I'm trying to remember if that was Q1 or Q2. I'll get you the news on that.

Jim Gustafson
Vice President of Investor Relations

I'll answer it, Joel. That was Q2, and that was in the corporate segment. Q1 had a large benefit in
international, which is in the strategic initiatives segment from exchange rates and it swung a little bit the
other way.

Yes. We had -- thank you, Jim. I appreciate it. We had $10 million of positive foreign exchange in Q1
through international, and that swung to a $4 million negative in the second quarter.

That explains it. So then back to Whit's question, the -- obviously, the -- on your comments around
COBRA and exchange take up being greater. Given the -- where the economy is going, that's a pretty

important swing factor. And obviously, it sounds like it's going better than expected. So it would be helpful
to us to kind of understand where it's been historically and where it is now? Could you share us just even
round numbers?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Well, I won't give you round numbers, and let me make sure I'm answering the right question, Justin.
Are you asking mix of COBRA versus other commercial insurance?

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

No. I'm asking the -- you said there's been a pretty material increase in the number of people signing up
for COBRA exchanges when they lose their job versus what you've seen in other periods like this?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. What I would say right now, without getting into details is I'll just reinforce what I've said, that our
patients are very passionate about keeping their commercial insurance for a variety of reasons, including
their family coverage and some believe that it enhances their odds of getting a transplant. And in some
instances, it's obviously the cheapest coverage with the most flexibility. And so they're making those
decisions carefully as they know it impacts their life in a nontrivial way since they consume so much health
care.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

And then, Joel, you gave 2021 headwinds, tailwinds. And you didn't mention Medicare Advantage
accelerating growth as a tailwind to 2021. So I'm curious, is your view that we shouldn't expect it to be
impactful next year?

I mean you don't think it's going to ramp versus what we've seen in the last 2 or 3 years? And if so, why
not?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Well, I think we've been pretty consistent with what we've said about Medicare Advantage, which is we
don't see 2021 as this huge inflection point in enrollment. We think MA enrollment will continue to grow. It
could grow a little bit faster next year. But we've just had a different view than others in the industry. We
think a lot of our patients are happy with their Medicare fee-for-service coverage. There is some level of
inertia. And we just don't see it being this massive uptake in 1 year.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. And the -- I just think there's a pretty big delta between massive uptake and what looks like a
couple of percent increase in penetration a year, maybe a little more. Right, so are you saying that you
really think it's probably going to be the typical 200 to 300 basis point increase that we've seen in the last
few years relative to what I think some might have expected it to be more like 500 plus?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Let me jump in because you have as much information as we do on this, Justin. What we can tell
you is we're roughly around 25% of the Medicare patients are picking -- have MA in our population.
You probably have a better number than I do, but the industry tells is around 35%. And so everybody
continues to say, "Will it be more than 35%? Are we going to get to 35% in year 1 of enrollment?" And
what we've consistently said quarter-over-quarter is that we think it will be more gradual, and we think it's

20

more gradual for some of the dynamics that have been said today that there's a patient population that's
uninformed.

There's a patient population that likes status quo and so don't underestimate inertia. If you say, "Well,
even though there might be a better product for me. I like my product or I'm satisfied with my product,"
and many people just don't have interest in switching because they fear the unknown. And so we're just
saying change for some are hard, and we think that it will be more gradual, and we could be wrong. But
what we want to make sure is there's a time where there was a lot of people saying that the change was
going to be very, very fast, and it was going to be a quick ramp up. And while they could be right, we
don't think that, that's the way it will play out.

Yes. I think we're not going to get into the nuances of productivity changes on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
I think the message we're trying to deliver is we continue to do a good job on cost management. It's
driving good margins in the core, but I don't think we're going to get into that level of detail.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then last one here is, I may have asked this probably earlier on the call, I guess, opened up 28
centers during 2Q. To your point, that's a lagging indicator of where things are going. If we think about
sort of 2021 in terms of the split between home clinics and standard clinics, what's the right split as these
eventually flow through into where you guys want to target opening in clinics?

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

CEO & Executive Director

I do not have the number in here, but Joel keep me honest that our number is roughly 50-50 on our
growth for next year between in-center and home centers.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

That is correct.

Operator

The next question is from Whit Mayo from UBS.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

You guys just have to cut us off. I've got one more because I've had several e-mails on the topic of
revenue per treatment. And you reported $3.52 in the quarter, take out $7 for calcimimetics we're down to
$3.45. I calculated the sequester maybe being $1.60. So I'm getting down to $3.44, and you did the same
math last quarter, it was $3.38.

So you've got $6 of growth in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So I guess the question is if your
commercial mix is largely flat versus the first quarter. What drove that incremental improvement? I mean,
historically, there's not that much seasonality in the pricing when we reflect back on prior year. So just
trying to flesh out if there's anything else that might be influencing that number up?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So, Whit, it is largely seasonality. I think we're seeing a little bit more seasonality this year because
of some bad debt dynamics. But I would say about 2/3 of that $6, and your math is pretty spot on, is
seasonality. The balance is, I'd say, normal fluctuations.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So when you say bad debt, does this mean that patients have already run through their deductible? I
guess, I want to maybe understand a little bit more exactly what...

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. As patients run through their deductibles and their coinsurance, and there are some other dynamics
that play through in bad debt. That's exactly what it is. It's exactly what you'd expect, I think.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Okay. But no other like payer settlements or anything unusual that ...

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Nothing else to call out. It was -- I think Justin asked me before, is this a reasonable RPT to use to start
your modeling for the rest of the year? And I think the answer is yes.

Operator

At this time, speakers, we don't have any questions on queue.
