Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to J.B. Hunt's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings
Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker for today, Brad Delco, Vice President of Finance and
Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.

A. Brad Delco
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before I introduce the speakers on today's call, I'd like to take
some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements.

This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are
intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current
plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results
to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information
regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Now I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John
Roberts; our Interim CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller and SVP of Finance, John Kuhlow; Shelley
Simpson, our Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services; Nick Hobbs, President of
Dedicated and Final Mile Services; and Darren Field, President of Intermodal.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?

John N. Roberts
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Brad. While we are all learning to live with the changes that have been presented by the virus.
When we began in mid-March, the response to a very sudden change in how we do business was
incredible. From day 1, we had to pivot to a new normal on the go, and we are so proud of our teams
across the country for the different ways we have found to make it work.

As noted, we set out our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and from the start, take care of
the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our
customers. Initially, the adrenaline pushed us through, but over time, we start to see why we work
together in person. The benefits of being together and collaborating, building on our culture, solving
problems as a team and sharing time with each other showed their value to us more now than ever. This
reality has prompted good work to find ways to begin coming back together, particularly in our corporate
offices, very slowly and very carefully. We should also call out that due to the nature of the business,
75% of our people in the field have been effectively in position since day 1 of the crisis, our drivers and
so many of the people that support them. We are extremely grateful to all of our employees, both at
corporate and in the field, and thank them for their commitment.

The third quarter showed us some new opportunities in spiking customer demands across all businesses
that I don't recall seeing in the past. At different points, we regrettably had to turn away business
that was offered but not built into our original network plans and commitments. The supply side of the
equation, our carriers and our rail providers all experienced pressure and congestion during the quarter.
Also due to what we believe is a labor shortage at our customers causing unloading delays, we have not
been able to turn our trailing equipment as well as we have been able to in the past. Topping off the list is
an abnormally high demand to hire company drivers for both replacement and growth.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Currently, we are entering the typical annual bid cycles with more uncertainty about capacity and
demand. We are actively discussing directional ideas for the next 12 to 18 months internally and with our
customers, including support for fleet expansion in Intermodal and Highway Services trailing equipment.
ROIC has long been our guiding principle when it comes to determining where to allocate capital. We ask
ourselves, what does the customer need and can we generate a proper return on the investments to serve
those needs? How can we advance the agreements and relationships we have with customers to better
align our deal cycles with our equipment cycles? Personally, I think annual jump ball bids are dated and
not good for the customers. We can't jump ball our equipment every year. Encouragingly, we have seen
some progress in modernizing the business models in Intermodal and Highway Services. We hope that will
continue.

I'll ask our business leaders to cover the segments. For the overall current state of our business, let me
just say that I continue to be encouraged with the work being done in our digital transformation with 360
Marketplace, not only within our brokerage business, but also as a tool set for us to use with other asset
and nonasset services. I'm also encouraged with the progress so far in developing our big and bulky Final
Mile Services. This includes the performance of our acquisitions before COVID and also the organic growth
we have experienced. Both of these key plays were called to help the company evolve several years ago,
and as with any difficult business, we need time to reveal the progress. We will continue to lean into both
of these channels going forward. Our more established lines, Intermodal and Dedicated, give us a solid
base to work from, and we believe that both of these businesses present sound growth and return profiles
going forward.

Let me close by saying that during the past 8 months, I have witnessed a true test of what I have long
believed to be a culture at J.B. Hunt that is centered on people, a commitment to each other and our duty
to serve our customers. We see that duty as a privilege and know that we need each other to get the job
done. I have seen true leadership from our executives in every aspect of running the company, and I look
forward to building out our 2021 and 2022 plans together with this great team.

With that, I will turn the call over to John Kuhlow. John?

John Kuhlow
Senior VP of Finance, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer & Interim CFO

Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, joining us on the call today. I'll provide a couple of quick
comments on the third quarter from a consolidated perspective and then let the business unit leaders
cover their segments.

The most prevalent cost impacts in the quarter were driven by the disruption in our networks due
to congestion and capacity tightness from labor challenges. We saw other direct costs related to the
pandemic begin to moderate during the quarter. We continue to offer paid time off for our employees that
have quarantined as well as invest heavily in caring for our employees through protective equipment and
workstation enhancements as we return to office. We incurred approximately $4 million of specific costs in
the quarter that were not planned prior to the pandemic for a total of $29 million year-to-date.

We performed well in repositioning and redeploying our people and assets as effectively as possible
to avoid furloughs and layoffs, which was the right call given the labor challenges noted. We continue
to carefully review our spend, balancing the need to invest for the long term, but being mindful of our
current environment and resource needs. Regarding the management of accounts receivable, we are
pleased with how our teams worked with our customers to handle payment issues, and we saw customer
loss reserves returned to pre-pandemic levels during the third quarter. We continue to closely monitor our
working capital metrics and the changing credit landscape.

As we've communicated throughout the year, our long-term approach to capital management has not
changed. However, like the second quarter and given the uncertainty in the freight markets and the
pandemic, we made intentional adjustments to our approach for the sake of protecting liquidity. While still
confident in our balance sheet strength and investment-grade status, we maintained higher cash positions
through the third quarter as we felt it prudent given uncertainty in market liquidity. Accordingly, we ended
the quarter with approximately $320 million in cash with resulting net debt just under $1 billion. We still

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

target our leverage ratio at 1x EBITDA and anticipate staying within close range of that metric. As of
today, we're forecasting our full year 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million to $625
million, which includes revenue equipment as well as approximately $100 million of technology investment
in our core transportation management system. Overall, we're pleased with our balance sheet strength
and feel we are in a great position to invest in our long-term asset and technology plans.

That's all I have prepared, and I'll now turn it over to Nick Hobbs to expand on Dedicated and Final Mile.

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I want to spend my time this morning discussing the
performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile segments. I'll also provide some updates on our pipeline and
give some high-level expectations for these businesses in the future.

I'll start with Dedicated, or DCS. DCS had another solid quarter, highlighted by strong executional
performance that delivered a 5% improvement in operating income year-over-year on roughly a similar
tractor fleet. In addition, strong utilization of our assets, the benefits of greater density in our operating
region, performance was also driven by lower driver turnover, lower T&E expense versus the prior year
and less customer start-up cost. As we stated last quarter, we expected new contract wins to be offset by
some attrition at accounts, given all the unique challenges the current environment and the pandemic that
has presented us a broad and diverse portfolio of customers. And that would ultimately keep our truck
fleet accounts stable for the remainder of the year. While that is still the case, we are feeling a lot better
about the pipeline, which I will address next.

As of September 30, we have sold 890 trucks worth of new Dedicated business year-to-date, which
compares to 430 trucks sold as of our last quarter. As a reminder, we had previously expected to sell 600
to 800 trucks worth of new business this year, and I'm proud to have achieved this goal a quarter earlier.
We have seen a meaningful uptick in conversations and conversion of opportunities to sign contracts over
the last 3 months. Customer challenges, including lack of available drivers, higher insurance cost, the
desire of companies to allocate capital to their core businesses, in addition to some of the flexibilities
offered by professionally outsourced dedicated fleet solutions, are all driving greater demand for our
services. Our service and ability to adapt to customer needs throughout the pandemic has served as a
testament to the value we bring, which we believe is evidenced by this positive update on our pipeline.
Looking out, we continue to target 11% to 13% operating margins over the long term as customer start-
up cost, higher driver wages, recruiting cost and travel and entertainment expenses normalize.

Now shifting gears to Final Mile, or FMS. FMS was able to deliver all-time record revenue of $182 million in
the quarter or 22% growth versus the year ago period and returned to slight profitability as we predicted
last quarter. We are seeing strength across our portfolio in the furniture, appliance and pool distribution
business with ample opportunities for growth in new market segments like home exercise equipment and
home improvement. To put it bluntly, the pipeline of opportunities is as strong as I've ever seen it. As a
result, we are continuing to invest in our product and service offering to ensure the highest standards
of service, safety and satisfaction are met in this critical component of the supply chain as we deliver
products of our customers' customer. Looking out, we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities
in this rapidly growing channel.

That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Shelley.

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Today, my comments will focus on our performance in
Highway Services, which includes both ICS and truck; how we continue to respond to complex challenges
on behalf of our customers; and an update on our investments in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 as
well as 360box.

First, I'm extremely proud of the progress the team in both ICS and JBT made in the quarter on many
strategic and operational fronts as we and the industry continue to face unique challenges. ICS was able

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

to deliver a record $431 million in revenue in the quarter, a 28% increase year-over-year and a 42%
increase versus the second quarter. More encouraging is ICS' ability to capitalize on this growth despite
only a 5.5% increase in operating costs in the segment, highlighting the benefits of scale in leveraging
the build-out of our platform. JBT delivered 16% revenue growth versus the prior period despite a 7%
decline in average truck count as JBT continues to evolve into more of an asset-light service offering with
a continued rollout in investment in 360box. As a result, third-party capacity providers have tremendous
visibility to select power-only loads following our trailers, utilizing our 360box trailer pool. We continue
to see promising data across both ICS and JBT related to our customer activity and engagement and our
ability to scale the model to grow to meet the need of our customers.

Next, I'm also extremely encouraged by our team's ability to help customers solve for their capacity
challenges by providing solutions tailored for what fits the customers' unique needs. The marketplace for
J.B. Hunt 360 provides a platform to serve whatever a customer wants, whether that is a J.B. Hunt asset
or a third-party carrier solution, committed or spot capacity or guaranteed tender acceptance; and at the
service levels that beat industry standards, whether the alternative is an asset or nonasset solution. In
addition, we provide tremendous visibility with data and market analytics to help our customers make
informed decisions that will save the money through greater efficiency. All of J.B. Hunt segments have
visibility into the platform as well with the ability to leverage opportunities to drive efficiencies with our
own assets. As you will hear from Darren, this helps us serve customers and meet our commitments when
circumstances might not otherwise allow. It's a comprehensive approach to being able, to the best of our
ability, to tell our customers yes, when we or others might otherwise say no. We will continue to focus on
partnering with customers that see the value of our comprehensive team approach with our goal to build
raving TAM.

In closing, our investments remain focused on our people, technology and scaling the platform, and we
continue to be on track with our long-term plan. As we stated in our last call, scaling the platform is one
of the greatest risks and opportunities to achieving our long-term targets, and our recent performance
has us even more encouraged. In the third quarter, 360 saw Truckload volume growth of 22%, an all-
time record in the number of carriers, users and loads on the platform. In JBT, we are and will continue
to make investments, albeit on a smaller scale, in building out our 360box program. We see that business
continuing to evolve into a more asset-light blend of trailers, third-party carriers, with some blend of
company trucks and being complementary value-added service offerings to our customers.

I'd now like to turn it over to Darren to talk about Intermodal.

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. Today, I wanted to focus my comments on 3 key topics:
network performance, the current demand and pricing environment and some general thoughts around
how we begin to move forward from here.

First, I continue to be encouraged with our team's relentless effort to solve capacity challenges for our
customers despite what I view as the most difficult environment from a network balance and fluidity
perspective I have seen during my career. Rail terminal congestion and a slower pace of unloading at
customer destinations have contributed to a meaningful slowdown in the velocity of the supply chain and
thus, the productivity of our equipment. The primary theme across both of these challenges is centered
around labor shortages. Our rail providers are working through labor shortages at some key rail terminal
operations. While we are confident that they will get back to their productivity targets, this negatively
impacted the quarter. Also, our customers have also been challenged with labor at the warehouses, and
the time it takes to unload our equipment has increased meaningfully year-over-year, impacting our
overall equipment productivity and otherwise available capacity we can provide to the market.

At JBI, we have also experienced cost challenges related to availability of labor, given the tight and
extremely difficult driver market, which negatively impacted margins in the quarter. We are making
progress on the driver front, but the driver shortage remains a challenge for the industry. We certainly
expect some improvements in all of these areas moving forward, but we don't yet know if we can achieve
even last year's velocity in the fourth quarter.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

During the quarter, volume demand was extremely strong. The challenges from weaker velocity began to
impact us in late July and continued throughout the quarter. Volume growth in July was 6%, August was
flat and September grew 2%. Across the board, our customers have asked us to provide more capacity.
Our ability to flow empty equipment back to the West Coast to support the Eastbound demand was limited
during the quarter due to the velocity challenges previously mentioned, which we estimate prevented us
from completing as many as 20,000 more loads in the quarter.

Many of you may want to ask if we were able to yield manage our capacity during the quarter in an effort
to chase higher prices. At J.B. Hunt, we communicated 2 priorities as the pandemic began: number one,
the health and well-being of our employees; and two, to honor commitments we made to our customers.
We believe a business that takes care of its people and honors its commitments to customers, particularly
in challenging times, is a recipe for long-term sustainable growth. With that in mind, all of our capacity
has been consumed with meeting minimum commitments during this difficult capacity-constrained
environment. On a positive note, we have worked closely with both ICS, JBT and DCS to provide additional
capacity solutions for our customers while we continue to focus on our work to improve velocity in our
network. We believe that working collectively to provide solutions for our customers provides a strong
foundation for long-term growth.

As we move forward into Q4 and 2021, we don't see anything changing on the demand front. We continue
to make small steps of progress on the velocity front. At this stage of the peak season shipping cycle,
we expect the velocity challenges experienced in Q3 to continue in Q4 with small improvements in all
the areas. The pricing bid cycle for 2021 is just beginning. Certainly, we would expect a lot of discussion
with our customers regarding capacity planning and cost management. We are prepared to expand our
container fleet for growth, but we will need to balance appropriate targeted returns on our investments to
do so, and we will engage with all of our customers with that thought in mind.

In closing my prepared comments, I want to say that we're not satisfied with these results in our volume
trends, margin performance or equipment utilization. We are not changing our long-term margin target of
11% to 13%, and we continue to believe we have a pathway to improvements in this area.

That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it back to you, Brad.

A. Brad Delco
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations
Thanks, Darren. [Operator Instructions] So Stephanie, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for
questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

Your first question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore.

Jonathan B. Chappell
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Darren, I just wanted to ask you -- the volume trends were good to hear. As we think about the
repositioning the imbalances, even the shortages of labor, did that get any better July to September
entering October, especially considering that the volumes were maybe the greatest in July? Or was it kind
of equally bad throughout the quarter and no kind of meaningful improvement yet as you're through the
first month of this quarter?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Well I would say, and frankly, in July, we had a slightly better fluidity in the system. As we got into the
back half, really August, throughout the quarter, we have continued to really struggle with the velocity of
the equipment. So July had 6% growth, as we highlighted, over the previous July of 2019. As we went
throughout the quarter though, velocity of the equipment and our ability to relocate empties has remained
very challenging. And so far in October, that challenge continues.

Jonathan B. Chappell
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then, Shelley, super quick follow-up for you. Just on the ICS, the growth on the top line has
been tremendous, but the margin pressure remains. Any change to the thought of becoming breakeven
in that business by the middle of next year? Does that get pushed to the right at all given some of the
investments that you're making?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Well so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are encouraged with the growth we're experiencing
and also the appetite that our customers have to really be interested in doing business differently. John
talked about that in his opening comments that the jump ball scenario, we believe, could be something
different, and we are pushing inside 360 to deliver that on behalf of our customers. Having said that, we
have more confidence as we progress through the quarter and into the fourth quarter that our comments
around the second half of next year remain intact and that we should return to profitability by sometime
next year second half.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So maybe thinking specifically about some of the cost, the elevated costs on the Intermodal side in
the third quarter, it doesn't sound like they all come out of 4Q. But can you give us maybe a little bit
of a cadence of how we should think about sort of regaining fluidity and what that means from a cost
perspective? Understanding that you still think that the longer-term margin guidance is intact, how quickly
can you kind of recover towards those levels?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Yes. As we get into the bid cycle, we're talking about that very challenge with our customers. I think
we've -- you've heard that theme from our comments so far is we've got to find a way to deal with that
a little bit differently than what we've done in the past. So the reality is we need time to implement new
prices. Certainly, we need the rail system congestion to be relieved somewhat. I don't really expect that
to happen in Q4. And as we move into 2021, clearly, I would expect some congestion challenges to relieve
a little bit in the first quarter. That would be normal, but nothing about 2020 has been normal so far. So
we'll have to wait and see. But certainly, new pricing, which would also help to cover some of our cost
challenges, is not likely to be visible until Q2 or even Q3 of next year. And that's when we would get the
bulk of the business repriced as we go through the bid cycle.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then the quick follow-up is just on the loads. When we think about the
fourth quarter, what it sounds like you're saying is fleet is not necessarily getting bigger on a year-
over-year perspective, fluidity is not necessarily getting better. So you're not going to get utilization
enhancements from where you were in 3Q. So roughly kind of that lower single-digit run rate is a
reasonable expectation?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Well I don't know that we're ready to provide any kind of guidance on volume. But like I said, I don't really
anticipate velocity changes to be beneficial during Q4. And so it's difficult to think that we would have any
kind of material benefit coming in Q4.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Darren, I very much appreciate the comment on pricing just now. I was hoping if you can just remind
us of the cadence of how much of the -- I assume in the third quarter none of the book of business in
Intermodal reflected pricing that is reflective of what's happening in Truckload. If you could talk to us,
you said 2Q, 3Q, the bulk of the business, but is the -- is it kind of equally through the fourth quarter, you
get 20% of the book repriced? And if you could just help us with that cadence? And then I appreciate --
I'm sure the shippers appreciated kind of J.B. Hunt standing by them with respect to honoring contract
commitments. But that kind of implies that those shippers [indiscernible] J.B. Hunt Truckload, which kind
of fell through the floor. And if you could just talk about that dynamic because it seems like there are
certain carriers out there that are revisiting kind of what minimum contracts -- volumes were when the
equation was the other way and the pricing leverage was in the hands of shippers. If you can just talk
about kind of the exercise you guys did there to make sure that there wasn't necessarily money that was
being left on the table from a pricing perspective in the third quarter?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Okay. Well from an implementation standpoint, I think what you're hearing is we do want to engage
with customers in trying to rethink how we typically do this. It's -- the jump ball is difficult. And in fast-
changing times around us, it really gets amplified in terms of how harsh it can be on us, and probably
maybe some customers feel the same way if it's moving the other direction.

But historically, we would implement new prices on the smallest percentage of our business during Q4. So
call it, 10% to 15% of the business gets a new price on it, implemented and running through the system
during the quarter. Q1 would be more like 25% to 30% and the same for Q2 and Q3. So if you just kind of
break it into, maybe, call it, 30% in the first -- each quarter of the first 3 of the year and more like 10% in

10

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Q4 is just a good rule of thumb. I don't have -- I'm not going to give you the exact percentages, but that's
a good kind of benchmark for us.

As it relates to volume commitments and did -- our willingness to honor those commitments relative to
this demand environment compared to a customer's willingness to honor a commitment maybe when
times are changing, I think we're -- we felt confident that we needed to do a minimum expectation
because at the end of the day, while our commitment to the customer -- we would like for the customer
to have an equal commitment to us, but they're the customer. I mean we're going to have to -- we have
to earn their business every day. We have to continue to provide capacity and serve those customers
in the way that we set up our plan to do. And we felt like, right now, in this very, very difficult time, for
us to take capacity away and do something different with it would have been a challenge that was just
extremely difficult to overcome. So I know Shelley may want to have a comment or 2 about customers
relevant to that, and I'll let her comment at this point.

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Thank you, Darren. So Amit, we took a similar approach that we had in our past, if you looked at our 2017
and 2018 cycle, which was very similar, albeit this time, has a lot more disruption about it. We did stick
with our customers throughout that cycle and then started having conversations so that they could plan
for it, do appropriate budgeting. And I think that was prudent on our part and our customers' part. And in
the end, we were able to grow with our customers at appropriate margins.

We've recognized that we have more cyclicality happening right now over the last 4 years or so. Usually,
the market swings about every 5 or 6 years. In this case, it's swung twice now in this 5-year period. We
believe sticking to our commitments and walking our customers through it. We are so focused right now
on making sure we help our customers through this very difficult time. That's why we're unleashing every
lever we have internally in every piece of capacity that we have and making sure that we don't just fulfill
our commitments, but also help them through this very difficult time.

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

I was going to jump in and say, we have the same customers in Dedicated, a lot of them that they have
in the other business units. And I clearly feel the impact of them being true to their customers. It pays
big dividends on our side. We have a very high retention rate, as you see in our business, and that plays
across our entire portfolio. So you take care of them in one segment, across all segments, they're there
with you through thick and thin. We've seen that historically.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That's very helpful. And just one quick follow-up, if I could, just going back to what Darren said in terms
of the pricing on the book of business. The puts and takes as you enter the fourth quarter, you'll have
some of the pricing embedded in the book of business. Obviously, the fluidity is still an issue, COVID is still
an issue, but I assume it gets better. Do margins come down -- sorry, did OR come down as you move 3Q
to 4Q? Just talk to us about the puts and takes as you move from 3Q to 4Q.

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Yes. I think that's sort of the question that we all have. We're continuously looking for improvements
in our -- on our cost front. Without implementing a significant amount of new pricing or some really
significant change in our velocity, it's hard for me to see a pathway towards any real material change.
Certainly, we think that over the course of the next year, we should be able to see a trend where we're
moving back towards our long-term guidance.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Darren, I don't know if you have any thoughts on fourth quarter volumes, but if you do, that would be
great. And then just as I think about third quarter, I look at IANA volumes that were up 10%. I see BN's
intermodal train speeds were up. Norfolk's were flat. Is this a ramp issue? Or is there a reason why you're
lagging the broader industry in Intermodal right now?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Well I understand that BN's train speed is up. There hasn't been a lot of challenges in the line of road.
When the trains get out of the terminals, they're moving. But terminal congestion is not a part of that
velocity measure that you see, and that has been a significant impact on our ability to drive volume
growth. Now do I think that the IANA data shows significant growth? Yes. And some of that is in the LTL
and parcel. So that business today moves -- in the past, you would see that more in trailers. Today, a lot
of that business has converted to 53-foot containers. So the IANA data doesn't really break out LTL and
parcel and container moves compared to the domestic intermodal. So I feel like the industry was able to
grow faster than J.B. Hunt. I'm not going to argue that. Certainly, we would have expected to maintain our
same growth rate, but the congestion in our system frankly didn't allow it during the quarter, and that's
what we've highlighted. And I would expect to get back to where we're growing at a similar pace to the
industry in domestic intermodal.

As it relates to all the parcel and LTL growth that the railroads are experiencing, I'm going to leave it to
you guys to figure out better ways to see that. Scott, we're turning down. I mentioned in my prepared
comments that we think we could have handled 20,000 more loads in the quarter, and that's a -- I think
that's a soft conservative estimate. We are turning down thousands of loads per week. In some cases,
we're turning down Eastern Network growth opportunities because we have to struggle to find the capacity
to serve and honor these commitments we've made. And we feel strongly that over the long term, that
will absolutely benefit us. It certainly hurt us in the quarter.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then if I can just ask one for Shelley. So I think in 2017, you were the -- I think the first one
that prepared the market for double-digit rate increases in '18. How are you thinking about the magnitude
of pricing? Should it be similar in Intermodal and Truckload next year? Or is there a reason why one would
be up more than the other?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

So we did host a conference call with our customers. It's actually a video call, had about 70% to 80%
of our revenue actually on that call. And it was just an open discussion with our business segment
Presidents, along with John Roberts. And really just wanted to give our customers an update and a view
of what's happening in the market from a dislocation perspective and a labor challenge issue. We got a lot
of questions around that from our customers, really just looking to lean in to how they should think about
next year, and we just aren't prepared already to have that discussion. We really want to wait through
more of peak season and past the election for us to really come to a better consensus on what we believe
pricing will do.

But having said that, Scott, our cost challenges are real. I think our customers are having cost challenges
also. We do want to have a metered approach and making sure we understand our growth with customers,
along with cost recovery, and I believe that we'll be talking with our customers towards the end of this
year. I really couldn't say what range I feel like that is because if I gave one, I think it would be quite off.
It could be -- I do think it will be up. It could be up significantly or it could be more modest. We'll just wait
to see what happens, and I would expect to talk to them towards the end of the year.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Your Next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I wanted to start with a question on Dedicated. It was good to hear about the activity in the pipeline
picking up. Nick, when you think about the trucks that have been sold year-to-date, I think you said 890
units, can you help us think through the cadence of those new business wins coming on board going
forward? And then from a start-up cost perspective, what we should be expecting? I'm just curious if
margins sequentially should be coming under some pressure because of start-up costs? Or if there's
enough operating leverage from growth to offset that?

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

Yes. Thanks, Justin. The timing of those, you'll see some of those start-up in Q4. Some of them are
already starting up right now and some of them will come towards the end of the year. And then there's a
pretty good group of them that starts early in Q1. So towards the end of the year, beginning of next year
is when those that have been sold right now. So it's typically -- when we sign on, it's typically 90 to 120
days until you start seeing those trucks on the ground. So anyway, we feel good about that.

Start-up cost, we've got a larger base to cover a lot of that cost. And so you'll see some cost. It's hard to
predict just because drivers are very tight, and so driver wages and recruiting costs are going to be up
as we try to find those drivers. So it's pretty hard to predict, but I think you'll see a slight pressure on us
from some of those costs.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. So just to be clear, it sounds like margins in Dedicated in the fourth quarter could be down a little
bit sequentially versus the third quarter. Is that your expectation?

John Kuhlow
Senior VP of Finance, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer & Interim CFO

We haven't provided a guidance on margins. But I think like Nick suggested, maybe a little bit of start-
up costs. But there's still pretty good momentum in Dedicated, and his guys are executing. So we'll see.
Winter weather can always play a role in cost, but no specific guidance for Dedicated margins other than
what we stated long-term being 11% to 13%.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe shifting to ICS. Shelley, I was wondering how you're thinking about
the level of tech spend and operating expenses in general going forward. Is the idea that operating
expenses can kind of hold with current levels and you can scale the business to get to profitability in the
back half of next year? Or how should we be thinking about that operating expense trend in the next 12 to
18 months?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

So from an investment perspective, we really talked about investing in 3 areas: in our people, in our
technology and in scaling the business. And so you saw some benefit actually inside the third quarter
that's buried in there from some of the efficiencies that we're seeing from our operations groups, from
360. We've reinvested some of that into our shipper work and that has been part of our plan. As we
continue to scale through the rest of next year, we believe that our cost basis to stay relatively the same,
maybe up just slightly. But if you were to look through this year, we've done a great job really managing
our count of people in a very constrained environment, I might add, but our platform has really produced
great results for us. I spoke of that earlier in my prepared comments that the platform has reached

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

records and continuing to reach records inside our segments. That's allowing us to scale more quickly in
that part and invest in the rest of it.

So for next year, I would expect our margin improvement for the second half of next year to come as a
result of cost as a percent of revenue in both labor and technology to improve as we progress throughout
the year.

Your next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Shelley, on the July call, you were the first to kind of flag that gross margins were running at, I think,
what you call, an unacceptable rate. It seems like gross margins were pretty tough for the entire quarter,
but can you just talk about how that trended through 3Q and how that's running in October so far?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Yes. Great question. So the third quarter was the exact inverse of what we saw in the second quarter
as the brokerage market was really trying to find that balance between supply and demand. So as we
looked into July, that was our worst gross margin performance, and we continued to improve as the
quarter progressed. And as we've moved here into October, I think our customers have responded well.
There is a lot of business that is moving, that is unplanned, that really published pricing would not be
appropriate. You saw some of that in our percent of business that's actually in the spot market. But I
would say margins in September and October are better than they were in both July and August.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And maybe as a follow-up on the Intermodal side. John, kind of do you -- I mean, it seems
like some of these issues are not going to be resolved overnight. Clearly, investors are focused on the
extremely tight truck market and the potential for spillover from truck into intermodal. Do you feel like the
upside opportunity could be restricted somewhat because of these operating issues at the end of 2020 and
into 21?

John N. Roberts
President, CEO & Director

I'm going to have Darren answer that.

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Yes. Well certainly, we're working with our customers across the board, where we're talking about what
we're capable of doing with our Intermodal capacity, and like we've said, honoring those commitments.
And then when we run out of capacity and -- but we've honored the commitments, they still have more
demand. And we're talking as an organization about how we can drive value into the organization and to
the customer with the capacity we can find.

As it relates to the railroads, I just think -- I think all of the railroads want to have ongoing dialogue about
improving productivity at their terminals, and I think we're engaged in those conversations. Now it's very
difficult to implement significant changes in that area during the course of this really unusual rapid climate
demand that occurred over the course of the summer. As we go into next year, we will be talking about
how -- what are the ways that we can expand capacity in the rail system without necessarily investing or
just buying new terminals. The long-term value for railroads can't just be that they're going to expand and
buy more parking in order to accommodate intermodal growth. We all have to work with our customers,
railroads and us together, in order to drive more productivity through those terminals. And I'm 100%

convinced that railroads want to do that. And that's not going to be something that we have to push for,
they want to do that. It has been painful in 2020. And yes, in the remaining part of this year, certainly, I
don't expect -- I would be surprised if that really changed in any material way.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

You mentioned a little bit about changing sort of how you view jump ball bids. I'd love to get some more
color on that and how that would change across your different units. Is this something where you're going
to look to set up contracts more like Dedicated has?

John N. Roberts
President, CEO & Director

Yes. This is John. So we've all been in this business for quite some time, and I have witnessed a great
deal of evolution in many areas of not only what we do, but what the industry does. But one area that
really hasn't seemed to change is, frankly, for nearly 3 decades or longer, how we price and arrange for
the services presented in our Highway and Intermodal business. And we have learned different ways to
position that service contractually with some niche kind of approaches that really work. And if you think
about the nature of the equipment that we need to procure to service customers, the life cycle of those
equipments and those contracts that we need to arrange with railroad providers and other carriers, it's out
of sync with the way we do business with our customers.

And we've studied, in fact, Darren and I just had a really good conversation about this last week that
historically, there is no real value to the customer in that constant annual event that really takes a lot of
time, doesn't really present a lot of value. And if we worked more collaboratively with agreements that
were more logically aligned with the services and the equipment we were providing, I think everybody
would win. We'd have better understanding for our networks. We'd have appreciation for how to buy the
equipment. I think it'd probably do good for our labor and our drivers, our utilization, all the things that
go into really what we learned at Dedicated, which is an engineered answer -- now I don't suggest that
we could apply all of the logic that we've learned from our DCS business. But there is a much better way
to arrange these contracts to where -- particularly our larger shippers, who need us year in and year out,
frankly, could be set up to advantage both us, our providers and our customers. And I've seen it already
happen. And in some cases, we're in the middle of that, and we are all benefiting from it. And so my
encouragement to the organization and to our customers is consider changing the way we do business in
this one-way world to a more thoughtful and frankly logical approach, and I'm going to be pushing for it.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And that's something, I'm assuming, will take years to sort of move over customer contracts like that?

John N. Roberts
President, CEO & Director

Most likely, but you got to start somewhere.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. No. I figured. Go ahead please, Shelley.

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Just wanted to add to that. Our customers are really asking us to grow across all of our segments. That's
something we're seeing great success in, and we believe that, that will be longer term from a growth

perspective. And so when we think about how we plan, we don't just plan with ourselves, we also plan
with the railroad providers. And the more information we can give them and the more understanding we
can give them about the customers that are really secured and locked in a lane level, the better that we
can do together to make sure that we have great capacity across the board. So I feel like doing a 1-year
bid, it's a difficult for us to walk our railroad providers, certainly, what we need from a driver perspective.
It's like we're short-term planning in a tactical environment versus really focusing on a better long-term
strategic answer.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That makes all the sense in the world. And let me throw really one quick one. You mentioned growing the
trailers in Highway Services. Is this because you need them with catch-up business? Or is there something
changing in how the supply chain is working that requires you to own more trailers going forward?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Well one of the things that we've heard from our customers as we have introduced 360 Marketplace is,
for the most part, that has been for our brokerage segment, and that's how the business started. But if
you look at the truckload industry, about half of the business actually requires more capital from a trailing
perspective. And so if you think about the capacity that is available in the market, 83% of the capacity
available is in the small carrier community with 10 or less trucks. So moving into Marketplace now, we've
actually blended both the drop trailer environment with a live load environment, creating 1 network
instead of 2, and our customers are loving that product.

So we've leaned in with the customers early in bid season. It's one of the reasons our growth really
started out strong this year. We continue to have customers ask us how many boxes we will move. But
as I said in my prepared remarks, we're moving to a more asset-light answer. And so we do have a great
blend of company trucks and independent contractors and even brokering some of that business, all
sitting inside the platform. So I think the market is large and the ability to create a better, more efficient
network exists significantly, and putting 360box or our drop trailers in that network just makes sense from
a capacity perspective for customers.

Operator

Your next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Todd Clark Fowler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I understand the reluctance maybe to give some near-term guidance on Dedicated margins. But Nick, it
sounds like that -- in your comments, you said that margin should kind of get back to the 11% to 13%
range longer term, but it's been close to 7 quarters where you've been above that range. Is there a reason
why structurally the margin profile of that business can't be higher, especially in an environment maybe
where travel and entertainment isn't what it was historically? So just a thought on why you can't continue
to run at this range, even if you do see some of the expenses normalize longer term.

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

Yes. I think the way we look at our deals, we price each one of our deals based on a set targeted return
on invested capital. And so if we get some deals that are a little lighter on assets, the customer has their
own trailers, each deal is priced differently. And so I'm just trying to look at the long range of we don't
know which mix of heavy assets, light assets are going to come in. So we think long term, that's still the
guidance that we're very comfortable with based on deals that we see in the pipeline and so forth, just
based on pure ROIC.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Yes, Todd, this is Brad. And maybe to say it a little bit differently is, I think, regardless of what happens,
over time, the way that Dedicated will approach pricing deals is always focusing on return on invested
capital. And to the extent, as Nick alluded to, some of the deals are more capital intensive, yes, it could
push margins higher in order to achieve the same targeted return on invested capital. And so that --
to the extent there is changes in margin, that could be a big driver of that change. But I think more
importantly, what will not change is how the -- we initially approach those deals, which is a focus on those
returns.

Todd Clark Fowler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Yes, that makes sense. And so I think what's maybe difficult for us to see is a little bit of a mix of
the deals that are coming through the asset-sensitive versus the asset-light, and that's just something
that it's difficult to kind of tease out of the numbers the way they're reported, it sounds like.

Just for my follow-up, Nick, if I could ask maybe sticking with you, with the growth that you're seeing right
now in Final Mile and kind of the trends that you talked about, can you talk about the platform that you
have in place to support that you're seeing both near term and kind of what you expect longer term? As
you think about that business continuing to grow, is that something that is all organic at this point and
require just more infrastructure or is that something that you'd look to do acquisitions? And how do we
think about the costs that would be associated with facilitating what looks like some pretty decent growth
in that segment?

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

Yes. I would just say the existing business that we're running today, not a lot of infrastructure cost
of facilities or anything like that. A lot of the new deals that we're doing is running out of customers'
locations, doing home deliveries. So we don't see any big capital expense going in on infrastructure or
anything like that. And so we feel good about continued growth. Acquisitions, we always look. But as those
come in, the right deals approach us, we'll look at them. But there is a big runway just on organic growth
right now from what we're seeing with 5 or 6 of our largest customers. We're just a small percentage of
their business, and they're rolling out their networks and, and we're kind of riding along on their coattails.

Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.

Bascome Majors
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on the jump ball comment and a couple of prior questions on that. The evolution
-- if you guys were able to move to what you think would be optimal for the industry and in a way that
your customers would agree to, is this -- is it more of a cost plus type longer-term commitment that you
have in mind that accounts for the capital intensity of that customer? Or is it setting some revenue or
volume floors that would also protect you in down markets? I just want to understand more tactically what
a new world could look like Intermodal pricing that you think would have a win-win sort of set up for both
you and your customers?

John N. Roberts
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Bascome. I'll start and then ask Shelley or Darren or anybody else to come in. I think you
hit on a lot of ideas that we have explored and had -- have had success within the past with different
customers. One of the things we implemented some time ago in Dedicated was kind of an index-based
pricing strategy, where we have a way to recognize labor cost and other inflationary pressures that are
visible and easy to process and recognize and applied to our pricing in a way that doesn't require all the
activity we present in a bid workout. And we spend that time working on the business. We have a program
we call customer value delivery, where we identified metrics, key performance indicators that keep us

on track with service and performance. All those things can be tied together so that the energy is on the
service, not the one-way, as we call, jump ball pricing. I think volume and different levels of either lane
or total commitment can be helpful to, as Shelley said, provide the really needed guidance that we would
want to present, i.e., to our rail providers to say, "Hey, this is what we've got on the book." And if you look
at Nick's business, Nicholas our retention now is -- still 90...

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

It's 97 and some change.

John N. Roberts
President, CEO & Director

High 90s. So we know what's happening in that business year in and year out and can really plan for
that. And I think the reason that we have such high retention is because we do a really good job for the
customer. Why else would they stay with us? And so that's basically the idea here is, can we apply some
of that logic? We have had some experimentation with this. We've seen it work. We do think it's better for
the customer. I mean it's not just better for us, it's actually really better for the customer. And we, frankly,
made a living by prioritizing that need. Let me see if Shelley or Darren want to add anything to that.

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Bascome, I would say our customers really want a prediction for their budgeting. And I think our ability to
give them that prediction, particularly from an asset perspective, largely comes down to how long we can
do business together because in our cost basis to that, if you think about bid season, we're able to actually
fill in gaps and fill in lanes that are embedded in our price the longer that we have the business together. I
do not think that our customers are interested in nor do I think it's good for us to do cost plus on all of our
business. That does not leave a predictable budget to a customer, and I don't think that's a good business
model.

However, I believe, in the bid process that the business that should be in there would be business that
is static and regular, and that business can be published and predicted for a customer. That business
also could go into a longer-term agreement, but there is a lot of business that moves in a more dynamic
nature. And that business is stale and old, trying to go up against a published price that really is not
commensurate to the market at every time. And that's what causes so many issues in the market. And as
we're talking to our customers about that, whether that's in Intermodal or any of our Highway Services
area, as our customers have lanes and loads that are unpredictable and that we can't get into a repeating
pattern, that business really needs to match up directly with capacity in the moment. And we have found
that over a longer period, that actually is better for customers. That is a factual number that we've
assigned to that internally to say we actually could save our customers more money if we were able to do
that for them and improve their service and capacity.

Nick, I just want to talk a little bit about the FMS segment. And you're seeing nice growth there, slight
turn of profitability, but obviously not where you want it. What's the biggest obstacle of getting the
margins either in line with Dedicated or where you want them? Because I know they're not going to be in
line with Dedicated because it's more asset-light, but how do you get from here to there?

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

Yes. It's a very, very fragmented industry. And so I try to look at it and take the same approach in
Dedicated. You give a customer fantastic service and great people that's executing that service, then you'll
be able to go in and get the appropriate returns that you need on rates as the contracts come up. And
so it's just a very methodical approach of executing, being best-in-class on service, taking care of our
customers' customers. And then over time, you will be able to improve the margins to an acceptable rate
of return. And we're methodically going down that path right now, trying to execute that. But it is a very
fragmented industry. And so you have to be very careful because there's a lot of small barriers to entry
right now is pretty low. But we think with a lot of our background checks, safety and security and things
that we do, we're going to set the bar higher to come into the industry, and then we'll be able to get a
higher price on our product and a better return.

David Griffith Ross
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And are you seeing much consolidation yet in the industry? Or is it still as fragmented as ever?
