Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone
As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the March quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor
Shipments, revenue, and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the midpoint of the range of guidance in the quarter
This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio as well as solid execution in cost management and our manufacturing and service operations
Revenue was $914 million in the March quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61 in the quarter and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.62. In our press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share
With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release
Now turning to highlights of the March quarter demand environment
Although we are no longer guiding quarterly orders, for the time being, we will continue to share our perspective on the current end market demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends in KLA-Tencor's performance
Upon completion of an upgrade of our internal analysis systems, our plan is to begin providing end market mix detail for shipment results and guidance beginning in September quarter
At that time, all end market customer mix, business segment, and regional breakdowns will be provided on a shipment basis and we will discontinue all formal order commentary including disclosure of the quarterly results
But for now, for the March quarter, new orders were $990 million
Foundry was 54% of new system orders in March, driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes
We are currently modeling foundry orders to be approximately 50% of the total in the June quarter
Memory was 42% of new orders, with investment evenly split between DRAM and NAND
We are currently modeling memory orders to be about 40% of the total in the June quarter, with NAND representing about 60% of the memory mix
Logic was 4% of new system orders and is currently forecasted to be approximately 10% of the June quarter total
In terms of the approximate distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of calendar 2017; wafer inspection was 56% of new orders; patterning was 21%, patterning includes orders from our reticle inspection business; non-semi was approximately 3%; and service was 20% of total orders
Total shipments were a record $909 million in the quarter, finishing above the $890 million midpoint of guidance for March
Looking forward, we are modeling June quarter shipments to be a new record at the midpoint of guidance and be in a range of $890 million to $970 million
Current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels in excess of $900 million and we expect this trend to extend at least through the second half of the calendar year
This outlook has strengthened since the earnings call back in January
Current expectations are for second half of 2017 shipments to be up mid-single-digits versus the first half of the calendar year
Turning now to the income statement, revenue was $914 million in March, finishing above the midpoint of the range of guidance
We expect revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $945 million in the June quarter
Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.5%, in line with expectations for the quarter
The strong gross margin performance in March is consistent with recent margin trends in terms of mix of product business and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations
Compared to the December quarter, the benefit of the incremental sequential revenue was offset by a less favorable product mix in the period
Looking forward to the June quarter, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 62.5% and 63.5%, up about 50 basis points at the midpoint versus the March quarter, due principally to the mix of products we plan to revenue in the quarter
As we highlighted last quarter, going forward, we expect to deliver gross margin results a couple hundred basis points above our 2015 published business model targets due to a number of factors, including customer reception of new product offerings, more efficient new product introduction execution, and improved variable cost management in service and manufacturing operations
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $224 million in March, up about $3 million compared with December and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%
We are modeling operating expense levels of between $234 million and $238 million in the June quarter due to higher compensation expenses and prototype materials expenses for current programs
For calendar 2017, we are modeling operating expenses to be around $950 million due to incremental investments in product road maps supporting 3D NAND and EUV inspection and metrology opportunities as well as higher variable compensation expense
Given our gross margin expectations, we expect to continue to deliver operating margins solidly above our published model for the foreseeable future
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter, just below our previously guided long-term planning rate of 22%, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and other discrete items impacting the tax rate
You should assume a 22% tax rate going forward for modeling purposes
Finally, net income – non-GAAP net income for the March quarter was $256 million and we ended the quarter with 158 million fully diluted shares outstanding
I'll now turn briefly to highlights on the balance sheet and our cash flow statement
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $111 million compared with the December quarter
Cash from operations was $225 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $215 million
In March, we paid an aggregate of $86 million of regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and made a supplemental payment of $25 million towards our outstanding term loan
We expect to continue executing our delevering commitments over the remainder of the calendar year, consistent with our leverage targets
In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in March reflect our market leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer's growth strategies at the leading-edge and in legacy design rules, and our industry-leading business model
This, fueled by record total backlog of $1.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, position the company for another year of greater-than-market growth and an overall WFE industry environment that is currently forecasted to grow mid-single-digits or higher in calendar year 2017. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of the portfolio of solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements of leading-edge, and our operational core competencies
With that, to summarize, our guidance for the June quarter is: shipments in the range of $890 million to $970 million; revenue between $885 million and $945 million; and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.44 per share to $1.64 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.46 per share to $1.66 per share
This concludes our remarks on the quarter
I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A
Ed?
Well, Tim, we haven't published a new model so it's a little bit difficult for me to answer that in terms of different WFE levels
I mean, I think the way you have to work through that is, as I've said around the revenue performance from an operating margin perspective, I think we're operating a couple hundred basis points better than what we have published before
But the easiest way to model that is if you're talking about in nearer term, and I think it's important assumption, are we talking now or a year from now and so on? But if you're just thinking in nearer term a $40 billion environment, you'd have to think about process control intensity on that
And I think in calendar 2016, process control intensity was below 13 percentile, so somewhere between 13% and 14%
The mix of business would be a factor in that
Market share was Gartner just reported 51%
We've got internal objectives to gain share at least a point of share a year over the next few years so that's certainly a factor there
And then our service business, which is currently – would be somewhere around $800 million into calendar 2017. So if you put all that together with the operating margin, I suggest that I think you can probably work your way to an EPS result
Yeah, Farhan
It's a good question
So there is some acceleration, I would call it incremental investment
We think there are opportunities for us on the inspection side
Well, frankly, metrology side as well for driving more process control into 3D NAND
And so there are a number of efforts in the company that are focused on that
There is also work that we're doing to enable EUV development activities
And so there's work there
Finally, the industry has strengthened, certainly the company performance has strengthened
So there's some variable comp dynamics that are part of that
And so when you add it all up, it looks like it's about $20 million higher for the year than what I was suggesting back in January
But our outlook has strengthened as well
So I think if you look back January versus today, we're probably in excess of $200 million of incremental revenue to where we see things today
And so if you follow our traditional drop-through model of operating margin, it's an incremental $20 million or so on costs
So it fits our model and we see it as an opportunity to invest in some of these big opportunities, we think, that will help drive process control intensity into 2018 and 2019. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thanks
And then, Rick, you talked about 2018 outlook looking positive at this stage
Can you maybe touch on some of the product drivers that give you confidence of some growth in 2018?
Well, so, C
, it's Bren
I mean, as we look to calendar or we look at 7-nanometer, I mean, 7-nanometer has a full shrink
You're shrinking in the front-end
You also have your shrinking in back-end in transistor wiring
So we think that that coupled with the multi-patterning schemes, the process integration structures that customers are doing with these new materials in the back-end will create a number of process window challenges, we think, will be good for our business
As we move into 7-nanometer, we have a number of new products that'll come out that customers will be able to try to address some of these technology challenges but also drive cost of ownership
So I think process control intensity per wafer goes up somewhere in that 20-ish percent range or so
Obviously, the number of wafer starts ultimately over time and design starts will be a factor in that because lots of designs change how customers invest
But how we're looking at it now is I think that to Rick's earlier comments, I mean, reuse will be limited
And I think the new product introductions plus the technology road map will be a good driver for our business
Well, the variable comp will adjust, right? So that's one factor that will play out as we move into 2018. I think the easiest way for you to think about modeling the company is back to the model that we had put out, we're targeting an operating margin level based on certain revenue targets
And we're exceeding the published model because of the strengths in gross margin, which we believe are sustainable
And so that's what's driving the outperformance
So as revenue grows, we will invest
And I think that as I outlined earlier, I think there's a lot of opportunities out there and so we'll invest in those
But we're committed to the operating model and that's how you got to think about it
Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren, and thank you for the comment
It really is more of an all-of-the-above statement
Certainly, logic, foundry into the second half of the year has strengthened it terms of the shipment profile
And we certainly saw that versus where we were in January
So now it looks like it's up a little bit and it's been really filling out in the December quarter
So we feel pretty good about that
I think in China we continue to be surprised by the customer pull that we see from those customers, so that's a factor in it as well
But I think all segments right now are investing and are putting a lot of pressure on us in terms of quick delivery
So I think the good thing about the upside we're seeing is it's quick orders and quick deliveries which will enable us to drive some revenue performance in the second half
But that's basically what's driving it
And I think finally the only other thing is that the order profile, so you look at the backlog that we're bringing into the year, the order result March, what we expect to be a book-to-bill greater than 1 in June
So we've got a fair amount of sort of backlog or runway in terms of what we see coming and how to scale and plan the factory through the second half of the year
Yeah
It's a good question and really, we're seeing benefit in a lot of places
I mean, we're seeing improving margin profiles in service, we're seeing improving margin profile across products
New product introduction execution has been very strong in terms of how you manage from transitioning from one product to another
And at these revenue levels, I think the scaling of our factory and the leverage that exists in that has all been good
So I don't envision a drop-off like you described
I mean, certainly, at these revenue levels, I think as I guided, I thought calendar 2017 was 62 plus or minus 50 basis points
I think we're probably at the higher end of that guidance range now as we look into next year
And I don't see anything on the horizon that suggests that this profile will change going forward
So we feel pretty good about it
And as I said earlier, I think what's driving how we're looking at our operating model and performance of various revenue levels is not so much about what we're spending, but how much more gross margin we think we're going to generate from our revenue
So the only thing I'll add to that is that in our unpatterned inspection business, we had a record year in FY 2016 and we just had a record quarter in that business in the March quarter from an order perspective
Now some of that is 3D NAND because 3D NAND is driving unpatterned inspection
They basically use these tools to monitor the deposition equipment to ensure cleanliness and so on, but also the wafer activity is a part of that
And I think that's starting and we expect to see that growing a little bit over time here and it'll be a nice tailwind as we progress through this year
Yeah
I think when you look across the year, our view on logic spending in 2017 versus 2016 is relatively flat, so I think it's a quarterly dynamic more than anything
So, yeah, I think it's just – we got orders that are going to get placed and numbers a little bit higher next quarter
Well, when you look at our order profile, I mean, it was so what we saw in 2016 and what we expect to see in 2017 for the most part is foundry-centric
And so it was roughly 15% of foundry orders in 2016 and maybe 25% of foundry orders in 2017. I think what's interesting is while the memory investment from a shipment perspective is more of an 2018 and beyond dynamic, we are starting to see memory orders show up in the funnel
And so as we look, I'm not sure exactly when we'll see those orders booked, whether we'll see them booked in June or whether we will see them booked in September
But they are for shipments in early 2018. And so your question about progress on the facilities is a good one, and so far as we monitor that and we begin to staff up in anticipation of supporting these ramps, these are factories we watch pretty closely
But right now, there's a lot of activity there and we're chasing trying to hire people and ramp up to be able to support those customers in a pretty diverse fab footprint overall across the country
Yeah, I think as Rick said, it's going pretty much according to plan
We revenued four tools in 2016, our plan is to revenue 8 to 10 tools in 2017. To Rick's point, they're seeded all over in multiple customers so across all the settlements
The other dynamic is driving Gen 5 besides the discovery opportunities where we compete more directly with (42:33) capabilities is that you're also seeing it deployed in EUV development situations too because it's used as a tool for radical verification when they print wafers and use the wafer results to calibrate pattern fidelity on the wafer or the reticle
So there's an additional use case there that we're encouraged by and we're in line with our plans
And I think by the end of calendar year 2017, we should have somewhere between, I don't know, 15 and 18 tools or so in the field fully installed
So we'll see how many we actually end up with revenue beyond the plan, I told you, but there's – they're out there and getting deployed, demonstrating value
Market share, just only thing I'll add is market share tends to be stronger with those customers? And so what comes with that is, to Rick's point, the need for some additional support as we work through it
So we have applications engineers in fabs all around the world and they get deployed in these opportunities
And we think we benefit pretty well from the market position we have on the tools and these folks help the customers get value out of the tools
