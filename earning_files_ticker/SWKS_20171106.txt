Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone
The Skyworks team produced record results in Q4 in fiscal 2017, demonstrating our traction within the increasingly vibrant and profitable Mobile and IoT ecosystems
Let me begin with a few fourth quarter highlights
We delivered revenue of $985 million, up 18% year-over-year, and above our guidance
We expanded gross margin by 30 basis points, and operating margin by 150 basis points sequentially
We achieved earnings per share of $1.82, up 24% year-over-year, $0.07 ahead of consensus
For the full year, we generated revenues of $3.7 billion, up 11%, with earnings per share of $6.45, up 16% year-over-year
And we produced exceptional operating cash flow, $1.5 billion, up 34% from last year
In addition to our strong financial performance, we've significantly expanded the aperture of our design win pipeline
Last quarter, we broadened our reach across all premier customers
Specifically, we powered Samsung's Galaxy and Note platforms, with proprietary DRx and SkyOne solutions, while adding GPS and DC/DC converters
We enabled Huawei's newest premium smartphones with low, mid and high band SkyOne, Wi-Fi, carrier aggregation, and proprietary SkyBlue power management solutions
And we leveraged SkyLiTE and SkyOne across new platforms at Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Motorola
And across our broad markets, we delivered fully integrated Zigbee and ISM modules for Bosch home security and Cisco's smart lighting systems
We commenced volume production of in-vehicle telematics at Hyundai, and launched wireless networking engines within DirecTV's 4K Genie receivers
We also supported Sonos' latest hi-fi speaker featuring Amazon Alexa
And we introduced next-generation 802.11ax Wi-Fi solutions, enabling a fourfold increase in speed and supporting up to 50 simultaneous users
We secured connectivity wins at DJI for virtual reality and drone applications, supplied precision GPS and antenna tuning for Fitbit's newest smart watches, and we unveiled high power solutions with leading base station customers for 5G MIMO deployments
So to summarize, we delivered yet another year of record results, capturing strategic design wins across all key market segments, while strengthening our balance sheet
At a higher level, the ubiquitous connected economy is gaining significant momentum and enhancing the way we live, work, play, and educate
The growth opportunity is enormous
Global mobile data usage is expected to grow five times between 2017 and 2021. IoT volumes are exploding, with 75 billion devices projected by 2025. And there is still the opportunity to connect the unconnected, which today represents over 2 billion people worldwide
In parallel, the applications driving our business are expanding to now include connected homes, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, wearables, as well as network infrastructure
And by definition, these applications would not be possible without fast, secure, power-efficient connectivity solutions provided by Skyworks
As we've previously discussed, the equity market is recognizing this macro-tend as powerful, highly profitable and accelerating
In fact, if we look at today's top five S&P 500 companies by market cap, they are all demonstrating successful monetization of the rapidly growing mobile economy
As a group, these five companies have created 2 trillion of incremental shareholder value since 2012, a clear testament to the strength of this industry
Meanwhile, the broad range of usage cases and expanding scope of newly connected platforms are creating an increasingly crowded radio spectrum, stressing network capacity and slowing data throughput
Our mission is to enable this data-driven world and alleviate the looming digital traffic jam
This will require an inflection point in global communication standards, and that's 5G
5G will represent a significant boost in speed, up to 100 times that that we see in 4G networks
5G will offer extremely low latency, a requirement for mission-critical applications such as driverless cars, machine-to-machine, and robotics
And 5G will be a key enabler to a massive rollout of IoT, greatly expanding network capacity and improving reliability
5G will also spawn new and previously unimagined applications, while greatly enhancing the performance and utility of existing mobile platforms
We will see this reflected in new unit growth in IoT applications and also across the global smartphone installed base
Keep in mind, the 5 billion subscribers today all operate on 2G, 3G, and 4G networks
In order to make the leap to 5G, system architectures will require significantly more powerful connectivity engines to ensure the intense performance challenges are realized
This upgrade wave will create an enormous growth catalyst for the entire smartphone ecosystem
And as a leader in unwiring the planet, Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize, with extensive technology breadth and depth, strategic partnerships with all leading smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated system solutions enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, all underpinned by our aggressive investments over the past two decades to expand our product portfolio, IP and scale
As a result, we have the profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet to extend our leadership position
Our strategic R&D and CapEx investments will be pivotal as the scale and technology requirements around 5G intensify
Finally, and most importantly, we are committed to delivering premium levels of profitability with above-market growth, while continuing to create sustainable shareholder value
I will now turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q1.
Thanks, Kris
Skyworks enters fiscal 2018 with strong momentum
Our outperformance is being driven by a vibrant, dynamic Mobile ecosystem, one that rewards companies who can resolve architectural complexity with simplified integrated solutions
The value inherent in the connected economy is apparent in our results
In the past five years, our revenues have more than doubled, EPS has more than tripled, and operating cash is up five times
In closing, our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time has never been more relevant and exciting
That concludes our prepared remarks
Operator, let's open the line for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Sure, I'll try to give you as much color as I can here
Well, as you know, I mean, China has been a strategic market for us for some time
It's a growing market
It's also a market that not only produces product in country, it exports
And as you've seen lately, they've also been a great consumer of global Tier 1 phones, so there's a lot that goes into that mix
For us, the theme that we're seeing right now and the theme that we're capitalizing on is this move towards higher-end performance within China
Huawei is a great example, where we have mid band, high band, low band, SkyOne, DRx technology, power technology, really rich content, moving that to Oppo and Vivo and Xiaomi as well
So, the real theme for us is moving that content up, moving that performance level up
And we're really happy to see that the consumer in China is up for that and asking for those products
Yeah, well, I think, both can be right
There's a low end, there's a mid end, and then there's a premium end
We participate in both the premium and the mid-tier, not so much in the low end
But where we're seeing real acceleration is when you look at $3 to $4 content 4G product moving up to higher end 4G that could be $6 or $7. That theme is playing out very well
We still have participation in the mid-tier, but again, the driving theme right now is about getting global phones that are rich in content that can sell in China, can sell even outside of China
So that's where we're seeing the benefit
I mean, Huawei has been a class case study for us
We've done extremely well with that customer
We've engaged early
We have incredible relationships and have been able to drive a wonderful set of products through their portfolio
And that's not changing
Sure, well, here's what I can tell you, Cody
We have a process for our guidance
We look through our backlog position
There's not a lot of speculation
We have great visibility in the current quarter as to where we are
And our job is to try to cement our designs with the right customers in the right markets, whether they're in mobile, whether they're in IoT or infrastructure
And the team has done a great job of putting great product with the right companies
And then it's up to the customers to actually deliver on the mix side on their end
So, some of that is out of our control, but we have a balanced view with the Q1. We don't really have any guidance for you yet for March, but I wouldn't expect anything different than from kind of our normal signature there
But we go through that process every quarter and nothing has really changed
It really is a broad set of applications and customers
I think one important point is the ability for Skyworks to create a broad and growing presence in the actual wireless topology
So we're offering Wi-Fi, 11ac, 11ax
We're offering Bluetooth, we're offering ZigBee, we're offering GPS
There's really a wide range of topologies that we bring, and even cellular in some of these applications
So that allows us to manage opportunities and grow the business, whether it's short-data range devices, whether it's devices that demand a stronger signal, faster data rate, longer-range, premium Wi-Fi
The customer set, we rattled off a few in the prepared remarks, continues to grow
There's connected home devices, there's security systems, there's more and more video applications that really drive a tremendous amount of content for us
So it's quite diversified
There's customers with applications and then there's the breadth of wireless topologies that we bring that really creates the differentiation
Sure, well, it's very early to call the implications here, but one of the things I would say is it clearly shows the value and significance of this mobile economy that we've been talking about for a while
This is a really significant change in the way we work, live, play, monetize
So I think it speaks to that
For us, we have great position with both of those parties
We do a lot of work with Qualcomm, we've had a lot of work with Broadcom Avago on Wi-Fi
So for us, I think that we would certainly be able to coexist with those folks
But think again about the statement that I see on this is the value of mobile and the economy that's supported by it, and I think that's the big takeaway here
Sure, well, I will say that my conviction in Skyworks and what we're doing is sound, and I'm really excited and happy about the execution of this team
And we've laid out a framework a few years back and even longer about what we want to accomplish
And I think we're doing quite well
There's more to do
But what I think about really is, we can call it mobile, we can call it connected, but there's definitely a big change in this industry
It's cloud-to-client, it's driverless cars, it's IoT, it's 5G smartphones
There's no question that the opportunity in those markets is unmatched
I don't see anything else in semiconductors, quite frankly that would compare to it
So we're really excited about that
And that's where you're hearing the dialogue and the conviction
Now, are there other things that could occur? Are there other potential partnerships or deals that could be made? Absolutely
And the balance sheet and the cash generation really gives us more and more options to do that
But day to day, we love what we do here, and there's just so much great opportunities in front of us
Thank you
With respect to Wi-Fi modules, Ed, was that it?
Yeah, I mean, we've been working higher and higher levels of integration with our Wi-Fi solutions from basically just single chip solutions to multi-mode devices to fully integrated systems
So we're along that curve right now
We have some customers that are deeply engaged and are looking forward to a complete module, which would definitely enhance the ASP
And then we have some other customers that are halfway there that still look at integration beyond just the chip level
So, it's a work in progress
I think one thing that does create tremendous advantage for Skyworks is our ability to integrate through Mexicali our package assembly and test, our ability to bring in filters now through our Panasonic deal, as well as our strength just at the chip level in Wi-Fi
So those elements are in place
It's just about bringing them together, harmonizing them and then bringing them to market
Right
And then on the RF360, Ed, we really haven't seen much of a change
I know there's efforts for that product across the globe, but we really haven't seen anything substantial
Yeah, sure
Yeah, this was – Q4 was really kind of the early stages of launches for really the suite of top tier mobile players
And that will carry through in our strong December guidance here today
It's great to see diversification across a higher set of customers that are all kind of adopting now variations on DRx and variations on SkyOne and some of the other what would have been kind of classic analog type product, our switching products, some of our antenna tuning products, GPS
We're starting to see that portfolio really grow among the high tier
You saw a bit of it in the September quarter, and it really is kind of the leaders that will propel us here in the December quarter
Sure, sure, yeah
Well, I mean, China is a very broad, broad market with a lot of companies, a lot of customers
There are some mid-tier and low-tier players that are selling on price, and maybe de-specing is a way to get there in lowering their prices
But what we are seeing is – and our focus has been on mid to high, and on that segment, we see a push for performance
We're also seeing more and more China players like Huawei that will build a global phone that will carry frequencies and content that can be used globally not just specifically to China
And again, the next set of players starting to move up, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi are also are moving up from, in some cases, a lower base of content
And there can be de-specing in other areas
It doesn't rule out that that possibility exists in certain markets and certain customers
A great deal of mid-tier and low-end phones, they get built in China, get exported to emerging markets that may not have the same demands for performance
So it's possible that could be happening
In the area of focus that Skyworks is interested in, we continue to see the performance push
Sure, that makes sense
Yeah, so this is what we're seeing
And we have pretty good visibility now with the players
There's definitely going to be some early elements of 5G stepping into this market by 2018 into 2019. We talked a lot about 5G here in the opening comments, and as you know, this will be kind of additive to existing 3G and 4G engines
So you could have connectivity solutions, 3G, 4G, and then augmented with new content around 5G, new frequencies, new filtering, and in many cases, MIMO implementation as well
So there's a great opportunity there
It will take a while before it's fully implemented, but that is on the roadmap today
It's going to be a big driver on the mobile side
When you look at IoT, Craig, what we're seeing is a couple things
We're seeing a much broader proliferation now with more and more applications that we're able to address, whether it's with a Wi-Fi device or a Bluetooth device or embedding GPS for location, we're getting a broader set of applications
And we're also starting to see applications that we've already had step up through an upgrade
For example, smart watches that now carry cellular technology or a streaming media device that was a 2x2 MIMO for Wi-Fi that now carries nine streams of Wi-Fi to enhance speed and data rate
So, it's really twofold
It's the continuation of broadening the IoT reach, and then there's kind of the upgrade cycle within the IoT applications
So all that is opportunities for us looking forward
Sure, no, that's a great question
So I think we're going to see a continuation here as we evolve from 4G to 5G
It won't be necessarily a step function, and I don't think we'll see a pause
And within each opportunity or each customer, they have their own story
I think that the winners in this market are the ones that are adopting performance-driven technology, customers that are adopting DRx-like systems that greatly enhance the downlink speed
We're seeing applications where we could have two or three DRx modules on the receive chain
That's really mirroring what we've been doing in transmit with SkyOne, low, mid, and high band
And most of our customers are somewhere along that continuum from a couple of modules to five or six modules
So there's a lot of work that we can do in 4G to grow our content and grow our business by populating existing customers with new technology and then also winning with some new accounts within mobile
And then when you look at 5G from an IoT perspective, one of the big, big drivers is creating that network capacity that can handle all of these devices
There's just going to be such a dispersion of devices, up to 25 billion or so by 2020 that we're going to need a new network to deliver those frequencies and deliver that data
So that's just another opportunity for connectivity through a number of different protocols, it could be Wi-Fi, it could be ZigBee, it could be cellular
But there's really going to be quite a massive upgrade cycle in the IoT space as well

Thanks for that clarification
And then one – another clarification on the M&A front
You talked a little bit about diversification, but I guess, in the past, you did try to diversify a few years ago
Given the strong balance sheet as well as the strong cash flow you're generating, maybe you could remind us what your M&A strategy is going forward
And if you don't find attractive opportunities out there, what are the plans with the cash? And what are the cash usage priorities?
Sure, sure
Yeah, as I said earlier, we really do feel great about the outlook in the business that we're pursuing and the markets that we're pursuing
At the same time, we're up for diversification as long as it enhances the franchise
We're not as interested in things that are just totally adjacent on a different vector to diversify the portfolio
So, we got a great management team, we know how to enhance businesses, we've done a few deals that have turned out fantastic for us
Our joint venture with Panasonic, which is now a wholly-owned entity in Japan, has brought tremendous filtering technology
We did a deal for Wi-Fi with SiGe in 2012. That's been a home run
So the deals that we do are very careful and thought through, and we want our team to be able to execute on the entity that comes in
We'll continue to have that kind of a mindset as we look at potential opportunities going forward
Yeah, Craig, and the other thing just to keep in mind is that as our business is moving more and more towards these highly integrated, unique, custom solutions, the margins benefit
It's not only fewer competitors, but we're getting paid for the value-add, the engineer-to-engineer work, working within our customers' ecosystem to cement these really challenging – resolving these really challenging problems with elegant, some integrated solutions
So that's a theme that will continue
If we look out into 5G and some of these more complex markets, that's really going to be the strike zone of what we do at Skyworks
So we should be able to see margin benefit from that, in addition to looking within the company internally to become a more efficient operator
Yeah, no, absolutely, I think couple things
You're going to see a wide range of new frequencies that will come about above 3 gigahertz, up to 6 gigahertz and beyond
That's going to create tremendous filtering opportunities
There's also some topology shifts from today, a 4G world, which is largely FDD, frequency-division duplexing
In 5G, a great deal of the frequencies will be in a TDD zone, time division, so our TC SAW product can play very, very well, even on high frequencies there
And then the level of integration and the amount of noise and interference within these modules, within these handsets is going to be unbelievable
And that requires very crafty solutions from companies like Skyworks to resolve it
So it's going to create a tremendous benefit to the consumer and a great uptake in speed and improvement in latency, but a lot of challenge for players like Skyworks
So we're looking forward to that
Yeah, well, we don't – as you may know, we don't sell any of that product discretely, so there's no specific revenue tied to SAW or TC SAW directly
However, you can certainly intimate that we are moving our portfolio up in frequency
We're leveraging our TC SAW now to 2.5 gig and potentially higher over the next couple of quarters
We're looking at all the different nuances in 5G
Again, I've mentioned FDD has a certain standard
TDD has a certain standard
There's implications for filtering
There's implications for switching and how we handle our SkyOne and DRx solutions
All that will come together
I think the important point though is that we have that flexibility, we have a very broad portfolio, all the way from gallium arsenide to switching to packaging and tests in Mexicali, selecting our own filters in-house
And occasionally, if we need to partner with whether it's a filter vendor or a strategic supplier for silicon, we have that in place
So it's going to be all about flexibility and managing the various configurations that we may see with our customers so as these 5G challenges build
Yeah, well, I mean, carrier aggregation is kind of in the middle innings right now and continuing to grow
I mean, there's no question about the adoption on that
It's very hot and it's let get it done as fast as we can
11ax is a relatively new standard in Wi-Fi
It has tremendous benefits in speed and performance
I think it's really about how that rolls through access points and routers and other end user applications for the most part, so I think those are important
And then the filtering that we discussed, we'll continue to add to our portfolio filters, stretch the frequencies a bit, improve the yields within our factories, and try to grow that through a number of customers
Sure, yeah
What we're seeing, again, is the mid-tier players that want to grow into high global Tier 1s or global Tier 2 brands
Huawei was a great example
Names like Oppo and Vivo are great examples
We're seeing companies like Samsung that have a great high-end portfolio, still hundreds of millions of phones that are in mid-tier that were moving up
And so the way that we're doing it is really to provide enhancements in our transmit chain solutions, which would be our SkyOne product line, trying to give them more output power and create a more efficient solution
We're working hard with our DRx solutions, which have been adopted by some strategic customers that have realized great benefit in improving downlink performance
That technology has not been fully populated so there's quite a bit of opportunity for us to go out and submit new wins there
And then you look at some technologies like Wi-Fi and power management, we have great product and our adoption rate has not been substantial through certain markets and is growing
So we're seeing more and more Wi-Fi now embedded in smartphones throughout Asia, the U.S
has been pretty solid
And we're starting to see just some more advancements in our power portfolio
So all of that is coming together
We look at a name like Huawei, on the Mate 10 phone, where we have $9 or more of content
That's kind of the benchmark that we'd want to see across the entire mobile space
Thanks, everyone
Appreciate you participating on today's call
We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences and other events during the quarter
