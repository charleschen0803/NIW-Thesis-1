EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

[Audio Gap]

earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman
and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today, including opening remarks by Craig
highlighting the company's performance in the second quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we
will be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release and the presentation we'll
go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press
release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is
accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments
today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company, and are therefore,
forward-looking statements.

Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of risks and
uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and presentation. They're also outlined in our
related 8-K filings. With that, I will turn it over to Craig.

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thanks, Yan. We'll start on Page 3 with recent highlights from the second quarter. And as you can
imagine, I'm extraordinarily pleased with the way our teams have executed in the midst of this pandemic
and the economic downturn. We've done a good job of keeping our employees safe, have delivered for our
customers and certainly generated exceptional cash flow, all while flexing our costs at record rates. Our
results, while off of last year, certainly in absolute terms, were better than expectations, and we continue
to make an important investments for the future.

Q2 earnings on a per share basis, $0.13 on a GAAP basis and $0.70 on an adjusted basis, which excludes
$0.20 of charges related to acquisitions and divestitures and $0.37 related to the multiyear restructuring
program that we just announced. Our Q2 revenues were $3.9 billion, down 22% organically. As we noted
on our Q1 earnings call, April was down approximately 30%. This was followed by slightly better volumes
in May and then relatively strong finish in June, which was down, let's call it, low double digits. In fact,
I mean, just as a point of maybe amplification, our electrical business in the Americas, in Europe and
Asia, all posted low single-digit organic growth in revenue in the month of June. And so once again, our
electrical businesses are remaining very resilient in the face of this pandemic and economic downturn.
Segment margins were 14.7%, down 110 basis points from Q1, and our decremental margins were at
25%, 5 points better than our guidance of 30%. Once again, a good indication of how well our teams have
done in controlling the elements that are really within our control.

However, recognizing that some of our businesses could be looking at a slow and certainly, what you could
call a prolonged recovery, we announced a multiyear restructuring program of $280 million, including
$187 million charge in Q2. These actions will reduce structural costs for sure and are targeted in those
end markets, including commercial aerospace, oil and gas, NAFTA Class 8 truck and North America and
European light vehicle markets, where these markets have been certainly highly impacted. I'll provide
more details on this program in a few minutes, but they're covered on Page 12.

The other clear highlight for the quarter was our operating cash flow, which was $757 million and free
cash flow of $667 million, both very strong results and which gives us the ability to really reaffirm our free
cash flow guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion and a midpoint of $2.5 billion. So teams continue to do
great in converting on cash as well.

Finally, as most of you know, we made an important announcement during the quarter regarding
sustainability and our commitment to 2030 sustainability goals. I thought it would be helpful just to put

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

this announcement in the context in order to show you how it fits within the broader strategic framework
of the company, which we do on Page 4.

As it simply stated, at Eaton, sustainability really is at the core of our mission. We talk about our mission
being to improve the quality of life and the environment. And certainly, that means sustainability. In fact,
if you think about all of our value propositions with customers, they're built around creating safe, reliable
and efficient solutions, let's call them sustainable solutions. And so as we oftentimes say, what's good for
the environment is good for Eaton. We believe that meaningful efforts to support the environment are
fundamental to how we create value for customers, and it's certainly a place where we think Eaton should
play a leadership role. Sustainability, as we think about it, really presents growth opportunities to help
our customers solve their business goals. And to this extent, against this objective, we've laid out 10-year
plans that include investing $3 billion in R&D to create sustainable products over this period of time. This
also includes reducing our emissions from our installed base of products and upstream sources by some
15%.

Just to maybe give you an example of where we think this really fits with our overall strategy.
Sustainability really is about capitalizing for Eaton on secular growth trends around electrification, for sure,
across all of our businesses and also in energy transition. Sustainability, I tell you, is also an important
part of how we run the company on a day-to-day basis. Since 2015, and we reduced our absolute
greenhouse gas emissions by some 16%, and we're certainly on track to deliver our 2025 targets. By
2030, we now have committed to achieve science-based targets of 50% reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions from 2018 levels. We're also committed to be carbon-neutral by 2030, a target that we'll
achieve through a combination of initiatives, including carbon offsets, such as reforestation, continue to
optimize our sourcing of renewable electricity in all of our operations as well as delivering energy storage
solutions. And so pretty comprehensive set of plans that we have that we think will deliver this 2030 goal.

And finally, to achieve these goals, we obviously have to continue to work on building a workforce that's
engaged and passionate about making a difference. And so this will continue to be a large priority
for the company overall. And so hopefully, that provides just a little context in terms of why we think
sustainability is such an important initiative for Eaton and how we're going to convert on that and turn it
into accelerated growth for the company.

Now turning to Page 5, we summarize our Q2 financial results, and I'd noticed a couple of things on
this page. First, acquisitions increased sales by 2%. This was more than offset by the 8% impact from
divestitures and also, we had negative currency impact of negative 2%. I'd also remind you that we now
recognize all charges related to acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring at corporate rather than at the
segment level. And we did this because we'd hope it would make it easier for you to do your forecast by
quarter by segment without the volatility that comes with these types of onetime charges.

Next on Page 6, we show our results for Electrical Americas, revenues down 29%, 9% decline in organic
revenue, a 19% impact from M&A, and this was primarily the divestiture of the Lighting business and
a small impact from negative currency as well of 1%. Operating margins increased 130 basis points
to 20.7% and these margins were certainly favorably impacted by the divestiture of Lighting, but also
our teams did a great job of controlling costs to really counter the impact of the economic impact of
COVID-19. This combination resulted in a very strong decremental margin performance up 16%. So this
segment continues to prove to be highly resilient when you look at margins, but also when you look at
orders and backlog. Orders increased 2.1% on a rolling 12-month basis, with strength in residential and
utility and data centers. And of note here, our data center orders actually were up some 7% on a rolling
12-month basis. And lastly, our bookings remained strong. They were up 11% versus last year.

Turning to Page 7. We have our results for the Electrical Global segment. Revenues were down 16%, with
a 14% decline in organic revenues and 2% headwind from currency. Operating margins here declined
some 160 basis points but to a very respectable 16% and decremental margins here were also very
well managed, coming in at 26%. Orders declined 4.6% on a rolling 12-month basis with most of the
significant declines coming, as you would expect, in global oil and gas markets and in industrial markets.
So not an unexpected result with respect to where we saw strength and weakness. And lastly, our backlog
for Electrical Global increased 2% on a year-over-year basis.

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

On Page 8, we summarize our Hydraulics segment. For Q2, revenues were down 32%, with a 30% decline
organically and a 2% currency impact. Operating margins were 9%, and orders for the quarter were
down 33.7% year-over-year. And this was driven really by weakness in both OEMs and the distributor
channel, both. We continue to work closely with Danfoss and completing the customary closing additions
of regulatory approvals. And I would tell you that Danfoss organization remains excited about owning the
business. We do, however, now expect the transaction to close at the end of Q1 next year. The delay, as
you can imagine, due to the COVID-19 impact, which has impacted the pace of some of the regulatory
approvals that we expect.

On Page 9, we summarize our results for the Aerospace segment. Revenues declined 27%, with a negative
35% in organic growth, offset by 8% increase from the acquisition of Souriau. Operating margins declined
to 14.8%. And really, this is due to lower sales, but also the acquisition of Souriau also had a dilutive
impact on margins.

Orders declined 12.8% on a rolling 12-month basis, with particular weakness in the quarter, as you would
expect in commercial OEM and aftermarket. It is worth noting, I would tell you, though, that orders for
the military aftermarket were up 13% on a rolling 12-month basis. Backlog was down 5% year-over-year
overall. Certainly, as everyone here understands, the commercial aerospace markets are grappling with
significant declines in passenger demand, and this is impacting our business and certainly impacting both
the OEM and the aftermarket. Just maybe some context here, while we think about this as kind of a near-
term dislocation and we're taking certainly the needed steps to position this business for the future. We
remain confident in the long-term attractiveness of aerospace market, and we'll certainly do what we need
to do in order to manage our margins in the meantime.

Next, on Page 10, we summarize our results for the Vehicle segment. Revenues declined 59%, 52% of
which was organic. In addition to the divestiture of the Automotive Fluid Conveyance business, which
impacted revenues by 4%, we had 3% negative impact on currency. The decrease in organic sales was
really driven by, I'd say, widespread customer plant shutdowns due to COVID-19, which really resulted
in lower Class 8 OEM production as well as continued weakness in light vehicle production. Just -- once
again, it's a little bit more color on this one, during Q2, most light and commercial OEMs had shutdowns
that ranged between 6 and 8 weeks. These shutdowns, which really began, let's say, in late March,
occurred throughout the month of April and extended into mid-May. And so many of our customers were
shut down for almost half the second quarter. But production is now certainly beginning to come back
online.

Global light vehicle market production was down 55% in Q2 and Class 8 OEM build was down from 70% in
Q2. We now project NAFTA Class 8 production to be 175,000 units for the year, which is down slightly from
our prior forecast of 189,000 units, but still down some 49% from 2019. This steep reduction and certainly
the sudden reduction in OEM production led to operating margins of a negative 6.4%. But I would add,
this business has once again done a great job of managing decrementals. And despite this tremendous
reduction in revenue, delivered a respectable decremental margin of 33%. Not surprisingly, and much
needed, we do expect better market conditions in the second half, and our business will be well positioned
to participate in this recovery.

Moving to Page 11. We have our eMobility segment. Revenues were down 33%, all of which was organic,
organic margins of negative 3.6% -- excuse me, operating margins of negative 3.6%, primarily due
to lower volumes and particular weakness in the legacy internal combustion engine platforms. And
once again, the ongoing increase in R&D expenditure. We continue to be enthused, by the way, about
the long-term potential of the business. And quite frankly, have seen nothing but upward revisions in
the expectation for the penetration of electric vehicles. And so a market that we still think will be very
attractive long term.

We're very well positioned once again with the common technology platforms that we're creating,
leveraging the strength in our core electrical business. A good example of this idea of everything becoming
more electric is one of the recent wins that we've had with the truck OEM, a $21 million program for
export power inverter for a major commercial truck customer. And so in almost every aspect of our
business, there's more electrical content, and we're well positioned once again through this particular

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

segment to participate in that growth. Overall, we've won programs with a value of approximately $500
million of mature year revenue.

On Page 12, we show the details of our plans to accelerate and, I'd say, expand our restructuring actions.
And I say accelerate because for the most part, we're pulling forward a number of the restructuring ideas
that we would have done anyway. Given the economic implications of the pandemic, we naturally have
a greater sense of urgency and also more capacity to take on these projects. We announced the $280
million multiyear restructuring program, as we noted, designed to eliminate structural costs, and we've
taken charges of $187 million in Q2, and we expect to see additional cost of $93 million realized through
2022. Just to characterize those additional dollars, we'd expect to deliver over the next 3 years, some $33
million of charges in the second half of this year, $55 million in 2021 and $5 million in 2022. We.

Would expect to realize $200 million of material benefits from these actions once they're fully
implemented, and we think full year implementation is 2023. Approximately 2/3 of these costs are in our
industrial businesses, principally vehicle and aerospace, and the remaining 1/3 is within our electrical
sector, particularly with an emphasis on our oil and gas business that we'll report through our Electrical
Global segment. Naturally, we're focused on those businesses serving end markets that are more severely
impacted by the pandemic.

And then turning to Page 13, we do our best to provide a Q3 outlook on revenues versus last year. And
while you can imagine that all these markets will be stronger than what we realized in Q2, this is really
a year-over-year look for Q3 versus last year. For Electrical Americas, we expect organic revenue to
be between down 2% and up 2%, so essentially flat with strength in residential, utilities, data centers,
offsetting weakness in industrial markets. For Electrical Global, our current view is organic revenues will
decline between 10% and 14%, with strength in Asia Pacific and data center markets, offset by declines in
Europe and once again in the oil and gas market. For Aerospace, we expect organic revenues will be down
between 28% and 32%, with continued strength in military, offset by really significant declines in all of the
commercial markets. And for Vehicle, we project revenues will decline between 30% and 34%. So markets
are still very weak in absolute terms, but these markets will be up significantly from Q2. And for eMobility,
we expect declines of between 13% and 17%, once again, pressured from legacy internal combustion
engine platforms. And lastly, for Hydraulics, we think markets will be down between 23% and 27%. For
Eaton overall, we're estimating Q3 revenues to be down between 13% and 17%. And so an improvement
versus Q2, which was down some 22%. But still in absolute terms, markets are still in decline.

Moving to Page 14. Here, we provide our best look at guidance for Q3 and some commentary on the full
year. But for Q3, we expect organic revenues to decline between 13% and 17%. And this really does
include what we know about July, where we saw low double digit declines. We've elected not to provide full
year revenue guidance given the kind of the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic and its impact on
markets in Q4. As many of you are aware, we are still dealing with the pandemic in various regions of the
U.S. and around the world, we're still seeing a growth in the number of cases. And so we're still living in
this period of uncertainty.

We do think Q2 will be the trough for organic revenue declines. And barring a second wave of the
pandemic, Q4 should be better than Q3. For Q3 and full year, we expect decremental margins of between
25% and 30%. And for Q3, we expect our tax rate on adjusted earnings to be between 15% and 16%.
We're maintaining our free -- 2020 free cash flow guidance, the range of $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion. And
I would note that this range does, in fact, include now the impact related to the multiyear restructuring
program that we announced, and that was not in our prior guidance. As a point of reference, in the first
half, just to give you some comfort around our ability to deliver this number, we generated some 35% of
our $2.5 billion midpoint that's in our free cash flow guidance. And this number is very consistent with our
performance over the last 5 years. And so we do tend to be a bit back half-loaded.

We're providing new guidance for share buybacks, and we're saying between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion
for the year. And recall that we repurchasing $1.3 billion of shares in Q1 with the proceeds of the Lighting
sale. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow, and we now plan to buy back between $400 million and
$600 million of shares in half of the year. And finally, and maybe just like we are doing here inside our
company, just to bring it back to kind of the broader longer-term strategy and where we're headed as an

organization. And we will continue to effectively manage through the short-term challenges associated
with the pandemic, but we also remain focused on the broader strategic and financial goals that we've laid
out in our meeting in New York, and we've summarized once again here on Page 15.

Number one, ensuring that we continue to move the company in the direction of becoming what we say
as an intelligent power management company that takes advantage of important secular growth trends,
and we talked about them being electrification, energy transition, IoT and connectivity and blended power.
So these trends are continuing and despite whatever temporary hiccups we're experiencing, we think long
term, it's the right place to be. By doing so, we're working on creating a company that's going to deliver
better secular growth. And better growth through various cycles, higher margins and with much better
earnings consistency.

Our long-term goals have not changed. It includes 2% to 3% organic growth, 20% segment margins, 8%
to 9% EPS growth and $3 billion a year of free cash flow. And with our strong cash flow, we'll continue to
be focused and disciplined in how we deploy it by investing in organic growth as a top priority, delivering
top quartile dividends, an ongoing program of share buyback then actively managing our portfolio while
being a disciplined acquirer. So we continue to remain excited by the Eaton story. I hope you are as well.

And with that, I'll turn it back to Yan.

Yan Jin
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations
Okay. Good. Thanks, Craig. Before we start our Q&A of our call today, I do see that we have a number
of individuals in the queue with questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn it over to the
operator, who will give you guys the instruction.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. So I guess maybe starting with the restructuring actions that you guys are taking, Craig. So the
information on the costs were helpful. I guess maybe some color qualitatively around what you're actually
focusing on, headcount versus maybe footprint or other things. And I guess where I'm going with this is
cadence of payback over the next few years, including the second half of '20 as well as, I guess, why it's
taking some time to actually get the payback from those actions?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I appreciate the question, Nicole. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, and one of the
things we've talked about historically is that we always, as a company, have kind of a future view of
restructuring projects that we'd like to take on. And the pacing items generally tend to be our own internal
capacity to deal them with them and manage them effectively as well as our customers' ability to absorb
them without creating disruptions for them. And certainly, in the event of an economic downturn like
this one, it gives everybody more capacity to take on these projects. And so a lot of what we're doing
today, I'd say, when you talk about footprint versus headcount, I think the important way to answer that
question is that it's all structural. And so these are all cost items that were taken on that will not come
back in the event that -- or when revenues return. And so these are things that are really focusing on
taking structural fixed costs out of our system, some of which will be headcount, some of which will be
around footprint. We have not yet made these announcements completely internally in terms of where
those impacts are going to be. And so we'll wait and provide that detail a little later on. But it will be
completely structural.

To your point around timing, I think some of these items, obviously, will impact and have a benefit earlier
than others. But it's one of the things I would say, as you think about the decremental margins that we're
delivering as a company and what's embedded in our guidance, it's one of the reasons why we can deliver
these very strong decrementals is because we are flexing our businesses and flexing our costs. And so I'd
say, as we think about this payback, a $280 million investment with essentially a $200 million return. This
is a very attractive program in terms of the return on the investment. And we'll get some of the benefits
sooner, some will come later, but in aggregate. It's extraordinarily strong returns on these dollars that
we're investing.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it, Craig. That's helpful. And you kind of teed up my follow-up there, I guess. And I wanted to hit on
decrementals. The 25% was obviously impressive this quarter and above your own 30% guidance. I guess
how do we think about that through the rest of the year? I mean to me, we kind of know that 2Q, at least
we hope, will be the low point with respect to revenue. So I guess is there any possibility that 25% could
actually become something better in the second half as you guys execute on cost savings and perhaps you
get a little bit of sequential improvement in revenues as well?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I appreciate the question. And our teams just have done an extraordinary job year-to-date on
decremental margins and as we flex costs. And embedded in that guidance of $25 million to $30 million
is, once again, the uncertainty around whether or not we end up experiencing a second wave of the
pandemic. And as you know as well as anyone, we're seeing these hotspots around the U.S. and potential

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

threats of going into some form of, if not full shutdowns, retrenchments in many of our markets. And
so there's still a lot of uncertainty, and it's one of the reasons why we still have this fairly wide range of
decrementals, as you can imagine, as well. We took a lot of extraordinary onetime costs in Q2, around
time off without pay, and travel was essentially came to a grounding halt. And so some of these costs will
certainly come back as the year unfolds. But if we don't end up with a second wave, in the second half of
the year, we will likely do better than kind of the midpoint of this range of decrementals that we've laid
out.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Craig, maybe just starting out, why don't we -- I'd love to hear your thoughts on just nonres construction,
specifically in your exposure to it. There's a lot of concern as we kind of head into 2021 that the markets
are going to downturn. And so I'd be curious to just hear how your business is positioned for potential
nonres downturn? and how maybe some of these actions that you're taking are potentially like offsetting
measures for that?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. Thanks, I appreciate the question. And when you use the term nonres construction, really,
that's -- for us, that's really most of our electrical business, right, because that's everything other than
residential and residential today, would account for less than 20% of our total business. And so it's a really
big category. The way we tend to think about it is that maybe just take you through some of the key
important segments for us. We think as has been the case for some time, we think data centers continues
to be a very strong market and are performing well in the near term, and we think long term, continues to
be strong. We think the utility market continues to be a very attractive market and will perform well over
the long-term and has held up extremely well. Residential, by the way, and I know you asked the nonres
question, but residential has just been extraordinarily strong and -- with essentially high double-digit kind
of growth numbers in Q2 overall. So resi continues to be extraordinarily strong.

And then, I mean, I think the kind of spear of your question really gets to this whole question, what's
going to happen within commercial markets. And there's been a lot of talk and speculation around the
death of the office and whether or not anybody is ever going to go back to the office again. I don't think
that's the case, by the way. In fact, I can point to examples where companies have actually had to take
down more office space because you have the social distance now on offices. And so you need more
space to house the same number of individuals. But certainly, there's certainly some risk to what we call
the office piece of nonres. Certainly, if you think about retail, those markets will probably be weak. But
offsetting that, there will be other markets that are strong. We think that you think about warehousing as
a segment, we think, will be strong. We think water, wastewater market will be strong.

And so I think the fact that our electrical business has held up so well or better than others would imagine
is the fact that we do play across so many of these different end markets some of which are experiencing
some of these negative forces, others of which are seeing positive impact. And as a result, this business is
extraordinarily resilient. And so we remain very optimistic about the prospects of our electrical business.
There will be dislocations in perhaps certain markets or certain regions of the world. But by and large,
we think the market will be just fine, and using kind of China as a good proxy for the rest of the world
as they get -- it should come through the pandemic. China is already back to positive growth, both in
sales and orders. And so we're hopeful once we get through this and we get a vaccine, we get an effective
therapeutic that the markets are likely going to return to trend level of growth.

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

That's helpful color, Craig. And maybe my one quick follow-up is more on just free cash flow. It was nice
to see you guys affirmed the range for this year. I guess as you're thinking about next year, also in the
context of some of the cost actions that you're taking, I know it's too difficult at this point to say exactly
what the number will be next year. But if growth starts to return to something that's a little bit more
normal, what are your thoughts on your ability to grow free cash flow in 2021?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

The way we generally think about it is that certainly, in periods like this as we decapitalize the business
and we're freeing up a lot of cash from working capital. But also, as you saw, the earnings are down
dramatically. And so as we continue to -- as we expand through an expansionary cycle, the earnings
will be up significantly. And then with that, your cash flows will be up. And so if you think about Eaton
over time, and through various cycles, our cash flows have been just amazingly consistent in terms of
generating very strong free cash flow, really, at all points of expansion and contraction. Rick, did you want
to add something?

Richard H. Fearon
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer

I'm just going to add a little color on the trends in electrical. We measure it in a lot of different ways. But
one of the ways we measure it is looking at our negotiations for large projects in the Americas. We have
very good data, and it's a very big business for us. And if you take out the activities related to oil and gas,
our negotiations in the second quarter were flat with a year ago. And so it gives you some indication that
the balance that Craig talked about on all these different segments, they come together in a way that
creates a lot of stability. And that gives us a fair amount of confidence that even with the turbulence and
the macro economy, there are enough sources of strength that those sources offset the weak spot.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I just would like to get a little additional color on Vehicle. Obviously, a very, very tough quarter. Production
on the automotive side starts to look better as the lockdowns ease. Just give us a little sense of what
you're thinking for the profit trajectory there? Should this be the only quarter where we see an operating
loss? And maybe give us a little color on how much, if any, of these restructuring benefits might flow
through to those businesses in the back half?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I appreciate the question, Jeff, and it's been kind of a long time since we've ever because -- since
we lost money in our vehicle business. And I'd just say, once again, just an extraordinary combination of
events when you look at some of these numbers around production, both in Class 8 and in global light
vehicle, essentially, half the quarter was lost. And so the team once again did, I think, an extraordinary
job in maintaining a 33% decremental in that environment. We certainly -- to look forward, volumes are
going to be significantly better than in Q2. We would fully expect that the margins for the business this
year will be double digit, and we would not expect to see a loss in the Vehicle business in any subsequent
quarter, barring another return to this horrific market kind of event that we experienced over the last
quarter. The details around where the benefits are going to flow, once again, we've not made internal
announcements specifically to some of these initiatives. And so we'll give you more color later on. It's
certainly fully embedded in the decremental margin assumptions that we've laid out for the year, but you
certainly can expect our Vehicle business to return to attractive levels of profitability post Q2.

Great. And second question, just on aero. Do you think we've seen the bottom in aftermarket activity? Or
do we still got to kind of deal with the delayed impact of parked airplanes and used material and stuff kind
of working its way through the system and maybe we're a quarter or 2 out on the bottom there?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean it's a good question and one that everybody trying to get their arms around specifically in
terms of what's the outlook for aerospace, specifically, what's the outlook for aftermarket in terms of our
consumers are going to be comfortable getting back on planes flying again, which is as you know, is what
drives the aftermarket. I'd say we had pretty horrific numbers in terms of aftermarket in Q2, down fairly
dramatically. So it's tough to imagine that things could get much worse than what we experienced in Q2.
Activity levels in general, as you're well aware, are improving. There's more planes flying today. There's
more hours of flights today than there have been certainly over Q2. Many parts of the world, in many
regions of the world, their numbers are better than ours in the U.S. If you think about Asia, you think
about Europe, they've done a better job of getting handle on the pandemic. And so you're seeing the data
there improve perhaps at a faster rate than the U.S. data. So I think it's quite -- it's unclear today. And a
lot of planes on the ground, and you talk about this idea of parting out airplanes and how that's going to
impact the aftermarket, I just think it's too early to tell whether that's going to have a prolonged impact or
not.

Operator

Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just wanted to really dig into your sort of your 3Q framework and the down low double digits first...

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

I'm sorry, Nigel, we -- you're coming through very faint. We can barely hear you. So maybe you can just
speak up a little bit.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Maybe I'll use my handset. Is that better?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Perfect. Perfect.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. I've got a very dodgy headset. I need to invest. My home office still needs a lot to be desired. So the
July down low double digits versus the down 13% to 17% framework. And I understand you want to be
conservative. But is there any reason why July would be better than the 3Q framework? And then just
within that, Electrical Americas looking to be flat versus the down 9% in 2Q. Again, just what's slipping
between 2Q and 3Q? And any end markets to call out there would be helpful.

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I appreciate the question, Nigel. And I think what we're really trying to deal with here is how precise
we can actually be in setting any of these forecasts. And I would tell you that if you think about June and
July kind of essentially running at about the same levels and as we think about our Q3 forecast, we really

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

think about it mostly as a continuation of what we experienced over the last couple of months. And so I
think on the margin, whether it's 1 or 2 points better or worse, it's really difficult to judge.

But one of the things that has us a little bit nervous, as we'll freely admit, is the fact that you are
continuing to see the spread of COVID-19 in so many parts of the U.S. And so if there's a concern that we
have that could potentially take the next couple of months down slightly below what we've experienced
over the last 2 months, it's whether or not the U.S. specifically, and then you have obviously, regions like
India and Brazil, whether or not we get a handle on the spread of the pandemic. So that's the piece that
has us all just a little bit nervous and perhaps a little bit conservative around what does the real outlook
look like for the balance of Q3.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. And then Electrical Americas, what's slipping -- what's getting materially better between 2Q and 3Q?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. In Electrical Americas, I'd say that for the most part, they experienced kind of the same kind of
shock to the system that the other kind of parts of our businesses experience, where you've had a lot of
construction projects essentially to shut down in Q2. As you're well aware, there were certain regions of
the U.S. where construction was deemed essential. There was other places where constructing projects
were simply delayed. And so I think the catch-up effect that we're seeing a little bit in the Americas,
specifically, is the fact that we would anticipate that you don't see the kind of wholesale shutdowns of the
U.S. economy that we experienced in part of Q2. And so on an incremental basis, quarter-over-quarter
basis, we would expect the Electrical Americas business to perform better.

Richard H. Fearon
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer

Also, Nigel -- it's Rick, we had some production challenges during Q2. We had to re-layout plants, and we
had some plants where the plants had to be closed for certain periods due to COVID issues. And so that
constrained our sales. And we've sorted through all that. And that, particularly in places like residential,
will allow higher sales volumes in Q3.

Operator

And our next question is from David Raso from Evercore.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Can you clarify your comment, if I heard you correctly, the month of June, did you say Electrical Americas
posted low single-digit revenue growth? Same thing for Electrical Global? I'm just trying to -- if that is
correct, why then does it step down the flat for Americas in the third quarter if you're already up low
single and then global goes from up single-digit to actually the next quarter down 12% at the midpoint?
I'm just trying to understand what you're really seeing in July in the electrical business.

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. What I was really trying to convey in that comment. First of all, you heard me correctly, electrical,
essentially around the world actually did pose positive sales growth in the month of June. But it's
oftentimes difficult to read too much into a given month because there's also some catch up, right? We
talked about the fact that we had, as Rick noted, we had factories that were shut down, we had projects
that were delayed. And so we think it was certainly a little bit of catch-up that took place in the month of
June. One of the reasons why we experienced kind of growth across the region and projects that perhaps
should have been delivered in April or May, that slipped into the month of June. And so as the economy
in the U.S. specifically, continue to open. And so we do think there was some catch-up in the month of

13

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

June. And so on the margins, things are slightly worse or about the same as the June rate in subsequent
months. It's really because of this catch-up effect that we think we experienced in the month of June.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

But is that what you're seeing in July? I mean especially global, are we going from up low single, say,
there was some catch-up, then to put down 12 in the third quarter. Have you seen that much giveback
already in July? Is it global already down that much in July?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I'd say that, once again, in terms of the -- you say global specifically, what we're experiencing
overall as a company in terms of the guidance numbers that we provided, that's consistent with what the
company has experienced. I don't think we provided specific guidance for Electrical Global overall. But --
so I'd say that it's certainly consistent with our overall guidance for the quarter for Eaton overall.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate that. Yes. I was just saying international, you call it global, but the international business
being down 12% organically in the third quarter, coming off of a June that was up low single. It's just
enough of a delta. I just don't see if you saw a big drop-off in July already to suggest that for the electrical
international business.

Richard H. Fearon
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer

What we are seeing, David, is we are seeing pronounced weakness in oil and gas. I mean it is not coming
back. And so that's what's driving that -- the weakness in Electrical Global. Our global oil and gas business
is all reported in Electrical Global. So that's really the factor that is causing the markets to be as weak as
we estimate. If you were to take that out, Electrical Global would look much like Electrical Americas.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Sure. But in the month of June, oil was down big, I assume, and you still put up low single-digit growth in
electrical international. So anyway, I'm just trying to understand it. And then lastly, go ahead...

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

I was just going to say there is a lot to this pent-up demand and people, we, being able to deliver on
customers wanting us to deliver projects that had gotten delayed. And so that June is distorted by that a
bit.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's fair. And just lastly clarification to an earlier question, did you say Vehicle margins for the year
would be back to double digit?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I did.

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Jeffrey David Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I just want to dig in on some of these markets that are proving more resilient in Americas. Can you just
talk about where kind of the incremental utility spend is seen or where you're seeing the most resilience?
And on the data center side, I know we were planning for kind of an air pocket, and that seems to be
coming back. Is that coming back stronger or in line with expectations?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'd say in the utility market, Jeff, I think it's pretty broad-based is what we're seeing really in utility
markets. Those markets are holding up fairly well. And I would say that within the U.S., I can't really --
I don't know that there's a very different story depending upon what region of the U.S. you're looking
at. But where we play in the utility space, on the distribution side, as obviously, resilience and investing
in grid resilience continues to be an important need in so many of our communities around the U.S., it
continues to be fairly stable and predictable market. In data center, specifically, what we're really seeing
is a return in hyperscale. And as we've talked about on prior calls, hyperscale does tend to be lumpy.
You get large orders, and then they'll go quiet for a while and you get large orders again. So if you think
about data centers overall, we saw very strong growth in hyperscale in the quarter that really is a return
to growth as they continue to kind of build out their requirements.

Jeffrey David Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just on the Hydraulics sale, is that just a function of timing around approvals? Or is there
anything else going on?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

I think it's a general slowdown in the market that you're experiencing in Hydraulics and specifically in
construction. The ag market is holding up a bit better. Certainly, the China market is holding up very well
in the context of the pandemic and really have already returned to growth. And so it's really just the
general slowdown in the construction market that's having a big impact on Hydraulics.

Richard H. Fearon
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer

And Jeff, if you were also asking about the timing of closing the sale, it's really a function of many of
the regulators are still working from home. And so that's greatly slowed their ability to process all of
the filings. I mean in any large transaction like our sale of Hydraulics, we're talking about thousands
and thousands of pages of material. And without their staffs at hand, without the ability to easily copy
things and have team meetings, it just is taking longer. And really seeing that for all acquisitions, not just
ours. So we're not surprised by it. Things are progressing in a normal way. We're receiving the kinds of
questions that we would expect to receive is just taking a bit longer to get those questions.

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

And I mentioned in my opening commentary that how enthusiastic Danfoss remains around the
transaction itself. And if anybody wants to get a sense of their real enthusiasm, the founder of the
company and the CEO posted a video this week on LinkedIn, where they're making the announcements
to their organization about to bring in together of these 2 businesses and professing their enthusiasm to
get this transaction closed. And so we remain absolutely convinced that while it's been a quarter delay, the
transaction will close, and they love the transaction, and it's going to create real value for them.

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Craig and Rick, just to put a finer point on this non-resi issue. We get these questions all the time. Could
you just remind us how big the new build portion for office buildings is as a percent of, say, Electrical
Americas and Global because that would be -- seem to be the one area that debatably, right, could be at
risk or is not necessarily going to expand. I can't imagine it's that big, but maybe you could just frame it
out for us in terms of its magnitude.

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I don't have the new -- I don't have that split. I mean, maybe one data point, John, that may be
helpful for you to kind of quantify or gauge the impact. Today, if you think about the office piece of kind
of our electrical business, what goes into office build, it's just under 20% of the total electrical business.
And so to your point, within that, some of it's new build, some of it's retrofit and modifications. And so
hopefully, those -- that data point, we can try to get to the data around what's new versus remodel and
refurb, but it's under 20% of the total business. And I do say, I think it is debatable in terms of where this
is going to ultimately take us in terms of whether or not working from home has been wonderful to date
and companies have managed it longer term. I think it's still an open question mark around efficiency and
organizational effectiveness in working from home. And as people come back to offices and this need to
social distance is going to require more space. And so I think it will be an interesting one to watch in terms
of how it unfolds.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Yes. No, I don't disagree with that. And I think historically, you've said retrofit is sort of 40% to 50% of
the whole electrical business, so maybe we can extrapolate that. I'm not sure.

Richard H. Fearon
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer

It's more like 25% to 30% for the whole electrical sector.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. All right. So I had that number wrong, but that's -- it's still winnows it down. Just as another
clarification. Is the $280 million charge on top of the $50 million to $60 million of quiet restructuring
you guys do every year? Or are you going to be lumping in that $50 million to $60 million with the $280
million? So kind of the whole thing gets called out over the next couple of years of the charge enactment?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's really the latter, John. And that was my point that I was making in my opening commentary
around we had a number of restructuring programs that we were intended to do anyway and pulling those
forward and accelerating them. And so it's really the latter. So we intend to take this one charge related
to the $280 million laid out the way we articulate it. And that would then eliminate the other restructuring
programs that we would have otherwise planned to do over the next 3 years.

Our next question is from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Security.

Andrew Millard Casey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Can you talk about M&A potential? I'm just wondering if the dislocation has created any incremental
opportunities. And then can you comment on any valuations you might be seeing?

EATON CORPORATION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Appreciate the question, Andy. And certainly, we remain, obviously, in a position where we have the
balance sheet that gives us that optionality around keeping M&A on the table. And as we talked about
our cash flow generation this year as well as certainly, the M&A event that will take place with the sale of
Hydraulics, and we'd expect to bring in another $2.85 billion of cash with that transaction when it closes.
So the balance sheet is in great shape, and we have plenty of firepower.

Having said that, I would tell you, though, that given the level of uncertainty around market outlook as
well as the fact that valuations and companies coming to terms with the fact that perhaps some of their
businesses aren't worth today what they were worth maybe 3 or 4 months ago. That does take some time
for that new reality to set in. And so I would say today that valuations have not and expectations have not
necessarily come down commensurate with the change in market outlook. And so those 2 things together
says we will continue to actively work the pipeline. We are, in fact, having a number of conversations. Our
focus and priorities continue to be largely around the electrical business. We think, in this environment,
we'll have to see whether or not Aerospace clears up -- the future of aerospace and outlook clears up
enough that for us to get back on kind of front foot in and around an Aerospace transaction. But right now,
I'd say that we're working the pipeline. It's an active pipeline. But valuations have really not yet come in.

Andrew Millard Casey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then a real quick one, I guess, for Rick. You gave the Q3 framework. If you isolate out the kind
of nonrecurring stuff like occurred in Q2 beneath the segment operating profit line, do you expect any
sizable change in things like corporate pension and other?

Richard H. Fearon
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer

Not any significant change. It should be relatively consistent.

Operator

And our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a question on inventories in the channel. Can you just tell, have dealers been destocking during this?
Where is the level both in North America and internationally as far as you can see? Is there a need for it
for restocking basically?

Craig Arnold
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the question around whether or not there's a need for restocking is still yet to be determined,
Andrew. I can tell you that we did experience some destocking during the course of Q2. And that
destocking is certainly behind us now. And today, when we do our channel checks and talk to our
distributor partners, they'll tell you that they feel like the inventory levels today are well aligned with
their outlook for revenue. And so I think it's too early maybe to make a call on inventory restocking, but
certainly, the destocking of inventory has stopped and is behind us now.

Andrew Burris Obin

Yes. I'd say nothing material. One of the things that we've always done and believed in strongly is
manufacturing in what we call [ zero in ] currency, which means essentially we -- what we sell in a
region, we generally make in a region. We do, in fact, ship some parts around -- and components around
the world. I would tell you that throughout this whole entire pandemic, our supply chain has held up
extraordinarily well. And I can say with confidence that we didn't lose a single order because our supply
chain broke down. And somehow, we ended up with an inability to deliver. The bigger challenge that we
experienced as a company really is what largely took place along the border. As companies and countries
have had different criteria around what industries are deemed essential. And so there was a period of time
when we had some challenges with the Mexican definition versus the U.S. definition. I can tell you that
today, that's behind us as well. But for the most part, supply chain has not been a big challenge for us
during this current pandemic.

Maybe just trying to understand the free cash flow a little bit better. Within that $2.5 billion midpoint for
this year, maybe help me understand what's the Hydraulics' contribution within that? And also, what's the
cash portion of the restructuring charges in that number, please?

Richard H. Fearon
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer

Yes. I don't have at hand the exact Hydraulics portion. We'll address that off-line. The cash part of the
restructuring charge is probably on the order of $50 million. And so that's why we believe that our
guidance, even inclusive of that cash portion of restructuring still holds true.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood. And then maybe just a second one around the aerospace, maybe margin dynamics. Help us
understand what the impact of Souriau-Sunbank was and that integration within the, I think, almost 1,000
basis points drop in the aero margin in Q2. And maybe how you see that impact from the acquisition
playing out over the balance of the year? And I don't know if you quantified, but maybe help us see what
the commercial aftermarket revenue drop was in Q2, please?

I have, but...

Craig Arnold

You have it offhand, Rick?

Richard H. Fearon

Let me just see what I have here. Yes, it -- I mean the margins of Souriau pre-acquisition were in the high
teens. And that, obviously, compared to our business that was in the 22% to 24% range. And so I think
the easiest way, Julian, is just to use those numbers. And we also gave you the overall sales volume of
