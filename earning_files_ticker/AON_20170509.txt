Thanks very much and good morning, everyone
Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call
Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies
I would note that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today
Before I begin the discussion on our finance results, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about Aon overall and our efforts to continuously strengthen the firm, consistent with our record of value creation
Let me start by saying, it's an exciting time for Aon, as we're reinforcing and building upon a proven decade long strategy to be the leading global professional services firm, providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions using proprietary data and analytics
We're privileged to take these new initiatives I will describe on the heels of a decade of improvement and innovation for our clients and shareholders
For our clients, NPS scores are at their highest levels since we began tracking them with strong client satisfaction and retention
For our shareholders, 10 plus years averaging 16% annual shareholder returns
And we finished 2016 with accelerating organic growth, record operating margin, and record free cash flow exceeding $2.1 billion
We feel very fortunate to have real momentum
But we also share our conviction today on that, momentum never sleeps
We must continuously innovate faster than our clients in our areas of expertise to add value
The Outsourcing platform divestiture provides a catalyst for our actions
As it is consistent with our focus in strategy to deliver advice and solutions and further aligns Aon's portfolio around our clients' highest priorities
It strengthens our ability to make new investments in high growth, high margin areas across our portfolio
It reinforces our return on invested capital, ROIC, decision making process and emphasis on free cash flow
And it provides approximately $3 billion of capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs
We're excited because the actions we are undertaking, we believe, will further strengthen our firm, including operating as one global P&L to strengthen our client serving capability by helping us achieve our commitment to deliver all of Aon's global capabilities locally
Providing greater transparency into our highest growth platforms through five revenue lines, more fully reflecting how our team thinks about our business
Investing $900 million back into our business to unify and improve our business services operating model, including technology, real estate, and our colleague experience
The outcome of this work is designed to result in a substantially stronger firm with higher growth in top line, bottom line, and free cash flow
In short, Aon ends up stronger than ever before with over $2 billion of incremental dollars to invest back into Aon
Continuing to reinforce and strengthen our free cash flow operating model, which has been very effective in strengthening the cash flow margins of our firm, thereby enabling more investment back into Aon
These actions reinforced our industry leading platform, highlighted by leadership positions in each of our five revenue lines, Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services
And more than $120 billion of premium placed annually, an unprecedented level of data from which to drive insight on behalf of clients through our InPoint, ReView, and Affinity technology platforms
$4 trillion of assets under advisory, providing the basis for strong growth in our delegated investment consulting platform
And finally, the reflection of our client value, strong retention rates greater than 90%
Overall, the momentum we already enjoy, amplified by the new initiatives currently underway is expected to substantially strengthen Aon for our clients, colleagues, and shareholders
And we believe represents the next wave of shareholder value creation
Now turning to the quarter on page 6. Consistent with previous quarters, I'd like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review
First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders
Second is overall organic growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment across Aon's industry leading portfolio of capabilities
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics
Each quarter we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase our earnings per share, and deliver free cash flow growth
In the first quarter organic revenue growth was 4% overall, the strongest rate of organic revenue growth to start the year since 2012, reflecting growth across the entire portfolio, including double digit growth in Health Solutions
Operating margin increased 220 basis points, primarily reflecting strong organic revenue growth and return on investments across our portfolio, as well as expense savings from restructuring activities and other operational initiatives
EPS increased 20% to $1.45, primarily reflecting strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate, and effective capital management
And free cash flow increased $41 million or 38%, primarily reflecting strong operational improvement, partially offset by investments in our operating model
Overall, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year with positive performance across each of our key metrics
Turning to slide 8. On the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments
Organic revenue growth was 4% overall, an acceleration from 2% in the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth across all five revenue lines, with particular strength in Health Solutions and Data & Analytics Services
Reflecting on each of our core growth platforms
In Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2% compared to 3% in the prior year quarter
On average globally, exposures were modestly positive and the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulted in a relatively flat market impact overall
Results reflect solid growth internationally across EMEA, Asia, and the Pacific regions
And U.S
Retail, new businesses increased over 10% in the quarter
And strong management of the renewable portfolio drove retention rates of 93% on average
Results were partially offset by a decline in Latin America, primarily related to unfavorable timing impact in the quarter
In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2%, an acceleration from flat in the prior year quarter
Results reflect growth across every product line, including particular strength in capital markets transactions and advisory, continued net new business generation in treaty, and growth in facultative placements also contributed to growth in the quarter
Results were partially offset by a modest unfavorable market impact globally
Similar to prior discussions, overall market conditions are improving, as price declines continue to moderate year over year and cedent demands continue to increase against record levels of capital
In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 3%, an acceleration from 2% in the prior year quarter
Results reflect growth across every major practice
We saw continued growth in investment consulting, specifically for delegated investment management services, reflecting an increase in client demand for Aon's tailored solution and independent advice, as well as improved market performance
The team surpassed the $100 billion mark of pension assets under delegated management, a real milestone
We also saw growth across our talent practice, primarily for compensation surveys and engagement services
In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 14%, an acceleration from 1% in the prior year quarter
Results reflect solid growth globally in health and benefits brokerage, including double digit growth across the Asia and EMEA regions
Latin America also delivered solid growth in the quarter, following the recent acquisition of Admix in Brazil
New business for global health and benefits brokerage increased 6% in the quarter
And strong management of the renewal book portfolio drove retention rates greater than 94% on average
Results also reflect double digit growth in healthcare exchanges, primarily driven by follow-on enrollments on the active exchange and certain project related work
In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 5%, similar to the prior year quarter
Results primarily reflect strong growth across our global Affinity business, highlighted by double digit growth in the U.S
We saw growth across all product lines in U.S
Affinity, with particular strength in areas across consumer solutions like travel and financial solutions
Overall, we delivered solid growth to start the year, driven by high demand areas where we continue to invest in innovative solutions and client serving capabilities
Turning to slide 9. Clients are navigating in an increasingly volatile world, where economic, demographic, and geopolitical landscapes, combined with the exponential pace of technology change, are all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses
Aon has a strong track record of developing innovative, first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs
We're investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, our InPoint and ReView businesses; cyber risk advisory, the recent acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; Affinity; health and elective benefits brokerage, Admix in Latin America and Univers; health exchanges, where we offer the broadest set of solutions in health; and delegated investment management
Overall, our strategic investments in high growth areas and in Data & Analytics continue to drive new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio, positioning the firm for continued long term growth
In summary of our performance, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year, driven by investments in our client serving capabilities and operating model
We're accelerating a proven strategy, which has been delivering exceptional results for clients and shareholders for over a decade
With significant financial flexibility to invest across our industry leading portfolio, our operating model, and to return capital to shareholders, we believe we're at the beginning of the next substantial wave of value creation for shareholders
I'm now pleased to turn the call over Christa for further financial review
Hey, Dave
So, Dave, from our standpoint we'd like you to think about these as five really revenue lines in terms of where we are
We really have one segment, that's really what we're trying to do
One overall P&L
And the opportunity here is it really reinforces what we know we're best at
When we bring global capability, all of Aon to our clients in a local way, we do exceptionally well
And in essence we're reinforcing that
So not only are we taking actions to improve the operating model of the firm, as Christa described, but we're also taking actions that continue to align the firm
So that's what we're trying to do with the revenue lines
And what you see is a reflection of exactly how we think about the business
So you're seeing opportunities – think about commercial risk, reinsurance, retirement, all the efforts around that
And then now Data & Analytic services, which really represents what we do in Data & Analytic services, in which we sell directly to a client – or actually provide directly to a client, not embedded in the work we do
So for us this is the exact reflection of how we think about growing and building the business
Which is why we're excited to actually take this forward on your behalf, because this again is how we think about it internally
Yeah, this is – from the standpoint of accountability there's sustained or even more intensified accountability in terms of sort of what has to happen at the grassroots level to build bottom up, to deliver on behalf of the firm
What you see now though is it comes all together in one P&L, to think about kind of integrated Aon
So this is how I think about the business when we think about – and how Christa thinks about the business, when we think about where and how to place capital
So the accountabilities at the front line remain the same and again are intensified
And the opportunity for us is really to take some very substantial steps forward on where we're going to invest and shape the portfolio
And that's what you're looking at here
You're getting a chance to sort of see the five platforms that are really growth platforms
And again if you step back and think about it from a growth standpoint, we started the year, first quarter 4% growth, strongest we've had since 2012. And we've been thinking about it this way for the last 24 months to 36 months
And now you're just seeing a reflection of that
So this is not any type of a change in sort of the detailed front line
It really is how I think and Christa thinks about allocating capital and growing the business overall
Thanks, Sarah
So, Kai, did we answer your first set of questions around sort of the reinvestment piece before we get to growth?
Listen, on the growth side this is really important just from an overall perspective
Because hopefully you can tell from our tone this morning, we're very enthusiastic about this next set of steps for Aon
This is something we thought about for quite some time
And now we're able to put it into place
Kai, if you think about it the – and this is about accelerating growth
Everything around this is accelerating growth and more impact for clients
The actions we're taking really reflect from our standpoint a real conviction around this opportunity we see before us
And as Christa described, a lot of confidence in our ability to capture it
And remember we – same strategy
Same strategy for the last decade, preeminent professional services firm, focus on risk, retirement, health, underpinned by Data & Analytics
That strategy has served us exceptionally well
As I described in some of my comments and Christa did as well, great NPS, value creation 16%, total return to shareholders for 10 years, great 2016 momentum as we jump into 2017. But we would say, and this what's so important
As we think about the potential of our firm, we're still, Kai, at kind of a four out of 10 in terms of capturing the full opportunity
This is very much kind of the glass half full in terms sort of where we can go
And what we're excited about is we know how to get there
We know this is around meeting client needs more effectively and they're evolving
And then improving Aon
And this is what the restructuring is all about from an Aon standpoint
To get from a 4% to a 7% to an 8% in terms of on a scale of zero to 10, this really involves investing and growing in areas of greatest client need
And you're going to see us do that more and more and more, increase risk of innovation
And then on the Aon piece, it's really aligning Aon more effectively to consistently deliver on this idea of global capability delivered locally
And this is – we call it Aon United
But this is really around becoming a better and better and better professional services firm
And to do that there is a whole series of things around technology, colleague experience, fundamental operations of the firm, as Christa described, we've got to improve on
But we also know the economics and the impact of this as we get this right over the coming 24 months, 36 months has a disproportionate and very strong impact on clients and our colleagues and for our shareholders
And then you get to the Outsourcing piece, why is this a catalyst? As we nurtured this and developed this and created the opportunity, the Outsourcing sale is such a great catalyst, because when you think about what happens when we're done with the moves on the restructuring, we end up with a stronger financial platform in terms of being enable to generate operating income
Because the $900 million investment via the charge and resulting efficiency gain, so it more than just replaces lost income
It really creates operational leverage for us in a very positive way
So you now end up with a platform that has a stronger financial engine
And by definition when you look at the math, is growing faster top line, higher margin, 100 basis points, free cash flow, faster growth, better operating leverage as we add and subtract businesses from the portfolio over time
And then, oh yeah, one other real positive, we generate $3 billion of net proceeds
We invest $900 million back in the business
We've gotten more than $2 billion again to accelerate and invest back into Aon
So for us, Kai, I just – it's important you understand sort of the psychology that went into this
This is something that's been sort of in the works for a long, long time that we're now able to launch with a lot of velocity
And we feel really good about it, which is why Christa described it as kind of in our view the next wave
The next wave for our clients, but equally the next wave for our shareholders
So I know it was a bit long winded, but it hopefully gives you a sense on – so what we're trying to do
Well, if you see again – if you look at the first quarter and some were already underway, we had record first quarter growth, the highest growth we've had at the company overall since 2012. So our view is this is an accelerant
And that's what it's designed to be
It's really – this is a set of very kind of offensive steps to sort of strengthen our client serving capability and accelerate growth
Yeah
All of us really trying to – I'll just say it in sort of in that
There is always timing around the quarters, Elyse, and there was in this quarter as well
But coming back to the revenue lines, really important
Again this is how we think about sort of the platforms or investment of the platforms for growth overall
If you think about growth, we've encouraged you to look at Aon
And so that's what we're going to look at
Again back to Christa's four metrics, I would note as well, margin is included in that too
And we have a commitment to continue to improve that
So while no target, we have a commitment to improve on all four of the metrics over the course of the year
And in the case of the revenue lines, we've got five revenue lines that for us represent in many respects how we think about growing the business
On the Commercial Risk side, listen, we feel this has gotten off to a very solid start, very much in line with our expectations
Again we're never caught up in kind of the quarter versus the year
But the underlying activity was exceptionally good
New business, $270 million, up 17%
Retention and rollover were up – both up marginally above 94%, very, very good
Marketing impact was flat
And strong performance internationally with some timing in LatAm
So for us we feel very good about the quarter
You're absolutely right in terms of sort of comparing it to previous quarters, our Data & Analytic Services piece would have been in Risk Solutions
And parts of our Health piece would have been in Risk Solutions too
So for us, we feel very good about the growth for the quarter
Again it's record growth for Aon, back to 2012. So feel very good about that and certainly feel good about where we are on the Commercial Risk side
So again, Paul, we would encourage you not to think about these as five segments
They're not in fact five segments
These are five revenue lines, where Christa and I and the most senior team think about capital allocation and disproportionate investments to change and modify the structure of the firm
Sort of our front line continues as it always has continued, thinking about sort of how we serve clients day to day, supporting each other around where we are
So that – don't look for a lot of change there
This is not in any way, shape, or form a restructuring
This is really how we think about the business overall
And we're trying to give you a much clearer window into how we think about capital allocation
We will continue to align the most senior team around a set of incentives
And we've done that for our executive committee, where literally everything is aligned around – together around shareholder value creation
And then we've also got our top 150, top 175 colleagues, who also are now more aligned around this single P&L, which is a very substantial change for us at the most senior level
As well as individual results that they have responsibility for
So for us, we're creating alignment around the one P&L at the top
But at the front line it is exactly as we've been doing
So this isn't a lot of disruption at the front line
This is really meant to create disproportionate investment around growth and to drive growth and to strengthen the firm
Well, Jay, consistent with what we just said before, sort of the quarters do what they do
We obviously love this segment, love this business, and have continued to invest in it, continue to see it grow
There's no doubt it's a hard comp if you want to go quarter to quarter for next year
No doubt about that
But feel very, very good about the overall trajectory
And the off-cycle is literally – on the exchange side as you add companies, make their decisions to add companies, subtract companies, it really changes sort of the off-cycle a bit, another positive thing about this business
And that's what you see reflected here
Yeah, you're still going to see it more, Brian – Q4 is skewed just as how companies make decisions
As we described before, we've really worked with clients to think about health really over the course of the year, which they do anyway, but in terms of the mechanics or the decision making process, so you're seeing that spread out a bit
But it's still disproportionately skewed to Q4.
Brian, I love that question
Here's – we don't think about it as cross sell
I'll tell you what we think about it as, delivering the firm
So this isn't about sort of a micro, I brought a new product, can you buy this or buy that? This is around an ethic
And we take this deadly seriously
This is an ethic around delivering the global capability of Aon, sitting at the table with clients, thinking about their needs, and having enough understanding as an individual and credibility to introduce parts of Aon to help a client succeed
Sometimes, Brian, that'll result in a sale
What it always does – and we know this
What it always does is it strengthens the reputation of Aon in the eyes of a client
That creates greater degrees of freedom or opportunities for us to actually help that client succeed
And also it gives us more information on where and how to invest in areas that are important to clients
So for us, this is why we're so excited about this opportunity
This is – as we take Aon United and we continue to evolve it and we go from a 4 to a 5 to a 6 to a 7 on that scale of 10 I described before, we know that's going to produce great results for clients and tremendous results for Aon
And in doing so obviously great results for shareholders
So for us it's not cross sell
It's really around Aon United and delivering the firm
And with real credibility in a way we've done many times before, Brian, but we've never done fully consistently
That's why again this isn't about a new concept
This is taking a concept we know works and then scaling it, which is why the investment back into the firm is so important
The really – Brian, there's – this is the beauty of this is, this isn't about restructuring or reorganization
There's not reorganization in this
This is literally stepping back and saying, what do we need to do to serve clients more effectively? And how do we work together to do that? In the one P&L, the five revenue lines, the alignment at the senior team, the restructuring that Christa described, all these things are around literally the mindset focus on clients overall
So the beauty of this is, there's not a lot of organizational complexity embedded in this at all
This is really how we come together to support our clients
And again it's not something that's conceptual
We've been thinking about this now for the better part of 24 months
We know this has tremendous potential
It was just how we were going to scale it
So for us this is not about sort of front line organizational change
It's really about how we think about clients
Well, the CapEx overall, Ryan, as you know, what we showed before, the $200 million has actually come down over time as we exited our – exited the Tempo businesses
As you recall that was 36% of that CapEx, so that's come down over time
Well, thanks very much for joining us
We look forward to the next call
And everybody, have a great day
