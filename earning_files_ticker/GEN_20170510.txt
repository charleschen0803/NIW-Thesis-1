Thank you for joining us
Fiscal 2017 was a transformative year at Symantec with substantial improvement across the entire company
Fiscal 2018 marks the second half of our execution plan to fundamentally transform Symantec's enterprise and consumer businesses addressing both revenue growth and profitability
Today, we announced our Q4 fiscal year 2017 results
And we're also raising our fiscal 2018 EPS outlook to $1.75 to $1.85. I will recap our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results, update you on our progress within Enterprise Security and Consumer Security segments, discuss our transformation and cost savings commitments, and our CFO, Nick Noviello, will provide more details on our financial results and fiscal 2018 outlook
Beginning with Q4, our results demonstrate strong and consistent execution relative to our expectations
During the quarter, we saw further evidence that our investments and commitments to innovation are distinguishing us as the leader in cyber security for the cloud generation
Let me highlight a few key areas from the quarter
Our overall Q4 business activity was strong and consistent with our expectations
And within Enterprise Security, we saw a faster than expected increase in mix towards cloud subscription and virtual appliances
We believe this product mix shift is a positive for our business both financially and strategically, is a proof that our customers are designing Symantec into their future cloud security architectures
Enterprise Security profitability has improved dramatically with Q4 fiscal year 2017 operating margins up 17 points year over year
Consumer Security revenue growth performed better than our guidance, and LifeLock came in above our revenue expectations as well
Overall, we continued to perform ahead of plan on our cost efficiencies and synergies
Total company margins were at the high end of our guidance
And as a result, we delivered EPS at the high end of our guidance, excluding LifeLock
Now turning to our Enterprise business, we are combining best of breed product innovation with unmatched scale
This is leading to significant competitive advantage and differentiates us in the market as the leading cyber security provider for enterprises
During the fourth quarter, business activity was strong
We are pleased to report Enterprise Security grew 2% organically in the quarter
The business activity of our Blue Coat products were in line with our expectations at above-market growth
And we hit a big milestone in Q4, as we have achieved feature parity between our network products delivered through an appliance and its corollary in the cloud
We now have the leading software elements across relevant deployment methods: appliances, virtual appliances, and pure cloud
During the quarter, we doubled the number of cloud proxy competitive wins versus our next largest cloud competitor
And we are pleased that we saw accelerating demand for cloud and subscription solutions
Selling more cloud solutions is a positive indicator for future success
This has an effect on end period revenue with the benefit of increased deferred revenue
The Blue Coat subscription offerings are now approaching $100 million revenue run rate, growing 67% year on year in the fourth quarter with business activity more than doubling on an annualized basis
Now on to Consumer Security results for Q4 fiscal year 2017; Consumer Security exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance on an organic basis, and LifeLock performed above revenue expectations with strong underlying growth metrics
LifeLock renewal rates increased year over year and cumulative ending members were up 8% year over year
This is an impressive result amidst the significant acquisition and integration activity
Moving to the full year fiscal 2017, the results show improving revenue performance and delivered ahead of plan on operating efficiency, while we are, at the same time, integrating our transformative acquisitions
Nick will cover the full year fiscal year 2017 details in his remarks
Now let me turn to the strategic progress we are making in Enterprise Security
Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is clearly resonating with customers
We believe our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform provides the security reference architecture for the future of IT environments whether on premise, software defined or in a pure cloud delivery model
The strength of our platform begins with a strong commitment to leading cyber defense intelligence
As we have commented on previously, the integration of Blue Coat and Symantec threat intelligence has created a differentiated lens into the threat landscape
An example of our artificial intelligence adding significant value with this data is now resulting in blocking an additional 3.2 million attacks every day
We expect more advancements from our artificial intelligence as we further integrate our network and endpoint data
Our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform ingests this threat intelligence and combines it with robust integrated functionality across our user, web, information, and messaging solutions
Turning to a representative customer example, recently one of the world's largest food and drug retailers with over 60,000 users embarked upon an initiative to move to the cloud and upgrade their security infrastructure
Our sales team moved the conversation with the customer from speaking about a combination of point solutions to articulating the benefits of our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform
We delivered a solution that improved the customer's security posture and reduced their expense
Given the increased Symantec footprint, this customer is now paying approximately 60% more to Symantec but reduced their overall security spend by an estimated 25% and took a major step forward in their security posture
We expect these type of win-win opportunities to be commonplace as companies are looking for integrated platforms as they struggle with technology sprawl and runaway costs due to isolated point vendors
Now let me highlight our leadership in cloud security
In order for the enterprise customer to take advantage of the cloud, security solutions must be incorporated that reduce the risks inherent in the cloud generation
All of our major solutions are now delivering in the cloud and designed for the new risks our customers are facing
For example, we have an industry-leading approach to securing cloud applications
We have combined cloud proxy, CASB, Data Loss Prevention, and multi-factor authentication into one complete offering that addresses these new risks
We believe we are the only company that has all of these major components and we'll enjoy this position for the foreseeable future
When compared to the alternatives of an internal IT shop procuring and integrating multiple solutions from point vendors, we are an obvious choice
In Q4 we saw a substantial traction with our entire cloud security portfolio
As an example of our success, during the quarter we won a large deal at a major technology services company that is undergoing a cloud transformation
The customer took the first steps in adopting this platform for their internal environment with the purchase of our cloud proxy and DLP
This was a highly competitive win and a massive endorsement to our strength in cloud security given how cloud-centric IT services organizations are today
We see many deals in the pipeline that are similar in nature
Turning to our endpoint security solution, endpoint security is a key component of our platform and its success has resulted in customers cross buying additional components of our cyber defense platform
In Q4, we saw continued success with SEP 14 from both a product and sales standpoint
SEP 14 detection rates have improved 26% compared to SEP 12. Competitive wins are increasing and SEP 14 has not witnessed a significant technical loss
For example we replaced a major competitor at a large financial services company
There were multiple drivers of the win including SEP integration with ProxySG and our superior machine learning capabilities
The competitive landscape is turning in our favor with a leading-market share endpoint vendor removed from a third party endpoint leadership quadrant as well as smaller endpoint providers experiencing some recent significant missteps
Overall we see signs of increasing win rates and expect renewal metrics to improve over the medium term
In addition, Endpoint Detection and Response, EDR, is an important part of the endpoint market that is garnering attention from customers
The next release of our converged endpoint plus EDR solution is launching soon
As we introduce this new version of converged endpoint plus EDR into our installed base, we expect to have a similar impact to the current point EDR solution vendors as SEP 14 is having on point machine learning and exploit prevention vendors
For example, during the fourth quarter we closed a nearly 180,000 endpoint win with a large IT services company that included our EDR and endpoint security
The customer was overwhelmed with the high volume of alerts across 40 countries and was seeking to consolidate their endpoint security to a single vendor
We won due to our strong technology and single agent architecture
This win involved replacing two competitors out of our customer's endpoint environment
We have made strong progress in EDR and are pleased with our first year in the market closing approximately 600 customers
We believe, given our rapid adoption, we are already a meaningful player in the EDR market one year after launch
This is an example of our competitive advantage enabled by our platform
In summary on endpoint progress, the power of our platform improves the security posture of our customers while enabling them to drive down their overall security cost per employee
The combination of cloud proxy, CASB, DLP, and multi-factor authentication enables the cloud generation
With SEP 14, we are now the leading next generation endpoint provider and will further extend our leadership with the introduction of the converged endpoint and EDR
Now onto our Consumer Security segment, the acquisition of LifeLock was a catalyst that expanded the business on to a new market category of Consumer Digital Safety
We believe digital safety increases our addressable market to an estimated $10 billion growing in the high single digits
We have expanded our value proposition by offering a comprehensive digital safety solution that delivers more value to the customer than PC malware protection alone and protects all aspects of a consumer's digital life including their information, identities, devices, homes and families
In addition, we now have a much larger demand generation budget for enhancing our brand and driving new customer acquisitions
We expect this competitive differentiation will fuel sustainable long-term growth in new customers and retention metrics
During the quarter we are already seeing signs that the strategy is working
Norton results were better than our outlook driven by renewal metrics and new products such as mobile solutions and privacy technology
We see a significant opportunity to deliver more value to our loyal customers which we will expand upon in more detail at the Financial Analyst Day
At a high level, there are multiple growth drivers that underpin our digital safety strategy
Let me outline the major components
First, leverage our larger demand generation
By combining Norton and LifeLock we have substantially increased our demand generation engine that can inform the market of our expanded value proposition
Our combined demand generation spend nearly triples compared to Norton stand-alone, and we expect it will provide greater economies of scale
For example, we recently rolled out a co-branded marketing campaign by leveraging LifeLock's existing paid TV and radio advertising spend
Second, transitioning to a digital safety offering
Another lever for growth is transitioning our loyal Norton customer base to our digital safety bundle We began our journey to digital safety by cross selling new offerings such as Wi-Fi privacy and our upcoming home IT security and next generation parental control solution, Norton Core
We have already begun the preliminary phases of cross selling Norton into the LifeLock base through a referral process
And in June, we plan to begin to cross-sell the LifeLock and Norton bundle, which we believe has potential to drive upside to our current outlook
As a reminder, identity protection customers pay 2 to 3 times more for protecting their identity than the average selling price of PC malware protection
We were purposely measured in our cross-sell launch of LifeLock into the Norton base to ensure our internal systems and processes were tightly aligned
Moreover, with approximately 50% of the Norton installed base outside the U.S
, international expansion of the digital safety bundle is a large opportunity
Third, mobile security
Mobile users increased 50% year over year driven by both Android and iOS growth
In April, we signed an agreement with a large international telco to deliver Norton Mobile protection for their customer base, which is a new route to over 43 million wireless subscribers
We are also seeing an uptick in demand of mobile private VPN due to recent legislation that permits ISPs to share customers' internet activity
Finally, Norton Core, which has the potential to be a significant growth driver
Norton Core is an exciting extension to our digital safety platform
We are seeing continued strong reception from partners and industry participants
We expect the combined consumer business to reach growth adjusted for acquisitions by the first half of fiscal 2018. We plan to accomplish this while maintaining industry leading profitability, which provides us with the flexibility to continue investing in driving long term growth in our Consumer Digital Safety business
Turning to recent developments related to our website security solution
As you may be aware, in late March, Google put forth a proposal that, if implemented, would introduce major changes to the processes and operations that are standard across our industry, including our Certificate Authority business
Since that time, we've been engaged in conversations with Google, Mozilla, and other members of the CA community to seek input on our counter proposal that we believe minimizes business disruption for our customers and improves trust in Symantec's CA business
We believe we will find a mutually agreeable path forward that is in the best interest of our customers, and we expect discussions around our proposal to continue and have factored our current expectations around this headwind into our financial outlook
Now, I would like to address the transformation of the overall Symantec business and our operational commitments
We indicated there was a strong industrial logic to our transformation
Exiting fiscal 2017, we believe this industrial logic is materializing across the business
Last June, we committed to a set of cost savings and synergies
We're achieving these savings at a faster pace than originally anticipated and we are ahead of plan exiting fiscal 2017. Exiting fiscal 2017, the financial profile of Symantec has substantially improved from what would have been the picture not even a year ago
For example, Enterprise Security operating margins improved from 5% in fiscal year 2016 to 13% in fiscal year 2017 and we are forecasting exiting fiscal year 2018 with over 30% enterprise operating margins
Fiscal 2018 begins the second half of our execution plan to fundamentally transform Symantec across both revenue growth and increased profitability
As we exit fiscal year 2018, at the highest level, we expect organic revenue growth for each of our segments, and total organic revenue growth for the company in the mid-single digits with market leading operating margins, in Enterprise Security above 30% and in Consumer Security above 40%
We are entering the year with significant operational improvements in our go-to-market processes and have simplified the demand chain and programs to our partners reducing substantial complexity across the business
We have made substantial transformational changes in our Enterprise Security segment related to SKUs, price lists, partners and systems
And today, we have a very capable and proven team that can navigate integration complexity and continue to focus on disciplined operational execution
We have combined two quota carrying sales forces thus increasing our productive sales capacity
From the close of the Blue Coat transaction through the end of fiscal year 2017, we effectively maintained the equivalent of 2 sales reps per named account, with divided territories
Over the last nine months, we have worked to align our sales capacity more efficiently
We are confident that our efforts are already translating to results, however, we believe it is prudent to begin the fiscal year 2018 Q1 with modest close rate assumptions, allowing for additional sales capacity to take effect
In summary, the new Symantec has established significant competitive differentiation, which allows us the financial flexibility to maximize our investment in cyber security, which greatly benefits our customers, employees and shareholders
The industrial logic around the Symantec and Blue Coat combination is stronger than ever, and we are combining leading product innovation with unmatched scale, which in our view, is leading to significant competitive advantages
The Integrated Cyber Defense Platform is resonating with customers and the opportunities to significantly expand our wallet share are materializing
We have transformed our Consumer business from PC malware protection to Consumer Digital Safety
This brings significant competitive differentiation and we expect will fuel sustainable long-term growth
We are forecasting that our Norton customers will purchase LifeLock, hence, returning the consumer business to organic growth
We are on track to deliver long-term sustainable growth with leading profitability across both our Enterprise Security and Consumer segments
And we are on track with our expectations to exit fiscal 2018 with organic growth accelerating into the mid single digits with total non-GAAP operating margins over 35%
Now, I will turn the call over to Nick to provide more financial detail
Jon, I'll ask you to lead the Q&A
Yes, so I think the endpoint is a busy space at the moment, and one of the things that we're really into is delivering a converged endpoint to try to reduce some of the chaos and expense in our customers as we had described in one of the examples
And so we have I think closed the gap on any of the AI-based [stimulus] detection machine learning aspects of the endpoint and always had the best sort of detection technologies that we had
And recently, we had turned our energy onto the EDR front
It is really trying to get to the repair and response to malware events or cyber security events
We have entered the market last year with that and I think in our prepared remarks we talked about some substantial success in that first year and we really look forward to that converged solution coming into the release of our SEP 14 platform in the very near future
From a customer wallet point of view, there is a wallet open for EDR at the moment in the enterprise, and we do expect to take a good piece of that
And I think another big benefit for us is the effect of that capability in our product in our renewal and we do expect our renewal rates on endpoint to increase
We are also delivering other endpoint technology that is great
We have a future release coming up this year of endpoint integrated very tightly with our proxy technology that will change the game in being able to respond and detect problems
And we have a great cross sell opportunity for endpoint DLP, which is very powerful in the cloud generation for protecting enterprise data from the endpoint to the cloud
So you put all that together, we also think there is a great opportunity for us to take share as some of the big market share leaders have had some headwinds in third party analysis
And as mentioned, in our prepared remarks, it had reports come out that have sort of downgraded their capability
We expect to step into some of that share also
One of the other points I'd like to make about the remarks in our conference call is the traditional Symantec Enterprise Security business grew this quarter in Q4. And remember comments from the prior call where that was slightly negative and we had felt good about our opportunity to bring that back to growth
And that was delivered in Q4.
Yeah, so I'll start off
I think with the Blue Coat question
So first we did see more subscription
I think there's a couple of things that are going on there
First of all, we have now achieved feature parity with the Blue Coat solution, whether it be the hardware appliance, the VAs that we deployed for software defined network solutions and also the pure cloud offering
So we want to provide our products to customers the way they want to buy them
And as we see more and more cloud adoption in the enterprise, we now offer our customers the three different versions of how to take that technology on
In the fourth quarter, we saw a more than what we had planned adoption of the cloud and subscription versions of those form factors
Very good result because that is proof that the Symantec technology is being designed into the future network architectures of some of our large enterprise customers
We think that there's going to be more of that in the future, and hence, we have on many conference calls, we have put an underscore on mix as we go forward and we do see, as the cloud generation takes off, more of that mix
We also have seen great traction with our Blue Coat subscription and Blue Coat cloud technology
That is something that is growing at a very strong clip
And as we reported in our remarks, that 67% growth rate at the sort of revenue zip code, we do expect a strong future there
So that hits the current period with tailwinds into the deferred revenue for the future
But we really also want to point out it's difficult to decipher the deferred revenue, and Nick can make comments on that later or at the Analyst Day
But I think it's really important to understand that we did see the expected levels of business in the Blue Coat products in Q4, and we saw a shift of some of the form factor with which it is purchased, which affected some of the end period revenue
Okay, so the business was in good shape
Very good questions
So two things are happening and just put an underscore around the product mix that we described and also the ramp in sales
And we did talk in our prepared remarks about two things
We have put a substantial amount of work into the back office systems and what we have done in our demand chain and our channel
That has gone into effect coming out of Q4 and into the first quarter of this fiscal year
And we have spent a lot of time planning and preparing the sort of realignment of our sales force where we used to have that sales force overlap on a bunch of named accounts
We have now worked for the last nine months to align them to the market
And we are just signaling to folks that it will take a little bit of time for that newly-aligned field to get productive
Okay? And so those are two things
And I'll pass the call over – the question over to Nick to hit a couple of these as well
I think that's a good point
Okay, the bundles are important
We mentioned that we are the only vendor in the market in our prepared remarks with the four major pieces of CloudStack, and others really taking what used to be four separate sort of pieces of technology and putting them together
That's an example of a bundle
And when we put it together, how that gets purchased and recognized is different than it may be historically
And I think the other piece that's really, really important is we did do the hard work for those of you who are long-term, we did go after the massive number of different kinds of distribution contracts
Thousands and thousands of SKUs, and reduced those things to a modern demand chain, modern set of distribution contracts and a much, much simplified price book for our products, and so we are going after long-term complexity take-down
And the other piece, I think, that definitely makes me feel good about things is our sales attrition is extremely low
And we come out of a fiscal year with just everybody hit all their – the usual cohort of very good folks did well, and now coming into this year, you usually get a spike in attrition
We did not have that
So, now let me start off by passing over the growth by product question to Nick, and he can knock some of that down, and I'll come back to the last one
And Matt, moving to your next question about the Blue Coat refresh, I think there's – we have I would say a very good reputation in the market with respect to the products and technologies that Blue Coat delivered to our customers, and that refresh is coming from having looked at Blue Coat before
What you have is a high end of enterprise and middle enterprise solution that's very popular in that cohort
And so that cohort is migrating to the cloud and really landing in what we call a hybrid cloud situation, where they definitely have need store on premise, hardware in some environments and other stuff they'd like to pick up just purely from the cloud
And for those who have built the virtual infrastructure like the virtualization capabilities, they want to be able to pick this stuff up in a software defined space
So as we roll into the refresh, which really happens in FY 2018, and then throughout FY 2019 in healthy numbers, nothing's happened to the size of it
We do see like we saw in Q4, we expect to see a better natural mix shift to the software defined and pure cloud choices for that, which we think are very good
If you look at a competitive displacement of that, we think we have a better stack for that technology than any other vendor, and we can give it to you how you want to buy it
And that's how we're approaching the refresh is if you want it in cloud, you want it in software defined, you want it in appliances, you tell us, we give it to you
And we think that when you look at the feature set of that set of capabilities, it is extremely differentiated
It is better than anything else on the market
So we are still planning on that going well, and that also is in our thoughts around a strong second half and also a very strong 2019. Okay?
Yeah, no problem
So let me take on the Norton Core one first, and then I'll circle back to the private
So in the Norton Core discussion, we have seen from the pre-launch of the product at the CES Show around the start of January, we've seen a continuing build in substantial interest both from kind of end customers as well as cable, broadband, telecom operators and other folks that have been traditional channels for more malware oriented technology
So we think that the future is bright for Core, and we've had some very, very good business interactions with some of those providers
We don't have – we don't want to mess up any of our announcements that may happen in the future by talking about that on this call, but I would say that we still are very optimistic about Core
And because of the value proposition, and I think the growing awareness of the plethora of internet enabled devices in the home and being able to take care of that
So we like the business activity around Core, and we think as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the growth driver from that is definitely a reason for optimism
For the first part of your question is really about endpoint and Proxy
And I think that we've delivered
One thing that we talked about on the call, which is very powerful, which is the threat telemetry into our AI that comes from the integration of endpoint and our Proxy technology
And what that means is if we know about something in the web that's bad, the endpoints are aware of that and they won't even initiate those kind of connections when the user is requesting those or when malware is trying to go to those
Also, modern malware comes to you in lots of pieces
It can be taking a long time with different forms of getting there
When we detect that and we go and stitch that back together, we can vaccinate all of those avenues in the network, and thus shut down those infections, and so we really like what's happening right now in our telemetry and the AI associated with it
When we first launched it, we talked about blocking 300-and-some-thousand events per day, and that's gotten smarter over time
And is now into the 3-plus million per day
And so that is extremely encouraging
What's happening next in conjunction with what we're doing in EDR is being able to have our network technology reach back to the client when they see something that they don't understand or something that's new or something that's anomalistic, and ask what's on the other end of this? What is requesting this? What is this? And when we see kind of a Twitter tweet that didn't come from a Twitter app or a browser, we would get very interested in that, and that EDR meets ProxySG
And our security analytics technology delivers a solution that we think will seriously differentiate us in the market
We know a lot about it and we're working hard towards that goal
Additionally, we have some more work we're doing with our client multi-factor authenticator to also enlist our users when we something that's anomalistic, and actually ask them, hey, we noticed this
Are you actually copying all these files right now? And we get a yes or no out of that, and that can really also enlist a very different set of remediation and detection capability
So we are driving innovation in network meets endpoint in a huge way and we are – our engineers are super excited about what's going on
And they run into my office quite often to show me something cool, and I think we're going to excite people as we start to release those pieces of technology where the rest of our network technology meets endpoint
Yeah, go ahead
Okay
So on the pricing side of EDR, I think the market is definitely used to buying EDR right now
So there's definitely a wallet and a budget open for that
And we do expect to, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, to be able to go in and say where that becomes a Symantec Integrated Cyber Defense Platform solution, we want to be able to give our customers a lower cost of ownership for that integrated product
And so, we expect to take down – we expect that we have an opportunity to, in that share of wallet, to get more for Symantec, but also give back a good chunk to our partners and our customer base
So we do think that we are a huge disruptor to the current state of play in EDR, because we do have a massive installed base
And in our business case, we also like to incent that renewal, which is very helpful for us because we do grow from two good pieces of security real estate, that and the endpoint, that and the network, and that and the big threat analytics
So we like growing and retaining our share at the endpoint
EDR will be a driver for that
I think the other piece that's quite good, we mentioned a very large case where we won an EDR account in our prepared remarks against all of the who's who
We also entered the market just in FY 2017 with EDR, and we did get a very strong set of installs around that that were competitive
So you mentioned the pricing
I think that's still kind of TBD from a list MSRP kind of situation when coupled with the next version of SEP 14. We do expect that to be more for Symantec, less for our customer
Okay?
We're forecasting organic growth in FY 2018 for consumer, and there's a lot of room for positive thoughts about how that's going to go
So, I think that's it
We're out of time, overtime
And I'd just like to thank all of you for getting on the call and asking some great questions
And at this point, in the transformation of Symantec, I think we have achieved some outstanding results on the operational efficiencies and the margin optimization
And I think we are set up on an outcome for FY 2018 that we feel as management team is achievable
And we feel great about what happens coming out of FY 2018 into FY 2019, and that is something that we really look forward to the discussion at Financial Analyst Day
We'll put the coffee pot on early
It's going to be a lot of detail
There's a lot to discuss
And look forward to seeing you all in person I think in just a little less than a month on June 8. So thank you very much for your time today
