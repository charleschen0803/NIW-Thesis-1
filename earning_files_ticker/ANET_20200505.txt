Operator

Welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the
Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Curtis
McKee, Director of Corporate and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin.

Curtis McKee
Head of Corporate & Investor Development

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call
are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief
Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal
first quarter ending March 31, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our
website.

During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking
statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2020 fiscal year,
longer-term financial outlooks, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, industry innovation,
our market opportunity, the benefits of recent acquisitions and the impact of litigation, which are subject
to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically
in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially
from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you
should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update
these statements after this call.

Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis
and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release.

With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Curtis. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our first quarter 2020 earnings
call. First, I would like to address the coronavirus global pandemic, the world's largest in 100 years.
Clearly, this is unlike recessionary events, including the dotcom crash of 2001 or the financial recession of
2008, both of which were sector-specific.

At Arista, we are focused on the welfare of our employees, supporting our customers and helping the
local community. We recognize our role and responsibility in supporting global communications and cloud
infrastructure during these mission-critical times. We're adjusting to the new norm of real-time audio and
video communication. Our support case load has doubled during the initial weeks, but has now stabilized
as we help our customers in their time of need.

Getting back to Q1 specifics. We delivered revenues of $523 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP
earnings per share of $2.02. Service contributed approximately 21% of revenue, up from 19% last
quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margins were 65.6%, influenced by a healthy software and services mix.
We've registered solid number of million-dollar customers as a direct result of our enterprise traction.

In Q1 2020, cloud titans was our largest vertical. The enterprise is now consistently the second largest,
followed by the Tier 2 specialty cloud providers and financials tied for third place and the service provider
at fourth place.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Due to popular requests from our analyst friends, we are now providing more color into our annual trends
across 3 main sectors: cloud titans, approximately 40% of our mix; enterprise, including financial services,
approximately 35% of our mix; and providers, which includes both service provider and cloud specialty
provider, approximately 25% of our mix.

In terms of geographies, Q1 2020 mix had international contribution at 23%, with the Americas at 77%.

In terms of mergers and acquisitions, we closed the acquisition of Big Switch networks in February 2020.
We are experiencing early traction and complementarity with Arista's Data ANalyZer, DANZ, offering and
entering into the network packet broker space.

We are expanding in the campus our cloud networking principles, introducing exciting cognitive WiFi suite
of features with the support of Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams and Zoom as well as open config-based
automation model. Arista's cognitive campus portfolio was launched last summer to address the explosion
of clients, users and IoT devices with software-driven automation.

We are well on our way to meeting our first year's $100 million target ending Q2 2020. While we are
pleased with this traction, we must all exercise patience as we cultivate this part of our business. It took
us more than 7 years to build our cloud business to $500 million, and we believe that our enterprise
prospects will take time, especially in this COVID-19 era. We are only just beginning our first year of a 5-
to 7-year journey to disrupt 30 years of legacy and status quo.

COVID-19 has required us to respond rapidly to changing events. In accordance with the country-specific
shelters and orders, we have closed all our offices to assure employee healthy -- health and safety. We
are consequently experiencing supply chain constraints, and we are managing our global capacity with
our contract manufacturers in San Jose, Mexico, Malaysia and coping with some inventory and component
shortages. Lead times vary and have doubled recently for some of our popular products. Arista is working
in lockstep with our customers in supporting their business continuity and planning throughout 2020.

Our visibility, especially into second half 2020, is pretty low. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has
increased sharply in April. Until the economic environment permits us to resume more normal routine, we
have limited visibility to demand. It is clear that we live in uncertain times, and therefore, with what we
know at this time, it is prudent to assume our annual 2020 revenue may decline versus our 2019.

We expect to manage our overall business this year at Arista's 2018 levels, and we'll continue to monitor
this closely. Arista, together with the entire business sector and global supply chain, is coping with
multiple unknowns in the midst of a global pandemic.

We expect to see some short-term strength in cloud titan, offset by prolonged sales cycles with new
prospects in the campus and enterprise sector. We remain confident that the combination of our product
superiority, commitment to quality with the lowest critical vulnerabilities and the highest Net Promoter
Score of 76 is very compelling in the network industry and of great value to our customers. Our recent
market share gains, customer intimacy and operating leverage will navigate us through these unforeseen
circumstances. We expect to emerge stronger than many of our industry peers as we migrate to modern
networking.

Before I turn it over to Ita for financial specifics, on behalf of Arista, I truly wish all of our listeners,
employees and their families, customers and well wishers be safe and healthy. Ita?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 '20 is
based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash, stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-
related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP
results is provided in our earnings release.

Total revenues in Q1 were $523 million, down 12% year-over-year and just above the lower end of
our guidance of $522 million to $532 million. As discussed previously, this decline on a year-over-year

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

basis was in part related to the recognition of approximately $83 million of deferred revenue in the first
quarter of 2019. In addition, while demand in Q1 2020 was reasonably healthy, we did experience some
COVID-19-related components supply and manufacturing challenges, which resulted in extended lead
times and somewhat constrained shipments for the quarter.

Service revenues represented approximately 21% of total revenue, up from 19% last quarter, reflecting
strong service renewal activity in the period, coupled with a lower product revenue number.

International revenues for the quarter came in at $122.4 million or 23.5% of total revenue, down from
25% in Q4. Shifts in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis were largely
driven by the level of revenue and the location of deployments by our cloud titan customers.

Overall gross margin in Q1 was 65.6%, well above our guidance of approximately 63% and up from
65.2% last quarter. As expected, we saw strength in our cloud business in the period with the related
lower gross margin impact, more than offset by some onetime constrained supply-related sales of
previously reserved inventory and a healthy mix of software and services mix.

Operating expenses for the quarter were $149.3 million or 28.5% of revenue, down from last quarter to
$154.3 million. R&D spending came in at $91 million or 17.4% of revenue, down from $96.2 million last
quarter. This decline largely reflected lower engineering and prototype costs in the period.

Sales and marketing expenses was consistent with last quarter at approximately $46 million or 8.8%
of revenue, with increased headcount costs, somewhat offset by lower marketing and travel-related
spending. Our G&A costs were flat to last quarter at approximately $12 million or 2.3% of revenue.

Our operating income for the quarter was $194 million or 37.1% of revenue. Other income expense for
the quarter was a favorable $12.2 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 21.6%. This result
[indiscernible] net income for the quarter of $161.7 million or 30.9% of revenue.

Our diluted share number was 79.94 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for
the quarter of $2.02, down 12.6% from the prior year.

We completed the purchase accounting for Big Switch acquisition in the period, with immaterial amounts
of revenue and expense included in our non-GAAP results in the first quarter.

For those of you focused in our GAAP results, we recorded $11.9 million of acquisition-related expenses
in the period, which we consider to be onetime in nature and which, together with $4.9 million of
amortization of acquired intangibles, have been excluded from our non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation
of our GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in our earnings release.

Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at
approximately $2.6 billion. We repurchased $228 million of our common stock during the quarter at a
weighted average price of $189 per share. This brings our total repurchases to date to $494 million or 2.4
million shares over a 4-quarter period. As a reminder, our Board of Directors has authorized a 3-year $1
billion stock repurchase program commencing in Q2 '19. The program allows us to repurchase shares of
our common stock opportunistically and is funded from operating cash flows.

Generated $195 million of cash from operations in the first quarter, reflecting solid net income
performance and a slight increase in working capital requirements. DSOs came in at 61 days, down from
65 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of billings in the period. Inventory turns were 2.5x, down from 2.9 last
quarter. Inventory increased to $262 million in the quarter, up from $244 million in the prior period. Our
total deferred revenue balance was $597 million, up from $575 million in Q4. As a reminder, our deferred
revenue balance is now almost exclusively services-related. Accounts payable days were 43 days, down
from 44 days in Q4, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments. Capital expenditure for the
quarter was $3.1 million.

Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. As Jayshree mentioned, we continue
to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 around the world. We, our customers and our supply chain
partners continue to operate under various local restrictions, and it is unclear when and how these

restrictions will be lifted. While we're not in a position to predict these outcomes and provide longer-term
guidance, we did want to provide some color on how we are managing and framing the business in the
interim.

While we expect demand from our cloud businesses to remain stable, we believe a number of other
verticals could see some pause or slowing of IT spending, pending clarity on the economic outlook. Given
this uncertainty, we believe it's prudent to manage [indiscernible] investments carefully and in a range
closer to 2018 levels. We are prioritizing key projects and customer engagements while benefiting from a
natural reduction in travel, marketing and other variable expenses. On the gross margin front, we would
reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, with customer mix being the key driver.

Now for a couple of additional housekeeping items. We have continued to see some upward pressure on
the effective tax rate and have increased the forecasted rate to 21.8%. In addition, we expect the current
lower interest rate environment to negatively impact our other income amounts in the future.

Finally, our guidance for Q2 reflects our current understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on our business
and supply chain. This is, however, an inherently uncertain situation, and we will need to continue to
monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds. With all of this as a backdrop,
our guidance for the second quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any noncash stock-
based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items, is as follows: revenues of approximately
$520 million to $540 million, gross margin of 63% to 65%, operating margins of approximately 35%.
Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.8%, with diluted shares of approximately 79.7
million shares.

I will now turn the call back to Curtis.

Head of Corporate & Investor Development

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Jayshree mentioned the short-term benefit you're expecting from some of the cloud companies. So maybe
if you can elaborate on that a bit. How much of this is from the cloud titans? What are you seeing from the
specialty cloud providers? Are you expecting similar upside there? And why isn't there more confidence in
the sustainability of this kind of upside as we look a bit more longer term?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks, Samik. Well, as you know, Arista's cloud titan performance is consistent with the cloud
CapEx reporting. In other words, some are experiencing strong spend, some are declining and others
are cautious. So given all the pluses and minuses, I think it's safe to say that for the year, we expect a
flattish cloud titan trend. And this is actually an improvement because we've been saying flat to down. So
of course, we'll monitor this closely. As you know, we never have long-term visibility on cloud titans. It's
quarter-by-quarter. So we'll inspect more closely, especially for the second half.

Now in terms of the cloud specialty providers, they were actually stronger trend for us in Q1. It's pretty
cyclical in nature. It depends on different Tier 2 cloud providers. Each one has a unique architecture. We
had a somewhat weak specialty cloud providers in 2019, but they've started off well for us in Q1 and Q2.
And over time, it will be a matter of economics and what makes most business sense for them. I believe
some of them will succeed in specialized use cases. But once again, we're going to keep a watch and
monitor this closely in the second half.

Operator

Your next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Jayshree, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the enterprise vertical and maybe on 2 different
vectors, if you can just kind of give us a little color on what you're seeing on large enterprises. And then
as it relates to -- you talked about a longer process for the campus move. Could you just talk a little bit
about the moving parts near term given that, obviously, a lot of people are working from home, so it's
difficult to sell on-prem equipment. So if you can just give us a little more color there.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Sure, Tim. So to answer your broad question on enterprise sector, I think Arista's brand is very well
recognized for data center. And with our 6,000-plus customers, we've got very good recognition there
from a differentiated product, and we've already been very engaged with them. So customers we've been
engaged with -- in fact, we had most recently in February, just a little before all the doors got shut down
on us, we were engaged with over 100, 150 enterprise customers. And we had a global advisory and
Arista innovate. So our intimacy with enterprise customers is very high, and we continue to do well with
them. They're both existing and new projects.

I think where we will be challenged in the enterprise and also in the campus is new prospects. We're not
going to get enough FaceTime with them. We're doing a lot of virtual webinars, virtual events, virtual
EBCs. It's a virtual world we're certainly living in. But the level of contact for both product capability,
conversation, relationship, partnership and, in fact, even testing for both new prospects and enterprise

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

and campus will be challenging. And nobody is in the building to upgrade their campus either. So the
COVID-19 will definitely delay our enterprise cycles for new prospects, but should be okay for new projects
with familiar customers.

Operator

Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Alexander Kurtz
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes. And glad everyone is safe and healthy over at Arista. I just wanted to follow up, Jayshree, on your
commentary from the beginning of the call. You said you're planning to run the business versus 2018
levels. I assume that's an OpEx comment? Or is it an OpEx comment that also maybe relates to where you
think revenue could kind of pencil out at the end of the year?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, Alex, first of all, I think we have -- we understand the first half better than the second half. So
please take this with a grain of unknown and uncertainty in everything. And I know CEOs are supposed to
know everything, but I can honestly tell you, we don't know much about the second half. So what we're
doing is controlling what we can control. And what Ita and I can control is the business and the expense
more than the top line for the year. And Ita, you want to add more to that?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. I mean, I think, Alex, it's a focus on just OpEx and investment levels until we understand better kind
of what the rest of the year -- how the rest of the year plays out, right? And so you should expect to see
us kind of cut back on some of the variable expenses, et cetera, and come back to spending that looks
similar to where we were for 2018. And then as things unfold, we can change that, right? But for now,
that's the focus.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

And Ita and I want to reiterate something. We will absolutely continue pedal to the metal, invest in key
R&D and customer support. We will reduce marketing travel, obviously, since we can't travel and perhaps
some IT spending. And so we work on what we can control and manage the business. And if it improves,
we'll certainly recalibrate and invest more.

Alexander Kurtz
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I appreciate that. And Ita, just on the 40% comment on cloud titan mix year-to-date, obviously, it would
be helpful to have the year-over-year comp if you're willing to give that.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. I think in the investor deck, we've put some trends around what the split has been and how it's
looked, and we put a range in there for kind of how it played out during the year, right, during the past
year, right? So the investor deck is looking at a trend over the prior year, and then Jayshree's commentary
is more short term. So I think that gives you a range to work with.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

And we put a special slide for you guys, Slide 15, I think it is, Curtis, right?

So that's in your honor.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair.

Jason Noah Ader
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Just really 2 quick ones, I promise, are going to be very quick. Number one, is it correct that cloud
outperformed in Q1 versus expectations in enterprise underperformed? And then secondly, Jayshree, can
you comment on your campus time line of the $100 million? Is that pushed out now?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Okay, Jason. I think both cloud and enterprise performed as we expected in Q1. We -- if there was a
theme in Q1, which becomes a stronger theme in Q2, I would say supply constraints in supply chain.
Our verticals were pretty normal as expected. In terms of campus time lines, we are on target. We are
committed to $100 million revenue in the first 4 quarters that ends Q2 2020. No change there. But we
do expect that the acceleration, I would have personally liked to see beyond that, in the second and third
year, we now have to wait and see due to COVID.

Operator

Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.

Ittai Kidron
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Congrats. And I must say you're very brave to offer a second quarter guidance. So I hope it works out. Let
me see. A couple of questions for me. First of all, on the supply chain, can you tell us how much revenues
spilled over from 1Q into 2Q because of that so we can understand the true run rate of your business? In
2Q -- and again, going back to Alex's question on the 20 -- 2018 investment levels. Ita, just to fine-tune
this, does that mean total OpEx 2020 equals total OpEx in '18? Or is this a run rate comment? I just want
to make sure I appropriately capture that modeling-wise.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. I mean, I think as we sit here today, we would say we're managing it to an overall plus or minus 2018
total OpEx number, right? And again, obviously, as we know more, Ittai, as we go through the year, we'll
continue to address that further. But for now, that's how we're seeing it.

Ittai Kidron
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

And as far as the pushout?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So to answer that question, Ittai, we did our best in Q1, but we got supply-constrained in March. I
think we will be really supply-constrained in Q2. So I do think Q2 is a case of less about demand and more
about supply constraints.

Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.

Simon Matthew Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to sort of visit the question or comment you made regarding the COVID crisis, making it more
challenging to sell new products. I guess what I'm looking for is a better understanding of how much of
your business comes from new customers/new products. And I certainly appreciate you've got 400-gig
products in the pipeline, campus in the pipeline, but I guess what I'm struggling with is the sense that a
lot of the campus was targeting existing customers. So just trying to understand that comment and how
to quantify how that fits into the overall guidance.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Simon. First of all, it's important to understand that our $100 million campus target is $100
million. It's small compared to our overall business. We do believe that we can naturally go into our
existing customers who already know EOS and CloudVision. But as I said last year, we were pleasantly
surprised by the new prospects and interest in campus. So in a non-COVID environment, I would have
expected 60% existing customers and 40% new prospects. In the current environment, I think we're
going to go back to a comfort level where our familiar customers are more likely to spend with us, and
our new prospects will take time. So it'll probably be 70%, maybe even higher, on familiar and existing
customers in 2020, which was not the trend we were on Q4 last year.

Simon Matthew Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And the implications for 400-gig, has that split out as well?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

No. Okay. So I was answering your campus question. What was your question on 400-gig again?

Simon Matthew Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Well, I guess, broadly speaking, I think of new, including campus and 400 gig. So I just want to get a
sense of how you see the timing of the 400-gig market, if that has split out versus your prior expectation.
And if so, when?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So first of all, 400-gig, we believe, is truly for our high-end enterprises, semi providers cloud, and
very, very high-end enterprise, quite the opposite of campus. And as we said before, we expect early 400-
gig trials will be in the late 2020 time frame. And actually, material production, general availability due to
low cost, lack of cost-effective 400-gig optics and even some of the COVID issues will be in 2021. Nothing
has really changed that, but we continue to see that.

Now we did have some exciting product announcements. In 400-gig, we introduced the Arista OSFP line
card, which is really a low power, high -- a highly compact, pluggable OSFP form factor for simplifying
DWDM for distances up to 120 kilometers. We also demonstrated interoperability with Ciena with
their most dense and spectrally efficient 400-gig and Arista Switch. So our 400-gig trials definitely are
continuing with existing customers and cloud titans. But as we've always said, we expect -- just to put
this in context for you, in Q4, the number of 400-gig ports according to market researchers is 5,000 ports.
However, the 100-gig ports was several millions. So there's 1,000x magnitude difference between the two,
and I don't think that's going to change in the near term.

Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet.

Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

Yes. I was wondering if you could help us understand the nature of the demand change over the course
of the quarter and into April, just so that we get a little better sense of how you were thinking about the
second quarter developing. Is it going to end strongly? Or is it improving through the quarter? That type
of thing.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So I think we have yet to experience the full impact of COVID-19. I think we'll see much more of
that in the second half. So if I look at Q1, we experienced it at the tail end, mostly in terms of our supply
chain. And if I look at Q2, we'll still be very supply chain-constrained. So I think we understand Q1 and Q2
better, and both of them were -- Q1, as you know, is seasonally a slow quarter for us. It really picks up
steam in March, and we couldn't pick up enough steam because we couldn't ship enough. And that theme
is going to continue into Q2. So Q2 is all about shipments. We do see, as we said, good strength in the
cloud titans, and we see reasonable demand in Q2, but I think our real worry is second half.

Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

Okay. Are you able to share with us kind of a loose dollar range for how much the supply constraints you
think are affecting you in either the first or the second quarter?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think the first quarter is done, but you can tell, we projected lower than consensus. You can count
all of that and more as supply chain-related.

Ita M. Brennan

Yes. I mean, I think, Jeff, if you look at where we came out for the first quarter on revenue versus our

Question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Kind of a different way of maybe asking the same question again. But I'm curious of how you think about
the demand profile from the cloud guys. We're seeing industry reports talking about pretty healthy server
demand at several of these public cloud vendors. We've seen the numbers from Microsoft and others. And
what kind of the lag effect you see between server footprint deployments or expansion versus actually
pulling more network bandwidth means and, obviously, a benefit for Arista?

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

First of all, we do see cloud titan use case demand in basically 3 areas: either our customers are adding
additional core or spine capability; or they're expanding racks to increase their server density; or, in some
cases, we're also seeing some geo expansion for their international needs, although some of them have
been ordered from the United States, increasing our U.S. titan contribution. So I think the use cases for us
is very, very clear. What we also see is that because we have long lead times that Anshul and the team are
working very closely on really understanding and sharpening their forecast and timing and working with
us on scenarios and contingencies. So I think when they are starting to look at their 2020 deployments,
they're not just looking at Q1, Q2, they try to give us visibility for the second half as well. And so while
we have not factored any of that into our Q1 or Q2 forecast, we are seeing them doing some very prudent
planning and for business continuity in their 2020 time frame. Anshul...

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And if I heard you -- I'm sorry.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Sorry. Go ahead. Anshul, would you like to add some more to that?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Absolutely. I know there's been a lot of commentary about other components that go into the cloud where
there's compute, other pieces and so on. And it's hard to correlate one-for-one, especially in this time
frame. Because some of the spike in those other components is coming of shortages in previous quarters,
if you remember that. As a result of that, there might be some volatility, and you'll some spike-up on
compute and so on. Networking has been stable. As Jayshree mentioned, we saw constraints towards the
end of Q1 here, but prior to that, things were stable. So they were not short on networking gear and so
on.

I do want to add one last comment on the traffic needs, and there's a lot of commentary on the street
on how traffic is growing and spiking up and work from home and so on. We have to keep those trends
in mind relative to the overall cloud capacity. And yes, working from home means you may need
videoconferencing or phone calls or edge connectivity. But that's a very small fraction of the overall cloud
spend in the broader markets. So yes, sometimes traffic quadrupled or grew 7x in certain regions, but
that's less than a 1% impact to the overall spend. So I would say there's some hyper on that rather than
material impact to us. But as everyone mentioned, things in the cloud are stable, and now we'll focus on
second half with them.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And that's a great answer. Stable, meaning you expect the full year to be stable for cloud versus
previously saying it would be meaningfully down?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

As was mentioned, yes.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Like we said, Aaron, we said we expect the cloud to be flat year over -- flattish year-over-year.

Yes. And just to clarify before we get all wrapped on the revenue deferred thing again, when we're talking
about these commentaries around the business and the trends of the business, and then, obviously, we
still have to deal with the deferred after that, right? But it is an improvement from -- we had talked about
the business being flat to down, and now we're saying we think it's stable in that context. And then the
deferred is additive to that afterwards, right?

Your next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities.

Ryan Boyer Koontz
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

If I could ask about the service provider segment. It's been somewhat of a laggard. And are there any
kind of new strategies or products that you guys are rolling out? Or is there a different sales motion that
you think is going to invigorate that segment?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, thank you for that. We have been marching towards more and more product capability. In
fact, we just introduced EOS software release, 4.20.4, very targeted towards cloud-grade routing and
service provider peering use cases with a single EVPN control plane and segment routing and MPLS on the
data plane, just a chalk full of features, BGP, flow aware transport label, MPLS, segment routing, traffic
engineering. What I can tell you is we're getting richer and richer in our product capability. But what I can
also tell you is service providers take time to operationalize these things in their network. We are doing
okay in our already existing service provider customers, and we are starting to win some small Tier 2 and
Tier 3 ones, small ones, but too early to call and too early to say much more about it.

Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP.

Erik Loren Suppiger
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

Can you just discuss how the large enterprise accounts are getting impacted by COVID-19? Is it a sales
execution issue where calling on the customer is the challenge? Or is it actually a personnel issue where
they've got people staying at home and not in the data centers deploying servers and switches? Or where
is the disruption most impacting?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

So Erik, I would classify it in 2 ways. I think the large enterprises that are already intimate with Arista
and need to make incremental enhancements, we're okay. They're familiar with us. They know how to
work with us. We're supporting them. They are our systems engineering team, led by Ashwin. Our sales
team led by Chris Schmidt have tremendous amount of engagement with our existing customers, right?
So I don't see a dramatic change yet in sales engagement or product differentiation. Where I do see
difficulty is prospects. So we're having a tremendous amount -- we have been having a tremendous
amount of new customer logos. And our new customer logos continue to be healthy and we gather steam,
especially internationally, where we have 60% of our new customer logos come in. However, to convert
them, especially into large deals and large enterprises, requires large proof of concept, number of network
design clinics and, obviously, were slowed down due to the lack of face-to-face. So we're spending more
time with them training, educating than we are able to do in deployment, whereas with our own existing
familiar enterprise customers, we can march forward with more progress.

Meta A. Marshall
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Maybe just one for me. You noted kind of strong behavior out of some of the Tier 2 clouds. But
has there been any change and thought? Or is it just too early as the Tier 2s go forward whether they will
continue to kind of build their own data centers or leverage the public cloud more? And do you expect kind
of this to have any change to that behavior?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Meta, that's a good question. And I said before, it depends on the Tier 2. We know some of the larger
Tier 2s have paused, and it's not that they're going to the public cloud, but they're just pausing their
spending. Others are expanding their data centers, and some of the smaller ones are continuing for their
specialized applications. So it's my belief that they will continue to succeed in their special use cases and
complement the public cloud, but it will be cyclical. They didn't do much of it last year, and I think some
of them are coming back this year. And what we are seeing is the specialty clouds are realizing that some
of the workloads, they can control better, and some belong in the public cloud. So I don't -- I think they'll
continue to have a place. And in fact, a good example of that was content delivery network guide. We saw
improved traction with the CDN customers, and there's some real-time streaming and content delivery,
particularly with work from home. With the millions of users and the aggregates of 4K and 8K flows, you
can see why they would make some important investments there.

Your next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street.

Pierre C. Ferragu
New Street Research LLP

One more on cloud. So on this perspective that you'll have flat revenues between this year and last
year, I was wondering how your mix is going to -- you see your mix evolving. And a couple of things I
have in mind is what you sell at the lower end of the [ hierarchy in access ], server access at the lease
level versus things you sell higher in -- for DCI, for the universal spine. And also -- or maybe another
way to look at the split would be Tomahawk-based products versus Jericho-based product. Do you see a
significant evolution in that mix between this year and last year?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Pierre. I would say a short answer is no. We've always had a very nice mix of value products
with the Tomahawk and Trident family connecting to servers -- sorry, the volume product. And then the
value products with the Jericho family with the 7280 and 7500 flagship. So depending on the use cases,
customers offer both. They're both very, very popular products, and both are currently -- challenge the
lead times as well. It's not so much that we're seeing a change in product mix. I would say the biggest
change we're seeing is people are doubling down on 100-gig, and 400-gig is getting pushed out next year
in the cloud. That's probably the big shift.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Jayshree, I'm curious with the supply constraints that are going on right now, if it impacts any one of
the verticals a little bit more than any of the others or it's broad enough that it's kind of having an even
impact across the group. And then, Ita, just sort of as a follow-up to that. You sold a bit out of inventory,
I'm guessing, because you couldn't bring some other stuff in. Is that something that likely occurs again
here in the second quarter?

Yes. Maybe let me take that first. I mean, that's kind of -- that's a onetime thing where when things are
constrained, it's a good opportunity to go look at what you have in inventory and sell some stuff that
maybe we haven't thought we would. But I think we're through most of that now. So that's why I think
the guide for gross margin comes back to the typical 63% to 65%, and then it will just be driven more by
customer mix than anything else. Right.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And John, to answer your question on our extended lead times, I'm not sure we saw a trend on
verticals. What we did see is that our key customers worked very closely with Anshul and Chris and
Ashwin to really sharpen their forecast and timing and work closely with us on their network designs and
what product is available, what's not, when can we ship what to them. And this is -- I hope these are
famous last words, but I hope we can -- John McCool and Christoph and the team are really working hard
to overcome this. And should we improve this in Q3, I think we will have a chance to fulfill a lot of our key
customers' needs and factor that into their 2020 deployment considerations. But I didn't see anything by
vertical. I saw it more by top customers.

Question comes from Sami Badri with Crédit Suisse.

Ahmed Sami Badri
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I was a little bit curious if you could give us a little bit more of maybe an idea on dynamics or just maybe
some observations you've had in 1Q 2020, what's going on in Europe. And are you competing against
different companies? Or are they offering different types of products, at least in the European region,
versus what Arista has to offer? And I know you've made comments that a lot of your customers in the
U.S. want to take you, one also in Europe. But have you seen dynamics change either pre or post COVID
or at least anything going on in 2020 that you could shed light on as an observation?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

No, I think for Arista, because our presence internationally is somewhat new, we are feeling stronger in
terms of our investment in sales in different countries. So country by country, we feel better about Europe
now than we did, say, even a year or 2 ago. What I think is the difference between Europe and the United
States is they don't have the equivalent of cloud titans, and we haven't won major service provider titans.
So we tend to have smaller wins but many customers. And I think that -- but country by country, the level
of engagement, in fact, my -- our entire executive team was at a Europe customer session last -- was
it last November? We were all there. It seems like forever, but it wasn't that long ago. And the level of
intimacy that the team has developed with our customers, especially in the developed countries, Germany,
U.K., France, Middle East, even Israel, has been very strong. So I think the European customer base is
embracing Arista for its differentiation and value add, but we just don't have the size of customers we do
in the U.S.

John Warren Marchetti

Got it. And just maybe competitors, are competitors a little bit different in Europe? Or are you seeing

Ita M. Brennan

right? There's a lot of movement pieces.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter because we have constraints.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess, I was more trying to think, could this help you and maybe size how much it would help you in
the back half of the year when the supply chain bottlenecks alleviated and lead times normalized? But
maybe another way, I guess, maybe if you could help us. Is there a gross margin impact you're dealing
with because of the supply chain constraints is the way to quantify that in the first half of the year?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

I mean, we saw a little bit of incremental spending in Q1, but it was very small. We will see some in Q2,
but again, I think it's manageable at this stage, right? Again, I'd go back to the 63% to 65%, and we'll
be -- the midpoint of that range is a good place to start, and then we'll see how it goes. So there is some
incremental costs because you're prioritizing supply over some other things. But at least in the first half,
we don't see something that's really significant.

Alexander Henderson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Jayshree, I was hoping you could give us some insight into the way enterprise executives are thinking
about conditions, what they're thinking about in terms of how they're approaching spending. You made a
comment that I think is probably accurate, which is you're more concerned about COVID in the back half.
And I assume that's not supply chain-related, it's more demand-related. I would assume that you've done
a lot of calls with top executives at firms. What are they saying to you about the business in process, the
programs that are already in place are getting completed, but maybe the pipeline is falling off as you exit
the second quarter and that their expectations for spending in the back half may be, hard to put it any
other way, sharply constrained?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Right. So Alex, that's a good question. I think our enterprise decision-makers and key executives are
struggling with this once-in-100-year phenomena, just the way we are, right? They all do have 2020 plans
and deadlines, and they would very much like to work with Arista and overcome the supply constraints
to meet them. And I believe they will. I believe they'll also take -- many of them will also take not just a
2020 horizon but a multiyear horizon and start thinking about how to plan for projects in this virtual world.
So we do see some systematic, prudent planning. And while we don't have visibility to that demand, we
don't think demand will be challenged significantly if they plan prudently. Where we think demand will
be challenged, like I said before, is new projects, people unfamiliar with Arista, people who have to do a
lot more testing with Arista, people who love Arista but haven't had a chance yet to get their hands on
it. So that class of enterprise customers may be more comfortable with doing nothing or being as is. But
certainly, the 6,000-plus customers we engage with really, really want to work with us, and we'll continue
to plan their projects this year or next year.

this quarter, but I've got to ask, in terms of the classic question of the risk displacement with the cloud

competitive issues or architectural shifts. In fact, if you look at the recently released market data from

doing that, where we are the #1 market share in 100-gig. And we continue to increase market share into
the high teens for high-performance data center switching. So we are pleased with our progress year after

highlight.

Anshul Sadana

No, Jayshree. And as we've said before, Paul, the level of sort of joint development we continue to do with

competitive environments. That will continue to be so. But there's no major shift that we're expecting.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Actually, this is -- Paul, this is a good time for me to highlight some -- the work Anshul has been doing.
As you know, we have a rich, long history in open networking. And today, Arista just introduced a Switch
Abstraction Interface, working -- so that we can work with our best-of-breed platforms and an abstraction
layer for cloud titans and -- who can now use SONiC on top of our Arista SAI. And this is another example
of the close collaboration Anshul was mentioning.

Paul Jonas Silverstein
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And Jayshree, if I could just follow up. I appreciate the market share comments, but obviously, market
share is exactly looking phenomenon. And so with respect to forward-looking and the risk of displacement,
you all haven't seen or heard anything from those cloud titans that would cause you incremental concern
relative to where you've been historically?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. On one hand, we are always paranoid on concerns. That's our nature, and we should be that way, and

no change in concern or no radical shift in the competitive landscape.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

I was hoping you could step back a little bit and tell us your thoughts, bigger picture, about broader
hyperscale investment. I'm not looking for guidance. I'm just interested how you think about these
customers longer term. The framing for that, near term, we're seeing these kind of material demand
drivers, migration to SaaS, adoption of cloud, need for elastic capacity additions. And in the interim, not
seeing a big change in those growth rates, the demand drivers themselves. So I'm interested how you
think about it longer term. What are the material drivers that kind of accelerate growth rates? Any specific
factors that you think could be meaningful for an acceleration in the broader investment?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Ben. Well, look, I think the greatest acceleration for Arista came when the cloud titans made
a huge migration to a leaf/spine architecture and especially standardized on Arista's EOS for 100-gigabit
universal spine. So -- and then on top of that acceleration, a number of titans co-developed with us, a
joint development focus that allowed them to scale this to distributed data centers all over the region
and all over the cloud. So I think the next acceleration comes from more use cases with 400-gig and

100-gig in tandem with the possibility of expanding their data centers and their server density and their
storage capability. And I don't think that's necessarily this year, but it could be in the next 3 years. So it
would have to be a repeat of how we succeeded in 100-gig at 400-gig levels. Anshul, do you want to add
something more to that?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Ben, the way to look at the cloud and the cloud titans is they started with data centers with compute
and storage and then moved down to different types of apps and are continuing that journey. And the
next phase of investment in this space, in our view, there will be more at the edge. By edge, I don't mean
directly just edge computing, but think of it as an Equinix type of meet-me place. So the cloud companies,
I think, will continue to invest in that area. And then connect that back into the tenant space in their large
data centers. And these networks of different kinds are being built or will continue to be built in the next
few years with different types of overlays and encryption and mapping from 1 tenant space to the other
and so on. I think that's very significant because in the longer picture, if you look at it 5, 10 years from
now, we will look back and say, "Wow, this is how the cloud companies restitched the Internet." And I
think those are some of the most strategic projects in the next few years.

Our next question comes from Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg.

Woo Jin Ho
Bloomberg Intelligence

Longer-term question as it relates to the enterprise. Has the nature of your conversations with your close
enterprise customers changed at all? This may be a little bit premature. And the reason why I ask is, given
that we're at a stay at home, 0-touch environment, one would have to think that the network automation
thesis should start playing out a little bit faster given that no one can get to their networks anymore.
How does that fit into customer conversations today? Do you think that will evolve? And especially given
that you do have Big Switch that provides that enterprise -- hyperscale cloud-like environment to the
enterprise, that might be a positive to you guys in the long term.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No. Woo Jin, you really bring up a good point here. We tend to talk about data center and campus
and all of these different use cases, but our customers are thinking more and more operationally. It's great
to have a box, but how to ignite that box with the right operational capabilities is very, very important.
And so when you look at it, you're absolutely right, day 0, day 1, day 2, 0-touch automation, 1 click for
the campus, data center, huge topic. The other one, and this is why we bought Big Switch, is not only
are we igniting real-time streaming telemetry and cloud vision, but we're really extending that into the
observability and network packet broker space. And they're very pleased with the sort of sum of Data
ANalyZer, CloudVision and now Big Fish to extend our DANZ monitoring fabric. So that trio or combination
is going to be very important for deeper telemetry. So our enterprise conversations are going beyond
best-of-breed platforms to much more operational automation, analytics, availability and, in the future,
security and segmentation as well.

So just a follow-on on that. Are these conversations that you've been having that's been ongoing for
quite some time now? Or does the -- I guess, the pandemic crisis accelerate that and potentially force

customers to make a left turn in they're purchasing decisions or their architectural decisions, causing
purchasing delays?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's too early to say it because of the pandemic. They were going on anyway, but I think the
importance of them becomes greater if the pandemic continues longer. Right now, I think we're getting
more hammered on supply chain, but if we overcome that, I think we'll get much more on automation and
analytics.

Again, just a couple. One for you, Jayshree, and one for you, Ita. Jayshree, do you get a sense of if there
was any business activity in the quarter that was just a pull-in from second half plans into the first half
given the effects of work from home that some customers are so pressured that they had to respond to
quickly and did it by pulling in budgets? And for you, Ita, on the 2018 OpEx comment, I understand T&E,
you're clearly saving a lot of money there. But are there headcount reductions planned as well or this is
just less marketing, less travel, you're not flying business anymore? How do I think about that?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. I mean, I'll take that one first, maybe just -- yes. No. I think we are preserving kind of employee
talent. That's probably our most important resource, and we're definitely focused on doing that. And
really, we're looking at other areas, other more variable expenses, onetime-type expenses that we can
manage, hopefully, in a near-term window and preserve kind of employees and the talent base.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

And the short answer, Ittai, to your question is we did not experience pull-ins in Q1.

Curtis McKee
Head of Corporate & Investor Development

additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investors section of our website.
