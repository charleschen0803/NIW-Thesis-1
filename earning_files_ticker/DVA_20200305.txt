Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. My name is Kath, and I will be your conference facilitator today.
At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator
Instructions]

Mr. Gustafson, you may now begin your conference.

Jim Gustafson
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued
interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me remotely
today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice
President.

Please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties
that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter
earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and
subsequent quarterly report for the first quarter of 2020 on Form 10-Q, which will be filed today. Our
forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and
undertake no duty to update these statements.

Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial
measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is
included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.

I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you and your families are healthy. Let me
begin by expressing my sincere appreciation for the 65,000 nurses, patient care technicians, social
workers, dietitians and other caregivers worldwide, including many nonclinical workers, who are on the
front lines of care with our physician partners. These people are living up to the meaning of DaVita, which
is to give life during this global crisis. Their courage and dedication to helping others is a source of energy
and inspiration.

I want to extend that gratitude to all health care organizations and caregivers around the world.

For today's call, I'll discuss 3 topics: our response to the crisis; the impact of COVID on our business; and
our decisions relating to the Cares Act. At Capital Markets, I talked about the strength of our platform and
our ability to provide continuity of care to dialysis patients across all sites of care from the hospitals, the
patients' home and in our clinic. Our response to COVID highlights the resilience and the strength of our
teammates and demonstrates the power of connecting to multisite platform.

Let me give you a few examples to bring it to light. First, we're leveraging our national scale with the
resources, teams and our geographic footprint to open and operate dedicated clinics and shift to dialysis
patients, who are or suspected to be COVID positive, which has helped to free up precious hospital
resources. The dialysis industry, in partnership with the government, has joined together to help maintain
continuity of care for dialysis patients by creating isolated cohort capacity that can be accessed by other
providers.

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Next, our position as a national leader in home dialysis who serve our patients well by supporting
continued growth of home dialysis during this crisis is helping to provide continuity of care for all of our
patients as they may have moved between dialyze in home, in hospitals or in center due to the virus. In
addition, we've been able to utilize our leading telehealth capabilities to allow us to expand the treatment
of our patients in the safety of their home, while maintaining access to their care provider team. With the
support of the government, we're now using that telehealth platform to provide further support for in-
center patient care. Finally, in our over 900 hospitals where we deliver key services, we've been able to
allocate resources and shift caregivers to areas that most need to help support patients and our hospital
partners.

Next, let me address some of the trends we're seeing, while covering the expectations for the short and
long-term business impacts of COVID. On the thread of the virus, we're experiencing similar geographic
waves of COVID impact as you've read about in the news. Initially, the CDC wanted all COVID positive
patients treated in the hospital. As the pandemic spread, however, the CDC quickly recognized this was
not possible and turned to providers like DaVita, who've been able to focus on infection control well before
COVID to alleviate the burden from the hospitals and to treat stable patients in an outpatient setting.
Today, nearly 70% of DaVita patients who are either COVID positive or suspected to be COVID positive,
are treated in one of our outpatient settings.

The operational task of maintaining treatment 3x a week of these COVID positive or suspected to be
patients on cohort [ state ] and clinics has been nothing short of extraordinary, all while maintaining
continuity of care to over 230,000 patients who show no symptoms of the virus but are at risk with
multiple other comorbidities.

The near-term impact on our business is still dynamic and somewhat uncertain. However, we're able
to affirm our guidance for 2020 at this time. This may be in contrast to what you've heard from other
providers, who may be facing volume or liquidity issues due to the significant drop-off on elective
procedures. As you know, dialysis is not optional, it is life sustaining treatment that our patients need
multiple times each week. The long-term is where we have less visibility. We believe the economic
impact of COVID on our business will lag the impact of the broader economy. The scope of the impact of
COVID on our business will be based primarily on the duration of this devastating virus and its impact on
unemployment generally. We expect that these factors would have the greatest impact on volume and
mix. Volume, as the growth of dialysis population is more uncertain due to the potential impact from the
virus on the late-stage CKD population and on the health status of our existing ESRD patients. And on
commercial mix, because the insurance mix of our patients could be negatively impacted by a weakening
of the broader economy.

Next, I want to nod the administration's quick response in this time of crisis. The administration
collaborated with the dialysis industry by modifying certain policies and regulations to facilitate our ability
to treat COVID-positive patients in cohort [ state ] or clinics were necessary. The administration also
acted swiftly by distributing funds to health care providers in an effort to ensure that patients, uninsured
and insured, have access to the care they need during this time of crisis. We believe that the spirit and
the intent of the government's action with the relief fund was to prevent health care providers from
closing their doors, not to help a company make their earnings target. DaVita has been and will be able
to continue to provide care for our patients, including the uninsured, without the need for this federal
funding. As a result, although we have incurred costs that fall within the parameters of the release fund
under the Cares Act, DaVita has decided not to accept this government financial support at this time. We
believe that it's in the best interest of our company, shareholders and our countries to allow these dollars
to be redistributed to other individuals, organizations or health care providers that truly need it.

ESG has been an increased focus over the last year, and doing the right thing matters. In our opinion, the
current health care crisis is an opportunity for companies to lead and contribute for the greater good of
society, and we are happy to do our part.

Let me conclude with a comment on DaVita's culture. In this crisis, the fact that our frontline caregivers
know that they're part of something bigger, [ to feel it ], has been a key part of our resilience. They are
true heroes, and they know that our entire company, or as we say, our village, is doing what we can to

support them. We know we still have an unpredictable future with this virus but we're thankful that we're
village strong.

Now on to Joel to provide an update on our Q1 results and to discuss our financial outlook.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Javier. I want to start by thanking all of our teammates who selflessly provide life sustaining
dialysis care to our vulnerable patients. I am proud to be a part of the DaVita Village.

Q1 was a strong quarter with relatively little impact from COVID. The details are in the press release, and
I can answer any questions during Q&A. I'll focus my remarks on financial details related to COVID. To
start, the level of uncertainty that we face going forward is significantly higher than usual. The factors
driving this include the severity and duration of the COVID pandemic, the impact on our patient population
resulting in a potential decrease in treatment volume and the impact on unemployment and commercial
health insurance coverage.

As a result of this uncertainty, financial outcomes are harder to forecast than usual, and the range of
possibilities is wider than usual. Our treatment volumes have remained fairly steady so far. For the
rest of 2020, we expect volumes will be impacted by any changes in mortality, transplant and/or new
patient admits resulting from COVID. On expenses, we're incurring elevated costs as a result of additional
compensation and reimbursement for certain of our teammates to help off some of the personal financial
impacts of the crisis, enhancements to our overtime PTO and benefit policies, the creation of dedicated
shifts to care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID, redistribution of teammates, machines and
supplies across the country, labor hours needed to screen patients and teammates who enter our clinics,
increased purchases and pricing of personal protective equipment for patients and teammates, higher
investments in and utilization of telehealth and development of educational materials for patients. Access
to these expenses could include the suspension or sequestration beginning May 1, which we expect to add
about $50 million to our revenue in 2020 as well as other cost reductions in our business.

At this time, we're maintaining our 2020 guidance ranges for adjusted earnings per share, revenue,
operating income margins and free cash flow, but recognize the increased uncertainty given the rapidly
changing dynamics related to COVID.

The longer-term impact of COVID is uncertain and difficult to quantify. We believe that the 2 main factors
to consider are growth and mix. First on growth, our long-term growth could be impacted by changes
in mortality in both the late-stage CKD and ESRD population due to COVID. This will depend primarily
on the infection rates, base fatality rates and age and health status of the patients affected. Second,
increased unemployment levels will likely lead to fewer patients having commercial insurance, which
creates earnings headwinds because of the higher reimbursement rates we received from commercial
insurance plans. We can't predict the net impact at this time but I will highlight 4 important dynamics.

First, when you consider the sensitivity of our business through a recession, we believe that the peak
level of unemployment matters more than the shape of the recovery. But many of our patients have a
preference to retain coverage in the near-term but may be slower to return to work in a recovery. Second,
when estimating the peak unemployment, it's important to recognize that a large number of individuals
currently included in unemployment numbers are actually furloughed and are still receiving health
benefits from employers. Those furloughed patients who eventually return to work may not face any
disruptions in coverage. Third, a significant number of our commercially insured patients have coverage
that is not tied to their current employment. This includes patients with individual insurance as well as
patients on COBRA. This should help mitigate the potential change in our mix relative to the increase in
unemployment.

Finally, if our patients lose their employer-based coverage, they have several coverage options, including
exchange plans where many patients can access tax credit and cost-sharing reductions, which was not
available as we came out of the 2008 recession, COBRA and Medicare and/or Medicaid.

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Looking at our balance sheet and cash generation, at this time, we do not see material near-term negative
impact from COVID. Out of an abundance of caution, in March, we drew down $500 million from our
revolving credit line, which is reflected on our first quarter ending balance sheet. Given our current
cash balance and near-term outlook, we expect to repay the revolver shortly. We also suspended share
repurchases in March and have not repurchased any stock subsequently. In the near term, we expect to
use caution with regards to capital deployment and we'll look to preserve financial flexibility and liquidity
in the face of current uncertainties. We believe that our cash flow generation and our balance sheet put
us in a solid position to weather financial and operational challenges brought on by the current pandemic.
This will allow us to continue to focus on what is most important, the health and safety of our teammates
and delivering high-quality care to our patients.
With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] All right, speakers, our first question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Appreciate all the detail. A few things here. One, obviously, a really good first quarter. I was hoping you
can kind of walk us through what you saw relative to your own kind of internal expectations there? And
maybe delineate what you think core growth was versus kind of any items we should think about?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. So let me take that. Hello, Justin, it's Joel here. I'd call out 3 things, although I would say it was
broadly a strong quarter across many dimensions in terms of what stood out. One, RPT was a bit higher
than expected, although not in a way that would lead me to change any of my views about the full year.
Second, costs were well-managed very broadly, I'd highlight productivity, pharma. G&A is 3 things,
although it was a broad strength. And finally, international was a strong contributor. Part of that was
strong fundamental growth. International just had a good quarter, but I would highlight there was about
$10 million of foreign exchange gain in our -- from our Asia joint venture that is nonrecurring.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's helpful. So you talked about RPT being a bit higher than expected, but not in a way to change the
views on the full year. Was there something that we should think about that benefit of the quarter that
doesn't reoccur? Anything particular?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Nothing in particular. The RPT number will bounce around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. So nothing
worth highlighting.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

And the cost side, I mean, again, like I'm getting -- you guys have a core growth number that you kind of
think about, ex moving parts? Because I'm getting something in the teens.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Well, I think it's a tricky quarter. Are you thinking Q1-over-Q1?

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes, year-over-year.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Yes. Well, Q1 last year was not a particularly strong quarter and then Q2 came on well. So there is
-- I'd say there was some variability there. This year, the typical quarterly seasonality is going to be a
little turned on its head. Usually, Q1 is a weak quarter. This year, you've got the positive calcimimetics and
then in the back half of the year, you'll see some negatives from valid initiatives and as the COVID impact

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

grows. So I think, as you think about a full year number, the margin you're calculating there is -- or the
growth rate you're calculating there is something that I would be hesitant to focus on.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then before I jump back in the queue, can you give us that calcimimetics benefit in the impact
in the first quarter, maybe both the RPT and to operating income? And then it looks like the number has
been cut in the second quarter by CMS. So how should we think about that for the rest of the year?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. So I'd say for the full year, I wouldn't -- I don't -- I wouldn't change anything we've said about
calcimimetics, which is $40 million to $70 million of OI for the full year. The Q1 number was $35 million
of OI benefit. The RPT numbers, I'm looking for those, the RPT number was $9.50 in Q1 and the cost per
treatment, $4.90 and change. So $9.56 of RPT, $4.94 of cost per treatment.

Operator

Our next question is from Andrew Mok of Barclays.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wanted to follow-up on the commercial rates. Looking back at the last recession, it looks like your
commercial revenue mix held up better than your commercial treatment mix. Is that something that could
play out again through potentially higher negotiated rates on a lower base of commercial patients? Should
we see more permanent job losses?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Let me grab that one, Andrew. I think it's difficult to compare. At the end of the last recession, of course,
we had a different dynamic going on. This one is very, very unique. And so we have, number one, as Joel
said, we now have the exchanges. And so we don't know what's going to happen there and how many
people will pick the exchanges. We still have COBRA and then we still have all of these people that have
been furloughed. And so when you look at this as opposed to the last recession, where we didn't have
a whole bunch of people on what appears to be pause or furloughed for a bit, we don't know how that
dynamic will play out.

Last time, there was not a lot of change in the rate dynamic, meaning the rate dynamics stayed similar to
what it had been in the past. And I have no information to inform that, that would change.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up question on...

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Does that answer your question?

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes, that's good. Just a follow-up question on home dialysis. Are you seeing any uptick in interest within
your patients to pursue home therapy? And second, longer term, do you think this crisis will potentially
accelerate the shift to home dialysis?

Javier J. Rodriguez

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

CEO & Executive Director

Yes. It's an interesting dynamic. Many people are asking that same question. For now, and again, it is
so early in this that we don't know what the long-term implications are, but for now, we saw a slight
downtick, so a little weakness. But then when you look at it, it's the placement of catheters that really
impacted it. And then once the administration deem it essential, that started to pick up. In addition, as
we talked about it, our platform really matters, meaning that there's a lot of patients that start in center
and then through education, go home. Well, we saw that, that number went down a bit because we didn't
have a lot of educators and nonessential personnel in the centers so we would not spread the virus. So
therefore, we had less of our patients in-center move home. And so when you add it all together, there's
still a lot of energy. We reached our 25,000-patient mark at home. And we think that over time, we will go
back to the patterns that we saw pre-COVID, which is roughly 10% or so growth.

Operator

Speakers, our next question is from Kevin from Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. I guess, I wanted to ask about the -- you guys announced kind of a big hiring push earlier in the
year. And you guys obviously highlighted a bunch of potential pressures and uncertainty as the year goes
on, including the impact to the economy. So just trying to understand what the purpose of that, that the
large increase in hiring was and how you thought about taking on additional costs potentially heading into
a recession.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Thanks, Kevin. I think when you think of hiring people, you got to put it into 2 categories. One is
the G&A that gets spread out through all the clinics and then you have the frontline caregivers. And so
what we announced, which was a big hiring, was for frontline caregivers. And so what you're seeing is that
sometimes in times like this, where you've had a nursing shortage and you've had a robust economy that
it's a great opportunity to have a stable workforce. And so that's what you really saw. We had openings
across the country. And so we want to fill them now while there's a lot of people looking for jobs.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. This is more about kind of backfilling open positions than it was about trying to add to fuel growth in
some segment or anything like that?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Correct.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess there's been a lot of press about patients with COVID in the hospital needing more
dialysis. Has that impacted your business in any way, either by managing the hospital outpatient dialysis
clinics themselves or hospitals trying to clear out their dialysis clinics, pushing volume maybe in your
direction? Is there any dynamic there?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

In general, the short answer is that it is lumpy from geography to geography. And so in some geographies
where the hospitals, because of all the elective procedures, have seen a big decrease in census. Our acute
have seen that as well if COVID hasn't hit that area. Of course, there are other areas where COVID is quite

10

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

active, where we have seen an increase. But when you net it all out, it is nothing that you would notice in
the economic model, if that's what you're asking?

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. No, it's perfect. And then you mentioned a number of the headwinds around the recession. Any
offsets that you can think of? I guess, you kind of mentioned labor might be easier to come by in a
recession. How do you think about the cost save opportunity versus the potential revenue pressures on
the recession?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Joel, you want to grab it?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. So yes, I think there are really 2 ways to think about the cost mitigation, and it really comes in 2
buckets. One is what you would expect to naturally occur in the context of a recession, which could be
higher productivity because of lower turnover, lower training costs, other things related to salary, wage
and benefit. So that would be one bucket. And then second is the levers we could pull proactively to take
costs out of the business, recognizing that if there is mix pressure or volume pressure that we have things
we can do. We've got a resilient business model. So there are actions we could take to mitigate some of
those pressures as well. So there's a natural component to it and a proactive component as well.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I mean do we read anything in the fact that you kind of mentioned the headwinds without kind of these
offsets? Would you expect that during the recession, you would grow maybe below the normal range of OI
growth? Or could you still grow within that range during recession?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I would say it is too early to tell. There's just so much we don't know yet about how this recession is likely
to play out in terms of what the peak job loss will look like, how much of that is true job loss versus just
furloughs, how this will roll forward? And how much of we could mitigate when we think about mix. So I
would say it's too early to tell how much of that we'd be able to mitigate from a cost standpoint.

Operator

Speakers, our next question is from Whit Mayo of UBS.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to follow-up on Kevin's hospital question. I mean that's a business that you guys have
had some remarkable growth in, in recent years. I don't think the number of hospitals that you provide
coverage has changed, but the revenue associated with those has been double digits for many years. Can
you maybe just talk a little bit about some of the factors driving that and how you contract with hospitals?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Sure. I'll try to give you a little color and see. In general, that business is a very tough business because
of the cyclicality, meaning up and down in the demand of the hospitals, 24/7. So it is a very hard business
to enter. And so this is a place where our platform really shines, and the hospitals see the value of having
the network and having the float pools where you can actually have the team to take care of the patient.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

So what we've seen is that a lot of hospitals value our value proposition. And of course, that would be
included in the price and the service. And so we've seen that platform grow in a significant way.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. So I mean, as I look at the number of hospitals, I mean if there's 900 and you're growing revenue
13%, I mean, is that the way to think about the organic growth of that business?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Joel, can you break down the revenue and the price? Or is that not something we want to disclose?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. Yes. It's not something we disclose, but it has been a faster-growing business than the core
business, although very small, and I would add, it tends to be a lower-margin business as well.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. I had another question on calcimimetics. And then a lot of the data is showing a progressive, I
think, uptick in Parsabiv use over Sensipar, and the ASP is much higher versus Sensipar. Can you maybe
refresh us just the economics between the 2 and what your split is today?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I don't think we've broken out that split specifically. In -- as you look at the spike that we've seen in
calcimimetics profitability starting in 2 years ago and then last year and this year, it's driven largely by
the oral and the gap, as you know, between how ASP declines and how our pricing declines. I think, as
we think about it going forward, obviously, as we're -- as the [ tobacco ] period is coming to an end,
the profitability of calcimimetics is going away. I think the important question for us is 2021. And the
issue between the oral genetic and the IV is how does the bundling work? And how will CMS reimburse
us and what -- is it by drug, by patient or some other methodology, and that's really what will drive the
economics.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

And a quick reminder on that, Whit, that the physicians pick whether it is IV or oral, and so at the end
of the day, they might have a preference. Right now, there isn't much data, and we know that the IV is
a lot more expensive. So the physicians are feeling their fiduciary responsibility to do what's clinically
equivalent or appears to be equivalent -- clinical equivalent at a much cheaper price.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe just one last one back to just the comments on volumes and trying
to think about what the impact of COVID will be on this patient population. And Javier, you mentioned
looking at some of the CKD stage 4, 5 patients. And obviously, there's going to be an impact on your
census today. I don't know maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more on kind of how you're
thinking about what the longer-term impact can be from COVID-19 on the ESRD population?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Sure. And I'll try to be as helpful as I can Whit, but as you can imagine, there's just a lot of dynamics,
and it's pretty early in the game. So the first and probably the biggest disclosure is, it all depends on the

duration and the severity of the virus. And of course, if we have another wave and all those sort of things.
But if you assume that there isn't going to be another wave just for the argument and to be an optimist
here, you have to start to look at, okay, did the virus actually impact CKD patients that would have been
on dialysis? And if so, how much and what magnitude?

Two is, if you were going to look at something that could increase volumes is did the virus actually do
damage to people that wouldn't have had some kidney damage. And so that is too early to tell. On the
other side, of course, the preferred kidney replacement therapy would be a transplant. And if you're going
to put a transplant into categories, there was the living donors and the deceased donors. And what we're
seeing right now, while the virus is active, is that the living donors are coming down because of the risk of
infection. And so there would be some potential changes in those numbers that would increase volume of
dialysis patients. So those are some of the gives and takes that are going on. We don't know how it will all
net out. And so we're keeping a close eye on it.

Operator

Speakers, our next question is from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

A few ones here. Productivity was strong in the quarter. Can you talk about for the drivers of productivity?
Was it consolidation and closing of centers from last year? It sounds like it wasn't a shift to PD or home
therapies. So what other factors led to increased productivity?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Nothing specific I would highlight, other than it's obviously, labor is our largest cost item. It's
something we spend a lot of time focusing on. And it's just something we need to manage well over the
long-term in order to deal with the fact that our RPT increases are below inflation. So it's just blocking and
tackling that we just continue to excel at.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. From COBRA benefits, have there been any changes to COBRA benefits in terms of the length
people to stay on COBRA versus the prior recessions?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

My understanding is that, I don't know of any COBRA expansion, but our patient population can add 11
months because of disability. So there's a disability extension. And so in essence, our patient population
could have coverage for 29 months. I do not know if there's a COVID exception.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. There is a lot of the uncertainty from a macro perspective at this point. As we move into sort of
2021, what's the impact that a Medicare Advantage can provide to your patients who are looking to reduce
out-of-pocket costs? And can sort of the uncertainty sort of add or fuel more people adopting Medicare
Advantage, do you think at this point?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Well, there's a lot of different views on your question. And at the end of the day, it is just speculation
because we don't know. It is a very individual and personal decision. But in general, the reason why
people would pick MA is because it has a max out of pocket, and it has some additional benefits. And
the reason why people would stay in Medicare is because they're used to it. It has basically almost an

unlimited network, if you will, it doesn't have the restrictions. If you have secondary coverage, it really
helps you in your out-of-pocket expenses. And so what we've said in the past, and we continue to say, is
that we don't have any information that would lead us to conclude anything other than our population will
likely mirror that of the general population. The only reason why we are so different is because this is the
only population that wasn't allowed to enroll in Medicare Advantage. So the only people that are there are
the ones that enrolled pre their kidneys failing. And so there's going to be open enrollment. And now the
question is, what will be the environment in the fall? Will patients be able to sit with someone? Will they
have a website? Will they be more nervous, more fatigued? Is the virus still with us? Or are we in a more
normal situation? And the short answer is we don't know any of that. So I'm just giving you the data of
how someone would pick one versus another.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. And then so last question here, just from a modeling perspective, you walked through a bunch of
costs which will roll through for 2Q. Is there any way that there's some dollar value that you can add? And
how much we should be thinking about these new cost being layered in during 2Q?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So Pito, it is really tough to predict, there are a lot of moving pieces. And again, the uncertainty
around length and severity of the pandemic, et cetera, et cetera. I would also note that as we think about
how we've modeled things in the various scenarios we've played with, we've generally assumed that we're
past the peak. We're kind of at or past the peak. We've got a whole bunch -- a whole range around at
what pace the pandemic begins to taper. But we haven't modeled in a second wave. So just as you think
about our guidance and what we're comfortable with, I just wanted to point that out.

In terms of specific numbers, we are thinking the number for April will be somewhere in the $30 million
to $40 million range. I think it's reasonable to expect May will be in the same range and then again,
depending on how the pandemic plays out, we'd expect it to start tapering down.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And actually, last one, I apologize, on share repurchases. Look, you're not taking any of the
government grants at this point. And because to your point, you're viewing this as sort of past the peak at
this point. When do you think that you will consider doing share repurchases again? Is this more of a third
quarter event? Or do you guys walk into June and things are better, you guys begin buying shares back at
that point?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So I can't give you a date because we don't have one. We are certainly going to be cautious with
capital deployment, given all the uncertainty. I think we're likely to keep a higher level of liquidity than we
have in the past. So hard to say when -- how we're going to think about share repurchases going forward
and when some of that caution might relax.

Operator

Our next question is from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just a few. Just to clarify on your last response, Joel, when you said $30 million to $40 million in -- was
that for April and May? Was that additional expense that you were -- additional operating expense you're
just saying is plausible?

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. That would be the incremental operating expense that we would expect related to COVID.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And the decision to return the Cares Act funding, is that decision limited to the first $50 billion that's been
distributed? Have you made a determination about the full $175 billion between the 2 provider funds? Or
is that sort of TBD depending on how things would develop?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

I might be getting lost in the details, so correct me if I'm wrong here, Joel, because I might be
aggregating pools and I'm not, but the Cares Act relief fund is how I have it in my head. And those are the
funds that we decided were the intention of the government, which everybody can interpret in different
ways. But from our perspective, they were a safety net, and they were to be used for people that needed
that money because the economic damage was so severe that they couldn't keep their doors open. And
so while it's -- you can tell from the numbers that Joel gave you, we have big expense increases. And by
the way, the numbers that you cited there, the $30 million to $40 million, is monthly. So we have had big
expenses. We don't think that, that was the intention of the money, so we're going to give that back.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then I saw just a couple of numbers flip in the income statement, Joel. I wonder if you would
comment on -- I know the equity investment income was almost $18 million this quarter, it's higher than
usual, than the other income down by interest expense flipped to a negative $4 million and change. Both
of those looked a little unusual. Anything to call out on those?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. On the equity income, the biggest component of that is the $10 million of FX on the Asia joint venture
that I called out. There is another component to this that relates to the deconsolidation of a few of our
clinics starting 1/1/2020. The details of this will be in the 10-Q. It's got no impact on EPS, but it does
take what was OI and turns it into a -- it turns -- it moves it into equity income. It used to flow through
revenue and cost, and it moves it into equity income, and then there's an offset down at the NCI level. So
those are the big things I'd call out there.

On the other income, there was a different FX loss associated with the international business, and that
was about $9 million. So those are the big things I'd call out.

Operator

Our next question is from Matt of William Blair.

Matthew Richard Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Actually, Javier, I just want to follow-up one more time on the tariff dollars. Obviously, when you
announced the receipt of the grant dollars, I think it was April 13, had said you were contemplating
keeping it. Just curious, was there additional guidance or regulation from the government that influenced
your decision? Or was this a proactive decision by the Board and management? Just trying to understand
from April 13 to today?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Yes. It was the latter, which is a proactive decision by the Board and management. And again, you could
make a very good case to say, the spirit of that was to reimburse high expenses related to COVID, which
we have many, including PPE, additional labor, overtime, and all the things that we've described on the
call. We came on the other side, which is the government, which needs to be totally commended, just
said, we've never had anything like this. And so we're going to distribute money to make sure that the
well-being of Americans is taken care of. And then we'll reconcile. Well, we don't need time to reconcile.
We know that we are not in that spot where we're the safety net. And so we want to be proactive so
that the government gets visibility of those people that can give the money back and that money can
be redeployed as soon as possible to the people that really need it. So it's really about the spirit that we
made the decision.

Matthew Richard Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Yes. Fair enough. And then actually, this -- you had an announcement out this morning about DaVita
Ventures [ DaVita Venture ]. And just curious what if any targets you might have for that group? And just
sort of given the announcement this morning, I want to give you an opportunity to comment on that.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Thank you, Matt. We're really excited about DaVita Ventures [ DaVita Venture ]. And basically, we
have a lot of entrepreneurs that are coming out with all kinds of great things, and they're saying, can we
partner with you? And so this venture group is out there and now really generating demand. And so we
want to be the partner of choice. And as we talked about capital markets, we're expanding from being a
dialysis company to being a full kidney care company. And that means that we're going to need certain
technologies and partners from diagnostic to pharmaceuticals, to other areas in transplant, and so we
want to be out there, and we're really excited about it.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

The only thing I'd add in there is, as you think about the magnitude of these investments, we're thinking
these are likely to be single-digit millions. And if you think about it in the context of our free cash flow, it's
not going to change the number at all. So relatively small.

Operator

Our next question is from Lisa Clive of Bernstein.

Elisabeth Decou Bedell Clive
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Just a question on legislation in Washington. Clearly, D.C. is busy with COVID-19, and that's the main
focus. But do you think the COVID-19 pandemic makes it more likely that the PATIENTS Act could get
passed? Do you have any comments on sort of how live that bill is in Washington today?

And a follow-up question on COBRA, my understanding is even though there is 11-month disability
extension, almost all patients drop out of COBRA at 18 months because after that point, they go from
paying 102% of the premium to 150%. So is it fair to assume that the only ones who stay on COBRA are
the ones that have a [ cap ] premium support?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Let me grab the -- Lisa, first of all, you've exceeded my knowledge of COBRA. And so Joel, I don't know if
you know that technical piece. In the...

16

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

I guess the other way of asking it...

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I do not have the answer.

Elisabeth Decou Bedell Clive
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. I guess the other way of asking it because if we do -- given the unemployment numbers that
we've been seeing across the country, if COBRA becomes a much bigger part of your -- well, if a lot more
patients end up on COBRA. I'm just trying to understand how long they actually will end up on it. So if you
do have any insights into that, that would be helpful.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. I do not. And so -- but we could get back to you, but I do not have any more insights on that, sorry.

But you had a second part of your question, Lisa?

Elisabeth Decou Bedell Clive
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

On the PATIENTS Act, given, yes, just whether the COVID-19 has any impact and also just general
discussions in Washington around that.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Well, I'll just say, in general, I have not had the courage to ask anything because obviously, all hands have
been on deck for this COVID crisis. I'm hopeful that policymakers will see the value of integrated care and
that they will see the power of connecting the sites of care and having this organized fashion really help.
Because if you look at DaVita as an example in how we were organized with PPE and how we were able
to stand up cohorting centers, how we were able to take care of our teammates with child care and other
things, we obviously saw that in other areas, but we did not see that in a lot of the smaller players. And so
we're hopeful that the government sees that resource organization and capabilities around the country is
also quite useful and if you connect the sites of care and the technology, that could benefit the system and
the patients. So we will see post COVID.

Operator

Our next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

I've got a few more here. First, I just wanted to follow-up, Joel, to your answer to Pito's question on costs.
I understand you don't want to give a specific number. But in your prepared remarks, you kind of walked
through there are costs associated with COVID, and you gave us not insignificant new costs in April and
May. You talked about the $50 million benefit from sequestration, and then you also mentioned other cost
reductions. So I'm curious, as you bundle those together, it looks like it's a headwind, ex potentially other
cost reductions. But I'm just trying to think about relative to where you were kind of in February when
you gave the original guide or updated it. How should we think about the net of those impacts? Is that an
additional headwind in your mind? Or can you kind of offset the incremental cost in COVID?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

So the way I'm thinking about it is if you start with a strong performance in the core in Q1, and you offset
that with the COVID costs and then add back sequestration, we kind of feel like -- and then there's some
Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

natural costs that come down, T&E is a simple example of that. We feel like net-net, we wind up with a
potential headwind that we're comfortable absorbing in without changing our guidance. So if you want to
think about how do we get to maintaining our guidance, strong Q1, the negative of COVID offset by the
$50-ish-million from the sequestration suspension and some other cost offsets.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

And can I pin you down in terms of how much better Q1 was versus your internal expectations when you
set the guide for the year?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

No. You cannot pin me down on that.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Then in your 10-Q that you just filed, there were a couple of new investigations of payments that
were out there. I know this is a cost of doing business in dialysis and historically for 20 years, I've been
covering the company, they haven't really amounted to much. But just wanted to ask you if there was
anything new or different that we should consider? And with those and what got reported there, I guess,
in New Jersey and California?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

No. What I would add is, of course, we take them very, very seriously, and we have just been through our
corporate integrity agreement. We've been at it for 5 years, and we continue to want to lead and show the
spirit of compliance and the law of compliance. And so we're disappointed every time we get them. And
of course, they can come through many different ways, including investigations, inquiries. And you hope
that once they see what we're doing that they're satisfied with that. But every time we get them, I can tell
you personally, I am very, very frustrated because we talk and live compliance on a daily basis. So nothing
else to add to that, Justin.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Understood. And then just a couple of numbers questions here. You mentioned the -- that a significant
portion of your commercial patients have coverage that's not tied to employment. I'm just curious if you
could share even just a round number there. Is it half? A quarter? 2/3? Anything like that you can tell us?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So it's -- there are really 2 components to that. There's COBRA and patients who are on the
exchanges. The number is in the kind of 25% to 30%, I believe.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. So 25% to 30% aren't tied to employment?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Right.

18

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Or tied to COBRA and exchanges, okay. And then the first quarter, what would you say the -- or can
you give us a number in terms of what you think the benefit was at the extra day in the quarter for the
operating results?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

No, that -- hold on. I'll get you that number before we hang up.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then just -- and then California AB 290, I know you talked about that being lower than
previous, right? The $25 million to $40 million you originally gave, it's going to be lower. Should we think
about that just be going to 0 now? Or do you think there still could be an impact there?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

As opposed to give you a number, I think what I can tell you is that due to COVID, the injunction stayed.
And so basically, what that means in layman's terms is that there's an extension of the case and so
unlikely to have much of an impact unless -- because of the timing until the fourth quarter depending
how the case goes, and then it might go into Q1 of 2021. So the number is still the same, the timing has
shifted. And of course, the outcome is unknown.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And last one, payer mix in the quarter, Javier, I think you said was down. Can you give us any
specificity there or what you kind of ended the quarter with in terms of commercial mix?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

I believe we published it, so I can say it, right, Joel?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I believe that is not correct. Justin, it -- there was nothing significant in the movement for the quarter.
We'll call it out on a quarterly basis if we think it's important, but there was nothing important there.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

So still in the 10% range, give or take?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes.

Operator

Our next question is from Jeff Gates of Gates Capital Management.

Jeffrey Linn Gates
Gates Capital Management, Inc.

Yes, a couple of questions. First, I noticed the volume was the best volume quarter you've had in a few
quarters. And I'm just wondering if there's -- you see any signs of an uptick in volume and what might be
driving that? Number one.

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

19

DAVITA INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

And number two, is this environment going to force you to do less de novos? Or you won't be able to do as
many de novos, so will your capital budget come down at all?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Do you want to grab it, Joel?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes, sure. We had a reasonable NAG quarter, no doubt. I wouldn't call out anything specific yet. I wouldn't
say we're ready to declare victory on some of the efforts we've been undertaking to drive NAG back up,
and there certainly was a tiny bit of noise at the end of the quarter. So nothing to call out there.

In terms of de novos, I think we're going to wait and see what happens to industry volumes and what
happens on the home side, but I think there is certainly a possibility that if there is a -- an overall NAG
headwind that comes out of COVID and possibly an accelerated shift to home that I think you would see
a potential decline, not just in our de novos, but in industry de novos, and that would bring the capital
budget down.

Jeffrey Linn Gates
Gates Capital Management, Inc.

You're not having any trouble constructing centers that you had planned?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Well, I'd say for 2020, depending on how long the various state shutdowns last, we might see our capital
spend come down a bit. There are just some projects that we physically can't get done right now, but that
will depend on how long things last.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Justin, while, let me finish up by saying the impact of 1 day is somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million
range.

Operator

And yes, speakers, we don't have any questions on queue as of now.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Okay. Well, let me wrap up with a couple of closing remarks. Number one, thank you for all the support.
Number two, I don't know if I can convey in words how proud I am of our team. The beauty and the
dedication that I've seen over the last 60 days is just literally hard to put in to words. The fact that our
government and our competitors and us put everything aside and cohorted, and worked together to
take care of our patients is just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. The clinical focus and the infection control
expertise that we have has been critical in helping us through this virus. Point three, our platform, the
importance of the platform in connecting the sites of care has been highlighted through this crisis. The
resilience of our team and our business model has been beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Financially, strong
balance sheet and a proven track record of cost management. And lastly, I do think that philosophically, it
is time to come together as a country, and we are happy to do our part. So thank you for your interest in
our company, and we'll talk again next quarter.
