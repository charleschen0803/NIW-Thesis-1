With that, I will turn the call over to David.

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Erik, and welcome, everyone, to our Q3 earnings call. Let me say a few quick words about the
quarter before we open it up for general Q&A. We had a very solid quarter with continued great execution
across the entire business. Dayforce recurring revenue ex-float grew on a GAAP basis by 33% or on a
constant currency basis by 31%. Total revenue increased on a GAAP basis by 26% or 24% on a constant
currency basis. For the fiscal year of 2021, we slightly increased the guidance and we narrowed the range
to $1.14 billion to $1.19 billion. On the gross cloud margin, we saw an improvement of the gross cloud
margin to 72.7%, which is up to 90 basis points on a constant currency basis and up 70 basis points on a
quarter-over-quarter basis.

Customer POP accounts increased by about 11% year-over-year, and the average size of the customers
also increased about 11%, and on a 12-month basis, we have taken live about 523 customers. Float
balances also increased by about 25%, but float income was negatively impacted by a slight decline in the
yield by 36 basis points.

Adjusted EBITDA was 39.4%, which is up 20 basis points on an ex-float basis. On the Dayforce Wallet,
we continue to see very strong metrics. The number of customers live on Dayforce Wallet is now above
290 customers. We have sold over 800 accounts at this point in time. We saw registration rates across
the eligible employees who have access to the wallets grow to about 29%. And when we look at the top
quartile of tenured customers, we see registration rates above 50%. Usage of the wallet continues to be
very healthy with an average number of transactions of above 25 transactions per month.

In early October, we closed on an acquisition of Data Fusion, which further increases our compliance
advantage and gives us specific capabilities for certified payroll reporting, prevailing wage rate
calculations, incentive payments, union rate calculations and very complex general ledger reporting.
This technology is immediately available and will be integrated into Dayforce. This acquisition will
obviously help accelerate our growth in construction, government contracting, manufacturing, unionized
environments, the public sector and not for profit.

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

Also in the first week of October, we held our first in-person customer event in over 2 years with the first
stop of the Ceridian World Tour in Las Vegas. At the CWT event, we shared our vision for Dayforce to
deliver the always on people platform for the global workforce, which is anchored by our brand promise
of making work life better. A few highlights of the event. We had some product announcements, including
the announcement of screaming pay, which is the automatic delivery of earnings and net earnings to our
employees' Dayforce Wallets. We announced the HR service delivery, which is an end-to-end employee
solution that provides an always on HR compliance support. And we also discussed Dayforce Talent
Intelligence, a suite of new transformative talent management solutions empowered by AI and data.

We plan to build on the success with our next CWT Torstar in New York. This advantage is primarily
focused on customers will also feature an investor track, including a session with the Ceridian executive
team starting at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, November 11, that portion will be webcast, so
please join us. You can find the information on our investor website on how to register the event or join
this session via live webcast.

I'm also very pleased to share that Ceridian was once again named a leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic
Quadrant for Cloud Human Capital Management suites or enterprises above 1,000 employees. We believe
this report further validates our vision, the innovation of the Dayforce product and our commitment to
delivering quantifiable value for our customers.

Before I hand it back to Erik, I would like to close by saying how proud I am of our Ceridian team across
the globe. Our engagement metrics are up. Our culture remains vibrant as we alongside our customers
transition to a new hybrid work environment and our purpose and our brand promise to make work life
better has never been more clear and relevant.

Erik, back to you.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

Question and Answer

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Today, the first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe.

Aleksandr J. Zukin
Wolfe Research, LLC

And congrats Ceridian team on a solid quarter. I guess I wanted to start out, David, by asking the question
of around the narrowing of the guidance range and particularly in the shareholder letter, you called out
seeing some employment headwinds in your customer base of them not being able to hire at the pace or
rehire at the pace that they wanted to. And it impacted the quarter. I'm assuming it impacted the guide
somewhat. I wanted to ask a broader question, which is, how long do you anticipate this to be a headwind
for the business? And are we -- if we step back and from a big picture perspective, look at the business,
you're seeing clearly tailwinds around the war for talent and necessitating, a modernization initiative of
many HR organizations and tools, but at the same time, you get paid per employee per month. And if
you can't hire, then you can't pay Ceridian more. So work -- talk to us about those 2 dynamics, are they
balancing out because new bookings are well ahead of where you thought you were going to be, and we
can't see those numbers, we can only see the PEPM stuff, but that would be very helpful, I think?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Sure. So Alex, great series of questions. So I'll try to break it down into different pieces. So for Q4, we
had expected last time we spoke, a $1.5 million improvement in the headwind from employee accounts.
As we pointed out in the shareholder leisure, we're seeing that it's taking slightly longer for our customers
to fill their open job requisitions. So we have decreased what we expect the improvement of Dayforce to
be down by about $0.5 million. And that is the tightness that we've actually taken. So we've widened the
Q4 guidance by corresponding by that amount. However, we have taken the beat that we had in Q3 to the
full year guidance, if you like. So that gave us the increase in the actual guidance.

In terms of the business, obviously, I do believe we have been executing tremendously well, that if I look
at it from a pipeline perspective, it still remains very strong. And we are forecasting for the second half
of the year, that sales will come in quite favorable to last year and to the year before that, which speaks
obviously to the sales execution of the actual business.

On the implementation, projects continue to be implemented, a lot of activity with our customers. And
I'm actually seeing some tremendous feedback from our customers in terms of the NPS or the customer
satisfaction levels as well. In terms of the tightness of the, if you like, the hiring market, I wish I had
a magic mirror or something. But at this point, just looking at what we know, given the employment
numbers that we did see in September, which remember, do give us October. And what we believe we saw
in October, which gives us visibility into November, and what we're currently seeing in November, which
will give us visibility into December. We believe our guidance range is pretty good.

Aleksandr J. Zukin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. And I guess, is this -- should we start thinking as we model -- as we adjust our models for next
year, should we start moderating our assumptions for an employee tailwind in general based on these
early indications? And then maybe for Noemie, also walk us through some of the adjustments around the
adjusted EBITDA guide? It implies that you are spending a little bit more, I'm assuming on marketing and
sales, either hiring or activities. And then also, I apologize for the multiple questions, but we do track job
postings and it did look like Ceridian's job postings declined quite a bit over the past couple of weeks, that
could be great because you hit all of your hiring targets, but I just wanted to double check that?

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

Chairman & CEO

Yes. Just on the hiring side, we have been hiring very aggressively throughout the year. What I will say
is that we haven't really been struggling in finding fantastic candidates across the organization. In terms
of the adjusted EBITDA, I'll hand it over to Noemie for all the fun and goodness in that conversation. So
Noemie, all over to you.

Noemie Clemence Heuland
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure. So our adjusted EBITDA for Q3, as you saw, was $39.4 million or 15% -- 15.3% of total
revenue. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 15.4% to
15.9% of total revenue. This is pretty consistent with what we've said before. We're continuing to invest
in our product and technology. We saw we made some exciting product announcements recently. And
your comment about hiring, we're actually very successful in attracting top talents in a tight labor market,
which shows our brand is strong and our reputation is strong as well.

We've made some significant investments in our R&D, as you saw, our cash spend on R&D went up from
less than 10% of our total revenue in Q3 last year to above 13.6% this quarter. We've ramped up our
services delivery capacity, which is kind of the timing thing that you see from Q3 to Q4 where we are
ramping up to service our customers to go live in Q4, which is our largest go-live quarter. There's a lot of
very large customers going live in Q4. And we're also focused on integrating the Data Fusion technology
into the Dayforce platform.

The other thing I would say is we've also reopened our offices throughout the summer in North America.
We've returned to in-person meetings as well, which is very important for our people after having spent 2
years apart. And our sales reps are traveling to meet our customers and prospects throughout the fourth
quarter. We've seen a lot of benefits, obviously, from digital selling, and we continue to invest in digital
sales capability, that's not going to go away, that was a great learning from the pandemic times. But we
also want our sales -- the sales and marketing team to be meeting customers and prospects on site, and
we've done so quite successfully in Vegas as an example, and we continue to do that throughout Q4. So
that explains a little bit the timing between Q3 and Q4. But overall, our full year adjusted EBITDA and
guidance range hasn't changed and our investment priority remained consistent.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Up next, we've got Jared Levine from Cowen.

Jared Marshall Levine
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

In terms of Dayforce sales force productivity, where do we stand versus pre-pandemic if below when do
you expect a full recovery? And if we're above, what kind of -- what's driven that improvement?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Sorry, Jared, you're talking about sales productivity prior to pre-COVID?

Jared Marshall Levine
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes.

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

That's a difficult number to answer because I don't know if we've actually measured a pre-COVID, post-
COVID. But what I would say is that we are quite pleased with our sales productivity numbers. And when
I look towards next year, I think we would expect to get even more productivity out of the actual group.

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

As you know, this year, we invested very heavily in building out the actual sales team. We did that for a
number of reasons. One, obviously, to move into the enterprise space to build out muscle in working with
the system integrator relationships we put in place and also to build out our capability is to focus on the
full HCM platform, not only on the compliance modules. And I would say all of that has been going very
well, not only in North America but on a global basis. Noemie, anything that you would add to that?

Noemie Clemence Heuland
Executive VP & CFO

No, I think you covered it all. We've invested also in the sales support organization with value advisers,
solution advisers and people who can sell alongside system integrators and upmarket with a large
customer. So that -- but you covered most of the points, David.

Jared Marshall Levine
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then in terms of the pace of Dayforce go lives in 3Q, can you kind of dig into what
weighed on that pace there? And do you anticipate an uptick in 4Q?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Q4 is always the bigger quarter. Q3 is normally a lighter quarter. So yes, we are expecting many more
accounts to go live in Q4 over the Q3, which is typical for the actual period. In terms of the number of
accounts, it's largely being driven by the size of the accounts that are going live. So if we take live, for
example, a 50,000 employee account, if I compare that to historical trends, where we're taking live, say,
1,000 employee counts, the 50,000 would count for effectively 50. So we look at it more on an LTM basis
now, which gives us more of an average type of trend for the actual business.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Next up, we've got Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.

Sitikantha Panigrahi
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Congratulation, a solid quarter. I wanted to David dig into the international market. That used to be 1
of your growth drivers in genital expense and you talked about a couple of years back. Now are you
expanding your payroll -- native payroll, and also, you talked about some of these global wins as well. Tell
us like what you're seeing and when do you think it will be a material contributor to your revenue from
international market?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

So look, our goal, I would say probably about a 3-year basis, we'll push about 25% of our revenue
onto a global basis. It might come quicker, it might take a bit longer, but we generally are moving in
that direction. We definitely have advanced relative to all of the other players in the market in terms
of global payroll and global core HR. Obviously, having a lot of success in market with companies that
are headquartered outside of North America as well as companies inside North America that have global
operations. At CWT, we actually discussed with the client base in 9 additional countries that we're adding
in 2022 in terms of native payroll capability. And again, I think that just positions us very well in market to
win these global accounts.

We definitely are seeing an increase in demand for core HR systems and talent suites and compliance
modules that cut across the globe to give organizations that single experience for all of their employees
regardless of where they live and work.

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

That's great. And then a follow-up to Dayforce Wallet. That's good to see the acceleration in new customer
sign as well as go live this quarter versus last quarter. But then you talked about streaming pay introduced
in October and also the CWT or the event. How should we think about the ramp in Dayforce Wallet in next
few quarters? And when do you think it will be reasonable for you to start disclosing other metrics like
revenue or any other revenue contribution?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

I think we'll probably start late next year on the revenue contribution. As you know, it's still a new
business for us. What I can say, if I look at the business on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it's effectively
doubling every quarter. So we're still going through the kind of the early stages of what I call hyper
growth of it. Some of the metrics that I'll point you to, I believe, last quarter, we spoke about the average
registration across all eligible employees to be about 25%. It's now over 29%. And when we look at
customers that have been live over a year, we're seeing registration rates in the top quarter, well above
50% with the very strong usage metrics that we discussed. Those 25 transactions that people are doing
everyday living. It's fast-food, grocery, convenience, gas, ATM withdrawals and the like. So that excites us
quite nicely.

In the quarter as well, we released 2 days early or up to 2-day early deposit, which means that if you're
a Dayforce Wallet user, you can get paid when you want and say you take out 1/3 of your net earnings
during the period, you'll remaining 2/3, you can get up to 2 days early as well. And again, the whole
model is predicated on no direct fees to the employees, no membership fees, no fees to the organization.
And every payment is a true payroll, which means it's fully compliant to get an earnings slip for every type
of transfer.

The streaming of pay will come online, as we mentioned, in 2022. We believe that will obviously accelerate
because the idea over there is instead of doing an on-demand pay or having to wait for direct deposit as I
work the pay automatically strains into my wallet, and we're talking about making access to your earnings
completely instantaneous, and that will obviously be paired with quite a very rich financial wellness
offering set with inside the actual product. So we are quite excited with it.

Dayforce wallet, by the way, also has given us a tremendous advantage in market. We are still seeing
attachment rates across new business well across 80%. And in every conversation that I have with clients,
with early clients, the Dayforce wallet is top of mind.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Next up is Mark Marcon with Baird.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations on the great Dayforce results. You had a number of significant wins. I'm just wondering
if you could characterize a little bit who you ended up winning from like you mentioned luxury global
automotive companies, largest car rental organization. I mean those are all really long large enterprises.
You had a number of international ones. Who are you replacing? How is the scope of the opportunities
changing in terms of the pipeline? And how is the recognition from Gartner impacting your ability to sell?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Mark, the first thing I would say is we're seeing more and more customers, larger customers buy the full
HCM suite. I believe the number is 36% of clients today buy a full HCM suite. And so the takeaway from
that is that we are now being seen not only as a compliance player, compliance being payroll benefits,
time and workforce management, but also a leader in talent intelligence, core HR, data analytics and all of
the other pieces that comprise a very rich and robust and engaging system for employees. As we've gone
upmarket, we obviously are seeing more add backs against the ERPs and I'm quite proud of our success

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

over there. We do also compete, as you know, against the more traditional human capital management
and payroll customers. And obviously, our win rates over there are quite nicely.

In terms of the wins, usually, we're replacing a more legacy type of payroll or time solution, either client
server or mainframe based. We're also seeing replacement of more legacy-based ERP systems that might
be or not through cloud. And obviously, we replace a lot of different point solutions when it comes to
various types of talent modules.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's great. And then you've got a lot of different growth opportunities, government, international, digital
wallet. How is that going to impact your investment perspective for next year? How should we think about
EBITDA margins in the short term relative to all of the investment opportunities that you have?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Look, our focus is on growth. We still have a relatively small market share whether it be in North America
on a global basis. So we believe what's right for the company is to invest more on growth than on
increasing the actual EBITDA. We are going to continue investing in product and technology, sales and
marketing.

In terms of our 5 growth factors, which we always speak about, number one, acquiring new customers,
we're obviously doing very well, still have a long way to go, a lot of white space. Two, increasing the actual
platform. Jared spoke about some really tremendous innovations in terms of what we bring in to market
and that allows us to expand the platform go back to the base. And remember, add-ons remain at around
25% every single quarter.

Moving into the enterprise space. I've spoken about that, but it's not only moving into the enterprise
space on a payroll benefit and time perspective, we really are talking about moving into enterprise
space on a full HCM basis. Again, 36% of customers are now buying the full HCM suite. We've spoken a
lot about the global opportunity. And in a number of years, I expect about 25% of our revenues come
from the global basis. And then, of course, we have the adjacent markets, which is the Dayforce wallet,
which there's a lot of excitement and the metrics look very good. So in terms of long-term growth for
the company, we are obviously very excited. And as you mentioned, when it comes down to the annual
budget, there are a lot of considerations and trade-offs as to which of the 5 different growth factors we
emphasized.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Should we just assume -- go ahead.

Noemie Clemence Heuland
Executive VP & CFO

We're also looking at the cloud recurring gross margin, which is 1 of the key indicator for us because that's
really what's going to fuel the long-term sustainability and profitability of the business. And that indicator
keeps going up. It was up 290 basis points, excluding float this quarter. So that's really what we're looking
at as we scale as well.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So investors should probably deemphasize looking at EBITDA margin from the short-term perspective over
the next year, just given all the investment opportunities and really focus on the recurring cloud gross
margin in terms of [indiscernible]?

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

Chairman & CEO

I think Noemie has emphasized a very important point. It's 1 that we have continued to talk about from
the time we went public that it's a metric that we look at internally, which is whether or not the growth,
the cloud recurring gross margin is expanding alongside revenue. And I would say that it's going up very
nicely. As Noemie mentioned, it's up 290 basis points, almost 3% on a constant currency basis year-over-
year, even given the headwinds that we still have from the -- sorry, from the employment headwinds.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Next up is Matthew Pfau from William Blair.

Matthew Charles Pfau
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

David, at the World Tour, you discussed the elastic workforce and some functionality that Ceridian was
potentially working on in that area in terms of connecting employers with employees. Maybe you can
just provide some more comments on your vision in that area? And how you think about that market
opportunity?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Matt here. I've spoken about this for quite some time. I always spoke about the technology,
having 3 sequential steps of delivery. The first step was to build out the continuous engine that would
allow us to calculate net earnings as someone worked. And that's obviously quite a difficult thing to do,
and we believe we have quite a competitive merger around us in that we can do that and the others can't.

The second step was creating the payment rails, so that not only would we calculate net earnings in real
time, but we could also pay people in real time, and that came down to the Dayforce wallet, and we've
seen great traction. The third part was, well, if I download the Dayforce wallet, and we know who you are,
the KYC process. We know you have the right to work. We know what your certifications are. We know
that you're a safe person. We also know inside the Dayforce application, what all the local jurisdictional
rules are for things like overtime, minimum wages, premium pay and the like. And we also have the
capability through the Dayforce app to allow you to clock in and clock out via geo locations.

In that case, what we can do is we can make it very easy for organizations to publish their vacancies.
And a vacancy could be a number of hours, say, a shift that has to be worked. It could be a task such as
a delivery or could be a longer-term assignment, say, a 3-, 4-week program in this time. And along with
the vacancy, the organization could publish the competencies required and possibly even some learning
management contract. We can then allow all of the Dayforce Wallet users to look at their app and much
like they'll be looking for awards around them, they'll be able to see the vacancies for which they have the
right competencies. They could learn about the vacancy through the learning management content, apply,
get matched and when they actually show up, they would show a QR code to clock in and clock out. And
as soon as their hours were approved, they would actually get paid. And as Ceridian would be responsible
for doing all the necessary remittances. We're doing all of the year-end filings, all of the different types of
money movement. And you would go now from just not only having instant access to your earnings, but
you'd have the ability to actually find work and get paid in real time, which we believe matches where the
workforce is going.

So we're quite excited with that opportunity. We've started the actual research and the build-out and the
partnerships that I think will enable us to do that. Obviously, leveraging the great stuff that we already
have through the Dayforce continuous calculation engine the Dayforce Wallet payment rails.

Matthew Charles Pfau

Tour specifically around some of the AI and self-service features. How do you think about those from

an ROI perspective when you're selling to prospective customers? And is that an important point of the
conversation?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

So Matthew, everything we built, we tie back down to a KPI that we can impact at a customer. And as
we've always said, that KPI needs to be measured measurable and convertible into a money saving. For
us, we use the term quantifiable value, and I believe we're ranked #1 in industry in terms of delivering
strong ROI.

When we talk about the Dayforce Wallet, we talk about some very strong metrics that show basically the
decrease in attrition rates. The decrease in the first 90-day attrition rates, the quicker time to actually hire
someone. So as we actually build it out, it's always along the same lines.

In terms of the talent intelligence, what we would say today is the market operates in something
called Talent 1.0. And at a high level, it's really people operating this list management framework. If
I'm recruiting, I look at a list of candidates for a particular job requisition. I sought or I filter that list
accordingly. I find the candidate that I'd like to act on, and then I go through a number of sequential steps
usually manually driven.

In Talent 2.0 that we're beginning to release now, we're moving more to a recommendation and prediction
type of model, very similar to, for instance, when you go to Amazon or Netflix and those systems
recommend either products that you would like or movie shows or TV shows that meet your requirements.
We're doing the same now on the talent side. When I go to that list of candidates, it's not a list, but a
set of recommended candidates that the system has predicted will be a good match based on who the
hiring manager is and who the recruiter. And then even once we have that, we can go and use a lot of
automation like align the candidate to self-schedule, when the candidate interacts with the system, we
can engage with bot technology. So if the candidate is applying for 1 particular type of job based on the
candidate who is applying and the available job requisitions, we can recommend back to the candidate
where they may be a good fit for other opportunities, and at that point in time, get them to engage and or
even complete the application for them. So it's effectively using ML models and AI models to go and look
at what's been done currently in talent in order to engage with people in a much more natural manner
that they would typically expect.

In terms of the service desk over there, there's a lot of information that the Dayforce system has. As you
know, we've already moved into natural workspaces, you can now engage with the system through Teams
or through Slack in a very natural way. We can now allow the employee to ask questions about policy.
What is the vacation policy as opposed to just how many days do I have? Am I eligible for something? And
by doing that, we can take a lot of load off the HR department. And again, given that's driven off of ML
type of model continually evolves, continually learns and becomes more of a natural way of interacting
with the system. So obviously, a lot of excitement in order to get around intelligence and data.

If you do come to the Ceridian World Tour, which you, obviously, came in Vegas, before others, you'll see
Joe talk about that, and we actually have a few demonstrations of the technology, which is really exciting.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Up next, we've got Samad Samana from Jefferies. Samad?

Samad Saleem Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So maybe, David, first for you, just as I think about the international side, the company has done M&A
around that. And clearly, the commentary this quarter was positive around traction. How should we think
about maybe international bookings or like new book dollars in this quarter versus prior quarters? And
maybe how should international as a percentage of new booked dollars going forward?

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

Chairman & CEO

Samad, I don't think we've actually included that in the actual numbers. I don't have them off hand,
but obviously, the global business continues to do very well, not only on the sales side. But if I look at
global implementations, we're seeing a lot of success both in EMEA and across APJ's in terms of getting
customers live and referenceable. As we go into the upmarket space, it's almost a certainty that we're
always selling our global systems, whether, as I mentioned, they are globally headquartered companies
or whether they're based in North America. In some instances, we actually see both. If you look at the
shareholder letter, we actually speak about an automotive company headquartered out of Germany. There
were actually 2 separate processes we went through. One was for the dealers that they have across
Germany and the other 1 was for their kind of more global manufacturing operations. So we're just kind
of a benefit from having both of those. And obviously, as you go through the risk profile and become a
vendor, or the overall organization, there's a lot of benefit and a lot of growth we see across the globe.

Samad Saleem Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great and then on the Canadian federal government deal, it was great to see that that's been brought
back now as the world reopens. Is that included in the guidance for the fourth quarter? Is there any
revenue contribution from that? And then just how should we think about the impact of that on maybe the
near-term EBITDA outlook maybe even into 2022? Or just how should we think about the margins -- the
margin impact from that?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

So there's a little bit of service revenue and a small amount of subscription revenue inside the actual
quarter, but I wouldn't call out as being material. Where we are with the government of calendar, we're in
the midst of the planning phases for the experimental pilot for the first department inside the government.
Obviously, the majority of that work effort in terms of executing across the pilot will happen in 2022. It's
also obviously that the GOC will require more departments to be included in the pilot to test the various
elements of the actual system. So it's likely that the number of departments will be expanded more
thoroughly as we move forward as well.

Samad Saleem Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just if I could squeeze in a third one, which is just I know I heard the question
about the employment recovery. I wanted to ask a different way, given just how many companies you're
exposed to, so regularly as the CEO of a large HR payroll company is? When you think about the hiring
within the base, is it a safe assumption to assume everybody will get back to the same levels where they
were all else equal before the pandemic? I mean I guess I'm just curious how much if there's automation
or if there's hiring plans have shifted where they're more efficient and don't need to get back to those
levels? Is that something we should think about as well as far as same-store sales growth goes within the
installed base?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

If you ask me Samad, I do think that they'll end up with employment levels above where they were pre-
pandemic. There are a number of factors. I do think the economy is growing very, very quickly. And so
companies are not hiring back to their previous levels but are hiring above their levels. The second part
is I do think there are a lot of new companies that have entered the economy that didn't exist pre the
pandemic. And those companies are actually hiring as well. So I do think we'll move back to very full
employment inside the economy as we go into 2022.

Up next, we've got Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler.

Arvind Anil Ramnani
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

David, I want to ask a bit more about Dayforce Wallet. I know you provided lot of color on Siti's question
on Dayforce Wallet. But a couple of questions I have on a Dayforce Wallet. One is, what are some
of the second derivative benefits of Dayforce Wallet? I mean, I think the revenue portion is going to
be interesting when you start to provide it next year. But can you just talk about some of the second
derivative like impact on win rates, ability to charge clients more or engagement? Just some of the second
derivative benefits would be great.

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Look, the first is obviously our run rate goes up because what we are allowing companies to do is to move
to paying people immediately without them having to change the way that they fund their payroll and
without any cost to them in terms of subscription fees or fees to their employees. So it's a tremendous
benefit to both the organization and to their employees. In fact, an organization could go from a weekly
or biweekly payroll to a monthly payroll and get a onetime lift of working capital as well. They wanted
additional benefit. So I think that's becoming very important. The second is what I would say is that the
desire to get paid immediately is becoming a requirement in business today. It's no longer optional. So the
economy is moving there, and we have better tech than I think anyone else in the market in that every
time we move the money, we do a true payroll that is fully compliant at a federal on the state or provincial
basis in Canada. And I think that's very, very strong as well. When we're going to some deals, we actually
are seeing them very focused on the Dayforce Wallet. There have been in some cases where that has
allowed us to maintain or actually increase pricing just based on the advantage that we have inside the
market. And the last piece as well is that I do believe it does help our brand with the employees of our
customers. And so I would expect over time that we become the preferred choice of HCM solution, not
only for the organizations, but for the worker as well.

Arvind Anil Ramnani
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Terrific. And then getting back to the first derivative impact. What is the sort of revenue model? I mean,
from what I've understood it, it's like maybe like an interchange, 80 bps or something. So 2 questions.
What is the business model? And I understand there's an interchange fee associated with -- when they
use the debit card to pay for it. But in the situation where someone pulls, let's say, $1,000 and they say
$800 is going to go into my bank account, $200 to stay in my debit card. Is there revenue to be gained
even from that $800 that goes into the bank account.

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

So first of all, currently, we don't see many transfers of the actual cards. What we're actually seeing is the
80-day spending from the cards. And as we mentioned, there's about 25 transactions per month, they
average probably about $30 per transaction, usually on day-to-day living. When someone does an ACH
transfer which, again, we don't see much of that, there isn't any fee to the actual employee. Next year,
we will move into what they call OCT transfers or instant transfers. And over there, there is an ability to
charge for that. Usually, it is 50 basis points up to a small cap that discharge for that particular type of
transfer. What we are seeing in terms of the usage of the wallet is becoming quite disruptive to the credit
card industry. So instead of using the credit card, we're seeing a lot of the employees are now using the
Dayforce card instead. In that way, there obviously are more on top of their finances and they don't get
into a situation where they are paying the 22% on the balance of the actual statement at the end of the
month. There's a big benefit from them. In terms of additional revenue opportunities, as we move into
next year, we start moving into things like rewards and we'll probably move into the areas like buy now,
pay later. And all of those types of opportunities address the ability to increase our take rate. For example,
on the rewards, we would expect to get about 90 basis points on the actual spend for that particular type

14

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

of item that was covered by the reward on buy now, pay later basis, there would obviously be a revenue
share with the partner over there.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Next up is Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo.

Michael James Turrin
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I know there was 1 here earlier already and appreciate the seasonal dynamics in the model. But the net
go-live number does look a little lighter than what we were expecting. And I'm wondering if that's at
all tied to labor constraints, either on services or the partner side or if it is truly reflective of a move up
market and towards partners? And if so, if that suggests that maybe you're likely to see even more of a
Q4 seasonal weighting in the model either this year or just on a go-forward basis?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Mike, it was largely tied to just the size of customers. So I wouldn't read anything to it. And last year, we
used to say, look at it on a half year basis because it evens out between quarters. Typically, you always
have the Q4 as being the biggest quarter because in the U.S., customers want to avoid the first quarter
reconciliation. So the Q4, we're expecting obviously a very healthy go-live. Quite honestly, internally,
we track it at a dollar value of go-lives. So we look at their cap on go-live in the quarter, we don't really
focus on the actual number. The other part about that, the number isn't really what I'd call a pure number
because when you have a customer that goes live in a different country, if they have contracted through a
different type of entity it could be viewed as from finance as a go-live second go-live, whereas, from STEM
perspective, we would actually view it as 1 system. So again, I would encourage you to look at the LTM
basis more than anything else. I wouldn't read too much into it.

Michael James Turrin
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

If you want to give us the PEPM go-live metric, David, we'll take that, too. But maybe you can talk...

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

That's a question for Noemie. I'm just a customer.

Michael James Turrin
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe you could talk about just the incremental Dayforce metric that's now above $200,000. So I'm just
wondering if there is a ceiling at all there or if you think that continues to trend higher, given you are just
hitting new thresholds and milestones there as well?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

No, look, the way I look at it, it's a rectangle. And on the x-axis, you have the number of employees,
which obviously is growing all the time. And then on the y-axis is the PEPM, the pricing that we get for
those. And as we increase the number of modules that we have with the customer, we go up on that y-
axis as well. And so I would expect it to continue going up.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Next up, we've got Brad Clark from BMO.

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I want to focus on the payroll strategy. You announced a lot of new countries to build out for 2022. Looks
like a lot focused on the agent path. And so on a broader level, I just want to see if you can discuss your
strategy around payroll rollout? And when how do you expect to see the impact of the new payrolls on
winning Dayforce customers?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Brad, a great question. Currently, we're actually focused, I would say, on 3 regions. The first
region would be North America. And obviously, you'll probably see us move into Mexico in the short term
as well to cover and complete the North America rollout. That obviously will have impact on manufacturing
customers with inside North America. The second area we're quite focused is in on EMEA. We've got a very
good presence, as you know, in U.K. and Ireland. I've seen really tremendous traction in Germany, and
we're launching the native payroll solution for Germany next year as well, and we're seeing quite a lot of
interest in that. Once we have Germany, we, obviously, are going to expand into the other [indiscernible]
countries surrounding Germany to get a road of footprint across EMEA.

The third area, as you pointed out, is across APJ. Obviously, the reason we're doing that is that we
do have a lot of what we call bureau customers, so customers through the acquisitions of Ascender
and Excelity and RITEQ. And as we build out the native capabilities for those regions, that gives us an
opportunity to go back to the base and not only move their payroll onto Dayforce, but also add on things
like time and attendance, workforce management, core HR and all of the talent modules, which obviously
is a very large revenue opportunity for us.

Also within APJ, we've got quite well kind of integrated go-to-market. So we have sales and marketing
across the region, a big presence across areas like Singapore, A&D and other areas across. We also have
service and implementation capabilities in market, which means we can get to market quite quickly. And
as we move into 2022, you'll start to see us focus more on what we call the migration and the upsell of
the incumbent base, which is about 1,500 customers in region. Noemie, anything that you would add to
that?

Noemie Clemence Heuland
Executive VP & CFO

No, you covered it all.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Next up is Robert Simmons from D.A. Davidson.

Unknown Analyst

So you talked about wallet monetization, but for streaming pay as the money isn't going into wallet and
you said that it's not going to be any charges simply, what is the revenue model there?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

It's the Same model, Robert. It is -- streaming pay comes on board next year. It's effectively the same as
on demand pace. So the current experience at the moment is I look at my mobile device, it tells me how
much net earnings I have earned. So that is what is my growth, that all of my taxes and deductions, and
then I can elect say, I'd like $50 added to my Dayforce Wallet or card. When I do that, I wait for about 5
to 10 seconds, and then 5 to 10 seconds, we doing our calculation going back about a year, we're actually
creating an earnings slip and we're actually funding the card immediately, but just about a 10-second wait
and the reason is to look at their balance before they spend. Where streaming pay, I elect to stream my
pay. And as I earn the money flows on to my wallet at the end of every day. I don't have to do the on-

demand transaction when it goes on to the card, we still get exactly the same interchange when they go
often spend or through the other types of transactions on the card.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. Okay. So I thought it was going directly into the comp. I guess that was not correct.

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Yes, it goes onto the Dayforce Wallet.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. Okay. And then do you have any preview, what you're going to be giving us next week at the
investor track?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

With the investor track, we actually wanted you to do is provide an opportunity for the investors to meet
the executive team. So in the executive track, we'll have it moderated by Leagh Turner. Leagh will also
have Joe Korngiebel, our Chief Products and Technology Officer, we'll have Chris Armstrong, our Chief
Customer Officer. Well, obviously, we'll have Noemie, we'll have Erik, we'll have Seth Ross, your heads up
our Consumer Group. Erik, Noemie, who else am I missing in the group? So I think we wanted to have
quite a -- allow people to have a dialogue with a broader set of the executive team.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Yes, that's right. There's a couple of other executives. And then what we've done is we've curated the
actual customer sessions earlier and kind of selected a few that we think will be most applicable to
investors.

And for our last question of the night, Bhavin Shah from Deutsche Bank.

Bhavin S. Shah
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I mean just maybe focusing on the SI partnerships. Can you just provide us an update on what you're
seeing in terms of these guys adding more to the pipeline opportunities. Is this something that we should
expect as we go into next year once you start probing more deals?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So actually, a great question on that. Obviously, we're seeing the number of opportunities brought to
us by the SIs go up sizable, a large margin. Obviously, we started off at a base of 0. So you can expect
to see very rapid increases on a percentage basis, but we're very happy with these growth of the pipeline
that has been influenced by the SIs. So that's the first piece we're seeing. Second piece is we have got
more SIs priming Dayforce implementations, which allows us to continue growing, especially on a global
basis. Without having to necessarily continue to build out our own services group internally, it allows us
to focus on really doing what we do great, which is build great software and deliver grade software and
obviously service to create software. In terms of the partner network, we are well above 20 SI partners
who have resources who are trained at CWT in Vegas, we have a very good chain by them, and I believe
we'll see quite a few of them at the New York event as well.

Bhavin S. Shah
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it. Super helpful. Just a quick follow-up on wallet. I mean, nice to see the continued growth in terms
of go-lives and the adoption from the employee base. But maybe can you provide any information on what

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

you're seeing in terms of your customers providing more of an employee's paycheck available in terms of
on an on-demand basis, whether you're seeing them increase it from 30% to 50% or 50% to 70% and like
what's that trend been like?

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The 2 types of comes, those have put guardrails so they're limited to 50% and others that give full
access. When I look at the overall population, it appears about 30% of individuals who use their wallet
move their wages on to the wallet before the end of the pay period. If they use it for direct deposit, and
we've seen the direct deposit business actually go up quite nicely. They get access to those funds 2 days
earlier than they normally would as well. So to answer your question, I don't think it actually has been
driven by the organization, just given that your natural amount movement onto the water seems to be
about 30% of the actual wages. Once we start doing a 3-minute of pay, I would expect that to go higher.
And we're also starting to emphasize now the direct deposit side. And so if you get the direct deposit, you
effectively get all of it at the end of the actual period as well.

Erik, just to pass it back to you.

Erik J. Zimmer
Executive VP and Head of Mergers & Acquisitions

Yes. Thanks, David. And with that question, that concludes our call for tonight. So on behalf of Noemie,
David and the rest of the Ceridian executive team, we thank you very much for your time this evening,
and we look forward to continuing the conversation throughout the quarter.

David D. Ossip
Chairman & CEO

Great. Thank you, everyone, and I look forward to speaking to many of you tonight and tomorrow, and I
hope to see a lot of you next week as well. Thank you very much.
