LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Las Vegas Sands Third Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your
first speaker today, Mr. Dan Briggs. Sir, the floor is yours.

Daniel J. Briggs
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining us on the call are Dr.
Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China.

Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain
forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws.
The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking
statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures.

A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial
measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings
slides on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note that this presentation is being recorded.

With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues in Asia, and thank you for joining our
call today. I'll provide some brief comments and we'll go to the Q&A.

Our results continue to reflect the pandemic impact, heightened restrictions directly impacted our results
in both Macao and Singapore this quarter, we did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in both
markets, and we remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore. Singapore
gaming operations were closed for a portion of the quarter, enhanced restrictions were in place throughout
the remainder of the quarter. The good news in Singapore is the travel corridors are being established with
a number of source markets which hopefully will contribute to the strong recovery overtime.

Our considerable investments in Macao continue to take shape. As the market recovers, we believe the
Four Seasons in London will present growth opportunities in the future. The spending in Macao has proven
both resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and a retail perspective, you see on Page
29 and 30 in your deck, and we have great optimism about our ability to perform to a pre-pandemic level
once visitation does return.

Our company is divided into 3 areas. Most importantly the Asia portfolio in Macao and Singapore. We
remain confident we'll return to a strong positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as
restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. The sale of our Las Vegas assets create liquidity
and optionality as we pursue large-scale land-based destination resorts in both the U.S. and Asia. We
will continue to build out our digital presence and we're exploring multiple opportunities we'll face at the
appropriate time in the future.

So thanks for your time again today. Let's go to the questions. Dan?

Daniel J. Briggs
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations
Operator, ready to go.

LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Hey, everybody. Hope, everyone is well. Rob, obviously, I'm not going to spend a lot of time discussing the
results, as we all know that numerous things impacting results right now. But when you think about kind
of the progress as it pertains to Macao and what you're kind of hearing around potential easing of visa
stuff, whether it's on a province by province basis or whatever the latest is that you could kind of share
would be appreciated.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Sure. We woke up 2 guys. Let them speak to it. Let Grant or Wilfred, do you take that since you're on the
ground and living and breathing these issues every day.

Grant Chum
Senior Vice President of Global Gaming Strategy

Yes, let me give that a try. Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes, on the visas, I think the main point is the visa channels
for the individual business scheme remains open. I think if you look at the quarter -- in the third quarter,
what really impacted results during the quarter, month by month is really the conditions on the ground in
terms of domestic COVID cases. So you will see that in July, we had -- at one point for about 3 weeks in
July, we had a pretty significant recovery in the visitation and also room occupancy. And we were starting
to get a good momentum for the summer after the issues we had in the Guangdong outbreak in June.

And then as we moved into late July and early August, we had more local cases, starting with the Nanjing
airport outbreak. And eventually, in early August, we did have 4 local cases. So that obviously curtailed
the traffic immediately. And then as we moved into September, again, we were recovering well, especially
in the second and third week of September. And we were building up ready for the October Golden Week
again. And unfortunately, we did have some local cases towards the last week of September, which again
reduced the traffic immediately as it led to additional restrictions around the border. So that really explains
how the traffic flow evolved during the quarter.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. Rob, you guys did disclose, and I
think this is different from how you've disclosed historically around capital expenditures in the period. The
one line in there was $24 million of corporate and other. Does that -- what exactly does that pertain to?
And does that have anything to do with the comments that you made on kind of the digital piece of the
business?

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Sure. Pat, why don't you take that?

Patrick Dumont
President, COO & Director

Sure. I think there's a bunch of stuff in there. Some of the stuff related to digital and some of it relates to
CapEx associated with moving.

LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it. And could you kind of just update your latest thoughts on the learnings of the last couple of months
of the quarter as it pertains to kind of the digital initiative to any degree, Patrick?

Patrick Dumont
President, COO & Director

Yes, sure, happy to do it. I think for us, we take a very long-term approach. We mentioned it last quarter.
I think this is something that's going to invest over quarters and years. We're really investing for the
future. I think for us, we're looking to be sort of mindful of the way we deploy capital. We've always had
a history of investing in things that we think provide a very high level of returns in the future. And that's
how we're thinking about it today. We think there's a great opportunity in digital in a variety of different
areas. You key some of the valuations that the market is giving to certain areas today. We think it's very
compelling, especially for the long term.

So right now, we're just sort of moving along slowly. And when we have more things to report we will,
as Rob said in his opening remarks, but we're very confident. We have capital to deploy against it. We're
excited about the future, and when we have more things to talk about, we certainly will. But right now, it's
very early stages.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe changing gears to look at Singapore. It looks like that market was also obviously impacted in the
quarter of VIP, particularly soft. If we look out further once restrictions ease, I guess how do you think
about the potential EBITDA potential of that asset if VIP in Macao remains pressured. In other words, what
kind of overlap do you typically see in Singapore from the Chinese traveler. And could that be impacted if
VIP is kind of permanently restricted?

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Sure. Yes. First of all I think the fascinating part to me is we operate in 3 markets currently. And Las Vegas
is the blueprint, I think for the recovery of Asia. We said about a year ago, when I was coming to work
and someone told me, in Las Vegas, we wouldn't see normal returns here until -- revenues until '24 or
'25. So here we are in the fall of '21 and the market is blown wide open. And what's the path. The path is
pent-up demand, vaccinations and doors get opened. And I think Las Vegas will be the blueprint for Asia.
That's the path. So vaccinations in Asia are booming, if you can look at what's happening in Singapore and
Malaysia, Japan, China, Korea, it's all above the percentage-wise, what's happened in the U.S. So first, we
have extremely strong vaccination rates in Asia surpassing the U.S.

Number two, I think you've got to obviously have a government that wants to open the doors in Singapore
is evidenced by their actions, they wanted just that. I think you're going to see a big turn in '22. The
recovery will begin in '22. When do we get back to $1.7 million and maybe beyond that EBITDA, I
don't know the exact date, I can't tell you. I can tell you this, it's going to be a lot better in '22 if the
government continues their path, which has shown a lot of leadership, thoughtfulness, vaccination rates I
think are actually approaching 80-plus percent. The market over there feels it's ready to come back in '22.

As the government opens those travel lanes and we look at -- again, the demand issues here in Las Vegas
have been, I think, very instructive. It's great to walk through here and see the numbers that's kicking out
through the entire city. Why wouldn't that happen in Asia. Singapore has been a hugely important market
to us. Your point about Macao versus the Chinese market. Obviously, part of our business is dependent
upon access to Chinese market, but it's not dependent. We probably could still make a lot of money,
maybe as much as $1.5 billion without a lot of Chinese inputs. So if Korea opens up and Singapore opens

LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

up, Malaysia opens up, and Korea and Japan, those markets are very, very sad and happy for us. And I
believe we'll see them start opening up throughout '22. That's the path.

It's a vaccination rate, which is soaring. It's opened traveling. It's opening the doors up and then watching
what's happened in Vegas, happened in Singapore. And I feel -- I don't want to identify a month or a
quarter, but I think you're going to see a nice turn in '22. And then the same will happen in Macao when
the government decides to open those doors up. So I know there's people argue that people will say it's
'25 to Macao, it end up '27. But the truth is, Vegas is just out 30 minutes. Once we open doors up, it just
recovers.

And as a gaming base recovery, it's not a convention banquet-based recovery actually have to come.
So I think the future in Vegas remains, as we've always said, very bright, and there's no reason why it
can't be emulated in both Singapore and Macao as vaccination rates take off and governments get more
confident and travel lanes reopen. So we're highly confident it's going to happen in Singapore in '22. To
what degree, I won't predict, but it's just a question of time for LVS goes right back to where it was pre
COVID. It's just inevitable. So we're very confident.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And perhaps as a follow-up going back to Macao. I would love to just -- if you could provide
any additional color on the consultation process. And what are the kind of the key points of clarification
that you are watching for as you think about how to strategically position the business? Thanks.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Yes, we've been -- I've been involved in a lot of my colleagues in Macao over 2 decades. And we've
seen everything in Macao. I mean we've been through everything. And starting 20 years ago and people
said, oh, you can't do business in Macao. And then Cotai wouldn't be successful. And then we have the
incredibly crippling crisis in '08 and '09. We had smoking issues. It always worked out and we're very
proud of what we've done in Macao over the years. I think our activities, our investments speak for
themselves. I have faith in the process. They've always treated us fairly, and we responded with the
largest investment in any gaming market in the world. So we believe we remain believers. We wait for
the government's advice and direction. We've submitted our responses. But looking at our history, our
success, I believe, we'll be instructive for the future of our business in Macao. And so no more kind of
beyond that. I think it's clear to say that we have a lot of lead in this market.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Hello, everybody. Rob and gang, on Macao's recovery and the potential for more meaningful increased
travel and mobility between Mainland China and Macao, you get the impression, whether it's from
conversations with the government or otherwise, that this is more likely after the Olympics in Beijing in
February?

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

I'll defer to the fellows in the ground. But I don't think we've heard these points of Golden Week and it's
going to happen when the Olympics are over. I don't think we know, and I think it would be silly for us to
predict, Joe. I don't think we can really give you confidence that we have great insight to when the doors
will reopen. But we just know they will at some point. I think '22 will be a turn year. But I don't want to
get into the game of saying it's going to happen this state. I think we said in previous calls, we don't know
when. We just know when it does happen, it's going to be very powerful. It's going to be like Las Vegas. I
mean anybody doesn't see that hasn't spent time in Macao. It's going to be quite a storm of activity over

there. But I don't want to the Olympics or Golden Week or because we -- obviously, we've been wrong
but those who predicted have fallen on the sword. There's no reason to -- Grant, Wilfred, do you have a
different approach to this? Speak up.

Grant Chum
Senior Vice President of Global Gaming Strategy

Yes.

Ying Wai Wong
President & Executive Director

So we agree. Sorry, Grant, go ahead.

Grant Chum
Senior Vice President of Global Gaming Strategy

Sorry, Wilfred, go ahead. I'm just going to say, I mean we see underlying demand continues to be very
strong when the opportunity arises. Now the opportunity has -- maybe has been relatively brief 1 month
here, a few weeks there, but we can definitely see the underlying demand actually across all the different
segments as very strong. And I think Rob referenced the pent-up demand that we're seeing in Las Vegas
coming through. And I think it's not going to be dissimilar in Macao but agree with Rob, that we can't be
really drawing into predicting timing, but we definitely see the evidence on the pent-up demand for sure.

Ying Wai Wong
President & Executive Director

And I think that China will open up to the world when they feel confident that they can control any
community outbreak situations. And that depends a lot on the vaccination rate, which at this stage, stands
at about 80% and the availability of medicinal cure, they're now testing with all kinds of cure methods,
including Chinese herbal methods, and there's a lot of research going into it. So we're quite hopeful
that very soon with -- and they are vaccinating at about 1.3 million, 1.4 million people a day. So if they
continue like this in another 200 days, it will be another 10% of the population. So I think as China's
vaccination rate goes up, the government's confidence increases. And we're hopeful that Macao, as part of
China, adopting similar policies will benefit from the opening up.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Thank you. Patrick, on the investments on the digital side, can you talk about how you envision
maybe the size of those investments over the next couple of years? Are we talking about relatively small
more modest investments? Or could we see investments in the hundreds of millions or $1 billion range,
depending on what's available and what you like?

Patrick Dumont
President, COO & Director

So it's something we talk about a lot internally. I think some of it's going to be related to the value of
the opportunity that we see. I think sort of our thoughts right now is that we're really thinking earlier
stage or mid stage. But again, it would fit into a larger strategy and that's kind of how we'll think about
being effective for the long term and how we think will create long-term value. I don't know that we'll
necessarily look at something that's transformational right away. That's something that we may consider
in the future depending on where things go and what market opportunity we see. But I think the good
news is we've got plenty of firepower. We've got a strong management team and expertise in the industry,
and we think we can be really helpful to growing technology. So from our standpoint, we're going to be
opportunistic, and we'll see how it goes. But in the beginning, we're going to start small and sort of build
from there.

Your next question is from the line of Robin Farley from UBS.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. I wanted to ask about one of the proposals in the new legislation is that it would require
government approval for dividends. And if that were enacted, I realize just in the discussion stages now.
But if that were enacted into law, would you think twice about investing if you -- if then there would be a
chance that you wouldn't be approved to get a return on that investment. In other words, how much of a
concern would that be for you?

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Pat, do you want to take that?

Patrick Dumont
President, COO & Director

I'm sorry. Yes. I think it -- I think from our standpoint, I think we're obviously very much focused on
building on our past. And as Rob mentioned, I think we have a great track record of investing in Macao
in scale and non-gaming amenities. And I think from our standpoint, we have confidence that what
ultimately will result from this process will be a good path forward. And so we're very confident. We're
eagerly awaiting instructions on how to proceed. But in our mind, Macao is the best market in the world.
We continue to invest. We're very excited about the long term in Macao. And that we'll wait see how things
go. But from our standpoint, we're very confident about the future.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Look, Robin, one thing I think what we're trying to reference is after 2 decades of being there, we've
never found the government to be not thoughtful. They're very thoughtful, and they're going to take these
issues and make it reasonable for all of us. We're not that concerned. I mean I saw initially the response
was like that, big concern. We don't have those concerns. And yes, we're eager to reinvest in Macao. And
we're assuming that the process will be fair and equal and we're also assuming that they want us to invest
as well. The government, they want to see growth in Macao. So we're not that concerned about that issue
at all.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up, just in terms of timing or potential
extension of your existing concession. Is there a point at which you feel like the indication is that it's going
to be extended for at least another 12 months. I mean just given the timing already seems would be --
seems very challenging to do anything before June of '22, given the inability to travel into the country. Is
that safe to assume that at this point, it's not something you would expect to come up for bid before June.
Thanks.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

I don't think we're going to -- we're not going to voice an opinion because we just -- again, we remain
confident in the process to work out. Again, we have 2 decades of history with this government. And it's
been a very good 2 decades. This company built a great business based on it. We've had -- like every
business, you have stops and starts, we've had good days and bad days. But in the 2 decades since we
started the business in Macao, we've always found the government very reasonable, very thoughtful and
very fair. And we're not concerned whether they make that decision next month, the month after or make
it in June. I don't know when they're going to make that decision. I'll let them make that decision and tell
us. We'll respond accordingly. But we have no trepidation or any fear that there will be an issue of this. We
knew this was coming. I mean it is a leasehold. We knew this day was coming, and we're prepared for it.

And we're also fair to wait until the government tells us how they want to proceed, and we'll respect for
that process.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just to maybe follow up on this -- the whole licensing process, I mean I think one thing we've all thought
about is the requirement or the idea that there are probably incremental capital that would need to be
invested either in Macao, theoretically in non-gaming amenities, which you know well, or in somewhere in
sort of greater Mainland China. And just kind of wanted to ask about that last point. Any thoughts on your
desire, your ability to invest directly in Mainland China? Is that something you'd be prepared to do? And
sort of how would you kind of underwrite returns or think about underwriting those given some of your
return focus, if that was the ask?

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

I'm going to refer to Patrick, but I'm going to preempt that by saying we -- again, you know we have
the ability to invest now that's clear based on our balance sheet. We have the appetite to invest. And
we have a track record obviously, we've invested $15 billion. We invested a few billion dollars right
before the pandemic hit, which people thought, "Oh, gee, you want to cloud in-license, we did it." So we
remain willing and eager to invest in Macao and perhaps other parts of Macao and just waiting that day to
happen. Patrick, do you want to jump in?

Patrick Dumont
President, COO & Director

Sure. Thanks, Rob. We're very happy and very proud of Sheldon's long-term vision for Macao and for
our company's investments, we're very proud of what Sheldon and the company and the team has
accomplished over many years there. The amount of investment, the high quality of tourism assets
that we've created, the tourism drivers, the non-gaming diversification. And really to be fair, a lot of the
tourism innovation that we brought to Macao have all been things that have been complementary and
followed through with the original goal of the first concession. And so we're very proud about that, and
we're very confident about the future and our ability to invest in order to support these long-term goals of
the government and for the company.

And so I think as we look to potential things that we may have to do in terms of future investment, we
welcome the opportunity. We would love to invest more. We're very eager to deploy capital into these
markets. We think they're very high quality. And we really believe in the future. So there's just been a lot
of commentary around things that may happen to occur or may have to occur. I don't think anyone really
knows. I think the only thing that we're very confident about is our ability to invest, to innovate from the
tourism side and to drive really the support of the initiatives that have been asked of us. So from that
standpoint, we're ready to do it. But until we get clear direction, there's not really much more we can say.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And maybe just as the follow-up, sticking with the investment theme, probably for you, Patrick, but
just thinking about the -- like the same question for Singapore. Obviously, there, you have a little bit more
of a developed path on dollars that have been allocated and when you want to get going. But can you just
give us the latest on when you think you'd actually be moving on some of the investment you guys have
committed to make there and building out the additional hotel tower and expansion?

LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Sure. As we've said before, I think we're very excited to do it. It represents a tremendous opportunity
to support Singapore's goals to deploy a significant amount of capital in the most privileged market
in the world, which is really one of the great cities in the world. Singapore is growing. It was growing
tremendously before the pandemic. And they've really been leaders in their public health initiatives to
support their population during the pandemic. So we're very proud to be there. I think we would love
to get started as soon as possible. But right now, they're dealing with a lot of things that have a higher
priority. So we're waiting patiently. We have a long-term partnership with the government, and we're
looking forward to working through the open remaining items so that we can begin. But our plan is to
begin and we're very excited about it. So the question is when, and I think that's going to be dictated by
necessary public health responses around timing and opening.

Operator

Your next question is from Ben Chaiken from Crédit Suisse.

Benjamin Nicolas Chaiken
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Hey, everyone. There's been lots of conversation understandably about investing in digital and future
investments that may be required in Singapore and Macao. But at the same time, you spoke about pent-
up demand in Macao and Singapore, which seems to make a share buyback at these levels potentially a
more compelling ROI. I guess, how do you balance the optionality of those different options, I guess, yes?

Patrick Dumont
President, COO & Director

So we think about this a lot. We spend a lot of time on it as a management team. We run a lot of
sensitivities and scenarios around potential returns. And it's interesting. We have a lot of opportunity as
a company. We're really excited about it. And I think our highest and best use of capital and to create the
best shareholder returns really is to develop new projects from the ground up. That's how we built the
company. That's how we've always created the return profile that has made our equity very compelling.
And so from our standpoint, that's our focus. Rob and the rest of the team spent a lot of time looking at
new development opportunities in many different jurisdictions. And so we're focused on deploying capital
into those jurisdictions to grow the business.

At the same time, we recognize there's opportunity in the equity. And in the past, we've always returned
excess capital through share repurchases. And so that's something that we'll look to do in the future. But
at this point, I think we're evaluating a lot of opportunities for real growth. And so from that standpoint,
we're very excited, but we'll always look at the return potential of buying equity. Do we believe the equity
is at a compelling level? Absolutely. But at the same time, we also like to believe that we have some real
significant development opportunities in the future that will create very significant returns as well. So to
your point, it is a balance. But we look at it, and we're trying to allocate capital in the best way that we
can.

Your next question is from the line of Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo.

Daniel Brian Politzer
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So on Singapore, how do you think about margins for this property over the next couple of years? I think
there's a higher tax rate that goes into effect and potentially impact from construction disruption and
possibly some of the costs you were able to optimize over the past 18 months. So going forward over the
next couple of years, how do you think about that given the expectation for pent-up demand to come back
in 2022?

LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Well, first of all, I look at what's happened, again, it's instructive look at Las Vegas. The so-called 4-year
recovery took again about less than a year. I think Singapore is a viable Las Vegas in terms of the pre-
COVID recovery being stronger, which means stronger margins for us and bigger growth. I think this
market in Singapore is proving very resilient in the past, especially when the governments come open the
travelings, open the doors up, I think margins will be just fine. We didn't -- by the way, we didn't furlough
people and lay off lots of people, didn't squeeze people out the door, we stood by our employees. And I
think we didn't necessarily maximizing credit. We decided not to do that. And I think that's to our credit.

But on the other hand, I think our business there will reoccur back to pre-COVID levels and probably
beyond pre-COVID. And again, if Vegas is instructive, and I believe it is, the demand is going to be
extraordinary in Asia. The lockdown here in Las Vegas was much shorter than the lockdown in Asia. Yet
the gambling proclivity for lot of Asian countries is stronger than Las Vegas. So anybody who thinks
Singapore is not going to come back with a vengeance, I think has mistaken, the same in Macao. And of
course, those revenues will drive our margins. So I have no fear that we're going to return to pre-COVID
margins and pre-COVID revenues and exceed both. In fact, I'm really bullish on Singapore, will be the first
and the best place open next year for the gamer or for the tourists or for the leisure traveler. It's going to
be exceptional plan to revisit.

You see where the government is going. I mean they've indicated they're anxiously get open there.
Vaccination rates are soaring. The traveling to be established. The neighborhood is being better in
Malaysia, Korea, Japan. Indonesia is still lagging, but coming on. So I think it's just question of time, '22 is
a turn year. So we see margins and revenues and EBITDA as being much more back to normal than in the
last 24 months.

Daniel Brian Politzer
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just one more on Macao. I mean, when Macao does eventually recover, how do you think
about your share of mass and slot GGR evolving given the opening of the Londoner which we didn't have
back in 2019. And also, I know you targeted a different customer, but how do you anticipate any impact
from Lisboa Palace on your properties? And if so, if there is an impact, which ones?

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Yes. Mr. Chum, are you still there?

Grant Chum
Senior Vice President of Global Gaming Strategy

Yes, Rob, I think history of Macao shows every time we have large scale, high-quality product coming in
on Cotai, it helps the market. And I think when the demand comes back, it's going to be to the market's
benefit and to the whole industry's benefit that we've got good new product that customers can patronize.
And that applies to Lisboa Palace that applies to what some of our other competitors will be -- will have
opened by then. And obviously, we think first and foremost is going to apply to what we've completed in
Grand Suites at Four Seasons and also the Londoner Macao.

So we're very excited and confident that when the demand returns, all these new projects, but I would
say, especially our projects is going to be a growth driver for the industry and by implication, we hope that
we will achieve good market share. But I think it's much more about as the history and 2 decades have
shown growing the overall pie. And I think in terms of segments, again, I wouldn't hesitate to say that
it's going to be positive across a very broad base of segmentation of the mass, the premium mass and so
forth.

Your next question is from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Okay, we'll go to the next question. It's

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Just one question here for me. And Rob, I know you're probably tired of answering a bunch of hearsay
questions about the renewal process and this one, it's probably going to be a bit more direct. But I guess,
a simple question is, do you guys see a scenario out there where you are not operating any casino assets
in Macao at some point in the near future. And I'm sorry to be so blunt, but it's a question I think a lot
of investors are pondering right now given the vagueness that has come out of the Chinese government
about what they're actually looking for.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

I do not. I see no chance of that whatsoever. I think we're -- but I'll refer is -- I apologize if I sign a
broken record. But the truth is we've been doing this for a couple of decades. We have the unparalleled
track record. The whole Cotai developer was the one guy did that at Sheldon. One guy put $15 billion in
ground of non-gaming and gaming assets. One company made almost $4 billion EBITDA. And I think we
have been a seller with our employees. So I remain beyond confident that we'll be operating in Macao.
I don't think there's any chance whatsoever that we wouldn't be. And I'm not saying that rhetorically, I
mean that sincerely, every indication we've gotten is the opposite. So we, again, are very proud of our
track record, proud of our development and proud of our investment. But I think the government has
recognized we've been awfully good licensee and partner and friends with China and Macao, and we're
eager to be back there. So no, I don't believe that's a possibility.

Your final question is from the line of David Katz from Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Hi, all. Can you hear me now?

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Yes. We thought you fell sleep on us because you're in Macao.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

There is no sleeping at Jefferies. What I was really hoping to have the team's perspective on is really VIP
gaming because we do spend a fair amount of time talking with investors, with people on the ground, et
cetera, around what the VIP -- what the future of the VIP business really looks like. There have been some
sort of public pressures on it, talk about currency changes and things like that, that presumably would
have some impact. What is the solid recovered core look like in VIP.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Yes. I just want Grant to take that questions he lives and breathes. You're talking Macao, I assume, in the
whole junket issues. Is that right?

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes, I guess.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

Yes. Okay. So let's begin with a little bit of historical perspective. Again, for the 20-plus years we've been
doing business in Macao, we've heard this. This isn't going to work. That's not going to work. This is -- the

revenues will never go anywhere. We've been hearing this for often lot. Segment is going to fall apart. The
latest thing is to say the VIP is going to go away to the junket. So I just remain a huge believer in that
market of all segments. Obviously, we made our strength in the mass premium. That's been our bread
and butter and will continue to be, but I don't think there's every discount. Those who have discount this
segment has done it at their own prowl. I think it can -- it could move to a different channel, a different
way of being available. But the gamers are going to keep happening in all segments in Macao.

As a pre-cursor to Grant's comments, I think you have to realize how powerful this market has been, the
growth has been unbelievable. Those of us who started back in 2002, '03 and '04, never have dreamed
the way every segment just developed. In the 2010, '11, '12 year, it was the junkets that drilled Macao,
that morphed into our premium mass market and now premium mass-mass market. And again, our
company has been more focused on those base mass and premium mass segments. But the VIP has
served the market very well. So I think it will reemerge in a different form with different channels of
distribution. And that's my take. Grant, you're much closer to this, so please speak up.

Grant Chum
Senior Vice President of Global Gaming Strategy

No, I think you said it very well, Rob. I think it's important to remember, again, the -- that the proportion
of profit coming from that segment especially, I think you're more referencing the junket segment versus
our own VIP business is very, very small. It's really low single digit on pre COVID. So I know people spend
a lot of time talking about it, but our business is really geared to that large-scale destination resort with
premium mass, mass, the leisure, the FIT and the future is going to be that structural growth in those
segments as well as the non-gaming, the retail, the mice. And so that's where really our reinvestments
and our asset base have really focused on.

Robert Glen Goldstein
Chairman, CEO & Treasurer

I think the driver -- to Grant's point, the driver that market is always going to be what we're focused
is lifestyle, extraordinary entertainment, restaurants, retail, rooms. That's where our investment is.
You'll see the Londoner, that's where the focus was, the Four Seasons is more towards the very high-end
premium mass. But no matter what form it takes, the gamer is going to keep growing over there and the
desire to come to Macao is going to grow. So whether it'd be the new assets we built another company,
it just enhances the market. And I don't think there will ever be a lack of customers, a lack of visitors to
Macao.

The problem is going to be and the market is going to be back and wherever it's '22, whatever, I think
the problem is going to be lack of capacity, I mean, lack of rooms. That market is always burdened by
new capacity, new lodging because whether it's be base mass, premium mass is no longer a Hong Kong
dependent overnight market. It's a stay overnight market. It's a leisure market, a business market. It's
a spectacular market. And we're going to be there with everybody else trying to get our fair share. And I
think our new assets, if you ever get to see them and we're open to the next year are going to surprise
you. What we've done with the Londoner and Four Seasons is the best thing we've ever done in my
opinion. So we look forward to getting back to Macao and getting back to business.
