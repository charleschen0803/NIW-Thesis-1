DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Dover's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Speaking today
are Richard J. Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and
your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms,
please disconnect at this time. Thank you.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir.

Andrey Galiuk
Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations

Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available
for playback, and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for 3 months.

Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures included
in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website.

We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that
are subject to uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, our
customers, suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to
be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the third quarter
for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking
statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
except as required by law.

With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Andrey. Let's begin with the summary of results on Page 3. As we guided back in September,
July, August trends were positive, and we are exceeding our internal forecast. This dynamic continued
through September. In addition to the improving demand environment, we were very encouraged by our
manufacturing operations and supply chain performance in the quarter. This solid operation execution
had 2 tangible benefits in Q3: first, it increased our capacity to deliver higher volume than expected from
the backlog in our long-cycle businesses and, as you see, the positive impact to the top line: and second,
through a combination of mixed and fixed cost absorption, it drove a robust margin performance for the
quarter.

Demand trends continued to improve sequentially across most of the portfolio. The trajectory continues
to vary by market, and I'll talk more about that, but our diverse end market and geographic exposure is
clearly an asset to us in the downturn.

Revenue declined 5% organically, and bookings were flat, with 1/3 of our operating companies posting
positive year-over-year bookings for the quarter and more than half posting positive comparable growth
in the month of September. We are not out of the woods yet, but the trajectory is encouraging, and we
continue to carry a healthy backlog going into the fourth quarter and into next year.

We delivered strong margin performance in the quarter and year to date. We achieved margin
improvement in the quarter, despite lower revenue, driven by our operational multiyear efficiency
initiatives, gaining further traction and by improved business mix, some of which we highlighted at our
recent Investment Day focused on the Pumps & Process Solutions segment and biopharma business in
particular.

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

With the strong results to date, we expected to over deliver on our full year conversion margin target and
are now driving towards achieving a flat consolidated adjusted operating margin for the year.

Cash flow in the quarter was strong at 17% of revenue and 127% of adjusted net earnings. Year-to-date,
we have generated $117 million more in free cash flow over the comparable period last year, owing to a
robust conversion, management and capital discipline.

As a result of our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year and a solid order backlog, we are raising
our annual adjusted EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.45 per share. We are not in the clear on the macro
backdrop, and performance remains uneven between markets, but we believe that our performance to
date and the levers we have in our possession will enable us to absorb any possible dislocations in the
fourth quarter should they materialize.

Let's move to Slide 4. General industrial capital spending remains subdued in Q3, resulting in a 10%
organic decline for Engineered Products driven by softness in CapEx levered industrial automation,
industrial winches and waste handling. Additionally, our waste handling business had the largest quarter
ever in the comparable period last year, making it a challenging benchmark. On the positive side,
aerospace and defense grew double digits on shipments from a strong backlog, and we've seen robust
recovery in our vehicle aftermarket business after a difficult couple of quarters. The productivity actions,
cost actions and favorable mix minimized margin erosion in the quarter, nearly offsetting the impact of
materially lower volumes.

And Fueling Solutions saw continued, albeit sequentially slower growth in aboveground equipment in North
America on EMV compliance and regulatory activity, whereas national oil companies in China continued
to defer capital spending amidst ongoing uncertainty. Demand for belowground equipment has improved
sequentially as construction activity restarted, but remained subdued globally. And in China, we're still
weathering the roll-off of the double-wall replacement mandate.

Margin performance in the segment was very good and a testament to operational focus and capability of
the management team and was achieved through productivity improvements, cost controls and favorable
regional mix, more than offsetting volume underabsorption.

Sales in Imaging & Identification declined 8% organically due to continued weakness in digital textile
printing. We've seen improving demand for textile printing consumables, reflecting recovering in printing
volumes, however, has been insufficient to prompt fabric printers to invest in new machinery. We expect
conditions to remain challenged for the balance of the year.

Marking and coding was flat on strong demand for consumables and overall healthy activity in the U.S.
and Asia, despite lingering difficulties with customer site access and service delivery. Despite segment
margins being down relative to the comparable quarter driven by digital printing volume and fixed cost
absorption, margin improved in marking and coding on flat revenue as a result of the mix of effect on
consumables and operational initiatives undertaken in prior periods, which also provide a solid base for
incremental margins in 2021 as textiles recover.

Pumps & Process Solutions continued to demonstrate the resilience of its product portfolio, some of which
we highlighted in last month's Analyst and Investor Day. Strong growth continued in biopharma, medical
and hygienic applications. Plastics and polymers shipped several large orders from its backlog, which were
initially slated to ship in Q4, getting it to a slightly positive revenue performance year-to-date.

Compression components and aftermarket continue to be slow on weaker activity in U.S. upstream and
midstream. Industrial pumps activity remained below last year's volumes, but has improved sequentially.
This was another quarter of exemplary margin performance in this segment, with more than 300
basis points of margin expansion driven by broad-based productivity efforts, cost control in impacted
businesses, favorable mix and pricing, which more than offset lower volume in some of the portfolio.

Refrigeration & Food Equipment posted its first quarterly organic growth since early 2019, which is a
welcome sign, in line with what we saw exiting the second quarter. Moreover, the recovery was broad-
based. Our food retail business, the largest in the segment, grew organically on restarted remodeling
activity in supermarkets. Belvac, our can making business, began shipping against its record backlog,

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

which we believe is in the early innings of a secular growth trend. Heat exchanges were approximately
flat, with continued weakness in HVAC, offset by strength in residential and industrial applications,
including semiconductor server and medical cooling. Commercial food service improved, but margins
remain impacted due to continued weakness in institutional demand from schools and similar venues,
while activity in large chains has slowly recovered.

Cost actions taken earlier this year as well as improved efficiency and volume more than offset the
demand headwinds in food equipment, resulting in appreciable margin accretion. We expect to continue
delivering improved comparable profits in this segment in line with our longer-term turnaround plan.

I'll pass it to Brad from here.

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone.

Let's go to Slide 5. On the top is the revenue bridge. As Rich mentioned in his opening remarks, our top
line continues its recovery, with each segment posting sequential improvement over Q2. Several of our
businesses, including plastic and polymers, beverage can making and food retail, returned to positive
organic growth in the third quarter, while biopharma continued its strong growth trajectory from prior
quarters.

FX, which had been a net revenue headwind for us since mid-2018, flipped in the quarter and benefited
top line by 1% or $12 million driven principally by strengthening of the euro against the dollar.
Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $3 million. We expect this number to grow in
subsequent quarters.

The revenue breakdown by geographic area reflects sequential improvement in each major geography,
but particularly encouraging is the trajectory in North America and Europe. The U.S., our largest
market, declined by 4% organically due to softness in waste handling, industrial winches and precision
components, partially offset by a strong quarter in our aboveground retail fueling, marking and coding,
beverage can making and food retail businesses, among others.

Europe declined by 4% organically, a material improvement, compared to a 19% decline in Q2 driven by
constructive activity in our pumps, biopharma and hygienic and plastics and polymer businesses.

All of Asia declined 10% organically, while China, representing approximately half of our business in Asia,
posted an 8% year-over-year decline. We continue to face headwinds in China in retail fueling due to the
expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and slower demand from the local national
oil companies. Outside of retail fueling, we saw solid growth in China.

Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were nearly flat, down 1% organically year-over-year
compared to a 21% decline in Q2, reflecting continued momentum across our businesses.

In the quarter, we saw organic declines across 4 segments, but sequential improvement across all
segments, and a particularly strong bookings quarter for our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment
driven primarily by record order intake in our can making business. These orders relate to large projects
that are mostly projected to ship in 2021 and 2022.

Overall, our backlog is currently approximately $200 million or 14% higher compared to this time last
year, positioning us well for the remainder of the year and into 2021. Note that a material portion of the
backlog increase was driven by orders in our can making business, which I mentioned above.

Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 6. On the top of the chart, despite a $77 million revenue decline
in the quarter, we were able to keep our adjusted segment earnings approximately flat year-over-year, a
testament to our proactive cost containment and productivity initiatives that helped drive 100 basis points
of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Some of the recent initiatives will continue supporting margins
into 2021.

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted net earnings declined by $3 million, principally driven by higher
corporate costs related to deal fees and expense accruals, partially offset by lower interest expense and
lower taxes on lower earnings. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately
21.5% for the quarter, substantially the same as the prior year. Discrete tax benefits quarter-over-quarter
were approximately $2 million lower in 2020. Rightsizing and other costs were $6 million in the quarter,
relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into this year.

Now on Slide 7. We are pleased with the cash performance, with year-to-date free cash flow of $563
million, $117 million or 20 -- over last year. Our teams have done a good job managing capital more
actively in this uncertain environment, and with the improving sequential revenue trajectory in the third
quarter, we rebuilt some working capital to support the businesses and our customers.

Free cash flow now stands at 11.5% of revenue year-to-date going into the fourth quarter, which is
traditionally -- which traditionally has been our strongest cash flow quarter of the year.

With that, let me turn it back to Rich.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Brad. I'm on Page 8. Let's go segment by segment. In Engineered Products, we expect similar
performance as the third quarter. Vehicle aftermarket had a very good Q3 as the business was able to
deliver on pent-up demand. Notably, we have a tough comp in Q4 due to some promotional campaigns,
but this is a business which has excellent prospects for 2021.

Activity in waste handling is picking up with private haulers, but orders placed are mostly for 2021. We
expect municipal volumes to remain subdued for the balance of the year. Demand is reaccelerating in --
for digital solutions in this space. And overall, we are constructive on the outlook for this business into
2021.

We are seeing some encouraging signs in industrial automation and automotive OEM markets, in
particular, in October. Aerospace and defense continues to be steady. Most of what we plan to deliver in
the next quarter is in the segment's backlog, so we don't expect material upside and/or downside from our
forecast. We expect margins to be modestly impacted by volume and negative mix relative to Q3 largely
due to demand seasonality.

Fueling Solutions remain constructive, finishing the year and into '21. As we've been guiding all year, we
have a tough comp in Q4 due to record volumes in the comparable period. Despite the top line headwinds,
we expect to hold year-over-year absolute adjusted operating profit as a result of our efforts done on
product line harmonization, productivity and pricing discipline. We expect 2021 to be a good year, as
demand trends remain constructive for our aboveground and software solution businesses, and we turned
the corner on belowground fluid transfer and vehicle wash.

Imaging & ID should remain steady. We saw robust activity in marking and coding exiting the third
quarter, and the backlog in the business is higher than last year. Activity in serialization software space is
also picking up nicely. In digital print, demand for inks has picked up, which is a sign of improving printing
volumes. We are seeing a pickup in quotations for new machines, but we expect a few more quarters
before we return to normal levels in this market.

In Pumps & Process Solutions, we expect current trends to continue, with biopharma, plastics and
processing continuing the robust trajectory and pumps recovering to more normal levels, particularly in
defense and select industrial applications. Compression product lines within the precision components
exposed to mid- and downstream are likely to see continued weakness in Q4, as projects and maintenance
continue to be deferred. Overall, the Pumps & Process Solutions outlook is supported by segment backlog
that is in line with what we had at this point last year.

Let's get on to the last segment, Refrigeration & Food Equipment. First, as I said, we were in the early
innings of what we believe to be a multiyear secular build-out of can making capacity, as evidenced by

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

our backlog, driven by the transition from plastic to aluminum containers and also the spike in demand for
cans at home consumption of food and beverages.

In Food retail, we delivered low teens margin for Q3 converting on our backlog, providing us a baseline to
reach our 2021 margin aspirations. Our backlog is beginning to build moving into 2021. As you all know,
this is a seasonal business, so Q4 volume and fixed cost absorption declines in Q4. And frankly, it's all
about 2021 from here, and Q3 was a sign of good progress.

We have a robust backlog in heat exchanges and are constructive on this market. Our capacity expansion
projects are being completed, and we have some interesting new products in the pipe.

Finally, in commercial foodservice, large chains should continue to support activity, but will not fully offset
weakness on the institutional side. Overall, for the segment, comparable profits and margins for the
segment are forecasted to be up in Q4 to the comparable period.

With strong margin performance to date, we intend to deliver approximately flat year-over-year adjusted
margin this year, despite a lower revenue base. As you may recall, we entered the year with a program,
entailing $50 million in structural cost reductions as part of a multiyear program highlighted at our 2019
Investor Day. We actioned more structural initiatives, which resulted in approximately $75 million of
permanent cost reduction in 2020, leaving a $25 million annualized carryover benefit into 2021.

We view this as a down payment on the 2021 portion of our multiyear margin improvement journey, and
we'll update that with more to come on '21 when we report the fourth quarter.

We expect robust cash flow this year on the back of solid year-to-date cash flow generation and target
free cash flow margin at the upper end of our guidance between 11% and 12%. Capital expenditures
should tally up to approximately $150 million for the year, with most of the larger outlays behind us.

In summation, we are our raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.45 per share for the full year,
above the top end range of our prior guidance. We remain on the front foot in capital deployment posture.
With several bolt-ons closed last quarter, we have multiple opportunities in the hopper, and we hope to
report on those soon.

And as usual, before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their work and continued
perseverance in these uneasy times.
And with that, Andrey, let's go to the Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So just trying to reconcile the kind of 4Q guide here. I mean, I didn't really hear -- when you walk through
the segments, there wasn't really anything that suggested that any one of these segments or at least
in total are going to be down materially year-over-year. Yet I think your 4Q guide implies a decline in
EPS, and I understand tax rate is going to be a little bit higher, maybe that's like $0.07 or $0.08. But
is there anything that we're missing there? I mean, refrigeration is usually the most seasonal, and the
backlog there was like pretty eye-poppingly strong. So anything we're missing? Or is this just a bit of
conservatism?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Well, I would have hoped that when we did the Investor Day in the middle of the quarter that we were
pretty forthright of what we thought the Q3 was going to be. And we would have hoped that estimates for
Q3 would have moved up and that Q4 would have moved down, and we've gotten either. So here comes
the Q3 is great, but Q4 is going to be a miss narrative. Look, I think we've gone public.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's not from me. Just to be clear.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

No, no, no. That was a general comment. That was not aimed at you at all. So look, we have a bad comp
in DFS, which we've been highlighting all year just because of the fact that, if you recall, we had a bunch
of orders last year. We had some operational issues in the Q3, so we shipped a ton in Q4. That's always
been hanging out there.

We overdelivered to our -- this year's forecast in Vehicle Services Group, which is a lot of the reason
that we did a lot better in Q3. So if you think about automotive aftermarket, we had a couple of really
poor quarters. We had a lot of pent-up demand. I think, operationally, we hit the ball out of the park and
delivered and overdelivered what we would expect our forecast to be, so that gives us sort of a negative
comp going into Q4.

Despite the backlog in refrigeration, I think I would caution you on the segment backlog, while we're
building backlog and refrigeration for '21 deliveries, that backlog figure is materially impacted by the
backlog that we have at Belvac, which is over $200 million worth of delivery.

So -- and finally, we're still getting COVID reports, particularly in Europe, so I think there is an amount
of prudence about are we going to have to take facilities down, are certain regions of Europe going to be
impacted from a demand cycle. So I don't think it's bad news at all. Quite frankly, in some of our higher
CapEx businesses, like waste management, we're getting orders for '21. Clearly, we could build that
product and get the industrial absorption, but I've got absolute confidence in our management team that
let's manage our inventory in Q4, and we start up next year with high build rates.

So overall, is there some conservatism in there? Sure, there is, and that's -- until we get on the other side
of this COVID issue, we'll continue to operate under that stance. But is there anything going on in terms of
any particular market getting worse from the trajectory that it's on now? Absolutely not.

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Just a specific follow-up on that. I think you said hold year-over-year absolute profit in your
comments at DFS for 4Q. Does that mean that's flat? Or was that just, "Hey, we'll hold it within a range?"
And then just to be clear on Belvac, is that still a pretty profitable business?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

The absolute profit comment was for the full year of DFS, so margin benefit outweighs top line decrease.
And on Belvac, it is accretive to the segment margins. We are beginning to do a transition to a higher mix
of turnkey projects, so there's some pass-through revenue. So I think I'll be a little bit careful about the
assumptions of Belvac, but we'll take it because, quite frankly, it's accretive to the segment, for sure.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Rich, you didn't talk about M&A markets at all on your prepared remarks. I just wonder if there's any bit of
an update on either activity out there that you're seeing or opportunities or valuation or anything that you
might share with us.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

It's not a lot different than it was at the end of Q2, and there are some opportunities out there. Valuation
continues to be reflective of the public markets. So despite -- every -- even private companies are
trying to see through the downturn of '20 and want to be paid on '21, so it's pricey out there. A lot of
competition in terms of private equity.

But having said all that, on some of the more niche-y opportunities that we have, we're feeling good about
some of those opportunities there, some of which we highlighted during the Pumps & Process Solutions
Day that we did mid-month. So we've got a pretty good list of candidates, but we're not going to overpay.
And then I think that some of these deals are taking longer because, as you can imagine, due diligence
under pandemic is a bit difficult.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

I'm sure it is. So just moving on, I'm kind of curious on your opinion on capital spending. There's a lot of
uncertainty out there. You've got an election. You've got a pandemic that, obviously, we in the middle of.
But at the same time, money is cheap, and no better time to invest ahead of a recovery, I suppose. So
are your customers delaying capital spending? Is this kind of a normal down-cycle response, and we'll see
a quick recovery? Or do you think there's any sense that things could be a little bit different and people
delay a little bit further just given perhaps higher corporate tax rates and other noise that's out there?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Look, I guess, my overall comment is there's a bit of seasonality, and I'm just not going to do the project
in Q4 because I can do it in Q1 of next year. The general commentary, if I exclude kind of some of our
businesses like textile digital print, which has some secular headwinds associated with it, which are
particular, what we're hearing from our customers is a desire to spend in 2021 on productivity CapEx,
which, generally speaking, is -- makes up about 85% of our portfolio.

So going into '21, as you can imagine, we're beginning to start to do the forecasting and the budget. We
feel good about a lot of our businesses. I think -- look, if you take something like waste handling right

now, the municipalities are going to sit on their hands now until they see what their budgets are for '21.
But on the private sector, we just think that we could build off our backlog now if we want, but I don't
think there's any reason to do so. And we'll hold our powder dry, manage our working capital and come
out at the beginning of the year with high build rates.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Two things, Rich. First, on pumps, I mean, the margins were extraordinary. You mentioned a little bit of,
I think, revenue pull-forward. Was there some kind of additional mix or volume dynamic there? And how
should we think about the margins in this segment going forward?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think there -- I think we're going to have to be careful about promising margin accretion from here.
I guess, we just take it in absolute revenue growth.

But look, my comments on the quarter was on the long cycle side, which is particularly Maag. Timing
those revenues is always difficult because of the size of the orders, and you're dealing with letters of
credits and a variety of things. But my opening commentary, as a general statement, I think that the
operational performance of the group in Q3 was excellent. I think that we're really beginning to get some
traction, and this is across the portfolio.

In terms of what we've been working on, on operational efficiency and supply chain and, look, Maag built
the product. It was ready to go, and we were paid and out the door it goes. So -- and that, generally
speaking, is margin accretive. And you couple that with the fact that the trajectory on the biopharma side
continues on, and you get the margin performance that you see here.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Interesting. And then maybe a 2-parter on the RFE, if I could, actually. So we're seeing actually very
strong results out of some of the food retailers. Albertsons today, actually. Is there any particular unusual
issue with access at this point? Obviously, we've got seasonality, but how do you see that playing out?

And then just a little bit more on Belvac. Are you just seeing kind of -- I don't know, kind of conceptually, I
guess, the switch being flipped on plastic to aluminum? Does something really dramatically changed in the
thinking of your customer base here?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Let's deal with Belvac first. I'll flip the answer. Capacity has been extremely tight. It was tight in
2019, and then COVID flipped it over in terms of the demand function. You think about beer, right? No
one's consuming keg beer. It's all flipped into cans, so there's been a surge in terms of can demand.

And if you go look at some of the bottlers, they've been bitching about can pricing for some time. So here
comes the capacity wave. These are big projects, so the planning period to get them up and going. We've
known about them coming, I would say, for a year now, but I think the COVID really drove the demand.
So you've got the COVID issue in terms of the transition to kind of more at home, if you will.

Overarching all that, you have this issue with PET and recyclability and a variety of other things, so that's
why you've got a pull forward in terms of this massive capacity expansion being announced, which is
driven by the shorter-term demand cycle. But I think that the can makers would tell you that they believe
it's secular because they think that they have an advantage from an environmental point of view. So for

us, we think that this is 2 to 3 years minimum in terms of the secular trend for us, in particular, on the
machinery side.

Back to refrigeration, look, we expected this year to be better. I know it's a low bar in terms of the
demand function, and we got negatively impacted by COVID because of access rights and everything else.
We ran at capacity in Q3. As I mentioned in my comments, we did low teens margin for the refrigeration
piece of the business, which is a good harbinger in terms of what we're capable of doing level loaded.

Q4, it's all about -- there's a seasonality portion of this business. You generally don't do store
refurbishments going into the Christmas season because, I think, it's going to be a stay-at-home
Christmas, clearly, so they're going to protect their infrastructure. But we are beginning to build a backlog
for '21 delivery now, so you'll see some underabsorption in Q4. But as I mentioned in my comments, it's
all about '21 for us here.

Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

You mentioned just now, Rich, it's all about '21, and I fully agree. Maybe on that point, Slide 9, I suppose,
you gave a little bit of color on the cost savings and that $25 million carryover into next year. Just clarify
perhaps that there will be extra cost saving measures on top of that, that we'll probably hear about at Q4
earnings.

And also, any way to size the return of some of those temporary cost outs that are not semipermanent?
Just to try and understand any magnitude on that for next year.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

To your first question, we said that we were going to -- it was a 3-year program of $50 million a year.
We've pulled forward $20 million to $25 million into this year, so you get a calendarized carryover. But
the fact of the matter is we've got enough in the pipe that we're confident that we'll get the $50 million.
And to the extent that we can work hard on it, we'll get kind of the roll forward of the calendarization
carryforward in '21. That's what I can say about in terms of absolute structural cost takeout.

On the temporary side, I think that we need to be careful because a lot of the temporary was based under
furlough legislation that was available, okay, and that is going to be dependent on revenue and volumes,
so let's kind of put that aside for a moment. The rest of what we can call temporary or controllable is on
the SG&A side.

Look, at the end of the day, we would hope to build out -- build back comp, so that's a headwind. But I
think that's important for morale around here. But on the other hand, clearly, on T&E and some of the
other things, I do not expect us to come back to 2019 levels, no matter what the revenue profile is for '21.

So look, at the end of the day, Julian, it's going to be embedded in whatever guidance we give you for '21,
but we don't expect a full snapback to kind of 2019 comp SG&A levels.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I understand. And anything, Rich, you could remind us on around kind of normal operating leverage that
we should expect at Dover, assuming next year revenues are up, but not dramatically, let's say?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's -- look, we have a wide range of margin profiles between the businesses. And depending on what
the starting point is, then the leverage is going to be different.

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

So you heard the question before about Pumps & Process Solutions. I think it's fair to say that you're not
going to get a lot of fixed cost absorption out of that particular segment, but any revenue that we get at
current gross margins is going to be highly accretive. So we look at it that way for that particular business
as opposed to digital textile printing, where you've had a very difficult time this year. We think that the
operational leverage when that comes back is going to be in excess of gross margin level. So it's a bit of a
mixed bag, depending on the current trajectory between '20 and '21.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That makes sense. And maybe just on the revenue line then for next year. DFS, I think you'd mentioned
a good outlook for next year. I suppose that the bookings have been tough for 2 quarters, probably tough
again in Q4, and you have those question marks around U.S. EMV that always get brought up. So maybe
don't focus too much on that specific piece, but maybe help remind us why you feel good about the DFS
top line next year.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

I'm glad you asked that question because, as we mentioned, we did -- when we did the Investor Day for
Pumps & Process Solutions, that we were going to do another one this year, we'll be announcing shortly
another virtual Investor Day, which we will concentrate on the Fueling Solutions business and hopefully
answer all your questions about '21 trajectory and what we think the strength of that business is.

Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Rich, can you give us more color into the progress you've been making in refrigeration in terms of margin?
At one point before the pandemic, you talked about hitting that 15%. You did have double-digit margin in
the quarter for the first time in over a year.

But looking out into 2021, have you seen enough from them in terms of execution in that segment
and what you have in backlog? You talked about Belvac, so you get continued sort of nice margin
improvement, and you can hit those goals that you set for yourself.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

We're not all the way there yet. We're not getting the benefits of the automation in terms of the labor
content, so we actually got to low teens margin in the quarter without that. So everything is pointing up. I
think it is purely going to be a function of the demand profile of the business in '21.

What we can see right now, what we hear from our customer, I think it's going to be proactive for '21. So
meaning it looks like, barring another wave of COVID, that revenue should rise for refrigeration next year,
and we'll get the benefit of both the productivity and the operational leverage.

So we're not -- it's not all in the bag yet, but we're cautiously optimistic based on what we've seen in Q3.
And I would not panic about Q4 just because of the negative leverage that we're always going to get in
that segment. Like I said, it's all about '21 from here.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then, Rich, you mentioned you're going to have that DFS Analyst Day. But if you step back, I
mean, you have 14% backlog growth, as you mentioned. You sound pretty constructive about 2021. So as
you look out, are there any businesses other than DFS that you're more worried about? Or do you actually

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

have pretty good backlog visibility at this point, maybe even better than average, toward growth in most
of your segments in 2021?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

We worry about them all, but I think I mentioned a few. I think that we've been proactively prudent in
ESG by cutting capacity early just because of this municipal issue, so we would expect to carry some
negative leverage from '20 into positive leverage in '21.

We feel really good about Vehicle Services Group for '21 based on mostly the amount of miles driven, the
amount of used cars that are out in the fleet, and I think that management has got a lot of really great
productivity initiatives in the pipe coming there.

Let's see. I mean, I don't want to go through them all one by one. Refrigeration, we talked about. We'll be
cautious on digital printing. That's probably going to be a second half of '21 in terms of the upturn. And
look, and if Pumps & Process Solutions just can continue the trajectory that they're on, that is absolutely
satisfactory.

So we're not out of the woods. We've got some business in terms that are highly leveraged towards
CapEx. It's a little bit of a wait and see, but our -- we're in the process of doing '21 forecast, and we feel
good about the demand function, and we feel good about the rollover of our productivity initiatives going
into next year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Rich, picking up on the answer on refrigeration. So I kind of went back over some notes here. I think
originally, you had said the food retail automation project was going to reduce labor hours by 50%. You're
going to cut SKUs from 400 to less than 100. You're talking about dramatic declines in base permutations.
Have those objectives been realized?

And you mentioned that the 50% labor wasn't really necessarily in that. So does that mean that, that's
on the comp because it's a matter of timing? Or perhaps the parameters for expectations or cost out or
whatever changed? Just any kind of more color on that automation project would be helpful.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I mean, we are slightly behind in terms of the automation just because we couldn't get contractor
access for a period of time into our sites, so that kind of gummed up the process a little bit. We're
making good progress in terms of SKU management, but that is also a function of the demand cycle and
somewhat a function of us getting the automation up because you need to kind of sell the benefits of the
automation to your customer because those are the ones that you're convincing to change their SKUs at
the end of the day.

So look, I think that we're probably -- taking Q3 into account, we're halfway where we would expect it to
have been under a more normal '20 conditions. I guess I can answer it that way.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

No, that makes sense. Do you -- assuming that the demand trajectory continues, where do you get to
the point where you say, "All right. Automation is done," and now you're getting the full bore of the cost
benefit or the productivity drivers towards, say, variable contribution from future volume uplift? Is that
sometime mid next year or perhaps a little earlier?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It would be -- this is -- it's a bit of a reverse barbell, so it would be Q2 and Q3 of '21 where we would
expect to see the tangible benefits.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. And then I did want to ask you about Wayne, Tokheim. Vontier just went public and they talked
about 2020 is the peak year for EMV. You talked about EMV being strong this quarter as they did. I'm
curious if you would concur with that.

So 2021 is an absolute revenue drop-off. And strategically, is Wayne considering, say, branching into
electric vehicle infrastructure to diversify the petroleum footprint to a greater extent? I know you've got
this alliance with ChargePoint. It doesn't look like there's a revenue or profit sharing mechanism with that.
But what are your thoughts, Rich, just strategically on -- and I realize EMV is very far out, but markets
discount the stuff and worry about it sooner versus later? Like how are you thinking about it?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

John, I don't want to take away from all of the effort that the management team is undertaking right
now to prepare for this Investor Day in November, which should answer all of the questions that you just
asked.

I think that the only thing that I will say that there was some talk about sizing the headwind for '21. I
would caution you that EMV is a North American phenomenon, and our exposure in terms of the North
American market is different than -- so I think you have to size that appropriately, and that our product
mix between aboveground and belowground is significantly different.

We've been carrying around a pretty weak belowground market this year, right? We had talked about the
headwind of double wall for China when we give the guidance of this year, but then you ran into COVID
with access rights and construction and everything else.

So at the end of the day, sure, margins are up. Some of that is driven by EMV demand for sure, but I
don't want to take away from the productivity improvement that the management has done here that has
driven margin accretion, despite the top line.

So what our thoughts are in '21, and I'll leave it to November when we get to it, is that the EMV headwind
is manageable to the extent that the belowground business returns to growth in '21.

Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a question, man, it's sort of been asked in different format. But how do you think of the businesses
that are doing well? How much will be sustainable in 2021? But just trying to see, as things normalize,
do you think businesses mean revert, i.e., things that have been doing well during COVID sort of get a
little bit weaker, and things that were weak get stronger? Or do you see structural changes in longer-term
growth rates within your portfolio post COVID?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Let's see here. Look, the only business that we have that is tangibly benefiting from COVID today would
be biopharma, but that is a business, I think, we sized it up for you. I mean, look, it's great. It's growing

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

fantastically. The margins are terrific, but it's not overly materially weighted in the portfolio, and that's the
one that's benefiting.

I mean, all this -- Belvac is going to benefit, but we believe that, that is more structural than COVID-
related just because of this issue of recyclability and moving away from PET. So we don't think that we
have a COVID tailwind embedded anywhere on our business, so it's purely a question of the ones that are
suffering -- the portions of the portfolio suffering, which ones are coming back.

I think it's fair to say that the one that we're taking a close look at is that our compression business, which
is the one that's levered most to midstream and downstream, whether that demand in terms of CapEx and
maintenance remains subdued in '21 or not. But again, that is not overly significant to the portfolio. We
can weather the storm.

So our expectation is the parts of the portfolio that are doing reasonably well will continue to do so, and
the ones that have been under more pressure will come back on different trajectories based on their end
markets.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And just a follow-up question, and I apologize if it's been asked. I've been getting disconnected. On
textile printing, on printing and ID, textile printing CapEx, you highlighted, it -- digital printing had sort of
weakness. Given the strength in consumer spending, just a little bit surprised that this business would be
weak. Can you just provide more detail as to what's happening there?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

I wouldn't consider it to be weak. I mean, revenues were flat, and margin was up. I mean, yes, the
consumable business is tracking right with consumer goods, which is great. I mean, the printer business
and the service business is still a bit choppy because that still requires access rights by customer locations
and everything else.

Operator

Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Rich, how do we think about the backlog conversion in Refrigeration & Food Equipment? And the reason
I ask the question is, if you go back to like the -- a few years ago, I don't know, 2015, 2018, it's a pretty
one-for-one type relationship between your orders and your revenue. And so clearly, in '19 and then
'20, orders are much better than what your revenue run rate, and I know part of that is the automation
project. But like how do I think about like the length of the backlog and how that converts over the next
couple of years?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me think about this. We are -- look, we give segmental backlogs, and I think that we've sized the
portion, the Belvac that's in there, which distorts that backlog because -- somewhat.

The refrigeration business, in particular, is relatively short cycle, so to the extent that we're getting orders
for 2021 is actually early. Now well, it would have been early, let's call it a month ago, which is a good sign
because it's -- generally speaking, food retailers don't kind of secure capacity. They just believe that, that
markets have been overcapacitized forever, so they just place the orders, and you run through hoops to
deliver it to them. So I think the good news is, based on what our customers are saying about their own
CapEx and maintenance programs, that we expected to be up in '21.

DOVER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

And the other good data point is, is that we're getting orders for '21 now, which is technically early -- a
little bit early. So that's the good news, but I would try to disaggregate our segmental backlog because
you've got Belvac in there, and it's very material.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess, maybe just kind of the one follow-on question would be
just around like capital deployment. I know that you guys reinstituted the buyback last quarter. It didn't
seem like you guys did much this quarter. How are you guys thinking about that versus you mentioned
$200 million to $500 million type deals? Like where are you kind of like prioritizing your investment right
now?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

We're still prioritizing on the inorganic. We had to walk away from one in the quarter because of -- for
particular issues that would have been an outlay in excess of $300 million, so that has changed plans a
little bit.

Look, at the end of the day, it's a wait and see. We've got a decent pipeline. We'd like to convert that free
cash into inorganic investment, but we're not just going to do deals to deploy the capital, right? They have
to be smart and they have to be within the parameters that we've laid out. And if not, then we'll revisit
capital return, and I'm sure that will be a discussion when we have the Board meeting next week.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So we've covered a lot of ground already, but Rich, I want to come back to another comment earlier on
the backlog and kind of the visibility into the first quarter, first half relative to normal. How would you size
that? I mean, clearly, I think you're trying to focus people on the comfort with 2021 over 4Q. I totally
get that. Any way to put some guidelines around proportional visibility this time of year versus what you
would normally have?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

I think that we talked about refrigeration at length, and we've talked about Belvac that we've seen there.
On our longer-cycle businesses, Maag comes to mind; DPC, to a certain extent. We would expect to
deplete backlog in the second half of the year as bigger projects roll off and then you build it up.

We shipped heavily off of that backlog in Maag, and it's not as if we're falling into a hole. So I think the
good news about Maag is that, despite heavy shipments in Q3, that backlog is not depleting at a high rate,
which is -- and that's all '21 just because of the delivery times in those particular businesses.

The balance of the portfolio outside of digital printing is, generally speaking, short cycle. I mentioned
Vehicle Service Group, who had an excellent quarter in terms of shipments and operational performance.
They've got a little bit of a bad comp in Q4 just because they are running some promotional things last
year prior to price increases. But what we're seeing in terms of dealer communication there is very good
for '21. So I think it's anecdotal, so there's no real general comment for our portfolio that's wide. But --
and I think that we're -- the signaling we're getting for 2021 overall is prospective.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. So it's not just a phenomenon where, hey, 4Q is a little weaker and January is awesome, but we
don't know anything else about '21?

'21 deliveries, we could make the product in Q4, right, which positive absorption, negative working capital.
I've got confidence in that business to build that product in 2021 and meet the delivery dates. So to us, as
we've always done around here, Q4 is about cash generation and setting ourselves up for '21.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And then I noticed another automation project announced in Precision Components. Any more,
I guess, kind of spread of automation or kind of evangelizing some of the technology out there across
the portfolio that we should expect beyond Precision Components and, I guess, refrigeration? Is that
something that could be kind of the next wave of cost reduction?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

There's a few of our businesses that lend themselves to increase automation. As we mentioned during the
Pumps & Process Solutions Virtual Investor Day that our expectation is to get on a cadence of doing more
of those, rather than the tour de force on the portfolio.

So one of the things that we're discussing is we have 2 or -- 2 big projects, one of which is completed
in Vehicle Services Group and one that is under construction around that, that we would expect is a
candidate to do some more investor outreach in Q1 of '21.

Your final question today will come from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. There's not a whole lot to run through here. But just go back to Belvac. Is the strength we've seen in
can manufacturing, is the flip side of that, that we faced some structural headwinds in chemicals, plastics,
polymers going forward, so therefore, some of the weakness we're seeing in backlog builders is more
structural than just typical?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Nigel, I'm sure when I talk about Belvac, the guys at Belvac listen and chuckle to themselves how little I
know about can making. So for me to bridge that over into the chemical world on PET, I think you're going
to have to ask somebody else.

Based on what we hear from our customers, both the can makers on the machinery and from the bottlers
in terms of the design portion of the can making, we believe that it's -- there is a structural change
underway. How that impacts PET demand, I'll leave it up to the chemical producers to answer that.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Fair enough. That's a good answer. And then just quickly on heat exchangers. I think you sell into both
commercial and industrial markets. I think you called out a couple of times you've seen an uptick in heat
exchangers. Where specifically are you seeing that strength in the end markets?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

More on the heat pump side than anything else. That's where our particular strength is, and that is where
we are in the midst of completing some material capacity expansions. If you know anything about that

that are being installed, especially on the back of European legislation. So that's really where the demand
function for us is coming from.
