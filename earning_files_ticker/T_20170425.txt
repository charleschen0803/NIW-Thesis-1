Thanks, Mike, and thanks to all of you for being on the call
Before I turn it over to Randall, I'd like to provide you a brief overview of our first quarter results
We opened the year on a very competitive note
The wireless market moved to unlimited, several over-the-top video players launched new services, and a major cable company announced plans to offer wireless service in an effort to duplicate the integrated experience we offer today
All this reinforced our belief that we are the best prepared for the new world, where capacity, networks, and entertainment intersect
A year from now, we may look back on the return to unlimited plans as the moment when the battle for network reach and capacity began
In a world of unlimited plans and growing mobile video usage, you need a network and the capacity to handle the load and meet customer expectations for quality service
We have just that, and Randall will talk more about that in just a few minutes, but let's first look at the results for the quarter
Consolidated revenues were pressured by record low postpaid upgrade rates in wireless and pressure in legacy wireline from grooming, but at the same time, we continue to operate efficiently and drive costs out of the business
Adjusted consolidated margins were up 80 basis points year over year to 20.7%
Credit for this goes to our entire management team but especially to our technology and network ops group and their work on automation, digitization, and network virtualization
We're well on our way to virtualizing 55% of the network functions by the end of the year, and we are seeing the cost and capital savings from those efforts
We grew adjusted earnings
Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.74, up about 3%
That includes about $0.02 of pressure from storm damage on the West Coast and legal settlements
Also during the quarter, we wrote down the book value of our legacy publishing investment
That was partially offset by gains from a spectrum swap with Verizon
Both of those items were adjusted for EPS purposes
Cash flows continue to be strong
Cash from operations reached $9.2 billion
Free cash flow was $3.2 billion, the same as last year, even though we increased capital spending to $6 billion for the quarter
We had improved working capital and lower tax payments in the first quarter and chose to reinvest those efforts in the business
While this made first quarter capital spending levels higher year over year, our CapEx guidance remains unchanged
This also was a key strategic quarter for AT&T
We made several significant moves that put us in a strong spectrum position for the future
We signed an agreement to acquire FiberTower, a holder of 39 gigahertz millimeter wave spectrum, and we were awarded the FirstNet contract to build and operate a national first responders network
And earlier this month we announced our intention to acquire Straight Path
We have now been informed by Straight Path that their board has received a superior proposal
Under our existing contract with Straight Path, we have the right to negotiate with the company over the next five business days to match or exceed the new bid
We will evaluate the situation and make a decision in that timeframe
And we also received the expected $1.4 billion refund of our deposit from the FCC broadcast auction last week
Randall will provide more insight into our overall strategy in a few minutes
Now let's look at our operations, starting with wireless
Those details are on slide 6. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic Mobility operations are divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments
For comparison purposes, the company is providing supplemental information for its total U.S
Wireless operations
The reintroduction of unlimited plans made an already competitive market even more so
We were disciplined with our response, which was to launch new Unlimited Plus plans that give customers a $25 credit for bundling DIRECTV or DIRECTV NOW with their mobile service
And earlier this month we announced a limited promotion for free HBO for our Unlimited Plus customers
The changes in the market did impact our postpaid net adds, especially in the first part of the quarter before we began offering our new Unlimited plans
Our moves to combine the value of mobile with video have had the desired positive effect
In fact, trends are now back to where things stood before Unlimited plans were reintroduced by our competitors back in February
Revenues were also impacted by fewer phone sales
We had our lowest ever postpaid upgrade rate of 3.9% in the quarter, selling 1 million fewer phones than a year ago, while bring-your-own-device customers remained strong
This obviously impacted equipment revenues and to a lesser degree some service revenues
But, despite all the competitive noise in the quarter, we turned in our best-ever EBITDA margins
Our EBITDA margin was 41.8% with wireless service margins of 49.3%
Postpaid phone-only churn was also a record first quarter low of 0.90%
But with the lower phone sales, we also had fewest postpaid tablet net adds in more than five years, adding about 100,000 new tablets
We did add more than 2 million subscribers, as record connected device net adds and a solid prepaid quarter helped to offset tougher postpaid and reseller results
We also continue to grow our branded smartphone base, adding nearly half a million smartphones in the quarter
Our Entertainment group also saw competitive pressure
Revenue and margins were relatively stable
West Coast storms did drive up expenses by about $100 million in the quarter, with about two-thirds of that allocated to our Entertainment group and the rest to Business Solutions
But these costs, along with higher content costs and our investments in DIRECTV NOW, were largely offset by merger synergies and disciplined cost management
Linear TV subscriber gross adds were consistent with previous quarters, but with annual price increases due to content costs going up
Churn was up, particularly in markets where we don't have broadband to bundle with video
Competitive pressure from cable and the increasing number of over-the-top video alternatives resulted in our video subscribers declining in the quarter
We're taking steps to address the situation, including simplifying offers and bundling with unlimited wireless
At the same time, DIRECTV NOW is an important part of our strategy and continues to add customers
We deliberately pulled back on marketing to give the platform time to mature and improve, and we're seeing just that
You should expect us to be more aggressive with DIRECTV NOW in the second half of the year, with additional features and content
Last week we added 14 FOX affiliates to DIRECTV NOW
You should expect we will be targeting those cities with additional marketing
We're still only five months since the DTV NOW launch, but we like what we see and feel very good about the service and where it's headed
Broadband had a very strong quarter, with 115,000 subscribers added
Our moves to simplify pricing are paying off, and our fiber deployment is making inroads
AT&T fiber is now in 52 metro areas and marketed to 4.6 million customer locations
We expect to add 2 million fiber locations this year, to reach 6 million by the end of the year, and to meet our 12.5 million merger commitment goal by 2019. Now let's look at Business Solutions on slide 7. In the business segment, we saw weaker demand than we expected
business investment as a percent of GDP continues to be low
Growth expectations in the economy have been rising, but we've yet to see that translate into economic gains or demand
We're still hopeful that growing consumer confidence and the possibly of tax reform will turn into increased business investment later this year, but the near-term view is cautious
We also continue to see the impact of technology shifts away from the traditional voice lines and other legacy services
Customers are still buying our strategic business services, which were up more than $200 million in the quarter
And wireless service revenues grew in the quarter, but lower equipment sales pressured overall results
Like in other parts of our business, we stayed ahead with a relentless focus on cost efficiencies
You can see that in our margins
Margins actually expanded by 90 basis points and were the highest in four years, and that included improvements in both wireline and wireless margins
Our business team is doing a good job in a tough situation
Increasing profitability in a challenging revenue environment is not easy
Meanwhile, our international businesses had a very good quarter
We grew revenues in both our Latin American and Mexican operations, improved margins and added customers
In fact, EBITDA has more than doubled year over year
We've made a lot of headway in building our network and our brand in Mexico
We now reach 85 million people with our LTE networks; we've rebranded, updated, and opened new stores and trained our people
We are now actively scaling our customer base to match those investments
We added 3 million subscribers last year, and we had a good start to this year by adding more than 600,000 new customers in the first quarter
That brings our customer base to 12.6 million
Revenue grew and margins improved both sequentially and year over year
Latin America satellite operations also showed revenue growth and margin expansion
Revenues were up more than 10%, even when excluding the foreign exchange lift in the quarter
The bottom line for our video business in Latin America is that it's profitable and continues to generate positive free cash flow
Now, before I turn this over to Randall, let me quickly review our outlook for the year
As we told you earlier in the year, when the FirstNet contract was officially awarded, we would update our 2017 guidance, and we'll update again following the close of the Time Warner acquisition
Because the FirstNet state opt-in process is expected to flow into the fourth quarter, FirstNet is now expected to have little impact on our 2017 P&L results
That being said, the FirstNet build efforts and reimbursement process might have a manageable impact on CapEx and cash flows, depending upon the timing of FirstNet reimbursement
So as it relates to guidance we're still expecting adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single digit range
We're expecting adjusted operating margin expansion even in the current competitive environment
Our capital spending guidance remains in the $22 billion range, but with FirstNet it could be at the higher end of that $22 billion range
And free cash flow is expected to be in the $18 billion range, and it may be a little bit on the low end of the range with the timing of the FirstNet reimbursements
You'll notice that we have stopped providing revenue guidance
The reason is pretty simple: Upgrades rates are hitting record lows
Our revenue forecasts depend on how many phones we expect to sell during the year, and that's uncertain
And we don't know how much demand there will be for any of the new product offerings that come out
Changes in customer phone buying habits have minimal impact on our profitability, but it does make revenue forecasts more unpredictable
With that, I would now like to hand this over to Randall Stephenson, who is going to provide a strategic update on our overall business
Randall?
2018.
John, with regard to that on – as Randall said, the FiberTower itself gives us a base of 39 gigahertz nationwide to really build on and plan on
And so that in and of itself is a great starting point and gives our network team an opportunity to incorporate that planning into our project evolution and this next-generation network
When you look at Straight Path, it really has two holdings, the 39 gigahertz, which would complement FiberTower's and give us that depth that we would prefer, and so that would be great, but it also adds a strong 28 gigahertz piece, which we could incorporate into our network and use that way, or we could, as we've done in the past, use as an opportunity for spectrum swaps to take advantage of other opportunities
I can give you a perfect example; this last quarter I mentioned that we had about a $100 million gain on the spectrum swap with Verizon, where we traded some PCS and AWS – three licenses to get both of ourselves in a better position to serve our customers
So that's where I'd leave us
The 39 gigahertz would be a great depth of position, and quite frankly with FiberTower an opportunity to really plan on that build as we go into project evolution
Thank you
So, hey, Phil, good afternoon
First of all, in the FirstNet process, we'll post the state plans here in June, open up the opportunity for the states to opt in
We'll actively work with the states, try to answer any questions, concerns they have, stay and (30:06) work with them and with the FirstNet organization, who have been really good to work with, and convincing the states that opting in is the right answer
So we'll go through that process through the summer and hope to get the states to move as quickly as possible with the, if you will, encouragement, that we are ready to go, and the first ones that opt in are going to get that first investment in their state, that build in their state, that job creation in their state
So we think that's a good strategy
Secondly, with regard to your question about opting out, there's a couple of things that make it challenging, I think, for a state to go down that route
One is, there is a collection of funding that's related to the contract winner, ourselves, with regard to setting some national standards, setting up portals and other abilities to communicate with FirstNet responders, to communicate with states, to set national standards of interoperability, and so forth
Those monies are committed to the award winner and not to the states
Secondly, if the states choose to go it alone, they take the risk of any project cost overruns
And third, they generally don't have – and quite frankly one of our largest competitors doesn't have any owned network in the states to rely on, so they have a huge catch-up to do with a company like ours
So we feel really good about the process and think that we are going to – we'll be very cooperative, we'll be very encouraging with the states to work with them, to make sure they feel comfortable
But our target is all 56 – 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia
We want to win them all, and that's our goal, so that's how we'll go about it
Randy, you want to take corporate tax?
I mean, with that economic growth, capital investment drives revenue for us, and that's really as important as the tax savings that driving those revenues would really be significant
And we would be able to invest with the cash flow benefit on a more rapid pace than even we are now
So let me make one other comment about FirstNet to make sure (35:22)
We'll make some investments here starting right away with regard to the portals, with regard to the interoperability standard, that kind of equipment, that kind of investment, and that could affect our operating expenses and our CapEx
But we'll get reimbursements from the FirstNet fund, and we're expecting those to kind of generally offset in this year
Secondly, the reason for the not-significant impact on our financial results in 2017 from the overall is that – two things
One, the states opting in probably in the fourth quarter timeframe, at least in large numbers
And two, the spectrum being put to use generally being up and running in probably 2018 and at the earliest late 2017, but probably more like 2018. In the accounting world, those two things will drive the accounting activity, and so the accounting for the spectrum costs and other things that are involved in this really don't start until you place that spectrum into service or until you've got completion of the state opt-in process
That's why we're saying, while there may be some impact, it's not going to be material
But I will add, if we were convinced that a state was opting in, if they had elected so and we had appropriate approvals from the state and the FirstNet authorities, we would be willing to start that investment process right away
We are anxious to get going, and we have the vendors lined up and the opportunity lined up to get it done
Yeah, sure, Mike
Let me say on the share loss, the feature phone continued to lose, but quite frankly with the unlimited plans being announced, we did see an uptick in the family plan losses and the attention on that
As we've come back with these unlimited plans and specifically with the offers to give the (37:43) $25 credit on DTV or DTV NOW and the opportunity for the HBO feature
We have seen the plans come back down, and we believe that part of the reason that's coming back to, if you will, normal or to pre-unlimited offer rates is because it's holding onto the families
We still need to go through that
It's been just a couple, three weeks, so it's early
But, yes, we did see some impact on both the standalone, if you will, feature phone type that we've seen in the past and the family plan
With regard to ARPU, I would suggest to you we still have a little bit to go with regard to ARPU because we have really smart customer base, and they go through this process of figuring out which is the best plan for them and going to it, and that'll continue on
Secondly, we still have some customers on plans that have overage
And, as I said, if they're smart customers, they will migrate over to these unlimited plans and work through that
But we are – I will tell you, if you look at our service revenues for the quarter, about 1% of the decline was really related to a decision we made last year to get out of the resale business in one of our specific large resale contracts, or to reduce that business, because the prices just weren't appropriate, and capacity was going to be important to us for our quality customers
And so we've seen some of the service revenue declines based on our decisions to back off of that reseller market, and I think you saw that in our customer counts
You saw it in our customer counts this quarter, but you saw it in our customer counts at the end of last year in the reseller market
And that was just a solid business decision we made based on realization – ARPU and per meg realization
Let me try the EPS question first, Dave
Let me go to this
If I harken back to a comment I made in a presentation that we had about a penny – $0.02 of pressure in the quarter, a penny from some legal settlements, some IP, and other issues; and quite frankly a penny from some storm costs
And we did not adjust for them
But if you look at our results, taking those out, you see the quarter of $0.76, and you can understand then that the growth rate goes up to just under 6%, and you can understand how we would feel that that quarter supports an ongoing activity
You're right; we could have a step up in equipment sales and upgrade rates
We're just admitting that we can't predict that at this time
But generally speaking, if that happens, we have significant offsets, whether it be the next accounting, whether it be the revenue recognition, or quite frankly if it's just the benefits of having customer additions and the additional service revenues and so forth
So that's something that does not scare us, so to speak
We can manage through that
The third thing is, as we mentioned, the entire team here has been really focused on costs
But as we go quarter by quarter, we continue to increase the network function virtualization percentages, and we're on this march from 34% at the end of last year to 55% at the end of this year
So that's just going to continue on in generating savings, and we're getting to that point where the mass or the base of savings that we have, getting it to 40% and 50%, starts overcoming the reinvestment dollars that are required to grow it
So all that put together, that's why we feel comfortable about staying in the hunt for that guidance and keeping things moving forward
David, Mike just reminded me – one other thing I'll mention to you is that if you noticed that improvement we had in the first quarter in Mexico and the fact that that customer base is now close to 13 million – I think we're at 12.6 million
And it was an investment cycle all of last year, and it's starting to turn
The team down there is doing well
But I'd suggest to you that's another support for our business proposition for the year
We need to keep working at it, and we need to keep that market strengthening, but we feel good about the fact that that provides us another opportunity
Secondly, I will tell you that the DIRECTV Latin America properties are just really – it's a lot of elbow grease
It's a lot of hard work, but they're doing well for us in what is challenging environments
But they are producing, and that's helping, too
So they may not be the focus of most of our discussions, but they sure are helping with our efforts this year
Hi, Amir
That's a good question, Amir
I mean, I feel really good about our opportunities to carry cash flow
And the best way I can explain it is what we saw on margins
The margins improvement was up and down from this cost initiatives, whether we talk about network function virtualization, whether we talk about digitization, whether we talk about automation, whether we – even as we have some challenges with regard to our legacy revenues, we have opportunities then to shed legacy costs
So I'm comfortable with where we're at on cash flows for the year
I will also tell you, the oddity of it is, handsets slow down, we have the outlay for handsets on an up-front basis, and then receive monthly payments for the – payments over time
So, as that happens, even with our next financing with the banks, it actually can relieve some of the pressure off of the companies because the next outlay for, if you will, the equipment outlay for handsets, actually slows
You guys know the background on the Time Warner and its capability to generate cash, and its much different capital intensity structure, as well as its great margin business, so we're very excited on being able to combine the two, about being able to farm out some growth initiatives and some cost savings, and so we look forward to that
We are still on a track to grow cash flows that we believe is so important, to not just – and not at all – I mean, it's very important to sustain and continue to grow the dividend
But not just that, but to create real wealth and opportunities and flexibility for the company on a going-forward basis
Thank you
So, Jennifer, let me take a stab at it, and I'll ask Randall to comment on it
But first and foremost, I think we need to get some clarity with regard to how we measure fiber and whether you measure it by miles of fiber covered or by strands within the payer, within the fiber itself
That gives a differentiating aspect to the magnitude of the dollars being talked about in the marketplace
But you're right, we're on a significant investment in fiber with the 12.5 million fiber-to-the-prem, but quite frankly, because of our legacy of our business, both the local exchange business which we've held onto in that historic Bell operating company business which gives us a tremendous footprint, but also the legacy Long Lines business, which had fiber throughout the country
And so we do have more fiber than anyone else as it exists today
What we look at, though – and we're open
We make evaluations on build or buy all the time with regard to backhaul for towers and that kind of fiber initiatives
What we will do is we will look at all the opportunities out there and decide whether it's going to be cheaper to buy or build
But we are open to it
We believe we have a big lead because of what we've been doing over the last five years in our VIP investments
We believe we have a big lead because we have the largest, if you will, legacy consumer business and the footprint associated with the Bell operating companies, and we also have a big lead with regard to the extensive fiber that was part of the AT&T Long Lines business
So when you put all of that together, we feel very good about it
We continue to invest, I would suggest, at – as much as, if not more than anybody's investing right now in fiber
It's very significant
Jennifer, one other thing I'd add is, and this could be repeated kind of on every question we've had, but the FirstNet contract award and the requirements that it provides to build out a nationwide first responder network and the funding that it provides to do that, gives us a great opportunity to incorporate – and the team has done this – incorporate fiber builds and fiber requirements both – not only for FirstNet in and of itself but anything they can leverage off of that
And we do this with building – as we've talked about before with the one tower climb and putting the AWS-3, the WCS spectrum to use at the same time we're doing the 700 MHz, but in all aspects of the FirstNet contract, it's providing us a real opportunity to leverage off the existing fiber and then to further add to what we consider to be the lead in that market that we have
John and Randall are taking too much time answering questions, aren't we?
Let me take the phone sales first, Simon
And quite frankly, you made a lot of the right points
The first thing is we are seeing a change with regard to next, if you will, and the impact that customers have – are understanding the costs of a phone differently; they're reacting differently
We're saying that not only in the slower (1:00:44), but we continue to have in this kind of 400,000 or 500,000 a quarter BYOD devices
So not only are they – when they do buy another phone, they are holding onto the other one and handing it down, giving it to someone else to use
And so we're seeing that
That is an impact of it
There has been a lot of discussion that most of the changes in the phone's capabilities are software enabled
We talk about it wanting to do it from our network perspective
We're seeing a little bit of it in the handset business, where the upgrades to the capabilities are software focused as opposed to form factors
So that's it
We are actually seeing, so to speak, a slowness in overall consumer activity
It seems like while the consumers – the economics and the consumer world may be improving, it seems like they're being very careful, and so that's a third thing
We have studied it, everything from the amount of tax refund dollars that impacts and when that comes in to all those things we've looked at
I would suggest to you I think it is a more permanent change in the environment because of the change in who pays for it
I don't believe – I'm not trying to suggest it's going to stay at this 30.9% rate
I would expect that it will come back, not only for new phones coming out but quite frankly, for example, as we, if you will, get our network even hotwired more than it is as the Austin-type situation, where you can get multiple hundred meg speeds on your phones, you'll see people want to get those devices, so I think that'll help
But I clearly believe it is a permanent change from where we were in the subsidy model, and I believe that the upgrade rates will be down on a permanent basis
We haven't mentioned, and I think you all know this, but with the move towards carrier aggregation and four-way, which the Galaxy S8 has the capability of doing that, with regard to MIMO and the ability to have the on- and off-ramps operate much quickly and move into that QAM 256, all three of those things are now available for us, and we're working this true (1:04:49) our Austin, and we're seeing tremendous, tremendous results there
So that's what's so encouraging about us, particularly about this continuation of wireless and this opportunity to support an overall broadband solution, as well as coordinate it with a FirstNet build that is consistent with the government's requirements
Thanks
