WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for First Quarter 2020 results. This
call is being recorded for rebroadcast. Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements
in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's
expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred
to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and
subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ
materially from those contemplated.

During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share,
unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions
and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at
wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And
now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the opening quarter
of 2020. I certainly hope that you and your families are all doing well and staying healthy.

First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are on the call with me today. We
have Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO; and Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer.

Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2020 earnings of $1.43
a share, a strong performance despite lower natural gas demand during a mild first quarter. The result
underscores our focus on operating efficiently and executing our capital investment plan. Scott will discuss
our metrics in more detail a bit later in the call.

Of course as we plan for the long-term success of our company, we're also focused on providing essential
service throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As you would expect, the health of our employees and
communities remains our top priority. We've adopted numerous measures to minimize health risks and
instilled in our employees the importance of following the CDC guidelines.

Stay-at-home orders, as many of you know, were issued across our 4 states in late March. Keep in
mind that the full effect of the virus hit Wisconsin and Illinois relatively late and the hardest-hit parts
of Michigan are outside of our service area. Given that timing, we saw only a minimal impact from the
pandemic on our first quarter results. I would also like to point out that we took action to further control
costs even before the virus struck. The first quarter happened to be one of the warmest on record in the
past century. When we saw a mild weather at the beginning of January, we set the wheels in motion to
reduce expenses in areas of our business that would not affect safety, reliability or customer satisfaction.

Now stepping back, as we look more broadly at our business mix, approximately 38% of our pretax
margin for the full year comes from our natural gas delivery business across our 4 state area. Also 1/3 of
our earnings for the full year typically come in the first quarter. So with a strong start to the year, we're
about as well positioned as we can be to deal with the uncertainties ahead. Many of you have also asked
about the status of the major economic development projects that have been announced in our region.
The short answer is rock on. A good example is the high-tech campus that Foxconn is building south
of Milwaukee. The Gen 6 fabrication plant for LCD panels is fully enclosed now and internal buildout is
underway. Smart manufacturing facility is also taking shape with production of components for enterprise
servers and racks expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

In addition, the external structure for Foxconn's network operations center is being erected as we speak.
And to help fight the pandemic, Foxconn and Medtronic have announced that Foxconn will produce a line
of Medtronic ventilators in our state starting this summer.

Obviously, we're keeping a close eye on local economic trends and customer demand for energy. Based on
what we're seeing today, I do not expect any diminution in our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to
7% a year. With minor adjustments, our $15 billion capital plan remains on track. And I'd like to highlight
one area of that capital plan that is progressing well ahead of schedule. That's our energy infrastructure
segment. You may have seen the announcement that we're increasing our ownership interest from 80% to
90% in the Blooming Grove, Thunderhead and Upstream Wind Farms. Pending all regulatory approvals, we
plan to invest another $118 billion for an additional 75 megawatts of capacity.

Folks for our infrastructure segment, we've now committed over 40% of the total in our 5-year plan, and
that plan just began in January. In short, our overall capital plan is low risk and highly executable. We
have ample liquidity, no need to issue new equity. In fact, our available liquidity at the end of April has
risen to $2.6 billion.

And finally, I'd like to cover one other positive development from the first quarter. Just a few weeks ago,
we announced the next important steps in our succession planning process. We're very pleased that Scott
Lauber will become our Chief Operating Officer, effective June 1. In his new role, Scott will have senior
oversight responsibility for power generation like infrastructure and fuels, information technology, supply
chain, supplier diversity and major projects. He also will be named President of Michigan Gas Utilities and
Minnesota Energy Resources, and he will continue to serve as he has as a member of the office of the
chair.

We're also welcoming, as you have heard, a new addition to the team. Xia Liu will be joining the company
as our new Chief Financial Officer effective June 1. I'm sure you know Xia most recently served in the
same capacity at CenterPoint Energy. Xia brings a tremendous amount of depth and experience to the new
role. She began her industry career at Southern Company as a financial analyst back in 1998. During her
career, she also served as the Chief Financial Officer of 2 Southern Company subsidiaries, Gulf Power and
Georgia Power and is the Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer for Southern Company. Xia will
also be a member of our office of the Chair.

These new appointments will bring additional depth and experience to an already strong leadership team,
a team that, as you know, has delivered exceptional results over many, many years. And now I'll turn the
call over to Kevin for details on our first quarter operations. Kevin, all yours.

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start by highlighting the work of our dedicated employees who are providing
safe and reliable service throughout this health crisis. We have sharply curtailed work inside customers'
homes, and 80% of our employees are now working remotely or in the field. Our employees are adapting
to these changes using technology, following health precautions and continuing to work efficiently.
The remote work that's making our company safer would not have been possible without our recent
technology investments.

Although we still have a long road ahead of us, I'm encouraged by the processes and procedures we
have put in place across our companies. Our incident management team and occupational health and
support services employees have been instrumental in executing our business continuity plans and
developing new processes to address changing conditions. We are working hard to support our customers
through this crisis, and I'm grateful that we've also been able to contribute through our foundations to
organizations on the front lines, including local United Ways, hospitals, domestic violence shelters, food
pantries and youth programs. Through these donations and matching gifts, we are providing more than $2
million to COVID-19 relief efforts. It's our way of thanking the people and organizations that sustain our
communities.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Despite these challenges, we continue to make progress on key initiatives. Importantly, we have no
active rate cases at this time, which is a real positive in our current environment. As you may know, the
pandemic has made it necessary to stop disconnections and place a moratorium on new late payment
charges for customers. Our regulators have been supportive, and we're working through the specific
mechanisms for future recovery.

In Wisconsin, the Public Service Commission has made it clear that we are authorized to defer forgone late
payment charges, uncollectible expense and incremental pandemic related costs. To be clear, this covers
all related expenses in our residential as well as our commercial and industrial sectors.

Turning now to our projects. We're on track to add utility-scale solar generation to our portfolio. You
may recall that we have already broken ground on 2 solar projects for Wisconsin Public Service, which
will provide us with 200 megawatts of capacity. Our Two Creek Solar Project remains on time to begin
producing energy by the end of this year. Our Badger Hollow I solar project is experiencing a modest
delay, but will continue to earn allowance for funds used during construction, and we expect it to be
operational by the end of April 2021 in time for the MISO capacity auction.

In February, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved our investment in Badger Hollow
II. Once complete, the solar park will provide WE Energies with 100 megawatts of renewable capacity.
We expect to invest $130 million in this project. And I'm sure that many of you have heard that the
Democratic National Convention has moved from July to August. We've completed a thorough review of
our network in preparation for the potential influx of delegates. And overall, we're in very good shape. And
with that, I'll turn it back to Gale.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Kevin, thank you very much. As we look to the remainder of the year, our earnings guidance for 2020
stands at $3.71 to $3.75 a share. As I mentioned earlier, our actions to date have put us in a very good
position to achieve those results. So today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2020. Again, our guidance
stands at $3.71 to $3.75 a share. Also a quick reminder about our dividend. In January, our Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6325 a share that's an increase of 7.2% over the
previous quarterly rate. We continue to target a payout ratio, as we've mentioned often, of 65% to 70%
of earnings. We're in the middle of that range right now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to
be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. And now with details on our first quarter results and
more information on our outlook for the remainder of 2020, here is our CFO and about to be COO, Scott
Lauber. Scott?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Thank you, Gale. Our 2020 first quarter earnings of $1.43 per share increased $0.10 per share compared
to the first quarter of 2019. This result was driven by our continued emphasis on cost control, a modest
rate increase at our Wisconsin utilities and additional capital investment. We estimate that the mild winter
weather conditions accounted for a $0.10 drag on the first quarter earnings compared to last year.

The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of the first quarter 2020
and 2019 results. I'll first focus on operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense
and income taxes.

Referring to Page 8 of the earnings package, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of
2020 was $627 million compared to operating income of $543 million in the first quarter of 2019, an
increase of $84 million. After adjusting for the impact of the 2019 tax repairs, operating income increased
by $43 million.

My segment update will focus on the remaining $43 million increase in operating income, which excludes
the 2019 tax repair benefit. At our Wisconsin segment, adjusted operating income increased $25 million.
This was driven by several factors. First, operating and maintenance expense decreased $41 million,

6

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

largely due to savings from the retirement of the Presque Isle Power Plant a year ago, additional cost
control measures and lower benefit costs.

Second, our Wisconsin segment margins were $5.8 million lower. This factored in our recent rate order
as well as positive fuel recovery. These positive drivers were more than offset by a $41.2 million negative
weather variance. And finally, depreciation expense increased $8.1 million as we continue to execute on
our capital plan.

In Illinois, operating income increased $23.7 million, driven by a $19.7 million decrease in operating and
maintenance expense net of riders. This is driven by lower repair and maintenance work due to milder
winter temperatures, lower benefit cost and cost control. Operating income at our other state segment
decreased $4.1 million due to the mild first quarter.

Turning now to our energy infrastructure segment. Operating income at this segment was down $1.2
million. As expected, Bishop Hill, Upstream and Coyote Ridge did not provide a material impact on
operating income. Recall that a significant portion of earnings from these wind farms come in the form of
production tax credits which are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. With Coyote Ridge coming
online late last year, fees production tax credits contributed approximately $0.03 per share to our earnings
in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.02 in the first quarter of 2019. Combining these changes and
excluding the impact of 2019 tax repairs, operating income increased $43 million.

Earnings from our investment in American transmission Company totaled $39.8 million, an increase of
$3.7 million. Higher earnings were driven by continued capital investment. Recall that our investment is
now earning return on equity of 10.38%. This is for the November 2019 FERC rule.

Other income net decreased by $25.3 million, mainly driven by investment losses related to our deferred
benefit plans. These investment losses were partially offset the lower benefit expense noted in our
operating segments.

Interest expense increased $5 million, primarily driven by incremental long-term debt issuances at the
subsidiary level to fund our capital investment program. Our consolidated income 2019 tax shares, net
of the 2019 tax repairs, decreased $15.7 million. Lower tax expense was driven by the positive tax effect
of refunding unprotected tax benefits following our recent Wisconsin rate decision. This year we expect
our effective income tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. Excluding the flowback of the unprotected
benefits, we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. Currently, we expect to be a
modest taxpayer in 2020. Our projections show that we'll be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with
our current capital plan.

At this time, I'd like to address our sales and earnings forecast for the balance of 2020. Based upon what
we have seen in April, we are adjusting our 2020 sales forecast. Specifically, on the electric side, our
forecast cast now assumes a 4% increase in residential sales volumes in the second quarter, trending to
an increase of 0.5% by the fourth quarter. For small commercial industrial customers, we are assuming
an 8% reduction in the second quarter, trending to a reduction of 3% by the fourth quarter. And finally,
for our large commercial industrial customers, we are assuming an 18% reduction in the second quarter,
trending to a reduction of 7% by the fourth quarter. Overall, based on these assumptions, we are
forecasting the total retail electric volumes, excluding the iron and ore mine, to decrease by approximately
5% for the remaining 9 months compared to our original forecast.

These revised volumes translate to a reduction of approximately $70 million to $80 million in pretax
margin for the year. We believe that we have the ability to absorb this margin compression through
temporary initiatives as well as multiple cost savings and efficiency measures across the enterprise.
As Gale stated earlier, these initiatives will not compromise our commitment to safety, reliability and
customer satisfaction. So we are confident in reaffirming our annual guidance of $3.71 to $3.75 per share.

Given that the stay-at-home orders are still in place in our region, we are providing second quarter 2020
guidance of $0.58 per share to $0.62 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.
In last year's second quarter, we earned $0.74 per share. We've obviously projected declining in sales

volumes and there are timing differences related to fuel cost recovery. With that, I'll turn things back to
Gale.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and
our stockholders.
Operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So a couple of questions. You touched on this a bit in your prepared remarks, Gale. But can you give us
a little bit more color at a high level, how you just sort of thinking about the duration of the downturn,
i.e., how long are you thinking a recovery is going to take? And maybe just talk about a little about the
sustainability of your levers. This downturn is more protracted, right? So any risk to the 5% growth, any
CapEx opportunities that become maybe secondary in nature? If this downturn is projected than your own
internal planning assumptions?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, good question, Shahriar, let me first say that I think we have been appropriately conservative in
terms of our view of how quick a recovery might take place. And what the extent of the recovery would
be in the near term. Scott covered with you our base assumptions In terms of sales declines. My sense is
that if in the region, we can get the economy restarted by June, that things will evolve in fits and starts.
As clearly, as you know, 2/3 of the economy is driven by consumer demand. And I think the real question
for everybody is how confident will the consumer be in going back to their semi-normal buying patterns.
Having said all of that, I mean, I think we're appropriately conservative in terms of what we expect to
happen to our electric and gas sales volumes. We're confident in our levers and in the dozens and dozens
of initiatives that we have across the enterprise to become even more efficient. We're learning things here
as 80% of our workforce is operating remotely, if you will. So we feel very good about our ability to drive
additional efficiency and cost reductions throughout the business. And we're prepared, obviously, to pivot
either way. If the recovery is quicker then that's all to the benefit. But I think we've been appropriately
conservative. In terms of the capital plan, when you think about the elements of our capital plan, they're
really all about reliability. So I don't see any really need or for that matter, I do see the need to continue
with that capital plan focused on reliability and improved customer service. The infrastructure segment will
be unaffected as best I can tell. And so long story short, we really don't see any threat right now to our
long-term earnings growth rate projection of 5% to 7% a year. I hope Shahriar that responds.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

No, it does. And I just wanted to confirm then and your conservative vendors always comes to light. Let
me just -- since you touched on the infrastructure segment, are you seeing this economic dislocation sort
of -- is it driving any new opportunities in that segment? I mean, you're well ahead of filling that capital
budget. Are any developers facing any cash crunches? People looking to get out of projects, especially
given you have an -- obviously, an advantage with your tax appetite? So can you have a contra effect
where the -- what you're seeing in the economy actually play into the hands of your -- of that segment?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

I would say it's a little too early to give you a definitive answer, but the early indications are, yes, that
there will be some additional high-quality projects. And remember, we are particular about the kind of
projects we're willing to take on in the infrastructure segment. But I would say that given the sharp
contraction in the economy, given the fact that some folks obviously need cash, I think we're going to see
more opportunity. We will be very selective, though, as we work through that opportunity. But I do think
there will be additional projects that we will take a hard look at.

Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Terrific. And then just lastly, can you just remind us if ATC receives a Transco adder? And if so, do
you have any thoughts yet on the recent FERC's NOPR proposal to remove it as we kind of understand it,
it would be kind of a wash if they increase the RTO membership adder by 50 bps? So how -- are we sort of
thinking about this correctly?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

I think so. Although I believe that one of the proposals -- and Scott and Kevin can echo me on this, I think
one of the proposals is for there to be 100 basis point adder for RTO participation. Right now, essentially,
ATC is getting a 50 basis point adder. So there's a possibility there, Scott, I think, of another 50 basis
points in the mix.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yea. That's exactly correct, yes, from what I'm reading right now. So there's potential there.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats, Scott, and Xia on the new roles, and I'm sure Xia will get a little bit more rest at night working
at WEC. So congrats guys.

Operator

And our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I actually have a 2 into the weeds question, so I'll apologize upfront. The first one on the -- as I
understand, I see the $13.5 million in Wisconsin segment, on Slide 8 that is. The $13.5 million decline in
-- I'm sorry, fuel savings. As I understand it, you are allowed to retain roughly $15 million versus your
authorized demand any fuel savings that you might have? Can you just comment on what of that $15
million, if any, have you utilized in the first quarter?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

I think, virtually all of it because of the timing of fuel recoveries, Scott?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Correct. Correct. This is $13.5 million better in the first quarter. And once again, it's -- a lot of it due to
the timing of the fuel recoveries. As you recall, historically, there's a pattern of the fuel recoveries at
Wisconsin Electric that you usually over collect in the first and second quarters, under collect in the third
and then swings back in the fourth quarter. And we just really had some positive fuel recoveries with the
price of natural gas and operating fuel cost in the first quarter. So we're ahead of the plan in this first
quarter specifically compared to last year and compared to our original guidance that we set.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

So Durgesh, what that really means is you won't see as big a pickup in Q2 because we've really eaten the
full amount into Q1 because of -- again, of the timing and the collapse of oil and gas prices.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Exactly.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Got it. That's what I thought. And then just maybe, Scott, the -- any additional color on the other
O&M category, the $22.3 million, what is that made up of? And how is that tracking perhaps versus your
original guidance?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes. So the other O&M, and what we did is we broke it out because we've talked about this before, the
offset of some of that deferred compensation is in the rabbi trust. So this O&M is really the day-to-
day savings that we're seeing from the multitude of operating savings across the footprint. And this is
specifically what's related to -- a majority of it's what related to Wisconsin segment, and there's more in
Illinois and the smaller utilities also. So that's the day-to-day stuff.

Operator

Your next questions comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I appreciate you guys taking the time. Perhaps, let me take this as a couple of clarifications to
commentary and perhaps move it a step forward. When you're thinking about the cost reductions to
offset, I think, the -- you talked about $70 million to $80 million of pretax here. How do you think about
the sustainability of that into '21? And then subsequently, how do you think about this meshing into the
regulatory process at large in Wisconsin? I'll leave it open ended. There's a lot of ways you could interpret
that.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Okay. Well, in terms of sustainability, let me just go back and talk for a second about our track record.
As you may recall, our day to day -- what we call our day-to-day operation and maintenance costs, we
reduced those by 7.3% in 2019 over 2018. Our forecast and plan for this year was an additional 2% to
3% reduction over and above what we achieved in 2019. And now we have put in, as we mentioned, I
mean, literally hundreds of measures across the enterprise. We're learning some things here in terms of
additional possibilities for long-term sustainable cost reduction through what we've been forced to operate
through the pandemic here. So costs, I believe, are going to come down. I would just point to our track
record of sustainable cost reductions to give you some confidence that a big chunk of what we're seeing
here, I think, will be sustainable. And of course that not only benefits the efficiency and the operation of
the business but also over the long term, benefits customers because it takes pressure off retail rates and
allows us to continue without pressure on retail rates, the kinds of important reliability investments that
we're making in our $15 billion capital plan. Kevin, Scott, anything else you'd like to add?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

No...

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Gale, this is Kevin. Let me first say I'm extremely proud of what our employees are doing and how they've
rallied during this COVID virus epidemic. But -- and Gale, you just mentioned that we're looking at day
in and day out, what we can do to be more effective and more efficient, and we're finding a lot of those
opportunities. And as you said, I believe they will be sustainable as we move forward.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Thank you, Kevin.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Excellent. And then if I can follow-up just quickly. Strategically, I know you talked about the
infrastructure opportunities a moment ago, but how do you think about the landscape today as it stands?
We've heard folks kind of backing away broadly from strategic opportunities, given the backdrop of late.
But obviously, there's been a lot of valuations and relative valuations, et cetera. How do you think about
the opportunity today more holistically and beyond past infrastructure?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

So you're specifically asking about, Julien, opportunities in the infrastructure segment?

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I was thinking beyond that, really. I know you just made comments about a robust set of opportunities on
the infrastructure side, but I'm thinking strategically beyond that, more corporate level.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, good question. And I think the answer will be boringly repetitive because we have a set of criteria,
as you know, that we use to look at any potential strategic or acquisition opportunity. And I'll just repeat
them quickly so we put everybody to sleep, but these are important, at least in my judgment. Following
these criteria in our sector, in our industry, I think if you can follow these criteria and actually execute
on them, I think you create shareholder value. If you don't, then I think the story gets a little bit more
muddy. So our really set-in-stone criteria are -- we would have to believe that anything we would acquire
will be accretive in the first full year after closing, we're not going to trash the balance sheet to do it.
We've worked very hard to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and we're not going to
make something accretive by trashing the balance sheet. And then thirdly, and I think, Julien, this would
be the gating question right now as we look at the landscape, we'd have to believe that the growth rate
of anything that we would acquire would have to be as strong as our own organic growth rate or stronger,
lead that 5% to 7% earnings per share growth a year. That right now would be, I think, the biggest gating
question for us as we look at anything around the landscape. I hope that responds to your question.

Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just maybe a little bit more color on sales, particularly if you have data for the month of April. Like what
did overall sales do and by class, so we have an idea? Project for the quarter?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Let me try to --- yes, well, we do have April data. Happy to share it with you. Last time we chatted, I
mentioned to you that we're also looking day to day at the MISO Midwest operator data for the 14 states
in the broad middle swath of the country. So if you look at -- from March 24, which was the date of the
announcement of the stay-at-home order in Wisconsin through May 2, basically, kilowatt hours send out
in the MISO footprint was down just over 8%. We've consistently, day to day, done a little bit better than
that. And I think through the same dates, March 24 through May 2, we're down right around 7%. So

we've consistently done day in, day a bit better than what we're seeing across the MISO footprint. And we
are seeing an uptick pretty significantly in residential usage. Scott, would you like to talk about that?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes. So we are looking at our residential usage and like we've done before, we track our entire system
and our large customers in residential. Using our automatic meter reading and really looking at the data,
we are seeing anywhere to at least 5% plus on some weeks on the residential usage. So when we put
our forecast together, looking at 4% is more of a realistic estimate to be a little conservative. And as you
go through the customer classes, the large commercial customers that we look at, and we track, as you
know, the 17 major segments that we're looking at in our area, and we get reports weekly on it. And
we're seeing between 16% and 18% down there, and that's what we've factored into our guidance here
in the second quarter. And then the third segment is really that small commercial area that we're seeing
down probably about 6% to 8%.

So that's how we factored it in.

Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations, Scott and Xia...

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Thank you.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay, on the $70 million to $80 million reduction in sales, so that's based on second quarter being the
worst of it and then things getting better throughout the year. Can you kind of ballpark where things might
be if, let's say, the second quarter turns out to be -- like the whole year turns out to be in the second
quarter, the third and the fourth quarter as well? Same kind of

reductions?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

We're doing a little meatball math here as we think about responding appropriately to your question.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes. So if you would take that second quarter, trend it out and carry the whole year, that may be another
$10 million $15 million and that's the ballpark number we've been thinking about here, if that would be
the case scenario. I mean, once again, we're seeing things start up and then kind of go back down, and
we anticipate as the say-at-home orders start to open up, we'll see some movement here. But we were --
we do have those kind of bookends here, and we're watching it every day.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

I think Scott's exactly right. If -- as we've done our sensitivities, even if the second quarter became the
third quarter and the fourth quarter, I think we're still under $100 million in terms of pretax margin loss.

Yes. So summertime has already been factored in this?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Absolutely.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And also, does that apply to both electric and gas customers? I mean not that gas would be much of a
factor. I'm curious if it's only electricity.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, no, we factored in both gas and electric. I would remind you, though, that the second and third
quarters for gas deliveries are very minimal. Our big quarters, obviously, are the heating seasons. So
Q1 and Q4 for natural gas. But we have factored in. And again, I mean, our natural gas deliveries were
largely unaffected by the pandemic in Q1, but we have factored in some reduction in Q4, assuming the
world is not back to total normal for gas deliveries.

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Gale, I would add to it, in my prepared remarks that we still are expecting the Democratic National
Convention to come here. And if it does and the markets open up, then there will be a lot of kilowatt-hour
usage during that summer period as well, which will help.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I think I missed this before. I heard something about regulatory treatment or COVID-19 expenses. Like
right now you have residential escrow accounting in Wisconsin and a rider in Illinois [indiscernible] at least
for bad debt. Is there any -- are there any other mechanisms being discussed or contemplated at this
point?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes. First of all, the Wisconsin Commission was the first in the country to basically set up a regulatory
mechanism. We are being asked -- all the Wisconsin utilities are being asked to track and defer direct
additional expenses related to response to the COVID pandemic, number one. And number two, since
we've all agreed not to disconnect any customers during the pandemic, we're going to be allowed to
defer and track for future potential recovery, any late fees that we cannot levy and resulting bad debt.
But as you say, for Wisconsin, we already have escrow accounting for residential bad debt. Then you
pop to Illinois, there's a docket underway right now. In fact, there are kind of -- there are dockets really
under way in each of the 4 states. The next furthest along would probably be Illinois where, again, no
disconnects, no late -- no new late fee payments. And the commission there is going to ramp up that

docket sometime in the next few weeks. So -- but I would remind you that we are decoupled in its natural
gas delivery only in Illinois, and we're decoupled in Illinois. So that's obviously helpful as well. Scott,
anything to add?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

And in Illinois, also, there was already in place collection of bad debt expense for both residential and
commercial industrial in Illinois. So that's already in place.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

There's a bill rider that's historically been in place there.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just out of curiosity, that Amazon opened one their warehouse, right? It just got started up recently,
just in time. That -- is that seeing any kind of -- any ramped up activity that -- beyond what you were
expecting? Or any plans for doing something more there?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

As a matter of fact, yes, there is another site that Amazon is looking at right now in one of the suburbs.
That would be their site for same-day delivery. That's going through a citing and approval process right
now, but it's an existing warehouse. So -- and my understanding is it's about 400,000 square feet. So yes,
Amazon is actively looking at potential expansion here as well.

Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

First question for Gale. What would you say the odds are of the NBA resuming this season?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Great question. I -- here's what I can tell you. The league very much wants to resume. They have talked
about even potentially restarting a part of the season as late as August. But I think there's a very strong
desire on behalf of the league to, in some way, shape or form, get to a meaningful playoff. Now having
said that, my own personal guess is if that does happen, it would be a broadcast-only event without fans
in the stands. But if I were a betting man, I would say, odds are better than 50-50 that there will be some
resumption of the current NBA season, even if it means a delay in starting the next season.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

All right. I hope so. As much as I love reading about utilities, I do miss sports. Next question...

All right. So next question, on the first quarter weather, I see the earnings package shows a roughly $45
million hit year-over-year. What would that be versus normal?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

It was about, oh, gosh, it's about $0.07 compared to normal. So about $28 million, $29 million?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, $28 million to $30 million.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. So in terms of the cost savings, you mentioned you're going to start to look for some stuff -- or
you started to look in January, you're saying roughly $70 million to $80 million from the coronavirus and
roughly $30 million from weather versus normal. Is that right, and that compares to your guidance of 2%
to 3%, which would be roughly $25 million to $35 million? Did I get those numbers about right?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes. You're in the ballpark, absolutely.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Then can you -- going back, as you guys have generally been there for quite some time, can you go back
to 2008, 2009 and remind us of how much you were able to identify as far as incremental cost savings
during that downturn?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Oh, good lord. Are you trying to say, Andrew, we're old? Is that -- was that the question?

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I'm saying you're consistent.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, I don't remember the specific number on O&M savings, but I can tell you this, industrial energy
usage during 2009 dropped by 10% compared to 2008. So we had -- and small commercial and industrial
got devastated as well. There was no real uptick like we're seeing now in residential. So I would say,
actually, based on our '09 experience in my memory, what we had to accomplish in terms of cost
reductions and additional efficiency in '09 was probably as greater, greater than what we're looking at
potentially today. Scott?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes. No, Gale, you're exactly right. And '08, '09 is a little different period there. But once again, we
executed and we achieved our earnings guidance, and we earned our returns on our utilities.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

I think a part of this is our general operating philosophy. I mean when you focus as a mantra and as a
management focus day in, day out on the fundamentals and executing the fundamentals as efficiently as
you can, it really gives you good insight into where you can drive additional reductions, additional cost
control, additional efficiency, both short term and long term. I think one of the factors that I would cite
is our -- for our success is really every day, we try to get better at the fundamentals of our business,
and that's really the focus of what our operating teams do every day. So I think that's a big factor,
understanding exactly what's driving your costs and understanding exactly not just top down but bottom
up as well on how we can get better every day.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Great. Then one last one, if I may. On liquidity, I believe you said $2.6 billion as of a few days ago. That's
up quite a bit from the end of March or year-end. Can you remind us what you've done to bolster that?
And the way you see the world today, do you think you're done in terms of capital raises for the year?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Scott, we'll let you handle that one.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes. So actually, the cash flow has been positive so far. And we did issue a small debt at our small utilities,
about $110 million that helped with the liquidity. Overall, MERC and MGU in total was $110 million. So we
will still have some issuances the remaining of the year as we look at financing now that we have multiple
items in the infrastructure segment, we'll be looking at that and also potentially some holding company
debt. So we're evaluating it right now and looking at the timing, but the rates are coming down a little,
so that looks good. But right now, the additional liquidity was good cash flow and additional debt at the
smaller utilities.

Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I think you touched on industrial and specifically Foxconn activity at the start of the call here. But just
wondering if you could share any more color on current and expected industrial activity going forward
here. And I guess, if you see the potential for any lingering impacts from the whole COVID-19 situation on
post-2020 industrial load?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, the honest answer is, we don't know. We -- I mean, until we see how the consumer comes out of
this shutdown of the economy, it's really almost impossible to tell, overall. But having said that, every
one of the major economic development expansion projects that we've announced in the last 2 years
are -- as I mentioned, Foxconn is a good example, are rocking and rolling and going forward with the
same commitment. In fact, one of the -- and I won't mention their name because it's not public yet, but
one of the major announcements we've made on the economic development front about 1.5 years ago,
we've just learned the footprint is going to be even larger. So that's one of the reasons why I don't see a
diminution in our long-term growth rate. We've got major capital projects on the way. And I will tell you
in terms of customer growth, customer expansion. The other thing I would tell you on the more optimistic
or even more optimistic side, I really believe that we're going to see a reshaping of the supply chains with

much more productivity and much more production coming into the U.S. I think one of the lessons that
everybody has learned is nothing against China, but we can't be dependent on Chinese production for all
of the antibiotics that are prescribed in the U.S. or the great majority of them. I think you're going to see
a reshaping of the supply chain, again, with more production coming in the U.S. over the next few years.
And Wisconsin will be particularly well suited to take advantage of that in my view.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's very helpful. And just one more, if I could. Just wondering if you see COVID impacting the timing of
pipe replacement in Illinois, kind of both from a rate increase perspective and an economic development
perspective.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, I will say this, given the stay-at-home orders, we have shifted a little bit in Illinois, some of the pipe
replacement work and actually to very much to our benefit and customer's benefit. So the plan was to
really upgrade the piping systems in a number of neighborhoods starting in the first quarter. Now though,
the Chicago Loop is deserted. And we're able to -- we were able to get some permits to do work we would
have done at a later time, but was on the schedule in the Chicago Loop. We are far more productive
with that work than you can possibly imagine because there's simply no traffic and nothing to disrupt
the timing of the work. So from the standpoint of actually being even more efficient and getting some
work done that eventually absolutely had to be done in the Chicago Loop, the pandemic has actually
been helpful to us in terms of shifting that work. It is slowing down, obviously, some of the work in the
neighborhoods. But we're really pleased that we've been able to get a real leg up on working the Loop.
Kevin, Scott, anything to add?

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Gale, I would add. It makes sense, excuse me, Scott, for doing so because, as you just mentioned,
from moving away from the neighborhood some, allowed us to not have as much interaction with going
inside the homes because in addition to the pipe replacement, we're also moving meters from inside to
outside. So with the COVID-19, we made a decision to minimize that and focus attention where we could
be more productive, as you just mentioned.

Senior EVP & COO

Appreciate that, Michael.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Thank you very much. Just what I wanted to hear.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

All right. I'll talk about demands and the revenue impact being around $75 million or so. And I just want
to make sure I'm thinking about the puts and the takes. So in Wisconsin, you had $22 million of O&M
benefit, in Illinois, you had almost $20 million, so call it $42 million total. So you're kind of half -- more
than halfway to the O&M cost reductions that would offset the demand weakness. Are you saying that,
that is all the O&M you would take out? Or are you saying that you would take out even more than that?
Because that's what the original plan already had.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

A great question, and let's back up for a minute. Remember, our initial plan, we embedded in our earnings
guidance and our forecast for the year was a reduction in O&M of 2% to 3%. So some of what you're
quoting for Q1 results really was part of the plan. So when you look at what we're talking about here with
the $70 million to $80 million projection for our base case in terms of pretax margin reduction and offsets
that we expect to achieve through O&M savings, that's over and above the 2% to 3%. Scott?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes. That's exactly right. So we had a great first quarter on our O&M control, and that was really needed
to offset some of the weather that we had. But the O&M for the rest of the year, we're going to continue to
take cost out, as we talked about, to achieve that.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. So I guess my question is, is the total O&M reduction kind of the another 3% to 5% in addition to
the original 2% to 3% that you had targeted. Is that kind of the right way? Or maybe it's easier if we just
put this in dollar millions and kind of go from there?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes. I think percentage-wise, you're pretty much on it. Yes. So we'd assume 2% to 3%. Then if you add
the $70 million to $80 million on top of that, yes, you're in the ballpark.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Yes.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Yes, got it. Okay. And you think some of that is sustainable into 2021 and beyond? Meaning kind of a
permanent reduction in O&M, which would obviously accrue back to the customer over time?

Okay. And you assume some of that is permanent, that incremental O&M reduction, meaning that it would

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes. That's exactly correct.

Operator

Your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

But just to sort of follow-up on a few questions here. You said that the O&M savings, a big chunk of them
are sustainable. Could you give a little bit more of a quantification on that? Or if you can't? Can you sort of
quantify -- just give us a sense as to where you're seeing this -- the savings longer term, the longer-term
stuff?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, it's a little bit early to give you a precise answer, the $70 million to $80 million of cost savings that
we expect to achieve this year on what -- on exactly what amount of that is sustainable. But I will tell you
that -- and I think this is the case for many of our brethren across the industry. Now that we're having
to operate as remotely as we are, and we're doing very well. I mean, as Kevin mentioned earlier, our
-- actually, our customer satisfaction levels are the highest I've ever seen. And we generally have very
high customer satisfaction. And I think we're -- our folks have managed to operate very effectively in this
environment. So for example, and we will be shaking this all out as we continue to watch and observe
over the course of the rest of the year. But I'll give you one specific example. We're not going to need as
many physical facilities as we once thought we would need. And there were some expansion plans on the
drawing board. I don't think we're going to need -- I don't believe we're going to need all of them, maybe
none of them, but as an example. So we'll see how this goes. But I would just point you back to our track
record. I mentioned earlier, more than a 7% decline in sustainable O&M reduction, '19 over '18, 2% to 3%
that we believe was going to be permanent this year, and I think it will be more than that.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then sort of following up on the question about the Illinois and the pipe replacement program.
As you know, there was a resolution that passed the city council. And do you think that the changes
that you're talking about will ameliorate there, I guess, their concerns as articulated, I guess, in this
resolution? Do you follow what I'm saying? I mean, how should we think about that resolution, I guess?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, this was the same resolution that was passed a year ago. So now we're into the second year of the
same resolution. For those of you who are not familiar with it, the resolution basically ask the governor
to look into the cost and effectiveness of the pipe replacement program. The major concern, as we
understand it, from a few of the council members is affordability, and there is a very, very good answer
to that. And that is that if you look at customer bills, customer gas bills in Illinois, starting in the year
that this legislation was passed that incentivized utilities in Illinois to accelerate the pipe replacement
program, customer bills are actually down. So we've not created an affordability crisis in any way, shape

20

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

or form. Once completed, and it's going to take a while, the system will be more efficient. That should be
helpful in terms of customers' bills. And in addition to that, we have just provided to the Illinois Commerce
Commission an independent study from a worldwide nationally -- internationally known engineering firm
that the Commission asked us to basically take a hard look at the execution of our pipe replacement
program. So we've just presented the -- it's called the Kiefner study, K-I-E-F-N-E-R, you may want to take
a look at that. It should be on the Illinois Commerce Commission website or a summary of it, certainly
should be. But the bottom line is the Kiefner study indicated that the aging pipes underneath Chicago are
-- have a useful life even shorter than what we had anticipated. I think the average useful life remaining
according to the Kiefner study is 15 years. So Kiefner actually recommended in its study to the Illinois
Commerce Commission that we accelerate the work to an even greater degree than we're trying to do
now. I don't know practically, other than a pandemic where you can do a lot more work in the loop. I
don't know how practical a significant additional acceleration is. But long story short, there's even more
evidence now of the need for the program, number one; verified by an outside international engineering
firm, number two; there is no heating cost crisis compared to when this program started.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Excellent. And then just on -- I know you guys have deferral back to Wisconsin. I know you guys have
deferral on the electric and gas side there, but -- due to COVID and everything. But could you just give
us a flavor as to what your actual experience is in terms of people paying their bills on time over the last
month or so? Or do you have any trends or any data you could share with us in terms of what you're
seeing in terms of bill pay?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Paul, really nothing yet in that. Remember, we are under a residential disconnect moratorium in all of our
cold-weather states that usually runs through April 15. So we wouldn't have seen any major difference in
terms of collectability or disconnections through tax day -- normal tax date anyway. So we're really only
looking at about a 2-week period since then. And I don't think the data, Scott, is meaningful in that 2-
week period.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

No. It's pretty early, we -- yes, normally, we see a little reduction in those remaining 2 weeks. We saw a
small increase, but it's really early yet. So we're watching it very closely, like everything else.
