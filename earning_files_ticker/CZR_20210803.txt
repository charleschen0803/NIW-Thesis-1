Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment Incorporated
2021 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the
call over to your speaker today, Mr. Brian Agnew, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance, Treasury and
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Brian Matthew Agnew
Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasury & Investor Relations

Thank you, Boena, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss
our second quarter 2021 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial
results for the period ended June 30, 2021. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor
Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com.

Joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer; Anthony Carano, our President and
Chief Operating Officer; and Bret Yunker, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before I turn the call over to Anthony, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we
may make certain forward-looking statements about the company's performance. Such forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, 1 should not place undue reliance on
them. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed. For additional information concerning factors that
could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in our forward-looking statements, you should
refer to the cautionary statements contained in our press release as well as the risk factors contained in
the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars Entertainment undertakes
no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that
occur after today's call.

Also during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC
Regulation G. The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure
discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the
comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at investor.caesars.com by
selecting the press release regarding the company's 2021 second quarter financial results.

Starting with our earnings press release today, we are now breaking out sports and iGaming into our new
Caesars Digital segment. This segment includes sports betting, iGaming and poker. And finally, as we
mentioned in our press release today, we have divested London Clubs, so starting in the third quarter of
this year, our former Managed and International segment will just reflect our managed operations on a pro
forma basis.

I will now turn the call over to Anthony.

Anthony L. Carano
President & COO

Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. The second quarter of 2021 represented
a consolidated EBITDA and EBITDA margin record for the company. Starting with Las Vegas, demand
trends accelerated meaningfully versus Q1. We generated $425 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter
and $436 million of property level EBITDA excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved 162% on a
quarterly sequential basis. EBITDA margins were 50.9% excluding the real rent payment, up 1,200 basis
points versus Q2 of 2019. Total occupancy for Q1 was 89%, with weekend occupancy 99% and mid-
week occupancy 85%. We delivered these outstanding Las Vegas segment results despite operating with
capacity and social distancing restrictions for the first 2-plus months of the quarter. In addition, we had
minimal group business and weak table hold in the quarter.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of '21 and into 2022. We're
expecting groups to start returning to Vegas with each month getting better as we progress throughout
the second half of the year. Group and convention revenues on the books for the second half of '21
versus '19 are currently pacing up approximately 18%. 2022 group revenues on the books are pacing up
approximately 15%.

CAESARS FORUM continues to exceed the original underwriting expectations with over 176 events booked
currently representing 1.7 million room nights and $657 million of revenues for all future periods. 76% of
this business is brand new to Caesars.

Turning to our regional markets. Operating results improved significantly versus Q2 of 2019 with EBITDA
growth of 56%, excluding Lake Charles, which remains closed. EBITDA margins in our regional segment
were 40.4%, excluding Lake Charles, and expanded 1,280 basis points versus Q2 of '19. On a same-store
sales basis, we achieved the highest EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history
of the company. 26 regional properties set all-time quarterly EBITDA records with 31 properties setting
all-time EBITDA margin records during the quarter. In our newly disclosed Caesars Digital segment,
we generated revenues of $117 million in Q2 of '21. We currently operate sports betting in 17 states
plus Washington, D.C., 13 of which offer mobile sports betting. Our apps are now rebranded to Caesars
Sportsbook and our new marketing campaign launched August 2. We have now integrated our digital
offerings with Caesars Rewards, and our customers can interact with us both online and our physical
casinos while earning loyalty rewards.

On the development front, construction is well underway on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles.
This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the second half of
'22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las
Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace has begun, and we look forward to a dramatically
improved arrival experience later in the year. In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion
at Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of 2022.

We have come a long way in a short time. Our operating teams are collaborating and sharing best
practices across the enterprise. This is leading to continued efficiencies. We believe our margin gains are
sustainable, and we'll continue to look for incremental cost savings opportunities. I'm extremely proud of
our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during the second quarter.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the second quarter.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Thanks, Anthony. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter and threw out that I'd expect
us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter. I
was actually thinking it would be this quarter. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule. As you look at the
quarter, Anthony touched on some of this, but remember that particularly with mask mandates coming
back in Nevada, remember, the Las Vegas numbers that you're looking at included a little over 2 months
of social distancing, restricted occupancy and masks, restricting occupancy in restaurants and on the
casino floor plus masks, and we were able to put up the numbers that we put up in the quarter. If you
think about drags in the quarter, we held poorly in Las Vegas, the loss from the London Clubs business
flowed through in the quarter because we didn't close the transaction until the middle of July and Lake
Charles was closed for rebuilding post the hurricane. The drags that I look at in the quarter were about
$40 million in aggregate versus what you would expect to see normally.

We were 89% occupied in Las Vegas. If you look forward -- if you start in May, May was the best month
in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars from an EBITDA perspective. June was better than May, and then
July was better than June. And I would expect that third quarter occupancy will finish significantly ahead
of second quarter's 89%. Brian touched on the way that we're presenting our financials. Now you can see
Caesars Digital on its own, you'll be able to measure our progress. I'll talk a little more about that in a
moment. You'll be able to see the bricks and mortar business.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

And now you can see the managed business, which was in that jumble that the historical Caesars used to
have of Managed and International and other, but you can see that, that business generates a little over
$100 million of annual EBITDA and that will grow when the Southern Indiana transaction closes because
we'll get a management fee and licensing stream from the Cherokee tribe at that property.

If you look at the bricks-and-mortar business, I touched on Las Vegas. If you look at it on a consolidated
basis, as we sit here today, we are run rating well north of $10 a share in free cash flow, significant
ramp from June to July. Obviously, we see the same public health situation that you see and there could
be bumps along the way in terms of masks and protocols that we need to follow, but the demand is
exceedingly strong, and has continued to build. So we feel very good about where we are in the bricks-
and-mortar business.

On yesterday morning, we launched Caesars Sportsbook. We closed the William Hill transaction a little
over 100 days ago, and we have spent -- and that was kind of a standing stock. Because of the rules in
the U.K., we really could not do much in terms of preparing for when we would close the transaction, and
we wanted to be in position to launch ahead of football season. So what you're going to see is us leaning
the entire organization into this vertical. You see the ad campaign with J.B. Smoove, Patton Oswalt, our
first national commercial will air during the USA Men's basketball game, Thursday night in the Olympics.
You're -- we are activating the entire enterprise. So connecting to Caesars Rewards more than 60 million
people tiered levels of service, ability to earn and use points on or offline. We're activating our player
development teams across the organization to sign up new accounts.

We're activating our entire workforce. Our frontline labor force will each have their own individual QR
code, and will be able to sign up customers and be incentivized to help us do that. So this is really a true
lean in by this organization that has not happened before. The numbers that you see and that we've
generated before have been in this kind of lame duck universe where we had bought Caesars, we had the
partnership that needed to be restructured and then we had the time between announcing the William Hill
deal and closing it where that -- the business that we were doing was kind of just incidental, not enough
real focus. This is truly leaning the whole organization in.

And if you -- in terms of how I think about it, I look at this like I look at any business opportunity within
the business. I think that we can generate cash-on-cash returns in this business at maturity well in excess
of 50% of what we'll invest. But we realize that we're -- we operate in a world that is competitive and that
we've got to jump in and compete. So you should expect us to spend over $1 billion in the next 2.5 years
to build our customer base. I can't give you a more precise number because a lot of the acquisition spend
is success-based. But I would expect it to be over $1 billion, and I'd expect to, at maturity, be generating
at least 50%, possibly approaching 100% of that in EBITDA. And the difference in terms of a bricks-and-
mortar investment that -- if I could find a brick-and-mortar investment like that, we would do that every
day of the week.

The difference is you're going to see that flow through our income statement, which is why it's important
that we're able to separate this and show you what does the brick-and-mortar business look like versus
what does the digital business look like. But with us free cash flowing in excess of $10 a share, we think
we have plenty of capital to invest in this business. We know this is not going to be just a straight line up.
We expect that we will make mistakes. We'll have to continue to evolve both from a marketing strategy
and a technology strategy, but the tools that we have in our portfolio to prosecute this opportunity, I'm
really excited to play this hand and we're just getting started as of yesterday.

And with that, I'm going to turn it to Bret to talk about liquidity.

Bret Yunker
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Tom. Our record-setting operating performance in the second quarter generated over $500 million
of free cash flow, which, in turn, we applied to retire our remaining convertible debt and make a onetime
payment to acquire the license rights for Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas in perpetuity. This combination of
debt repayment and license fee buyout results in over $40 million of annualized free cash flow and set the
table for further free cash flow benefits from deleveraging and refinancing activity.

With investment plans for Caesars Digital now formalized, our 2021 calendar year CapEx moves to $500
million to $550 million, which includes approximately $100 million for Caesars Digital and acceleration of
spend in New Orleans. Net of growth CapEx, our annual core CapEx remains approximately $400 million.
We commenced the sale process for William Hill's non-U.S. assets in the second quarter and expect to
announce the transaction no later than early Q4 of this year.

With that, I'll turn it back to Tom.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director
Thanks, Bret. Boena, with that, we'll turn it back to you for question and answers.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congratulations on the strong results. First question, Tom, is for all of you, going back to Las Vegas. If
you look at sequential flow-through in Las Vegas, it was about 75%, which is remarkable and just seeing
50% margins on a page is also sort of remarkable. Can you talk about -- is there an operating expense lag
relative to revenue recovery? And if there is, is there -- typically with respect to labor, is there a way to
quantify that?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

The answer to your first question, Joe, is no, not really. I mean, we're having challenges across the
country in terms of filling available positions but to the extent that we sell them, we're also seeing revenue
lift. As I said, July was stronger than June, which was stronger than May. So I'd tell you Vegas margins
in July were stronger than they were in the second quarter. So I think you should expect us to be in that
50% neighborhood for the foreseeable future.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then, I think, one thing that stood out to us in the quarter as well, Tom, was digital was
positive EBITDA even with the investment. Is there a way that you can sort of think about how the next
few quarters -- I know you're trying to build the business, and I heard the level of investment over the
next 2.5 years. Do you think you could successfully invest and still be EBITDA positive each and every
quarter? Or do you really look at it starting now with the new launch before you reap the benefits of
incremental EBITDA that you'll see a little bit of an EBITDA loss before you kind of get to those great
returns that you're targeting?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

You should expect digital to be a material EBITDA loser starting this quarter as we -- we're launching --
in addition to all the customer acquisition activity that we intend to do, we're launching a new brand. So
you're talking about a nationwide advertising campaign in addition to everything you do, in social. So
you're talking about TV, both national and local, and some expensive markets, I would expect to be -- you
should expect that $1 billion plus of spend to run through that EBITDA line over the next 2.5 years or so,
and it should be front end.

Operator

Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Tom, kind of a bigger picture question and really just playing on the success you guys are having right
now. Obviously, 90% occupancy in July, 89% in the quarter. The EBITDA numbers you're putting out, the
margins you're putting out. I guess, Las Vegas as a market has migrated more towards group convention
business and whatnot. Has this period made you guys at all think about the go-forward strategy and the
use of kind of group and convention type elements to fill rooms just given how strong it is at this point?
I mean, you talked about some of the tailwinds, obviously, that you still expect to see coming out of the

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

business. Have you guys thought about at all the way the model is configured in terms of room night mix
on a go-forward basis?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes, Carlo, that's a good question. I would say, as you know, we're a company that kind of lets the math
dictate what's the correct path to go down. I fully expect that, that convention customer coming back
is going to help us in terms of rate compression. And when you see what's missing even running 89%
versus what was 2 years ago, 97%, 98%. It's an extraordinary amount of EBITDA that's left on the table.
So I think there's absolutely a significant addition as that group business comes back, it is heartening
to see what we can do without that business, though, because in the second quarter, we had very little
group business to speak of. Nothing that's even statistically significant, and we're still able to post the best
quarter that Caesars had ever posted from an EBITDA perspective.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Understood. And then if I could just follow up. You talked a little bit about kind of what I think the way I
interpreted your comments was a stabilized Caesars Digital business that was doing $500 million to $1
billion of EBITDA at some point in the future. Just holistically, as you think about those numbers, what do
you kind of envision as a mix between kind of the iCasino piece versus the sports piece? And how do you
think about the 2?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

I mean I think that -- if I'm looking at the current landscape, I think that they -- in the time frame that
I'm thinking of, I think they end up fairly evenly split because there's fewer iCasino states available than
there are sports. On a per state basis, I think iCasino is considerably more profitable than sports.

Operator

Your next question is from Barry Jonas of Truist Securities.

Barry Jonathan Jonas
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Tom, your comments on July sound incredibly strong, but I just want to be very clear around the
increasing cases for COVID and specifically the new Nevada mask mandate. Any impact to the outlook or
timing for Vegas recovery, whether that's group, international? Just want to get any color there.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes, Barry, this is all real time, right? The mask mandate came into being less than a week ago. What's
going on now with the mask mandate is far less onerous in terms of restrictions that we have dealt with
in the last quarter. I don't know what impact that will have ultimately on groups coming back. we had the
widely leaked internal memo last week on cancellation rate, which I should hit on that what that measures
is a week's worth of reservations. If I get 10,000 reservation and 4,700 cancellations, that's a 47% cancel
rent versus what's typically 27%. It's not -- we went from 98% occupancy to 50% occupancy. So we fully
expect to remain in the low to mid-90s of occupancy in Vegas through this current situation with the Delta
variant.

Barry Jonathan Jonas
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just how are you thinking about land-based expansion here? Whether that's Florida?
Chicago is always out there. And I know you're starting to do something in Nebraska.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

CEO & Director

So I got no interest in Chicago. Florida we already operate in Pompano. We've got a significant joint
venture development that's still churning at that site. Nebraska was a unique opportunity in that we have
significant operations in Council Bluffs right on the Nebraska border. That would be impacted by Nebraska
utilization and doing the Columbus track allows us to participate in sports and online to the extent that
we're able to in that state. So for a modest investment in entry into a state where we think we can get a
good return out of that investment, that was a very easy decision.

Operator

Your next question is from David Katz of Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Look, we've been walking around with a $10 share free cash flow bogey for seemingly quite some time.
How do we think about -- given the pieces and the way the table is set now, where it could go from there
in some qualitative way? I'm not necessarily asking for a guide.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

So we're still missing group business in Las Vegas. We still see plenty of opportunity in the portfolio in
terms of areas where we could tighten up. So if you think about it in broad terms, I've got to do about
$4.5 billion of EBITDA out of the bricks-and-mortar business to be $10 a share in free cash flow. I told you
that we're significantly in excess of that at the current run rate, and we see further upside from there. Did
I lose you, David?

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

You did for a moment, and it's much more likely on my side. If I may -- just work from home. So look, if
I may follow up, please, with respect to labor, it's been an area we've all been hearing quite a bit about
and reading quite a bit about in hospitality and the challenges of engaging people and the costs thereof.
Not sure if you've talked much about that, but how do you see that? And we've heard less of a problem in
Vegas than other places. But how much of an issue is that in the course of your day?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

I don't think it's less of an issue in Vegas, I think it's an issue everywhere. And I'm sure our friends at
MGM will concur tomorrow or later this week. It's difficult to find enough frontline employees and it does
impact what you're able to do, and we're behaving as if there isn't some magic date where it's all going to
be better. We're hopeful that as unemployment -- supplemental unemployment rolls off that the picture
will get better. But we're doing incentives. We're raising wages. We're doing job fairs. We're doing referral
bonuses. We're doing everything we can to find as many employees as we possibly can.

It's in a regional property. It tends to be easier because you're not hotel dependent. So whether I
have 300 hotel rooms open in a regional property versus 175 really doesn't make a huge difference in
materiality to my EBITDA. In Las Vegas, that's an entirely different animal. So we are -- our teams in Las
Vegas are doing a fantastic job of managing through this, but it's -- there's a lot of stress in the system,
and there's times where we've got to pull back on the throttle to make sure that the customer experience
endures.

Operator

Your next question is from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Tom, so if I start with the digital side of things. Obviously, we've seen all these sports betting companies
out there, and they're spending like crazy to try and gain market share, and now they're going to have
new guys out there throwing around a decent amount of money as well. So I guess the question is,
what gives you the confidence that the $1 billion spend will eventually turn into $2 billion or some higher
number if the competitive environment stays pretty cutthroat at this point?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Steve, if it turns into $2 billion, we're having a very good experience in terms of gathering customers
because away from this initial brand launch, most of what you're doing ends up being success-based as
you bring new depositors into the system. And look, my view is this is a unique situation in that you've got
a bit of the Wild West where things opened up quickly and everybody is looking for where the customers
are. If you look at the companies that have very large databases coming into this or even look at the ones
that have been successfully converting smaller databases, it's because they know where the customers
are.

We've got over the 60 million people in our database. We have the wherewithal to serve the highest-level
customer down to the lowest-level customer. We have a well-developed rewards program in place that
treats customers to increasing levels of service as their value to us increases. That's all -- that mousetrap
has already been built. It's never really been used in the sports business anywhere, a, because you have
companies that are off to quick starts here that just don't have that kind of database and that kind of
system. And you've got others like us that are kind of just getting our ducks in a row.

But I look at it like we can create -- if we lean into this appropriately, we've got 54,000 salespeople
in our company that work it with customers every day can open accounts. We have dedicated player
development executives that deal with building relationships and expanding those relationships every day
and have for decades. We have physical experiences that we can offer and tie into that business that I
think position us well ultimately for success. And that's not to say that others are not going to succeed or
that our path will be, as I said, just straight up. But I think we've got everything we need to be a success
in this space, and we really kicked it off yesterday.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Got you. And then if we go back to the margin side of things, it seems like you think current
margins are pretty sustainable even down the road as the world hopefully goes back to normal. But what's
the biggest delta that you guys are seeing today to drive those margins so much higher relative to pre-
pandemic times? Is it 1 or 2 things? Or is it 100 different things? Or is it just as the businesses were
closed down that gave you guys a chance to look at every single thing under the roofs? Or is it -- the
previous management teams were just so inept?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Well, I'll leave the inept comment alone. But everything else that you laid out there is a piece we operate
with less labor than we -- than the historical company operated with both at the property and the
corporate level. But it's really the attention to detail, the focus on every P&L. I'll give you an example.
This quarter, we were cash -- operating income positive in food and beverage for the first time in the
history of Caesars. So just on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that's over a $60 million cash swing. So that's
$0.25 billion a year. And that's how are you pricing your product? How are you yielding it? How are you
managing your labor? How are you managing your marketing? And what are you giving away? It's all sorts
of different areas that roll up into big numbers. We're a big company now. So 53 properties if everybody
finds $5 million, it's a $0.25 billion. And we have historically been a good company at $5 million.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So as we think about the digital business, as the market matures, customer acquisition is becoming less
of a driver in product picks up some of it. You launched your new sportsbook yesterday, the new app. Can
you just talk about some of the key features of it?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Bret, do you want to take that?

Bret Yunker
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We encourage you to download and experience it yourself, but it has very deep betting markets. It's
very fast, the UX is great. Again, it's going to tie into Caesars Rewards here. And we think it's a best-in-
class app looking at funding and withdrawal and the clarity for any sports better. And then you layer on
top J.B. Smoove and a great marketing campaign and tie that together not only online but across our
brick-and-mortar portfolio, and we like our digital mousetrap.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then just a numbers question. So when you announced the William Hill deal in 2020, you said you
expected sporting betting and iGaming to deliver $600 million to $700 million of revenue in 2021. Is that
still a good baseline? Or how are you thinking about it?

Bret Yunker
Chief Financial Officer

Thomas, with the rollout of the Caesars Sportsbook yesterday and our new strategy for marketing and
investment, I think promos, so net revenue could be below that $600 million to $700 million as we invest
in the business. But it doesn't diminish from the long-term growth opportunity at all. But relative to that
initial $600 million to $700 million, our attempt to increase and be more competitive in the market could
impact that net revenue line this year.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. That was the business in the -- in the world where it was kind of just wandering in the wilderness
without the way to the business behind what's changed yesterday.

Bret Yunker
Chief Financial Officer

I will say we're $260 million year-to-date. Obviously, we're coming into the seasonally strongest period.
So you should see those revenues start to accelerate into the all-important Q3.

Your next question is from John DeCree of CBRE.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Securities, LLC, Research Division

To stick on the digital theme, perhaps a 2-part question, Tom. A lot of the discussion so far today has
been on the vast and probably underappreciated opportunity of mining your database and brand, but you
also have a lot of other customer acquisition channels that were assembled over the last couple of years
between you and the predecessor William Hill. Like ESPN, CBS agreements of daily fantasy stuff. I was
wondering if you could talk a little bit about how those kind of fit into the strategy going forward? And as a

tag along to that, if there's other media partnerships, channels, customer channels that you could look at
to bolt on going forward? Or if you think you've got everything you need?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

No, you're right, John. We have numerous league and team partnerships plus the ESPN and CBS
partnerships that give us access to databases that are certainly extremely interested in whatever team or
sport they're following and likely sports betters. And part of what we're doing here in addition to Caesars
Rewards, we're leaning into all channels into our own database into the databases of partners that we
have transactions with and then out into that Wild West for people that we don't have a relationship with
yet. We are looking to build a leader in this space, and we think tying it to everything that we've described
should make it an attractive option for players.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Securities, LLC, Research Division

And kind of the second part, is there other things that you're looking at or potential tuck-in M&A, whether
it's additional technology or other avenues that you'll continue to look at going forward?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

The technology will continue to evolve for as long as we're doing this. So if there are areas where a tuck-
in acquisition makes sense to advance the ball on the technology side, you should expect we would look
at that. If there's some brand or M&A opportunity that allows us to improve our position in customer
acquisition, you should expect us to look at that. You've known us a long time. We're looking for how do
we drive the most value for our stakeholders. And the answer can change over time. But as we sit here
today, we think we've got everything we need to launch with strength and then to add to that over time as
we build the business.

Your next question is from Chad Beynon of Macquarie.

Chad C. Beynon
Macquarie Research

Tom, given your Las Vegas margin success in the quarter of running over 20,000 rooms and a much
higher EBITDA result than any of us were expecting, I'm wondering if anything has changed in terms of
your thinking of divesting an asset out there and the timing around that.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say nothing has changed there. We still expect to sell a Vegas Strip asset, a single asset and I
would expect that sale to take place in 2022.

Chad C. Beynon
Macquarie Research

Great. And then with that cash or, I guess, the near-term cash of selling the U.K. William Hill business,
what are your plans with the cash that you have on the balance sheet? You've talked about what the
digital vision will cost, but you'll still have some excess cash, particularly given the $10 free cash flow
projection. What will you do with that?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

You should expect us to be deleveraging. We want to drive our leverage below 4x on a gross lease
adjusted basis. I see that in the relatively near future for us. And I look at it like -- if you think about

something of -- north of $1 billion of investment into sports and online, I think between -- just the
proceeds out of the assets that we're going to sell out of -- that came with William Hill, I think that's going
to match up pretty nicely with what we need to spend in sports and online to build that business in the
U.S.

Your next question is from Daniel Adam of Loop Capital Markets.

Daniel Scott Adam
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

For Caesars Digital, it sounds like that segment includes both your retail sports betting business and
online. Is that correct?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

That's correct.

Daniel Scott Adam
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. So can you break out what online-only revenue and EBITDA was in the quarter in that segment?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

No. No, I can't, Dan.

Daniel Scott Adam
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then Tom, I'll take another stab at this, but I'm wondering if you have a long-term target online
sports betting and iGaming market share number in mind that you'd be willing to share with us?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Also no. I would expect us to be a leader in mobile market share among -- certainly among the leaders in
both sports and online.

Brian Matthew Agnew
Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasury & Investor Relations

And Daniel, given that we operate in 13 states mobile and now we've rebranded the Caesars Sportsbook,
the bulk of the growth, obviously, for the sports business is going to come online over time and as new
states legalize.

Your next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

I just want to go back to the Vegas environment. Tom, you gave some really great color on sort of your
occupancy thoughts. And I was wondering if you could sort of give us a little bit of color on what you're
seeing on the rate side of the equation in the past. There's been some volatility there, and it's been
competitive. But obviously, what you're seeing now is really different from the consumer. So I was just
kind of curious on what you're able to see out in the future and maybe how that trended across the
quarter as well.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. For the past few months, we have seen higher rates occupancy that climbed to equal prior year level.
We would expect that to grow further and faster as group business comes back. We're fairly comparable
from a rate standpoint over the last, call it, 2.5 months to prior year, a little bit ahead.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

And historically, we have seen some seasonality in Vegas, but obviously, that's been driven a bit by the
group business. I know the booking windows can be short, especially now. But just any thoughts on sort
of, let's call it, the fall progression as some people may head back to work and schools may be more back
in session, that trade-off in August relative to sort of the upside opportunity as you probably see the group
calendar fill in post Labor Day?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. I'm expecting to be back toward more normal seasonality in Vegas through the rest of the year. I'd
expect you'd see the same holiday softness that you typically see on a relative basis, and we'll see what
happens in terms of group cadence coming back. But I'd expect we'd be -- certainly in '22, I'd expect kind
of a normal year of seasonality in Vegas.

Your next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I've got a couple of follow-up questions on the digital side. I guess, starting with the database. How do
you think about the overlap of sports betting customers versus iGaming versus kind of the existing total
awards database? Do you have any sense for how much of your total rewards customer base may be
overlapping with peers or you may be fishing for a customer who perhaps has even already been caught.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

I don't have any real insight into what's in others' databases, but I'd tell you with the amount of
people and ours that, that database has been built over 20 years in mind. I would expect that -- a
substantial amount of the gambling customers that everybody is searching for is in our database and has
a relationship with us. So giving them an ability to stay home and not look elsewhere is a key piece of
what we're doing here.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And then perhaps on the regulatory front, I know you mentioned you always follow the math. I guess
what's your strategy and willingness to pursue states where taxes and/or license fees are materially
higher? Do you need be in those markets to get national scale? Or are there other ways to create value?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. You're going to look at each state on its own. There's going to be -- I can envision scenarios where
there will be states where it's just not economic to participate. I haven't seen one of those yet. So you
should expect us to be active everywhere we can be. I -- there are states that you could miss or if it's
impossible to make money. But the reality is, if you look at the history of the business in states where the
initial tax structure was difficult, there is a history where those have been adjusted. You can't participate
in that if you're not involved on the front end.
