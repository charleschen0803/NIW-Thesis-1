Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Prudential Quarterly Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the
conference over to your host, Darin Arita. Please go ahead.

Darin C. Arita
Senior VP and Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's
call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of U.S.
Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob
Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and
Ken, and then we will take your questions.

Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ
materially from the predictions we make today.

In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such
measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-looking
Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation, which can be found on our
website at investor.prudential.com. With that, I'll hand it over to Charlie.

Charles Frederick Lowrey
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we reported
fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.33. We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of
12.1% for the full year. Looking back on 2019, we implemented a number of important actions to enhance
our business and financial performance for the long term. As a result, we have begun 2020 with a clear
set of initiatives, against which we will execute with the renewed confidence that our businesses can
deliver increased earnings performance.

I'll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019. First, we launched a process, talent
and technology transformation initiative, which is on track to realize $500 million in run rate cost savings
by 2022. As part of this program, we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U.S.
workforce during the fourth quarter, which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating
a more agile and competitive workforce. Second, we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders
via dividends and share repurchases. The 10% increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive
year of dividend increases and produces a yield on book value in excess of 4%. Third, we completed our
acquisition of Assurance IQ in October, adding a leading direct-to-consumer financial wellness solutions
platform.

We're encouraged by the growth in customer demand, the interest from carriers wanting to put their
products on the platform and the level of talent we are attracting from well-known technology companies.

Finally, we made progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern,
and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance. In 2019, our financial performance was
impacted by a low interest rate environment, the annual assumption update in our Individual Life business
and higher-than-typical expenses in our International Businesses. In 2020, we are implementing a number
of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead.

We're focused on executing 3 key initiatives. First, we remain focused on enhancing the customer
experience to produce long-term sustainable growth while generating $140 million in cost savings this
year. Second, in our International Businesses, we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of

earnings coming from growth markets. Supporting this objective, this quarter, we closed on the acquisition
of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat, expanding our presence in Latin America. We also
completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations
in other markets, including Korea. We'll share further details at the appropriate time. And third, we're
continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment, such as adjusting the
mix and pricing of our products.

Turning to Slide 3. I'll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results, which Rob
will cover in more detail. Our U.S. Businesses benefited from record account values in Retirement and
Individual Annuities. Earnings increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment
spread results partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business. PGIM, our global asset manager,
reported record assets under management of $1.3 trillion as well as higher net asset management fees
and Other Related Revenues. Our International Businesses increased earnings, driven by higher net
investment spread results and business growth, partly offset by higher-than-typical expenses.

Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to touch briefly on 4 ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a
sustainable way. First, we are a purpose-driven company. We strive to make lives better by solving
the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders. Second, in
December, our Board introduced a multi-stakeholder framework that extends the Board's accountability
to investors, employees, customers and society at large, reinforcing the Board's commitment and ours
to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns. Third, this multi-stakeholder framework is
reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental, social and governance practices. Finally, we
provide transparency so investors can measure our progress. We disclose metrics and targets related to
the financial stability board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures. This includes quantifying
greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and water usage. In addition, we publish metrics in accordance with
the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.

We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold. Just last month, Fortune
included us on its list of World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. We are proud to
have earned the first place distinction in the life and health insurance category each year.

In closing, we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into
place, including the 3 initiatives I have outlined for 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look
at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook.

Robert Michael Falzon
Vice Chairman

Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM
and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook.

Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and
Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread
and underwriting income. Our U.S. Businesses have 3 key priorities for growth. First, we are investing
in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while
realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins. Second, we will continue to pursue targeted growth
opportunities, including, by way of example, the non-jumbo corporate segment of the full-service
retirement market and the premier segment of involuntary products offered by our Group Insurance
business. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market, including through
workplace financial wellness and Assurance IQ.

As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities, over time, we expect higher earnings
growth and improved returns. In the near term, we expect underlying earnings in the U.S. Businesses to
be relatively consistent with current levels as underlying business growth in Retirement, Group Insurance
and Assurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our Individual Annuities
business as we maintain pricing discipline. We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our
expected underlying earnings outlook by business.

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

Now turning to Slide 6. PGIM, our asset management business, continues to leverage its diversified
multi-manager model, global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value-added strategies
that serve investors globally. With a record $1.3 trillion of assets under management as of year-end,
PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager. It is the fifth largest investor in fixed income globally and one
of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms.
We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private
and alternative investment strategies and expanding in both retail and international markets. And as
the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and
International Businesses.

Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success. More than 80% of assets under
management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This
performance helped us to generate $1.9 billion of net third-party flows during the fourth quarter, including
$1.2 billion of institutional and $700 million of retail net flows. In addition, PGIM rose to the seventh
highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows up from 14th in 2018. PGIM's adjusted
operating margin of 32% in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and
has grown over the last 3 years as we balance business reinvestment with margin expansion.

For the full year 2019, PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4% higher than
2018 and 6% higher after adjusting for business acquisition-related costs. Looking ahead, we believe
PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid- to high single-digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its
deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager, and we expect
to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year.

Turning to Slide 7. Our International Businesses continue to benefit from our world-class Japanese life
insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as
from our focus on other operations in high-growth markets. Life Planner sales increased by 17% compared
to the year ago quarter. This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil,
Korea and Taiwan. Sales for Gibraltar were 14% lower than the year ago quarter. This primarily reflects
lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels as
the recent decline in U.S. interest rates led us to lower crediting rates. In addition, we continue to focus on
quality distribution. The number of life planners as a result has declined. The lower Life Consultant sales
were partially offset by higher bank channel sales. We continue to innovate new products and implement
pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability.

Total in force for international increased by 3% from the prior year, including a 5% increase in Life Planner
and a 1% increase in Gibraltar. In the near term, we expect total in force to grow at a similar level. We
expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the
impact of low interest rates. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken.

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 8, which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative
to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We begin with pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter,
which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.33 on an after-tax basis, then we adjust
for the following items. First, in the fourth quarter, we had favorable variable investment income driven by
equity market performance and prepayment income, which was a benefit of $135 million. Second, the first
quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs, which will result in a net
benefit of $435 million or $0.85 per share and is comprised of 2 items. The fourth quarter included $160
million of seasonally higher expenses and $365 million of implementation costs, including the impact from
the voluntary separation program.

As indicated in the 8-K filing on December 17, we expect implementation costs of $175 million in 2020
with about $20 million of these costs in the first quarter, and long-term compensation expense for retiring
eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each
year. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect this expense to be about $70 million split between PGIM
and corporate and other. These items net to $0.85 per share. Third, there are other considerations that

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

we expect will have a $20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to our -- to the
fourth quarter. And fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, assuming
reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth quarter. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.95 per
share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases, business growth and
market impacts in 2020. The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS
by approximately $0.15 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other
factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020.

I'd also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix. On Slide
18, we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll-forward by
business. And on Slide 19, we provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. In
addition, we have included some other considerations for 2020 on Slide 21 regarding corporate and other
net costs, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate.

Now turning to Slide 9. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very
good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $900 million to shareholders during
the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which were largely funded by the cash flows
generated by our businesses. On December 19, we announced the Board's authorization to repurchase
up to $2 billion of common stock in 2020. In addition, we increased the first quarter dividend to $1.10
per share, which represents a 10% increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4.4%
yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Our regulatory
capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets, and our financial leverage ratio
remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.1 billion at the
end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We will continue
to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities
and return capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 10, and in summary, we had numerous accomplishments in 2019. We are focused on
executing our key initiatives in 2020, leading to greater earnings in 2021. Now I'll turn it to the operator
for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.

Nigel Phillip Dally
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I had a question on annuities. It's one of the areas that you do expect a decline in earnings in 2020, so
I just wanted to check, you said just because of a modest decline in AUM, because of the anticipated
outflows overwhelming market appreciation? Or is there also an underlying element of some deterioration
in the return on assets? And if it is the latter, what's driving that?

Andrew F. Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So Nigel, thanks for your question. This is Andy. There's really 2 major impacts that we're seeing in the
annuities business. One, as you pointed out, is the outflow. That really is coming from -- we are being
very disciplined in our pricing of product and in our return on new sales. And if you look backward, we had
some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range. So that's creating that outflow. And the other
thing I would point to, though, is as that business is rolling across its surrender period, we are seeing
business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect.

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Nigel, this is Ken. I'd just add -- I know there's been some questions about the ROA. Our primary
objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE, and our variable annuity
business is very profitable, and that is evident by the high ROE that's in the high teens. And that high
ROE reflects our unique product design, our robust risk management and disciplined pricing. And our
hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings, capital and cash flow even
with significant market moves. So as a result, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be less sensitive
to markets than the account values. And the ROA may move as market moves, but again, our earnings,
capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome. So the decline in rates and the increase
in the equity markets, while it had an increase in account values, had a less meaningful impact on our
earnings, again, due to our robust risk management.

Nigel Phillip Dally
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Got it. Second question was just on dividends. Good to see the incremental dividends again this
quarter. I think that brings your payout ratio to around 35%. Is there a limit to how high you'd like to go?
Or is there incremental upside there?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure. So maybe just a little bit of reflection of our capital management and shareholder distribution
philosophy that's been very consistent over time, and it starts with our free cash flow, which is about
65% of after-tax earnings. This year, a little bit better than that. And this should -- we then distribute in
both the forms of dividends and share repurchases. Our dividends have increased actually 12 years in
a row now. And if you look at the average increase over the last 5 years, it's been 11%. And now that
dividend represents, as I mentioned in my opening comments, a 4.4% yield on book value. Our Board
has also authorized $2 billion of share repurchases for 2020. So generally, a very consistent approach to
our shareholder distributions, which balances both dividends and returns of excess capital through share
repurchases.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So maybe a question on interest rates. On last quarter's call, you increased your guided interest rate
sensitivity to $0.30 of EPS impact for a 50 basis point drop in rates. And now we've seen in 2020 -- well,
maybe not today, but I was estimating 30 basis points so far in 2020. So I just want to make sure there
are no changes. Should we expect a $0.15 to $0.20 negative impact on 2020 EPS based on that? Or are
there some other factors at work? And with that, maybe you could tell us what your new money yields are
doing in the portfolio.

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure. So the sensitivity that we gave to interest rates of 50 basis points at $0.30, that's still good. So
that rough rule of thumb and how you applied it, I think that still is appropriate. Our new money yields in
the second half of the year were about 3.65%, and you can think of that relative to our -- and that's in the
U.S. relative to our U.S. portfolio yield of about 4.2%.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then just shifting over to the Individual Life segment and kind of thinking back, second quarter,
you had that $200-plus million charge. Third quarter, there was about $30 million of underwriting income
below expectations. And in 4Q, it was about $15 million now below expectations. So I'm wondering if --
as we look forward, are you comfortable with underwriting assumptions into the year? And your sales
were really robust at $209 million. You cited it as a record since 2013. So what are you selling that you're
excited about?

Andrew F. Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes. So Andrew, it's Andy. Thanks for your question. So we would consider our actual to expected in the
fourth quarter as in line with our expectations. The result was 103%, and I would encourage you to think
of there's a quarter around that 100 of -- plus or minus a couple of percent so that -- we really think that's
in line. As far as you referenced the assumption updates, we're seeing that our business performance has
been consistent with the updates that we made in the second quarter.

Shifting over to the new business sales, we are very, very pleased with the performance of sales in the
Individual Life business, as you cited, it's best quarter in 5 years. We're probably even more pleased
that versus the absolute level in the mix of sales. The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from
Guaranteed Universal Life, which obviously is highly interest-rate sensitive and over to where almost half
of the sales are variable life, which has much, much less sensitivity to interest rates. So pleased with what
we're seeing. The success is really coming from we have a very, very strong brand name. We believe our
product portfolio is very strong and our distribution system is top-notch.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And term life is at the balance of the sales largely?

Andrew F. Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes.

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a first question on the Assurance IQ deal in terms of how are you thinking about the results so far. It
looks to me based on the disclosure that the revenues are coming in below what was projected initially. I
think it was $500 million. Was the 2019 guide and looks closer to maybe $300 million on a full year basis.
I guess first question is that right? And secondly, does that cause you to rethink revenue and earnings
projections, 2020, 2021?

Andrew F. Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So maybe -- Tom, this is Andy. I'll start, and then I'll hand it off to Ken. So as you'd imagine, these are
early days. We just closed the acquisition in October, but I'll tell you, there's a lot of things that we're
excited about. We're, as we sit here today, even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this
business. In fourth quarter, we saw very, very strong consumer demand flow across the platform. We saw
6.5 million shoppers. And just to define that for you, we define a shopper as an individual that has an
absolute intention to buy a financial service product and that's willing to share their contact information
with us. So we saw 6.5 million shoppers across the platform in 4Q. That's compared against 3.5 million in
the year ago quarter. So we're very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand. A very
positive for us on that is we have product providers, literally lining up of every shape and size that want to
go ahead and get on the platform. So from a revenue potential perspective, we're every bit as strong as
we were. We are in -- kind of where we're focused right now is getting those additional products onto the
platform.

As far as your numbers around revenue, yes, our revenue for the year came in just north of $300 million.
And really, what I would tell you there is we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed
agents, we'll call it, capacity on the platform. We learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort
and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 health care agents onto the
platform. I will tell you that we're already well underway in getting those agents appointed for 4Q of 2020.
So it's a completely rectifiable situation and we're well out in front of it.

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The only thing I'd add there is, as you had heard from Andy describe, this business is in a very high-
growth phase and we were not expecting meaningful earnings in the near term or in 2020 as a result. And
so it's early days and we'll report this information to you each quarter. And just as Andy indicated, just a
reminder, that is a seasonal business, primarily fourth quarter loaded.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And Ken, would you say you're sticking to the $700 million revenue projection for 2020 still? Or is
that sort of TBD?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Given the high-growth nature of this business, we don't want to get into the practice of updating each
and every quarter. So again, we're going to -- you're going to see the results as they occur in a separate
segment.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then just my follow-up is, is PRU planning on early adopting variable annuity reform at year-
end 2019? And if not, is the plan to do full implementation in 2020 or a 3-year phase-in?

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

We're going to adopt on the effective date, which is January 1, 2020, but remind you that we made big
structural changes that were very much aligned with the new reform many years ago. So we're well
positioned, and we expect to be very well capitalized before the reform and after the reform.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And Ken, no 3-year phase in, you'd fully adopt in 2020?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Fully adopt, January 1.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

So you've clearly taken some big steps to accelerate the timing of realizing the expense savings you've
talked about. Can you just help us think about when we'll start to see these in results and where they'll
come through, I guess, whether in terms of the business segments or through in corporate?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure. In our 8-K that we filed, we gave some information of our belief of the progression of the saves.
They were modest in 2019 and we provided an estimate for 2020, that $140 million would be realized
in the P&L in the year. Those results, you can expect to build as we go through the year and you can
expect to see them emerge with -- primarily in the U.S. Businesses and in corporate but throughout those
businesses but, again, because it's a company -- it's a U.S. Business-wide program.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Got it. And when you're giving sort of your walk-through in the slides of kind of future earnings trajectory,
am I right that there's nothing really explicitly contemplated there from savings in the businesses?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Only what was accomplished in the -- through 2019 or the first and the fourth quarter. And then any
future improvement, whether it's from business growth or share repurchases or additional expense saves,
incremental expense saves would not be included in that baseline. That's all in the future.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Got it. And then you mentioned in the remarks, potential actions to continue streamlining your business
portfolio and realize that it's premature to say much specific. But how would you think of redeploying any
proceeds you potentially generate? Would you look to reinvest these in the businesses? Or potentially,
would they be available to return to shareholders?

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

The answer is yes. So what we mean is, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But let me take a
step back for a moment and make a more general comment on how we think about capital, in particular,
the optimization of our capital, which I think we've been doing for years. So we always look across our
businesses, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment; and
when we see attractive opportunities, you've seen us invest in growth and make acquisitions. And you've
also seen us scale back or look for divestitures over the years when there are better uses of capital and
then put that capital to use either in growing the franchise or, if there aren't opportunities, returning it to
shareholders. So we'll continue to look for ways to optimize capital deployment and to maximize outcomes
for our shareholders, whether that be in investing in new business opportunities, which, again, you've
seen us do or return capital to shareholders.

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.

Ryan Joel Krueger
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I guess first, have you completed the year-end cash flow testing analysis? And if so, can you give us any
indication of the impact?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

The statutory filings will come out at the end of the month, and so yes, that will include our updated cash
flow testing or asset adequacy testing. You'll see those results when we report them. What I'd offer you
now is, given lower rates, we would expect some strengthening in our AAT reserves or cash flow testing,
but we have derivative gains or interest rate hedges that offset that and we expect to have RBC ratios that
are above our AA financial strength objectives.

Ryan Joel Krueger
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then when you did the second quarter assumption review and had some impacts to the
Individual Life business, at the time, you talked about reinsurance as being a potential option to improve
returns in that business. Is that something that you're still contemplating? And can you give us any update
there?

Andrew F. Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes. Ryan, this is Andy. So I would broaden your question and say we're taking a number of actions to
strengthen the performance of our life business. First and foremost, we are working diligently on expense
efficiencies and you can think about that in the context of the broader work going on at the company and
the $500 million in outcomes we expect over the next couple of years. We already talked about the sales,
which we think is a meaningful -- will be a meaningful contributor to giving earnings lift over time in the
business. And then, yes, you are correct. We have been looking at options and we'll continue to look at
options from a reinsurance perspective on -- with the block. And what we're looking for there, obviously, is
the right partner and the right terms that make economic sense for us. There's nothing currently that we
want to report, but we'll keep you posted as we go forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Just focusing on Slide 20 of your deck in the International Businesses, it looks like, at least over the
next 12 months, Life Planner and Gibraltar are expected to be flat, which is lower than that intermediate

earnings growth guidance you gave at Investor Day of mid-single digits. So just want to get a sense of if
we stay in this interest rate environment, what kind of gets us from flat back up to the mid-single digits
and sort of over what time frame?

Scott Garrett Sleyster
Executive VP & Head of International Businesses

Hi, Suneet. This is Scott. Let me take that. So as you pointed out, the underlying business fundamentals
for our International Businesses actually look quite strong. As Rob pointed out, our in-force block is
growing at about 4%, 4% to 5% in LP and about 1% in Gibraltar. Unfortunately, given the low-rate
environment, for the most part, we're giving back a lot of the earnings growth associated in the block,
and we're continuing to make some portfolio investments on technology and the like. So right now, I
would say, over the -- certainly, looking out to this year, we think we're going to be closer to flat. We hope,
over time, as we make adjustments, that'll start to build. But I would say, even right now, looking at the
intermediate term, we'd say we're looking at low single-digit growth.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And then a follow-up is just on Assurance IQ. I think it was mentioned that there are about 6.5
million shoppers in the fourth quarter. What should we expect to be the conversion rate of the -- of that
balance, in other words, of the 6.5 million? How many would you expect to actually buy a product?

Andrew F. Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So Suneet, it's Andy. I'll take your question. Conversion rate is a very complex topic. So it very much
depends on the product mix that's on the platform. And as we talked about, we are in a phase of rapidly
looking out -- looking to roll new products onto the platform. So the conversion rates that we're currently
experiencing are going to change quite a bit with that product mix shift as well as, as you can imagine,
with the shopper demand we had, but the mismatch with our agent capacity, our conversion was lower
than we would expect going forward. At this point, we're not going to put out explicit numbers, but
hopefully, that gives you a way to think about it.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And have you put any PRU products on that platform yet? I know that was one of your objectives when
you announced the deal.

Andrew F. Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes. So it absolutely is one of our primary objectives. We have been working diligently to get our simply
term life product onto the platform. We are ahead of schedule on those plans, and we will get that product
on the platform in the second quarter of this year. And we're very encouraged with our brand name and
the quality of our products that will give both Assurance and, obviously, mother Prudential some lift.

[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill.

John Bakewell Barnidge
Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division

Have you seen any meaningful acceleration in PGIM's U.K. business post election or demand for product
from that market in Continental Europe?

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

So John, this is Andy. I'll take that question. So what I would tell you is in the short term, with all the flux
that's been going on, we haven't seen any meaningful change or lift. I would kind of frame it as, in many
ways, the marketplace is a bit hunkered down. So as an example, on the real estate side, we haven't seen
a whole lot of capital fundraising and deployment. We are absolutely ready no matter how that plays out.
We have licenses in all the right places and people in all the right places to continue not only serving our
current clients but to capitalize on potential opportunities if and when the dust settles.

John Bakewell Barnidge
Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division

Okay. And then my follow-up. As we look back to SARS over 15 years ago in light of the coronavirus, do
you see any increased demand for your products on the benefit side to note?

Scott Garrett Sleyster
Executive VP & Head of International Businesses

This is Scott, again. On the specific question, I would say, history would show that any time there's a
widespread illness, it creates a greater sensitivity among the customer base about the kinds of products
that we sell. In particular, as you know, on the international side especially, we're very focused on death
protection products. And so anytime you have something like this that goes on, you're very concerned
about your employees and your customers and you're taking lots of actions there, but I do think there is a
follow-on effect of greater sensitivity to the products that we offer.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.

Humphrey Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

A question related to PGIM. So looking at your retail flows, it looks very strong from an inflows
perspective. I think it may be even a record number, but then at the same time, it seems like you have
record withdrawals as well. I was just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of where you see
the inflows and what happened in the outflows and how do you think about it in 2020.

Andrew F. Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So yes. This is Andy, Humphrey. So we are very pleased and proud of the retail flows that we saw. As I
think Rob mentioned in his opening, we moved up to #7 in the quarter. The retail flows are really coming
from an expansion of our product portfolio on that platform as well as the work that we've done around
usage. From an outflow perspective, what I'd say is that will tend to be episodic, and I think over the long
term, we feel very, very good that due to our investment performance and our range of strategies, that we
will see a continued upward trend over time.

Charles Frederick Lowrey
Chairman, CEO & President

And Humphrey, I would just add on the institutional side, that those flows can be a little bit lumpy. And
we saw a couple of clients who want to consolidate this year. And sometimes, we're the beneficiary of
consolidation. Sometimes we're not and a couple of dominoes tilted against us this year, but that doesn't
affect how we think about our institutional capability or the quality of flows that we can have going
forward.

Humphrey Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

That makes sense. And then just a clarification of regarding Assurance IQ. So I think Ken was talking
about the -- given the growth that you're expecting and then you're not necessarily expecting any
earnings from Assurance IQ in 2020, I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly because I think

originally, at the time of the announcement, you were expecting maybe a $0.10 EPS accretion for 2020.
So I just wanted to kind of bridge the indifferences.

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, I didn't mean to say no earnings. I said not meaningful earnings, again, because of the high-
growth nature of the phase that they're going through.

Humphrey Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

So the $0.10 still kind of -- I understand you're not going to update guidance or anything like that, but is
this $0.10 still a reasonable expectation?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Again, we don't want to get in the practice of having to update this every quarter.

Operator

And I'd now like to turn the call back to Charlie Lowrey for any closing comments.

Charles Frederick Lowrey

Okay. Thank you very much. So in closing, I hope you all walk away from this call with a clear picture of
our progress and priorities, our continued sense of conviction and urgency and our path forward to deliver
meaningful outcomes for all of our stakeholders, including investors. So thanks again for joining us today,
and have a nice day.
