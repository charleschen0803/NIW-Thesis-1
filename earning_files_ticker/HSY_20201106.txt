THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. I'm curious, for the past several years, Michele, the majority, if not all, of the company's organic
sales growth has come really from pricing as opposed to volume or consumption growth. And much of this
is obviously due to the success of the company's new pricing model and the associated volume elasticity
that comes with it. I guess that said, as you look forward into '21 and beyond, I'm curious if there is a sort
of focus internally on maybe regaining some better balance between the 2 drivers. And if so, would you
expect to see some of that maybe develop more fully next year?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Andrew, absolutely. I think we've shared before that we do view pricing as an important part of our
growth algorithm, but we are very focused and would like to drive to greater balance between price and
volume. We have good visibility into Q4 in 2021, and we do expect volume trends to improve.

Part of that will be us lapping some of our pricing elasticity from last year and also a continuation of some
of the strong share gains that we've seen to date that will carry into the first part of next year. I think you
can definitely count on seeing volumes being a more important part of the algorithm next year, and we
feel good that the calendar programming we have, the innovation, the media is really going to help to
drive some of that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Along the same lines of 2021, if I can, Michele, you pulled back a little bit on advertising this quarter.
It's been a little up and down this year for understandable reasons. I'm just curious what your thoughts
are in general on what the company's plan is for advertising, marketing in general as you get into what
hopefully, will be a more normal year in 2021.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So we definitely believe in investing in our brands. That is a critical piece of our growth model on
the business. So clearly, as we mentioned to you, we had pulled back on some spend in areas where
we just thought, given the pandemic, it didn't make sense. For example, in refreshment, where we
knew consumer usage was down significantly. But as we look to 2021, and as we've started to see the
momentum that we're seeing and some of the recoveries, we definitely plan on taking our investment
levels to where we would like them to be and more in line with where they have been historically. So you'll
see us really leaning in to drive the consumer and to leverage some of the behaviors that we're seeing.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then for a follow-up, you didn't do any share repurchases this quarter. I think that's the first time in
2 years, and that was the last time it was right before you bought Pirate's Booty. I won't ask if the lack of
repo is an indication of a pending deal, of course, but I am curious how you would describe the current
environment for potential transactions.

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

I guess, particularly, our targets may be more willing to sell because they can do so off a higher sales
number than usual? Or are they more hesitant because they, I guess, kind of want to ride this demand
wave as long as they can?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Steve, do you want to take that one?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, I'd be happy to. So first, just on the share repurchase, we'll just echo what you said. Don't read
anything into that. I would say for this year, we have taken a little bit more cautious approach to liquidity
in general, going back to the beginning of the year in the COVID phase, just taking a little bit more
cautious approach.

We will be revisiting that as we look at next year. And I would say, in general, our capital allocation
priorities haven't changed. With respect to M&A specifically, it's probably more of the latter. I think
people are -- still the ones that are the most interesting are riding the wave, and they still have valuation
expectations that look like they did pre-COVID, if not higher.

But I would say we're continuing to have an active funnel, continue to look at a number of opportunities,
and we'll continue to update the market as appropriate.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I think the recovery expected in 2021 in international and other is -- you have a 2% headwind this year
in 2020. But can you give us a little bit of color as to the condition of your business in Mexico and India
and China? Is it easy to assume that things can go back to normal? Or has the pandemic impaired your
commercial capabilities at all, or the retailers' desire to merchandise confectionery products in those
markets?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So first of all, I'd start by saying, certainly, there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the
pandemic. We all know that we're seeing the ups and downs of occasional increases of spikes in markets
around the globe. That said, I would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in
international. Our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment. And I think that
we've seen, while each market is a little different and the use of the category is a little bit different,
consumers are really looking during this time for brands they trust, and we've done a great job over the
past couple of years building the Hershey equity.

So we were pleased with the rebound that we saw in many of our markets. I think I mentioned in India,
our business was now up 6% versus it had been down. We gained market share across almost every
market on our core chocolate category. So I wouldn't say that we believe our ability to drive the business
has been impaired in any market on a permanent basis. Just as we are pivoting in the U.S., I think we've
pivoted to where the opportunities are in international, and we feel good about the recovery and plan to
continue to deliver against that.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Can I dive a little bit deeper into Mexico? Are there any packaging requirements that the government is
making on nutritional values? Or any concerns about the category? How that might impact the category?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Absolutely. So the government did put in place front-of-pack labeling changes in Mexico. And that
new packaging is now in the market, and we are beginning to monitor the trends. We believe consumers
know our categories are treats. They know it has sugar, and so we expect that we'll see less impact from
that than perhaps other categories will. But we will, of course, keep a close eye on that. And I would say
Mexico has been one of the harder hit developing markets relative to COVID. So we feel good about the
progress we're seeing, but it's a little slower than some of the other markets.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

A question on your share gains in the U.S. and particularly in chocolate. You really -- and in your prepared
remarks, you touched on this, how adaptive you were by market, by channel, by need state and in terms
of smores. Some of that's related or might be related to supply chain. Could you talk about that part of it?
And I think the reason I'm asking is because if there is a supply chain breakdown or lack of adaptability by
a competitor, maybe that will represent share gains that they can reverse somewhat in '21. And I have a
follow-up.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Absolutely. So I would say, I believe our share gains are a testament to both our strong brands, our
consumer understanding, our programming as well as to the supply chain execution and execution at
retail, both of which tend to be core advantages for us as a company.

So I think we're seeing our categories and our brands are definitely resonating with consumers. And
as you mentioned, we really pivoted with the consumer. So very early on, we tried to understand how
consumer behavior was changing. And we've talked to all of you before about the fact that our category
splits, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, take home, instant consumable and seasonal. And as we saw consumers shift to
more at-home behaviors, we very early on shifted the focus in our portfolio to really dial up S'mores,
Twizzlers for movie nights, our baking product activities.

And then within the seasons, even with Halloween, we made that decision to lean in and drive and build a
Halloween season versus back away from it and everything related to that relative to, let's set the season
early so we can get consumers in pre-Trick or Treat. Let's make sure we are smart about the portfolio
that's out there and not overly indexed to seasonal SKUs, et cetera. And then we worked really hard on
messaging to message consumers safe ways to celebrate the holiday.

We dialed up e-commerce as consumers shifted to e-commerce and because we had invested in
capabilities in that, we were able to do that. And then I think a lot of the strong investments we've made
in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well, and some of those go
beyond supply chain. So we've made investments in better understanding consumer trends.

We've made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level. We've made media
investments to target better. And certainly, we've invested in our plants all along the way, which really
enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocols and really be able to continue to execute. And then we
made the decision to keep our retail sales team at retail.

So as I think about that share gain, I would say, clearly, we would expect to continue to see share gains
clearly through the spring of '21. We would expect that they would moderate after that, though we're
certainly expecting to hold on to share. And we will continue to drive our outstanding programming and
also continue to execute supply chain with excellence.

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just on any sort of onetimes from this year that, that we should be thinking about
from a model perspective? I'm thinking about COVID-related friction costs this year, but also you might
add back some SG&A in parts and others. So any onetime-type comparisons that we should think about?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think we talked about it in the prepared remarks. On the top line, we had about a 2-point impact.
So you can right away say there's a drop-through of that 2 points into profitability. But then if you take a
look at the net of cost for COVID, so protective equipment, and employee incentives that we had early in
the year, and you net them against the DME optimization, the media optimization that we did as well as
the T&E savings, it was a net slight positive on those 2 pieces.

And so that we would expect to mostly go away. We'll have some lingering costs next year, probably
less one-off in any quarter related to COVID, PPE and so forth that continue. But net, it was just a slight
positive outside of the 2-point drag on the top line.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I had a question for you. If I look back at Halloween, I'm curious if you split the season apart and you had
given some information on this last quarter, sort of the early season part and that trick or treat season
part, kind of how each piece performed, if you can give us a little color on that?

We have some information from IRI, but I'm curious if you have better information that we have. And
then I'm also curious, as I think about that early part, if that's more indicative of what you expect for the
holiday season as we move into Christmas in that kind of time where you don't have a trick or treat event.
Could that early season, if you start that season early in particular in stores, be more like what we saw in
the early part of Halloween, if that makes sense?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So clearly, we saw that within the season, the early part of the season performed more strongly, and
the later part, that's more trick or treat-focused performed a little bit softer. Now we had anticipated that.
So overall, the season performed exactly in line with our expectations. As we look at the total season, we
were quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus a year ago, as was our sell-through, up versus a
year ago.

So during a time of the global pandemic, I think it speaks to the resiliency of the category and the
consumers' desire to really hold on to and continue to celebrate the traditions and fun occasions like
this in their family lives. As we look at holiday, holiday is -- has some different consumer dynamics than
Halloween, and so we believe it will behave a little differently.

I don't think we're going to have some of the pressure that we anticipated we have coming into
Halloween. The category should be quite strong. Consumers use the product in different ways. It's much
more about family occasions. We aren't as big in gifting some of the areas of the category that might be a
little bit more hard hit. So we expect solid results given that skew to at-home consumption.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then just a follow-on to that. Are you shipping in holiday product early? And would that have
been an incremental bet? Do we see some of that in the third quarter more than we would have seen
historically?

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, we did, just like we did with Halloween, started shipping in holiday a bit early. So you do get some
pickup in the third quarter for that. That will take away a little bit from the fourth yes, quarter, maybe on
the order of 50 basis points.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

And we also that to drive the consumer behavior early as well, just as we did with Halloween. As
Halloween was still on the floor, holiday was also out there so that consumers could also gravitate to the
holiday pretty quickly. A strong Halloween sell-through really helps us because it helps us get that fast
start to holiday because it clears the space to be able to put a holiday on the floor.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on a good quarter. I want to pick up on the back of Chris' questions and try to tease out a
little bit more of the outlook on holidays going forward. The Halloween early part selling was phenomenal,
much better I think an as expected. I think a big part of that is due to the merchandising programs that
retailers had. It seems like they started bigger and earlier than they usually do. Has that, you think,
influenced how they're going to approach other seasons going forward? So said more directly, do you
expect retailers to provide more merchandising support behind the category into the holiday into Easter
than they otherwise would coming out of the success they saw in Halloween?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So we've always had pretty strong merchandising support at every season. And one thing we always think
about with seasons is when we get it on the floor because we know that consumers will buy that holiday or
seasonal product, whether it's easter, wherever, early for in-home consumption. If you get it out there, it
kind of sparks the trigger of fun moments earlier.

So I don't know that I could say specifically that we can anticipate that retailers are going to merchandise
it even more than they ever have. I do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely
get it out early to capture the early part of the season since that is the piece that is a bit more stable.
There were a few retailers, as you can imagine, with the uncertainty of Halloween and the fact that all
these decisions about what to do with Halloween really had to be made in early May, when things were
quite uncertain and schools were closed in bars and restaurants and all of that.

So there are a few retailers who had pulled back on Halloween, and based on the results of the season this
year, they will likely have more confidence going forward, which should help to make for an even stronger
Halloween next year and probably also build confidence for the other seasons like Easter.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That makes a lot of sense. And then one more question on the -- I'm sticking with follow-ons to Chris'
questions, which I thought was solid. The early part of the season versus the latter part of the season,
the earlier part of the season was exceptionally robust, and you said late part was a bit softer. But in --
somewhere in your remarks, I think you said all in, total holiday, so both early part and late part, finished
down mid-single digits for the category.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

I think mathematically, if you get the category down to single digits, we're going to have to see some
pretty sharp declines coming through the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we capture that
late part of the season. Am I thinking about it right? Am I interpreting your comments correctly?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Yes, you are interpreting them correctly. So category was down mid-single digits overall, as much as
our business was actually up, and we will see some of those declines.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. And Jason, one other thing to just keep in mind, there is a little bit of a timing impact from the
Nielsen and IRI data, given the season was on a Saturday versus a Thursday and based on retail reporting
days. So you will probably even see us down even more, and you'll have to wait until kind of mid-
November until you see some of those last couple of days being reported. So some of it when you see, will
be just the timing shift because of the day of the week, and some of it will certainly be the declines in trick
or treat at the end.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with DD Research.

David Christopher Driscoll
DD Research LLC

And congratulations on great execution in the quarter. I had 2 questions. The first one, just 2 relatively
small ones. On the other expense commentary, I think through the year-to-date period, other expense is
only a small number, but your full year projection, $100 million to $110 million on that, means it's a fairly
massive number in the fourth quarter. Am I doing the math right? Is that correct on how the pattern lays
out for other expense?

And then related, just another follow-up on your volumes expected in the fourth quarter. I think in your
prepared comments, you said North American organic growth similar to third quarter, but pricing only
like 0.5 points. So that would mean volume is something like 5 percentage points positive in the fourth
quarter? Am I doing those 2 pieces right? Any color you can give on those 2 comments?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, I'd be happy to. So on the tax side and other expense, you're exactly right. We will have a large other
expense in the fourth quarter. That's consistent with what we've been saying even in the early guidance
earlier in the year, and then along with that, a lower tax rate in the fourth quarter. If you do the math on
the tax rate, you also have to solve for a lower tax rate. So that's how those 2 lines will play out.

And yes, on the volume up in the fourth quarter, you're thinking about it the right way. We do have some
inventory replenishment that will happen in the fourth quarter. We saw that in the third. We'll see some
more of that or that continue into the fourth. We're also lapping some elasticity after the price increase
last year and then this continued strong share gains. Those 3 things are part of driving that fourth quarter
volume.

David Christopher Driscoll
DD Research LLC

Michele, a bigger picture question. First, you took pricing in most of the portfolio outside of seasonal
candies in 2018 and then in 2019, given the negative impacts to Halloween for the entire category, would
you agree that now is probably not the time for seasonal price increase actions?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Maybe this gets delayed to 2022 or sometime later until we get a normal consumer environment?
Essentially, I'm just asking you to assess your ability to pass through cost increases through pricing
actions. It's a weird environment, and I don't know how it's altered that calculus.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So obviously I can't speak to any specifics about our specific -- any upcoming specific pricing actions.
What I can say is there's been no change to our pricing strategy of smaller, more frequent increases.
And that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we
would always announce pricing at the same time. We did, for example, actually have a small price increase
this past year on our foodservice business in the third quarter.

So as we look over time, we have been able to price at various times at various economic conditions.
So what's important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm. But as we've
talked about before, we really want to grow through balanced growth across levers distribution, velocity,
innovation, price, et cetera. So we know that, that is certainly the one piece of the portfolio that we have
not yet priced. And I think it's fair to say that given that we haven't announced the price increase at this
moment in time, the magnitude of pricing in '21 would be less than we've seen in prior years, at least at
this point.

We've been pleased that we've seen conversion be pretty good this year, even in a very difficult economic
environment. And I think that continues to demonstrate what we've seen over the years, which is the
category is very resilient. Our brands are strong. We continue to invest into our brands, and that does
allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. I guess, building somewhat on earlier questions, I'd love a little bit more color around your general
mindset heading into '21 as you work through your planning process. Clearly, there are parts of your
business that have been under pressure this year, international, movie theaters, vending specialty, et
cetera, and hopefully, all those set up for at least directional recovery in the year ahead.

But at the same time, you've been gaining a lot of share. You've had great success in at home categories
like baking and with initiatives like S'mores, all of which has fantastic momentum, but again, could set
up for difficult year-over-year comparisons. So as you size it all together, I guess, is there a way to frame
your thinking at a summary level to what degree those various puts and takes sort of just net each other
out in your mind? Or are you approaching '21 planning -- thinking we've got either a net easier or net
harder setup versus what one might consider typical?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we're pleased with the momentum that we are seeing. And I would say your call-outs and what
you shared about some of the ups and downs on the business, I think, are very accurate. We believe
we're seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers and especially at a time like
this, where they're looking for some of those moments of goodness, moments of happiness. We're really
pleased with how we've been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be
able to execute within this environment.

And we feel good about that momentum and our ability to continue pivoting. So this year, obviously it was
consumer shifted to take home. And so we dialed up S'mores and we dialed up Twizzlers and we dialed
up baking, and we leaned in to create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity,
giving consumers new ways to participate Halloween, that frankly, we believe those things like candy

slides and candy graveyards and all the creative things people did will probably become a part of their
ongoing traditions, and they have just evolved.

As I mentioned, we were able to dial in and accelerate e-commerce. And I think as we look to next year,
we are prepared if the consumer pivots yet again to be able to pivot with them. I think we've built --
and we've demonstrated the ability to execute well during this environment and also to pivot from an
executional perspective, whether it's at retail or in our manufacturing facilities. So we're very focused
on that. We've captured as well some cultural positive effects, I think, capabilities we've built in terms of
operating in this environment that perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly, and we think that is
an enabler for us going forward. So we feel good about the -- as we look to the future.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Michele, I don't know if you want to take this one or Steve, but just as a follow-up, sort of unrelated. Just
any comments you might have on just current levels of promotion, the promotional environment and what
you expect to see there over the balance of 4Q and into '21?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We don't see any significant change relative to promotional activity. We didn't really see it this year.
We didn't execute anything significantly differently and nor do we expect to see anything in the future.

Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. So Michele, I was hoping you could provide some context on the partnership with Google that you
used during the Halloween period. And do you believe this capability can be leveraged for this holiday
season, but also kind of in your everyday business as you kind of look forward?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

We are continuing to leverage different types of data and analytic and insights more and more across the
business. And we continue to really try and stay on top of tracking consumer sentiment and leveraging
data and analytics to tailor copy, to tailor messaging, to tailor media. So more and more, we are
operating at a more sophisticated level relative to using multiple data sources and also using that to reach
consumers at the right places with the right message at the right time.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is this kind of new way of kind of targeting consumers like the
return that you see from what you've done, like can you just give us any kind of understanding? Because
one thing I'm noticing across the entire CPG landscape is companies are spending more money, but
they're spending more money on the same message, and in fact, new consumers are being recruited.

Usage occasions are changing, and so it really requires a change in how you talk to those consumers.
And so I find this Google's -- the partnership incredibly compelling for you guys. So I'm just trying to get
better context on how it's changing the return profile of your spend, if you can provide any context on
that.

So we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media. We always have --
we've had strong media ROIs forever. And our challenge is how do we keep making them better and then
we continuously optimize based on that. So right now, it's a big spend area for us. So it's an area we're
very focused on elevating. And it is about making sure -- right now, I would say, some of the biggest
opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting. And then once you have that target, the
ability to alter the message.

So -- and then we alter our media mix accordingly. And I would say we see significant movement in that
mix on a year-to-year basis as we get better at that. I think we've raised some of the opportunities of how
we've gone just very deep relative to specific seasons, whether it's S'mores, by zip code or whether it's
specific holidays and looking at sell-through at a store level basis to be able to dial up media on a zip code
level basis. So you'll continue to see more of that. Frankly, that's just becoming a way of how we operate
now.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And last question, just from an innovation standpoint. Can you just provide any context on kind of
what's remaining in terms of innovation this year and how things are going to work in 2021, if there's any
clarity you can provide on the launch timing?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we feel very good about our innovation some of the innovations that we are excited about that are
new to the market include the Reese Pretzel product, a Reese Cup with pretzels in it. We've had a range
of Kit Kat flavors. We know, on a global basis, a big part of the Kit Kat portfolio or flavors, they tend to do
quite well.

We are, on a very small level, launching snack cakes under our research trademark, which delivers that
Reese experience in a slightly different type of product form, and we feel good on that versus based on
some of the early test results. And we will have more coming, some items on our take-home side of our
business that won't get announced until early next year, which is typically the time we announced those
things just given reset windows. No major change in our innovation strategy. We think it's working very
well for us. We think it's rightsized, and we think it's delivering much more sustainable results.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

You've talked about the increase in e-commerce sales, even if it might have decelerated a little bit, but it's
up very strongly. You've said in the past that baskets and dollar ring are higher online. Is that still holding
true with the growth that you're seeing now?

And on the margin side, you've mentioned that there's a small gap, but that you were narrowing it and
that scale would help that. Is that coming along the way that you would have expected? How does that
look now?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean we've generally seen larger basket sizes in general across most channels this year as people
are doing fewer trips and more quantity per trip. So I think that's been somewhat of just an underlying
dynamic given the pandemic impact in the marketplace. For us, on our e-commerce business, we've seen
very significant growth across the board, but particularly in click and collect, where people actually go and
pick up their groceries, and also in the local delivery models as well versus kind of national delivery. The
margins that we have are similar to what we see in bricks and mortar. In those 2 areas -- excuse me, and

those 2 areas where we have similar products obviously that we sell in bricks and mortar. Steve, anything
you want to add?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I would say is that we said in the past that, overall, e-commerce margins are a little bit dilutive. And
it's there -- as Michele just said, in click and collect and local delivery, very similar, not much impact. And
that's probably 2/3 of our e-commerce business.

The piece that is more dilutive is the ship-to-home and, in particular, cold ship. And that's an area where
we continue to work with our customers and look at our overall investment with those customers and joint
business planning to drive efficiencies over time so that those margins align.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And I just want to follow up on S'mores. I thought that your data analysis and insight there to
push that the way that you did was interesting. As you're seeing cases rise again now, are you replicating
that? Are you seeing similar results? Is there a S'mores surge we should expect? And would it be right to
assume that those Hershey Milk Chocolate Bars are probably some of the highest margin ones that you
have?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So we have really expanded S'mores from -- at one point, it was a very focused time of year to really
capturing some S'mores as a year-round opportunity, especially if you think about how different weather is
across the entire country.

There are lots of opportunities to continue to expand that. So we're very focused on that. We're also
very focused on the upcoming baking season, where we know that consumers will be spending time at
home. It's already a natural baking season. And so we'll be looking to really optimize -- we're able to drive
leveraging insights around that season as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So just one question for me. And I think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks
about some inflation and cost of goods sold. So maybe, Steve, could you just give us a kind of a lay of the
land right now in terms of what commodity costs and just cost of goods inflation looks like currently, in the
context of -- it seems like freight costs are going up. You've had some competitors talk about cocoa prices
going up. So just trying to get an understanding of directionally where inflation is headed right now.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Sure. Yes. For us, I'd say, overall, it's been relatively stable. So on the commodity side, relatively stable.
You saw big movements in big commodities across Q2 and Q3. And of course, we've talked in the past,
we mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program. And I would say today, they're fairly stable.
There are increases in freight costs.

There, too, our teams do a great job of longer-term contracting, which helps mitigate some of that
increase. So that hasn't been a real material impact for us. We have seen some increased warehousing
costs. And part of that is volume and flow-through, along with the share gains and the volume increases
that we've seen. So we called that out in the prepared remarks. But in at least sitting at this point, I would

say overall COGS is fairly stable, and we'll get more guidance on 2021 when we get into the fourth quarter
call.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

But I guess we can infer from that, at least from where we sit today, that it's stable. It's something that
looks like it kind of carries into next year unless something changes.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think that's fair. Next year, as we get the -- you're going to have the 2020 and 2021 comp props of
cocoa start to bear the lid, so there's that to consider. And then there's other things obviously on the gross
margin side. As Michele said, we'll have a little bit more volume-driven than price-driven mix driving gross
margin next year. We'll have our continuing productivity goals. And again, a lot more on that to come
when we talk on the fourth quarter call. All right.

Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.

John Joseph Baumgartner
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Michele, I'd like to follow up on the Reese's snacking. You mentioned that it's small right now, but Hershey
went down this path about 15 years ago and it didn't really translate into anything material. So I'm
curious what the data tells you in terms of changes to the landscape now. Does this maybe mark a new
phase of the snack section evolution? And I guess where do you think it slots in? I mean, does it compete
against the Twinkie? Is it cookies? Just where is the target market? Any big picture thoughts would be
appreciated.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Absolutely. So I think we've approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way, which was not a
mass launch where we just threw it out there and tried to make it as big as we possibly could at one point
in time, but we did a very targeted in-market launch for an extended period of time so that we could really
learn about the proposition. We spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that
we really understood some of the drivers of liking in the snack cake area.

And we also really thought about where and how we wanted to play and launch. So this, for example,
is very C-store focused. It is a single-serve type of item. So we're keeping it as a focused launch. It is
definitely bringing the great chocolate and peanut butter taste profile that we have on Reese's to the
snack cake market.

So yes, it is playing in that snack cake area versus other snack cake brands. We know that we had
participated in this category for many years through licensing. And we learned through that, that our
brands could participate and extend to the category. We also know that morning snacking has been a
growing trend, and our confection items skew more to afternoon and evening. So this is a chance for us to
participate in some of that growth because that is where the snack takes get utilized.

So again, we're going to have a very focused rollout. We'll put it in locations where we think we can garner
incremental space. And we think there's a strong consumer fit and starting at C-store and looking at other
select areas. And then if it continues to perform well, we will expand, but we will watch it closely and take
a measured approach.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Can we just talk about the c-store channel specifically? It's obviously been under pressure because of the
pandemic. But I imagine that there has been some sequential improvement in there. Could you maybe
just give us some numbers about how that channel is recovering?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Absolutely. So as you said, we've continued to see strength in food and mass and dollar as consumers
eat more at home. The c-store class did see a bit of recovery in the third quarter. So we saw the business
grow in the low single digits in the third quarter, which is definitely an improvement versus those early
pandemic trends.

It did then slow a little bit as summer ended and those summer road trips decreased with kids going
back to school. Our business has tracked pretty much in line with the channel and significantly ahead of
the category. So we have share gains of about 120 basis points in Q3 in that channel. So seeing some
rebounds and some recovery versus where it was in the past as people are out about a little bit more than
they were.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Great. And then as a follow-up, actually on Brian Spillane's question about freight costs. I remember back
in 2018, as freight costs spiked back then, that's quite a bit of a headwind for you. It seems as though
it's not so much of a problem this time around. Are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of COGS
freight actually represents, and how much of that is already contracted out, and what you've learned since
2018 to make the situation this time around a bit more manageable?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Sure. So yes, freight costs right now, we don't see as a material impact. As it continues to rise, it will have
a bigger impact right now, again. Because we're contracted and our teams do a great job of managing
those contracts, it's not having a material impact. It's roughly 10% of COGS overall, and so it's not
immaterial. But right now, not seeing enough movement there given the contracting to really drive a
material impact on overall COGS.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.

Jonathan Patrick Feeney
Consumer Edge Research, LLC

So 2 quick ones. I noticed in the data, your pricing in North America is plus [ 1 9 ] on the takeaway, plus
[ 3.3 ] is what you reported. Is that just the math? Or is there some shrinking or different mix within
retailer margins? That is my first question. And secondly, historically, when you look at -- today's velocity
is generally tomorrow's distribution and your velocity has been fantastic. This is a weird year. A lot of
people's velocity is fantastic. But do you anticipate gaining shelf space in that everyday place? You look at
these baking items, you look at these take-home items, like this is phenomenally better velocity. Forget
about just the total sales that you're seeing there. Do you anticipate significant share gains, perhaps
structural ones? I'm talking share of shelf here as retailers do resets for holiday and going forward.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So 2 parts to your question. The first was around price and some of the discrepancy. And yes, there
is a mix impact. Honestly, it might be best if Melissa goes and takes you through a deep dive on that

because there's some complexity associated with it, but the P&L is definitely accurate. As it relates to
velocity, yes, good velocity. I like your phrase, "Today's velocity is tomorrow's distribution." I do think
that's very accurate.

As we look at the seasons you asked about holiday, we certainly have been able to garner incremental
distribution, incremental SKUs throughout the year, both in terms of every day and seasons because we've
been able to deliver. And the items that we then put on shelf, not only could we supply them, but then
they moved. So we do feel good about that. We'll continue to take a very disciplined approach and be very
careful that we don't over-SKU.

So we really have to look at the productivity of every SKU. And as long as it's good, we will be there. But
yes, we have been able to gain some distribution. And going forward, I anticipate that we will continue to
be able to perhaps even through the first part of next year.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO.

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I just have one quick question. Everything has been asked and answered. You made a reference in the
prepared remarks about Pirate's Booty is tracking ahead of your strategic plans. Can you talk about what
are the key learnings that you've developed through your years as the CEO that has really helped you kind
of make this a better acquisition and implement it? What are your key learnings? And what do you take
forward to future learnings -- the future acquisitions?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, so I think a lot of learnings along the way. I guess I would start with there's a business model for
brands that we, as a company, are best with. And that is branded items, where -- brand matters, where
the business has significant scale, probably close to that $100 million mark, and it needs to be a business
that has a high gross margin because that's what our business model is.

We're a branded company. We invest a lot in marketing, and we have high margins that enable us to kind
of invest and grow, invest and grow. And we -- that's our model. That's what we need. So I think that was
-- one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset. I think, secondly, really understanding the
strength of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dives on which KPIs, we think, predict the
ability for a brand to scale. And then I would say really trying to scale the business well.

And I would say, hey, we've learned lessons the whole way along the way. As you know, in the past, we
bought some businesses that were too small. We bought some businesses that had lower margins, and
we had some that we perhaps didn't execute on the scaling as well. And I think we've had a very focused
effort on the scaling as well, and we've gotten much better at that, relative to supply chain, relative to the
talent that we need when we buy a company like this, where we want to keep the entrepreneurial spirit.

We want to keep people who know the brand and the business. But we also have to be focused on the
point that we're also at a point where we want to scale the business. So I mean I go back to the scale, the
branded nature, the high margin are probably the biggest ones, and then picking the right underlying KPIs
that say it's a sustainable business because if we can do that, we can make it home.
