Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a
reminder, today's call is being recorded.

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made
based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company
at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.
Further information about these risks can be found on the company's filings with the SEC.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for
Essex Property Trust. Thank you, Mr. Schall. You may begin.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Good day, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will
follow me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A. I will provide an overview of our third quarter
results, our initial operational outlook for 2022, apartment market conditions and then conclude with the
regulatory environment.

Our third quarter results exceeded expectations, reflecting substantial improvement in West Coast
economic conditions and housing demand. Net effective market rents are now 6.4% above pre-COVID
levels and it's notable that we've exceeded pre-COVID market rents despite having recovered only about
63% of the jobs lost during the pandemic. As a result of improving market conditions, we reported
quarterly core FFO of $3.12 per share, $0.08 per share above both our sequential results and guidance
provided last quarter. This is the first of likely many quarterly sequential improvements in core FFO.

Southern California continues to deliver the strongest growth with net effective rents up 17.2% compared
to pre-COVID while Northern California is still down 5.2%. Return to office delays at many tech companies
and slower job growth compared to other West Coast areas were factors in the pace of recovery for
Northern California. Overall, September job growth in the Essex markets was 5.2%, substantially above
the U.S. average of 4%.

Turning to our outlook for 2022. We published our initial market rent estimates on Page S-17 of our
supplemental package. We are expecting 7.7% net effective rent growth on average in 2022 with
Northern California the notable laggard in 2021 forecasted to lead the portfolio average in market rent
growth next year. A key assumption driving our outlook for 2022 is the return to a predominantly hybrid
office environment occurring over the first half of the year, supporting our 2022 job growth outlook and
our expectation that the West Coast markets will resume their long-term outperformance versus U.S.
averages.

Our confidence in the Bay Area recovery next year is partially driven by rental affordability following a
year of solid income growth, lower effective rents and exceptional growth in single-family home prices.
Median for-sale home prices are up 17% in California and almost 16% in Seattle, making for-sale housing
more costly relative to rental housing and often impeding the transition from renter to homeowner. Finally,
despite large increases in for-sale housing prices, our expectation for the production of for-sale housing in
2022 remains very muted at only 0.4% of the single-family housing stock.

We previously noted that many large tech companies in our markets have delayed their office reopenings
as a result of the Delta variant this fall, which we believe is the primary factor in the slow recovery of
Northern California compared to other Essex markets. Nevertheless, recent tech company announcements
regarding office expansion, open positions in the Essex markets and new commitments to office space

all support our belief that the leading employers remain fully committed to a hybrid office-centric
environment on the West Coast.

Page S-17.1 of our supplemental highlights recent investments by large tech companies which have
continued throughout the pandemic and include Apple's 550,000 square foot recent expansion in Culver
City, their new 490,000 square foot tech campus that will soon begin construction in North San Jose and a
recent acquisition of 5 office buildings with a total of 458,000 square feet in Cupertino. Google last quarter
received needed approvals for its planned 80-acre campus near Downtown San Jose and YouTube's 2.5
million square foot campus in San Bruno was just approved by the city last week.

We continue to track the large tech companies hiring in terms of open positions and job locations, giving
us confidence that we continue to grow alongside the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy. Our most
recent survey of open positions indicates 38,000 job openings in the Essex markets for the 10 largest tech
companies, up 9,000 jobs or 26% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Strong economic growth on
the West Coast is further supported by venture capital investments which achieved new highs in Q3 '21 of
$72 billion, of which 44% was directed to organizations in the Essex markets.

Turning to our supply outlook for 2022, we are expecting 0.6% housing supply growth for the full year,
including 0.9% growth for the multifamily stock which is manageable relative to our expectations for
job growth of 4.1% in 2022. Overall, our West Coast markets will remain well below the national rate of
new housing supply growth and especially compared to the rapid accelerating pace of housing deliveries
across many low-barrier markets next year. Longer term, residential building permits in Essex markets
saw a modest 3.5% increase on a trailing 12-month basis, which is favorable compared to the U.S. where
permits have increased 13.6% compared to 1 year ago.

While our markets often temporarily underperform the national averages during recessions, we remain
disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, including the cadence of housing supply deliveries with
permitting data supporting our West Coast thesis.

Turning to the apartment transaction market. We continue to see strong demand from institutional capital
to invest in the multifamily sector along the West Coast as evidenced by increasing transaction volume
and cap rates in the mid-3% range. Apartment values across our markets are up approximately 15%
on average compared to pre-COVID valuations. The company has recently seen more development
opportunities, and we were able to purchase 2 commercial properties in the third quarter, one located
in South San Francisco that we expect to become a near-term apartment development opportunity and
another in Seattle that we will begin to entitle for apartments while earning an attractive 6% going-in yield
with a high-quality tenant. We also recently closed 2 apartment acquisitions, as noted in the press release,
and our acquisition pipeline is strong. Barb will discuss a new co-investment program in a moment, which
is strategically important given our preference not to issue common stock at the current market price.

Finally, the California statewide eviction moratorium ended September 30. However, a few meaningful
local jurisdictions have extended their separate eviction prohibitions. The net result is that a significant
portion of our portfolio remains subject to eviction moratoria and other regulations that will slow the pace
of scheduled rent growth in 2022. Fortunately, the Federal tenant relief program has come to the aid of
many of our residents, although the reimbursement process continues to be slow and requires a significant
coordination and support from the Essex team. I am grateful for this extensive team effort.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Thanks, Mike. First, I'll start by expressing my appreciation for our operations team as we are in the midst
of a strong recovery, our team has been busier and working harder than ever. I also want to thank the
support departments, especially our delinquency collections team for their diligence to help our customers
navigate the complex rent reimbursement legislations.

On to today's comments, I'll provide an overview of our portfolio strategy relative to current market
conditions, followed by some regional commentary and expectations for our markets. Our third quarter

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

results reflect a combination of the operating strategy implemented early in the pandemic and a healthy
recovery in net effective rents that began in the second quarter as California and Washington finally
reopened from the pandemic shutdowns.

As you may recall, in the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic-mandated shutdowns halted our
economy, Essex quickly pivoted to a strategy that focused on maintaining high occupancy and coupon
rents with the use of significant concessions. Now over a year later, as our markets recover, we are
starting to see the benefits of this strategy flow through our financial results.

In the third quarter, same-property revenue -- same-property revenues grew by 2.7%, which is primarily
attributable to a reduction in concessions compared to the previous period. By primarily utilizing
concessions last year, we were able to limit the in-place rent decline to only 1.1% in the third quarter. The
benefit of this strategy is also coming through our sequential revenue growth, which increased 3.2% this
quarter from the second quarter. With the market volatility we experienced over the past year, this is an
extraordinary result and positions the company well going forward.

From a portfolio-wide perspective, market conditions remain strong compared to a year ago as
demonstrated by the 12.6% blended net effective rent growth in the quarter. In addition, rents relative
to pre-COVID levels have continued to improve, further enhanced by a delay to the typical seasonal
slowdown in all our markets.

Turning to some market-specific commentary from north to south. Rents and jobs in the Seattle region
have had a strong recovery with net effective rents up 8.3% compared to pre-COVID levels and year-over-
year job growth of 5.5% in September. New supply continues to be largely concentrated in the CBD, which
is less impactful to Essex because 85% of our Seattle portfolio is located outside of CBD.

Looking forward to 2022, as outlined in our S-17 of the supplemental, total housing supply deliveries for
the region is expected to decline compared to 2021, and we anticipate job recovery to continue, led by
Amazon, which recently announced plans to hire over 12,000 corporate and tech employees in Seattle. As
such, we are forecasting market rent growth of 7.2% in 2022.

Moving down to Northern California, which is our only region where net effective rents remain below pre-
COVID levels. Greater job loss and apartment supply deliveries caused net effective rents to fall further in
Northern California since the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the job recovery in Northern California
has been at a slower pace than our other regions, with only 4.4% year-over-year improvement compared
to a 5.2% for the entire Essex portfolio as of September. We believe this is partly driven by the more
owner mandates delaying normal business activities.

Apartment supply, particularly in San Mateo and Oakland CBD are also presenting challenges for nearby
properties, leading to financial concessions for stabilized properties for -- of over a week in these markets
in September. On the other hand, we anticipate that Northern California will be our best-performing region
in 2022, with market rent growth forecast of 8.7% on our S-17. As Mike discussed, we expect hybrid
office reopenings to continue, which will drive additional job growth and healthy demand for apartment
units. With similar level of supply delivery expected in 2022 as this year, we are optimistic that Northern
California is in its early stages of its recovery.

Lastly, on Southern California. Rent growth has continued to improve in the third quarter, and net effective
rents in September are 17.2% above pre-COVID levels. As we have mentioned in the past, Southern
California is a tale of 2 markets, the urban areas in the downtown L.A. versus the more suburban
communities, which have generally outperformed. In June, L.A. rents were still below pre-COVID levels,
but as of September, they are now 6.8% above. While Orange County, San Diego and Ventura have
achieved rents between 17% to 30% above pre-COVID levels.

Job growth in Southern California continues to progress well, up 5.9% in September as the region's
economy continues to reopen and recover. With the exception of the Downtown L.A. area where
concessions averaged 1 week in September, the rest of our Southern California market has demonstrated
solid fundamentals with no concessions recognized in September.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

We expect Southern California strong rent growth to continue in 2022, led by Los Angeles, which has just
begun to recover the jobs lost during the COVID recession. Apartment supply in the region is forecasted to
increase next year compared to this year and could present pockets of interim softness counterbalanced
by a continued favorable job to supply ratio across the region. As you can see on our S-17 market rent
growth for Southern California of 7.1%, we anticipate this region to perform at a comparable level as
Seattle. With this backdrop of stable occupancy amidst a favorable supply-demand relationship, our
portfolio is well positioned for the continued growth.

I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak.

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Angela. I'll start with a few comments on our third quarter results, discuss changes to our full
year guidance, followed by an update on investments and the balance sheet. I'm pleased to report core
FFO for the third quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08 per share. The favorable
outcome was due to stronger operating results at both our consolidated and co-investment properties,
higher commercial income and lower G&A expense.

During the quarter, we saw an improvement in our delinquency rate, which declined to 1.4% of scheduled
rent on a cash basis compared to 2.6% in the second quarter. The decline is attributable to an increase
in income from the Federal tenant relief programs that were established to repay landlords for past due
rents. Year-to-date through September, we have received $11.6 million from the various tenant relief
programs, of which $9.5 million was received in the third quarter.

Given the increased pace of reimbursement, we began to reduce our net accounts receivable balance in
order to maintain our conservative approach to delinquencies and collections. As a result of the strong
third quarter results, we are raising the full year midpoint for same-property revenues by 20 basis points
to minus 1.2%. As should be noted, this was the prior high end of our range.

There are 2 factors I want to highlight as it relates to our fourth quarter guidance. First, as Angela
discussed, we are seeing strong rent growth in our markets. While there will be a small benefit to the
fourth quarter, the vast majority of the benefit from higher rent growth won't be felt until 2022 when
we have the opportunity to turn more leases. Second, our fourth quarter guidance assumes we continue
to receive additional government reimbursements for past due rents and contemplates a continued
reduction in our net accounts receivable balance. Thus, we expect our reported delinquencies as a percent
of scheduled rent to be above our cash delinquencies, which is consistent with the third quarter reported
results.

As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.11 per share to $12.44. This reflects
the better-than-expected third quarter results and changes to our full year outlook. Year-to-date, we have
raised core FFO by $0.28 or 2.3% at the midpoint.

Turning to the investment markets. During the quarter, we raised a new institutional joint venture to fund
acquisitions as we believe this is the most attractive source of capital today to maximize shareholder
value. The new venture will have approximately $660 million of buying power, a portion of which is
expected to be invested by year-end.

As I discussed on our last call, we are seeing an elevated level of early redemptions of our preferred
equity investments due to strong demand for West Coast apartments and inexpensive debt financing,
which is leading to sales and recapitalization. For the year, we expect redemptions to be around $290
million. Roughly 40% of these redemptions are expected to occur in the fourth quarter. Given the current
environment, we could see continued elevated levels of early redemptions in 2022.

In terms of new preferred equity and structured finance commitment, we are on track to achieve our 2021
objectives as outlined at the start of the year. Year-to-date, we have closed on approximately $110 million
of new commitments. As a reminder, it typically takes 3 to 6 months post closing to fund our commitments
given they tend to be tied to development projects.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Moving to the balance sheet. As we expected, we are starting to see an improvement in our financial
metrics, driven by a recovery in our operating results. In the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio
declined from 6.6x last quarter to 6.4x. We believe this ratio will continue to decline through growth in
EBITDA over the next several quarters. With limited near-term debt maturities and ample liquidity, we
remain in a strong financial position.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

As we look to 2022, how do you think about Essex's ability to capture that MSA market rent growth of
7.7% that you discussed? I know either from a regulatory standpoint or the lease roll perspective, just
trying to tie the initial same-store expectations to the market rate data that you provided.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Nick, it's Mike. And Angela might follow me with comments. I think we're feeling very good about
conditions around us. Again, we have high occupancy throughout and a very strong loss to lease, and
that's been noted before. And everything looks like our markets are recovering. We expect to outperform
the U.S. with respect to job growth, certainly going forward. And we view the catalyst of the return to
office in Northern California as being sort of the last piece, that's probably the relative underperformance
that we've had thus far relative to the peer group. And we see that as still being a very strong part of our
portfolio.

Historically, Northern California produces the highest CAGR of rent growth over long periods of time. And
we expect that dominance to show itself. And a lot of the reasons why we're embedded in the various
comments that you heard from all of us. So hopefully, that all made sense. A number of open positions
for tech companies, the big investments that the tech companies continue to make within the Northern
California markets, et cetera, I think it bodes well. So we really feel great throughout our footprint. But
the key piece going forward, I think, is Northern California, we feel very good about that, too.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Maybe following up on that, the return to the office or hybrid. How do you think that impacts seasonality
over the next few months as employees maybe move back into Northern California specifically?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

I think that given that we carry high occupancy into this period of time, any incremental growth in
jobs should have a very positive impact on market rents. And so again, our expectation is, I would say,
Northern California was probably shut down to a greater level than most other markets, maybe L.A. would
be #2. But it has had the most muted recovery, yet, it has, I would say, the strongest and most dynamic
job base.

So again, we're looking forward to that. We were hoping it would happen earlier. But again, I think the
Delta variant has postponed that. But again, we feel strong. We think all the things, all the conditions that
we would expect to see from a number of open positions for these companies, major commitments to
campuses and lease commitments for office space, et cetera, all seem to be focused on a return-to-office
program probably in a hybrid sense for these companies. So I think that's before us in the not-distant
future.

Our next questions come from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

So first question, I guess, is on the topic du jour inflation and all the ways that it's impacting the business.
How are you thinking about that impact in regards to payroll, R&M, utilities? And what offsets could you
perhaps -- what levers can you pull to offset some of those costs into next year? And then maybe some
broader comments on your technology platform, where you are in terms of the rollout of that and how
that could be a help here as well?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Haendel, thanks for the question. It's a good one. And I'll let Angela handle the technology piece of
it. I -- help me. What was your first part of your question? I'm sorry.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Inflation.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Inflation, yes. Yes. So I mean, we've studied the inflation thing, the historical precedent going back a long
time actually into the early '80s. And no doubt, we are feeling quite a bit of pressure on the cost side.
Certainly finding positions, especially on-site positions is challenging and compensation is going up, for
sure.

On the -- the one piece that's good in California, obviously, is property taxes because Prop. 13 limits
that increase. And so I -- but I go back to rents. Rents are obviously the big thing. We're a high gross
margin type of company, and therefore, the rent growth really matters in this equation. And I think in
an inflationary world, rents do very well. And so I would expect that our rent growth would more than
compensate for whatever cost increases that we have. And I think it's -- it would be -- I'm not saying I
want this to happen. But I think if we were in a more -- a stronger inflationary period, I think it would be a
net positive in terms of the financial performance of the company. Obviously, if inflation goes up, all asset
values decline in value. So maybe that would be one sticking point as well because probably cap rates
change and some other things happen as well. Angela, do you want to comment on?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Sure. But I think Barb wants.

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I just want to follow up on that one point. Haendel, the other thing that we've done over the last
several years is take advantage of the low interest rate environment and lock in our interest rates for
long periods of time. And we have very little debt maturing next year and the following year. So we're not
susceptible to rising rates from that perspective. We've locked in our interest expense effectively. And we
have very little -- limited variable rate exposure as well. So we feel good about where the balance sheet
stands from an inflationary perspective.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Great. And on the technology front, Haendel, what we have been doing is really focused on ramping up
the contactless interactions which also allows for efficiency and then allows more flexibility for our site
team. And so we are going to continue that path and further refine and enhance those technology. And
what that means is that it will allow our staff to probably specialize more and hopefully continue to be
more efficient, and that will help. I don't think it will be, say, an immediate relief as far as the payroll
expenses that you're looking for, but over time, it should benefit the business platform.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So without putting words in your mouth, it sounds like the near-term outlook for inflation, does it
necessarily spook you? Perhaps there's a little bit of pressure building in the business, but maybe not to
the degree to perhaps put a mid-single-digit type of expense growth outlook for next year.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're not giving -- yes, we're not guiding yet for next year. And Barb drilled that in prior to the call.
Please don't give out any guidance for next year. So we're still working on this. Yes, I guess the point
I would make is in high gross margin businesses, even if you get some expense pressure, you -- still
the top line is so much more important. So I think -- in my view, we always look at rents, what's the
relationship between rents and incomes. And so in an inflationary environment, if incomes are going up,
we're probably able to pass through most of that in the form of rent. And if that happens, we will do very
well in that scenario.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. Fair enough. And the second question, if I could ask about the 2 office acquisitions here
in the quarter. Maybe some comments around the math, the thought process. And should we think of
these as opportunistic and more one-offs or some -- perhaps more reflective of the low cap rates in your
markets which could be making more conventional acquisitions more difficult? And if that's the case,
thoughts on calling some of the portfolio a bit or maybe taking advantage of some of the pricing.

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Haendel, this is Adam. So I'll touch on both of the 2 office acquisitions that Mike touched on in the opening
remarks. They're both kind of separate, which is why I'll cover them separately. The first one, which is in
South San Francisco, we've had that tied up for over 3 years. And so during that time, we worked with the
city to determine what sort of zoning we could get. And during that time, we're basically able to increase
the density by over 100 units. So coupled -- when you take that, coupled with the cap rate compression
that we've seen in the market, the deal made more sense than really any development deal that we've
penciled in the last couple of years. So there is in-place income on the existing use, which -- it's in the,
call it, high 3 kind of cap rate range, which is fine. And that will get us through 2 entitlements, which we
would expect in 9 months to a year or so.

The other one, somewhat of an outlier. It's a single-tenant office deal in Seattle, really good location.
There's still another 9 years on the lease. And we have a partial guarantee for that term. So it's north of
a 6 cap on current income. It does pencil on today's multifamily underwriting. And it is actually zoned for
multifamily, but we'll revisit that in 5, 6, 7 years from now to see what makes the most sense. But for
now, that's a very solid covered land play from our perspective.

Operator

Our next questions come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.

Unknown Analyst

This is [indiscernible] for John Kim. So I was just wondering a little bit about the regulatory risk in your
market. I know you've kind of touched on that here and there. But are these increased risks kind of
being priced into valuation? Some of your other peers were citing that as a reason to reduce exposure in
California. And I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about that.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Adam -- well, I'll start, and I'll let Adam chime in here. Well, we've obviously dealt with regulatory issues
over many, many years, really for the 35 years I've been here. And historically, the bigger the loss to lease
gets because of rent roll, let's say, the more buyers and sellers will start pricing in a portion of it or want
a higher cap rate given the delayed impact of rents. But generally speaking, all apartments are valued
based on market rents today, not -- and then again, the loss to lease is a determination based on facts
and circumstances.

So with California rent control law, the statewide law, at CPI plus 5% max of 10% annual increase, I don't
think that, that in and of itself will cause a significant valuation differential. And I think that's the key part
that if you're moving your rents by CPI plus 5%, let's call that 8% or something like that, most buyers
will think that, that is plenty of compensation for the transaction. And I don't think cap rates move all that
much because of that. Adam, do you want to comment on that?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Just one additional comment. The most onerous rent controls within California, San Francisco or Santa
Monica or Berkeley, there's just very little of the trade there. So that's where you see that larger loss to
lease, the bigger gap between in-place and economic. And that's where pricing would fluctuate more. But
as far as AB 1482 goes, the California statewide one, it doesn't really factor in to really anyone's models
from what I can tell.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. Going back to the inflation piece too, how is that affecting your planned developments? I know you
briefly talked about the other commercial acquisitions and how relative to multifamily, those are still good
trades. But kind of moving forward in the development pipeline, like is that something that you're really
thinking about?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

It's something we consider in all of our strategic decisions. We're not focused on the office market. And I
want to be very clear that the 2 opportunities that we had are like the one-offs. But no, I mean, we look at
all of those factors in determining where and what to invest in.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think we estimated about 9% between today and when we would start construction, for example,
on the South San Francisco deal that Adam talked about earlier. Could that be high, we don't know. But
we build in an estimated cost escalation. And -- but what really drives all these deals, if cap rates go from
4.25-ish down to 3.5 or so, the built-in value of those transactions, other development transaction until,
of course, land sellers -- until land sellers adjust their price, it makes a ton of sense and gives a lot more
value created in that process. Adam, do you?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. So just one final follow-up there. We're always looking at the spread between where stabilized
acquisitions or stabilized assets are trading versus our development yield. And so whether deal is entitled
or unentitled, we're going to look for a different spread between what in-place cap rates are. And so that
escalation that Mike referred to, we assume on everything, whether it's 3 months out, 6 months out or 2
years out, and then that factors into the denominator. And so with this cap rate compression, we've seen,
especially on these 2 deals, and there are a couple of others potentially in the pipeline where that spread
has increased, and those are the deals that we are pursuing aggressively.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just a quick question. Could you maybe provide us some details on your loss to lease across the various
different markets so we can compare them to the rental rates you disclosed for your macro forecasts?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Sure. Happy to. It's Angela here. At September, the portfolio loss lease was 9.8%. And -- but it's a wide
spread from Northern California in the 4s to Southern California in the low single digits, around 13%. And
so -- and we understand that typically, analysts look to this loss to lease to model next year. So I want
to just make sure that I provide a little more context on that because we want to consider a couple of
factors.

First, this year was an unprecedented year because we started out the year with a huge negative rent
growth and have turned positive. So it's a very steep curve. And so this trajectory is not likely to repeat
next year. And so -- but because of that, and the delay in the seasonal peak, it has created a small drag
on revenue for next year. And secondly, some markets, those over 10%, which, broadly speaking, will
be our Orange County, San Diego and Ventura counties, they have -- they're above the 10% cap -- rent
control cap. And so that will be a factor as well.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Angela, that was actually exactly what I was looking for. Just maybe one other question. When we
think about the leasing spreads versus listed rates, is there a lead lag there? Some of the data we look at
is that listing rates seem to be a lot higher than the signed leasing spread. So I'm just wondering if the
listing rate is a leading indicator and how you think about that.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

I'm not sure if I am following your question.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. So what I'm suggesting is are you...

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Are you talking about asking versus achieved? Is that what you mean?

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. Yes. And I'm suggesting are your asking in October, November, December higher than where you've
been signed?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Yes, I see what you mean. Normally, it is -- well, let's put it this way. It has been higher, but that's pretty
typical. What we try to do is forecast what the rent level is going to be 1 or 2 months out, whenever we
sent a renewal. And so what that means is sometimes it's higher and sometimes it's lower. So we think
that we're now in -- we are sending out renewals now for, say, December, January, if -- it's not likely to
be a whole lot higher. But back in, if we're sending renewals out in March for renewals in May or June, it
tends to be higher. So it really depends on the timing and the market conditions.

Our next questions come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I was curious, going back to the market rent growth forecast, if you could just give some additional detail
of kind of how you thought about a baseline scenario that maybe doesn't include some type of hybrid back
to office and how you went about determining what that additional growth would be layered on top with
that back-to-office scenario playing out? We know you guys tend to take a conservative approach. So just
trying to understand the baseline versus what the upside look like.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's a great question. And yes, I'm not sure we approach it that way. I mean, our research group,
Paul Morgan, he -- they use a variety of data sets and they're not looking at any one thing, not creating
some base case scenario. The simple part of it is looking at what we expect job growth to do and how
many units of demand are represented by the job growth and then how much supply do we have. And so
fortunately, again, we're 96% occupied in all these markets. So it is like we have a hole to fill before that
-- before the demand over supply situation takes hold. So we're already there.

But included in some of the things he looks at, which is, I think, some pretty interesting data. For
example, Seattle has recovered 79% of the jobs that they lost in the pandemic, and he's expecting
them to be at 110% by the end of the fourth quarter. So they will actually be above their pre-COVID
employment level, whereas almost all the other markets are still below pre-COVID level by the end of
2022. So it's not that simple. He considers affordability, which affordability is a key part of what we do.
And we look at things now because there's been such incredible growth in rents in Southern California,
they screen. And the way we do affordability is on a market basis, not a property-by-property basis
because we're trying to look at the overall dynamic in the marketplace.

And Southern California because it has such great rent growth is screening a little bit expensive, and
Northern California, which has the highest incomes and rents that are pretty moderate given what's
happened here, so that's what leads to the better growth rate for Northern California next year. And
just by way of background, I'll give you a quick comparison. So rents in Seattle and Los Angeles, the
median rent, the market rent, not Essex portfolio is about $1,816 in both cases. But in Seattle, the median
household income is $102,000 and in L.A., it's about $88,000. So Paul would look at that relationship and
say, "You know what, that's a positive for Seattle." It has about the same rents, has a lot more room to
run with respect to incomes, and that would factor into his equation in terms of what we expect market
rents to do. That makes sense?

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes. No, that's very helpful color. And so in that scenario, if demand were to exceed just from a job
growth perspective, you talked about kind of the jobs versus supply piece. So if back to office does drive
incremental demand above and beyond that, is it conceivable to think that you could benefit from a pricing
power perspective, but also see some upside to occupancy as well?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Well, occupancy is a little bit different element. And that really has -- it has to do with how aggressively
we're pushing rents. And so occupancy, some have noted has actually declined a little bit, but that's really
because we're pushing rents. When you push rents, you hold out a little bit longer and you are willing to
accept a little bit lower occupancy level.

But going back to our basic thesis, if we have 530,000 jobs created next year and the typical relationship
between a household and a job is 2:1. So we have somewhere around 265,000 units of demand for
apartments, and we produce a total supply of 64,000 homes, we should do pretty darn well in that

scenario. Again, affordability becomes the key issue, and affordability is different by market. We screen
relatively inexpensive in Northern California and relatively expensive in Southern California. But just
looking at basic supply demand, we should be in great shape next year. And -- so we don't know exactly
what's going to happen. We think 7.7% is a big number, but we'll wait and see.

Our next questions come from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess outside of restrictions within the confines of AB 1482 in California, are you guys self-limiting any
markets or submarkets with respect to renewal rents just kind of in that sort of corporate spirit and being
the good guy from -- vis-à-vis your tenants that you guys have employed in the past, thereby sort of
exacerbating that growth in the loss to lease as things go forward?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

That's a good question, and this goes towards the social responsibilities part of our corporate governance,
right? We have a self-imposed cap of 10% for many, many years. And really, the approach behind that is
to avoid being viewed as anti-gouging. And so -- and that strategy has worked well for us for many, many
years, and it really has not materially negatively impacted the returns of our shareholders.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And Angela, which markets are you sort of employing that strategy at this moment, if you don't
mind?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Well, it's broadly across the portfolio. And so it's wherever we have that hitting the loss to lease above
10%. And so it happens to coincide with 1482. So it's the Orange County, San Diego and Ventura because
they're all above 10% loss to lease.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And Seattle, perhaps?

Angela L. Kleiman

Yes, Seattle as well.

Our next questions come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I was just curious in the Bay Area, if you've seen any change on the move-in stats if maybe more people
are coming in from outside the metro versus what you've seen more recently?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

It's a good question. And the granularity of that data is kind of difficult to follow. And so it's hard to say
exactly what's happening recently. We do have job growth and the job growth is exceeding the national
average. So from that statistic alone, we feel like there was some positive movement back to the Bay Area
and clearly, occupancy, et cetera, has confirmed that. And so -- but we don't think that the major shift
has happened. We expect it to pick up here in the next couple of months as we approach year-end and
hopefully accelerate into 2022. And that's the premise. But again, we don't -- we need -- I'd say we need
more job growth than what we have currently to achieve the 2022 forecast that is on S-17, but we'll do
fine either way.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Got it. And then on delinquency, can you walk through sort of what the underlying trend has
been? I know there's noise obviously related to the rental relief payments. But has the underlying level
come down? And how do you see that sort of playing out?

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Brad, this is Barb. So you can see we report our delinquencies. For the quarter, we were at 1.4% on
a cash basis. And keep in mind, we did report July last quarter, and that was at 2.2%. So that implies
August, September had come down. That was around 1% on a cash basis. And then October, it's about
1%. And that's really being driven by the reimbursement. As I mentioned during the call, we got $9.5
million in the third quarter. Most of that hit in August and September. And we've seen -- in October, we've
seen a commensurate amount. So that's kind of where we've been at. We've been stable, I would think,
the last 3 months. It's been pretty stable in terms of our net delinquencies.

Operator

Our next questions come from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.

Neil Lawrence Malkin

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Yes. Exactly. It would be a higher without those reimbursements. The reimbursement is what is driving
that number lower, correct.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes, sure. Yes, I was trying to understand what's baked in. And if anything has changed and how you
recognize bad debt and how that looks. I get you. Okay. And just in terms of the people moving into San
Francisco, I guess, we'll focus on that one. You mentioned that, in general, your portfolio has seen people
come back. And I wonder, just given in San Francisco the rents are still down from pre-COVID levels,
can you comment -- are the demographics changing a little bit from the people who are moving in? Are
they the same in terms of income, jobs or are more people who are coming in sort of moving in from the
outskirts looking for a deal of some kind that would potentially impact your ability to retain those once
market rents come back?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

This is Angela here. That's a good question. We have not seen any meaningful change in the demographic
profile. And I think this question was also posed early on when rents declined or when we were giving out
significant concessions. I think at the end of the day, it's becoming -- it's all about jobs. And so while it's
slightly more affordable, people are not going -- we just don't see people randomly moving into the city
and then not being able to stay. Does that make sense?

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes, yes. I appreciate that. Yes. So just the other one follow-up, maybe just talk about development and
the sort of mezz outlook. You kind of touched on this earlier. But given everyone understands there's
a lot of inflation with input costs, supply chain disruption, hard to get labor, et cetera. But you made
the comment that you're seeing increase in development and a commensurate increase then in mezz
opportunities. Can you just maybe elucidate that a little bit?

Just you think that, that -- it would be a tougher environment. But can you talk about what's driving that?
And then what kind of opportunities you're evaluating right now and potentially the size?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Actually, maybe I think there are several parts to that, and I think we may need to clarify the question
a bit here. But overall, we think 2022 will have roughly 4% more supply than 2021. And part of that is
because there was the delivery delays caused by COVID. And eventually, they will catch up into 2022, but
not enough to be really meaningful in the scheme of things, especially, again, when you go through the
job numbers that we have and the implied demand from 530,000 new jobs across our footprint. Notably,
on the supply side, Seattle is the 1 market that's down pretty substantially about 12%. So that's another
gold star, let's say, for the Seattle market there. Barb, do you want to? Or Adam? Yes.

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

So Neil, as far as on the street opportunities that we're seeing to kind of echo your point with costs having
risen. Now that being said, costs are well down from where we were kind of at the lumber peak in mid-
summer. But taking all that into account, we're seeing a steady flow of deals, but fewer deals, it seems
that are penciling and that's both on the mezz and pref side as well as on the direct development side.

The one thing -- the one point I made earlier about -- with cap rates compressing on existing products,
they're also diminishing some on the development yields. So there are kind of competing factors as to how
deals are being made today. But like I started with, there is a flow of deals happening. But again, those
that are actually penciling are, I would say, fewer and further between.

And then, Neil, I just want to make sure that in my prepared comments, I did say that we had $290
million of preferred redemptions this year. And given the current environment, if it is to continue
low interest rates and high valuations for West Coast assets, we could expect early redemptions of a
comparable amount in 2022, I would imagine. So we could still face headwinds there, just given this
environment. We're seeing a lot of developers able to take us out early for a variety of reasons. And so I
wanted to make sure that you heard that as well.

Our next questions come from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Maybe a question for Adam. I think in the prepared remarks, Mike referred to apartment values being up
15% versus pre-COVID levels. Curious in the hardest-hit markets of the Bay Area where you think current
values are relative to pre-COVID levels.

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. Thanks, John. Well, as Mike pointed out in the opening remarks, that's an average. So as it relates
specifically to the Bay Area, there's been very little to trade, very little of substance. I think that number
in the Bay Area is going to be anywhere between 5% and maybe upwards of 20%. But again, there's been
really just 2 Class A deals that have traded and then some kind of B and C deals that have traded. So
we're talking about a very limited data set.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And that's -- sorry, to clarify, 5% to 20% down or up?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Up.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. One final question for me, and then I'll jump out. The -- I'd like to just drill down on San Mateo.
Obviously, job growth is improving, migrations up. But sequentially, each and every quarter, revenues
keep declining in San Mateo. Can you just tell me what's going on in terms of the rental behavior, the
durability of demand gains over the last few quarters? And when does it turn the corner?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Yes. That's an interesting question in that the data set itself, I wanted to just give a little context because
I think that matters. Our San Mateo market only actually has 4 properties in the same store. And so
because of that, you are going to see a lot more volatility. And in addition, there has been well -- good
job growth and it's a good market for us, there has been lease-up competition in the area. And so we're
talking about an interim period where you have competition from lease-up, it's a -- well, their job growth
is still at a slower pace relative to our other markets. And you add that with a small data set, it's going to
just be a lot more volatile. It's not that there's anything fundamentally that we're concerned about with
this market.

Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Apologies if I missed this, but on your co-investment platform, has the interest from institutional capital to
partner with you changed the economics of those deals at all? Or is the increased attractiveness that you
talked about really been driven by lower debt cost in the market today and the higher LTVs that you can
use in those agreements?

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Amanda, it's Barb. We've used the co-investment platform for many, many years, and we like it because it
is an alternative source of capital win. We don't like our equity, our stock price. And so we've used it from
time to time. We do think it's a good source of capital for us. And in terms of economics, we were able to
reduce the hurdle rates and improve the economics for Essex. Cap rates have come down over the past
year, 75 to 100 basis points, and we're able to change terms accordingly. So the economics of the joint
venture didn't change materially from what we've done in the past. But we'll continue to use the source of
capital going forward depending on market conditions.

Our next questions come from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.

Chandni Luthra
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I'll start with your redevelopment program. If you could perhaps give some color. I believe you started
that last quarter where you're at and how you're thinking about it in 2022.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Sure. Happy to. It's Angela here. We started ramping up, and I mentioned that last quarter, and we're
going to continue to do so, especially in light of the recovery and the strength of the recovery, and of
course, our expectations for market rent growth next year. And our goal at this point is really to double
the number of renovations for next year compared to this year and then ultimately get back to pre-
COVID levels because it does take a little more time to ramp up these activities. And as market conditions
improve, we also make sure that we underwrite the improvements and ensure we don't have capital
destruction and make sure that we are meeting the market and optimizing our returns. And so it's not a
turn the switch on. We just -- we are just much more -- we just want to be diligent about it.

Chandni Luthra
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And then Angela as a follow-up to that, I mean, how is ROI looking at on sort of those redevelopments?
Is that consistent with pre-COVID levels? And is there a big range to think about there? Just trying to
understand that if you could throw some color on that as well, please.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Sure. No, happy to. We target ROI at pre-COVID levels. So -- but keep in mind, it's driven by market
rents. And so what that means is that, that ROI -- unlike -- the way we approach it is that we wouldn't
proceed with a reinvestment opportunity if we're not achieving our target ROI. And therefore, if you're
concerned that there's been any compression or deterioration there, there has not been.

Let me make sure I understand your question. Are you asking about our leasing velocity whether it has

Chandni Luthra
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I mean Amazon's policy shift on return to office, the announcement a couple of days ago.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Yes, I see what you mean. So we have not seen any impact from the Amazon shift. Because keep in mind,
while, yes, they have the corporate mandate, but they also have a lot of workers throughout the region.
And so that's -- and of course, all the businesses that support Amazon. But practically speaking, we have
not seen an impact on our turnover. We have not seen an impact on our occupancy and certainly not an
impact on our ability to raise rents.

Our next questions come from the line of Daniel Santos with Piper Sandler.

Daniel Santos
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So my first one is on your stock price. You didn't issue equity in the third quarter yet on our estimate. And
based on the Street's estimate of NAV, you're trading at a premium. Instead of issuing equities sort of --
are going to disposition and JV routes. So I just was wondering if you could give more commentary on
your views, on your stock price and maybe using more equity going forward.

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, that's a good question. I mean we always remain very disciplined as it relates to what source of
capital we use. So we look at a variety of different sources, one being the equity, one joint venture equity
and one disposition. And keep in mind, with values up 15% from pre-COVID levels, that puts our NAV and
-- where we think the value of the company is. It's up quite a bit from where we were at the start of the
pandemic. And so that's a factor that we look at when whether we want to issue equity today or not.

The other factor to keep in mind is we have a lot of money coming back from preferred equity
redemptions. We're using that to fund the new investments we're making, along with using the joint
venture platform. We really do you think it creates a lot more value for our shareholders given the fees
and the potential for promote hurdle and given where our stock price is trading. We don't believe we're at
a material premium to NAV at this point.

Daniel Santos
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, how much more are you expecting a benefit from SmartRent? And
what's your timing on that?

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, that's a great question. The value of our SmartRent investment is about $75 million today. And
our third quarter financials, there's a lag effect there because we report them -- the shares are still held

within RTV until we come out of lock out. And their financials are 1 quarter in arrears for us. And so we
would expect a fairly substantial gain in the fourth quarter. It could be up to $40 million. And then we
would also have to recognize an unrealized deferred tax provision as well. That could be up to $12 million.
Both of those numbers are not reflected in our full year guidance for total FFO. Just given the uncertainty,
there's a lot of other moving parts within RTV that we don't try to predict that gain or loss. But those are
the numbers related to SmartRent in and of itself.

supply there/what you're seeing on the ground, if anything yet.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. This is Mike, and good question. We are still waiting and sort of guessing as to what might happen
with SB 9 and 10. And of the 2, the one that's more impactful is SB 9 because that would effectively
have the state override local zoning laws as it relates to the development of ADU units. And so potentially
allowing more ADU units to be built in the suburbs. So I want to note that there previously was a ADU law
that was passed earlier this year and this whole situation has been quite politically active with respect to
the YIMBYs, the "Yes In My Backyard" versus the NIMBYs, the, "No, In My Back Yard" groups. And that's
going to be an ongoing battle.

So I think personally, given that there was an ADU law that was out there before and it had relatively little
impact that's going to continue to be the case. There was a L.A. Times article that was recently written
and it said -- it estimated, I don't know where this estimate came from, but I'll just mention it for the
sake of transparency. It mentioned that estimated 1.5% of single-family homes are likely to use SB 9. So
I suspect that will be high. But the backdrop of this is that Governor Newsom and various other sources
have indicated that the state is short millions of homes. And the likelihood the SB 9 and SB 10 will change
that, I think, is very unlikely.

Right. And I just wanted to touch on the trajectory of potential renewals going forward given the CPI
regulation. Would you consider pushing a little more on that lever in future rent negotiations to make sure
that over the span of a few years, you're able to get to market quicker? Or do you see that being just
playing out similarly how it has in the past in terms of the difference between renewals and new move-ins
spreads?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Well, the CPI plus 5%, it's that, but it's cap to 10%. So it's not a metric that we have, say, a flexibility to
push at our discretion. And we've been operating in this market even before AB 1482. We have assets that
had rent control. And over a long period of time, it had comparable growth rates, and we've operated well
under these circumstances. So we just -- we don't think this is going to fundamentally change our ability
to achieve our return targets.

Our next questions come from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

I was just kind of curious how you're thinking about pushing rate in the fall winter. It looks like some of
your markets, you saw a little bit of an occupancy dip, and maybe it's a different strategy across markets.
Would be great to discuss that as well.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Yes, happy to. What we're -- so this is an unusual year in that normally, we peak around July. And so
starting, say, end of July, we started to have a deceleration for 6 months. This is an unusual year in that
we have this huge ramp-up. We went from this -- a big negative, I think, like negative 10% of market
rent growth in Q1, and we peaked around -- it depends on which markets, but the Seattle and Northern
California peaked around August. And Southern California is just peaking now, like as we speak.

So it's very different from that perspective. Having said that, that natural seasonality does play itself out.
And so the question is really a magnitude issue. And what you're going to -- what we're going to continue
to do is focus on at this point, wherever we can push rents, but more likely as we head into November,
December and now focusing on occupancy. And I think some people noted that in the third quarter, we
allow occupancy to fall a bit, but I want to emphasize that was because of the strength of the market. And
now we are going to preserve those rents and focus on occupancy if we see that deceleration continue to
continue.

Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's great. And maybe just a follow-up on that comment that SoCal is just peaking now. Is that late
October peak? Has it been leveling off or starting to see a little bit of pullback? Just kind of curious where
it is.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

It's kind of between mid-October and now, so say, in the past week.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Schall for any
closing remarks.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We look forward to seeing many of
you, virtually speaking, at the upcoming NAREIT. Until then, stay well. And again, thank you for joining the
call.

Operator
Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line
