Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Diamondback Energy Second Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Vice President, Investor
Relations. Sir, you may begin.

Adam T. Lawlis
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Second Quarter 2020
Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be
found on our website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO.

During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the
company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses.
We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-
looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the
company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The
reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday
afternoon.

I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Thank you, Adam. And welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call.

Before we get started, I would like to take a minute to continue to extend our thoughts and prayers to
all of those both directly and indirectly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. This year has brought
unprecedented challenges, and I'm proud of how our organization responded given the obstacles
presented. Our teams reacted quickly to the commodity price volatility and adjusted our operating and
capital plans in real time. We are seeing the benefits of this work today with all-time-low cash operating
costs and capital costs per lateral foot at or below all-time lows in both basins. This is also accompanied by
high-graded forward development plan weighted towards the Midland Basin, where we have high mineral
ownership, lower midstream and infrastructure capital requirements and higher returns due to the quality
of our acreage accompanied by industry-low drilling and completion costs.

Turning to the second quarter. We dramatically reduced our operated rig count in the second quarter
from 20 rigs on March 31 to 6 rigs today. In response to historically low commodity prices experienced
in the quarter, we made the decision to complete as few wells as possible in the second quarter, with 0
wells turned to production in the month of June. We also curtailed 5% of our oil production during the
second quarter. This curtailed production has been restored and is now receiving significantly higher
realized prices than it would have received when the decision was made to curtail. We have 3 completion
crews working today to stem production declines and to meet our fourth quarter production target of
between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels of oil per day. Importantly, Diamondback decreased activity levels
throughout the second quarter while not spending excessive dollars on early termination fees or other
onetime expenses that are headwinds to cash generation.

Looking ahead, production is expected to continue to decline in the third quarter but rise to meet our
fourth quarter guidance, as we began completion operations in June with 2 crews and added a third
completion crew in July. We expect to run between 3 and 4 completion crews for the rest of the year;
and are currently running 6 operated drilling rigs, which is our base case for the rest of the year. In 2021,
should a maintenance capital scenario become the base case, Diamondback can hold fourth quarter 2020

oil production flat while spending 25% to 35% less than 2020's capital budget, which is also expected to
include lower midstream and infrastructure budgets. The second half of 2020 and 2021's capital programs
will benefit from the drawdown of some of the DUC build from the first half of 2020 as we work down our
operated rig counts as contracts rolled off.

We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion of stand-alone liquidity and have only $191 million of our
September 2021 notes outstanding after tendering for 55% of the original $400 million issuance during
the second quarter. This is our only major term debt maturity before 2024. With our reduction in forward
capital spending and expectation for true free cash flow generation at current commodity prices in the
second half of 2020 and 2021, we will look to reduce both gross and net debt while continuing to return
capital to our shareholders through our base dividend. This dividend remains our primary return of capital
to our equity holders, and the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the dividend based on the
current forward outlook.

To finish. Diamondback has further adjusted downward our already low-cost structure and is prepared to
operate successfully in a lower-for-longer oil price environment. A lot of the efficiency and cost gains made
during this downturn will become permanent and will benefit Diamondback shareholders in a recovery.
Low interest expense, low leverage, industry-leading low cash operating costs, downside hedge protection,
strong midstream contracts and the benefits of Viper and Rattler will allow Diamondback to operate
effectively through an uncertain forward outlook.
With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.

DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] So your first question will come from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist
Securities.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

First question, Travis, for you, or Kaes, I guess. We've heard a lot this year about how activity and
pricing has impacted everybody's free cash flow, but again what we've noticed from you all, and you
mentioned this in the press release several times, is that your costs come down notably again in 2Q. So
my question is how your cost control sets you up for free cash flow generation better, as it appears to me
your outspend is now behind you all.

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Yes, certainly. I'll agree that the outspend is behind us. And as I articulated, in the third quarter, fourth
quarter and throughout next year, we'll be generating significant free cash flow. The cost structure
remains one of Diamondback's significant advantages. You've heard me say before that our main focus
is to convert resource into cash flow at the most efficient margin while we drill, really drill and complete
really good wells. The costs savings and the cost reductions that we're seeing right now through this
downturn, we believe that a high percentage of those will continue throughout the forward development
plan. Historically, when we go through a cycle, you'll see service cost concessions of 10% to 15%. We're
now down over 25% over the last 12 months. And as long as rig count stays below 200 rigs out here in
the Permian and commodity price stays sort of range bound where it is right now, we feel pretty confident
that the execution and cost metrics that we're seeing today will be part of the future -- part of our future
operating plan.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Leads into second one, just on that plan. I was wondering on the future activity cadence and
leverage. Specifically, you guys have now mentioned a couple times that you can keep '21 activity flattish
with, I think you've said now, even 25% less costs, so the question would be, if prices stay about at
today's level into next year or even go a little bit higher, would you still potentially keep activity levels
flattish and cut debt? Or how would you think about it? Because it -- certainly it sounds like you have the
ability with these costs to come in a little bit better. So I'm just wondering, if prices do rally a little bit as
all others seem to be cutting production out there, what's the thought of tackling debt or looking a little bit
more on activity?

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Certainly we're not seeing any signals that growth is needed from Diamondback or from our industry in
general. So growth in today's world is pretty much off the table. The comments I made in my prepared
remarks echoing the Board's viewpoint that we're going to -- we're -- our primary form of return to our
shareholders is in the form of our dividend, and our Board is committed to maintaining that dividend and,
hopefully, growing that into the future as well. Beyond that, excess free cash flow, as I said, it -- we'll
be using to reduce debt. So I think it's a combination of both continue to lean into the dividend and also
reduce total debt and net debt at the same time.

CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Yes. Neal, I think we're really focused on this Q4 exit rate number on oil of 170,000 to 175,000 barrels
a day; and maintaining that number in 2021 with the lowest capital required, whether that's on the
midstream side, the infrastructure side as well as the DC&E side. So we're continuing to refine that and
put some guideposts around 2021, but as Travis said, growth isn't top of mind today. Instead, it's how
capital efficient can we be to keep that production flat in 2021.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Derrick Whitfield from Stifel.

Derrick Lee Whitfield
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Wanted to follow up on Neal's first question. Perhaps for yourself, Travis, or Danny, could you speak to
the repeatability of your recent operational records with the completion of the Spanish Trail 4-wall pad
10.5 days and the horizontal well you drilled and 8,000 foot in 24 hours? And if possible, help us kind of
quantify the savings associated with that degree of efficiency versus your average well. And Travis, we
understand that every well can't be a pacesetter well, but we're just trying to get a feel for the degree of
cost savings and how repeatable that could be for you guys in the future.

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Yes. Derrick, Danny is in the room this morning, and I'm going to let Danny answer those specifics.

Daniel N. Wesson
Executive Vice President of Operations

Derrick, yes, first, on the kind of repeatability point on the completion side. I mean really that's a kind of
an operational procedural change from one of our service providers and a new kind of way of attacking
zipper completion. So that's repeatable on each pad we go to that we have those [ simul ] frac crews
rigged up on. It's certainly something we anticipate going forward. And then as far as on the drilling
side, the 8,000 foot in 24 hours, while that's a leading-edge kind of metric and it's a basin record and
a Diamondback record, I don't expect us to be beating records on every well that we drill, but certainly
we'll keep edging closer to those types of results. And while that's the leading-edge marker, maybe the
midpoint moves closer to that and as we continue to utilize the technology that our partners are bringing
us and start pushing the bounds of what we can do.

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

And then I think, Derrick, on the costs side, the dual completion crew that completes 2 wells at once and
can -- did that Spanish Trail pad. You're paying more for the horsepower, but you're also saving a lot of
money on the variable costs. So you're probably saving somewhere in the range of $20 or $25 a foot. And
I think tangentially that benefits areas where you have high water out or high production. You're watering
out your production for a lot shorter period of time and getting that production back online. So that's a
crew that we're going to use in areas where we have a lot of existing production throughout the basin.

Derrick Lee Whitfield
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Very helpful, guys. As my second question, I'd like to shift to the evolving regulatory environment but
perhaps for you, Travis. You've correctly outlined your minimal exposure to federal land as a potential
competitive advantage in the event that there is nonsupportive industry legislation with permits and/or
fracking. With the understanding that you guys are one of the more progressive E&P companies on ESG
matters and are not exposed to federal lands, could you speak to your greatest regulatory concerns in the
current environment?

DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Yes, sure, Derrick. It's a lot of -- we don't have a lot of clarity on what the regulatory environments can
look like if we fast forward to administration change, but what we do know is that it won't speed up.
Things won't become more efficient and so what we're trying to do is be as much on our front foot on
things that require regulatory approval. Now you've just echoed and we have articulated that our -- we
have essentially no exposure to federal acreage, but we're going to see what the new rules of engagement
are should they get rolled out. And you can expect Diamondback, like you said, to be progressive in the
way that we navigate through those new rules of engagement. We -- listen. We support sound science
that drives regulation, and you've heard me say that before in our sustainability report. And we'll continue
to support regulation that's backed by sound science. When those 2 things deviate is where Diamondback
and our industry are likely going to have a problem with the regulation.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

You all in your presentation, on pages, I think it's, 10 and 11, provide your current inventory, and you do
have that economic sensitivity. And it looks like the Midland Basin is pretty resilient in this assessment
down to at least $40 to $45 a barrel. Can you give us some sense of what caused that resiliency? Is it
the current well costs? And maybe if you can give a little bit of color around that inventory. Where do you
think that relative, I guess I'll call it, quality is versus what you've drilled to date and maybe versus what
you see with -- compared to other peers?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes. Scott, I think it's misunderstood how good our Midland Basin inventory is. I'd kind of put our Midland
Basin inventory, particularly with our cost structure, up against anybody, and that's just proven based on
the numbers. So with current well costs below $600 a foot on the Midland Basin side, we have a significant
runway of quality inventory ahead of us. And I think we wanted to get ahead of that discussion topic which
seems to poke its head out once in a while. So really on the Midland Basin side, putting $0 of value on the
gas side at $35 a barrel, you have over 3,000 locations economic today. And I think that speaks to the
quality of inventory and the cost structure behind that inventory.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. And I guess my specific question would be -- and you've talked about well costs and obviously the
royalty rate advantage, but can you talk maybe about the like EUR and productivity, say, relative to, say,
some of your peers? Is -- or is it really the costs and the royalty advantage?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

It's really a combination. I mean, some of our peers, mostly the peers that are larger than us that have
a significant amount of inventory, they're spacing their wells wider and doing bigger frac jobs, so they're
getting a little more EUR per foot, but the costs are higher. We've tended to space our wells relatively
tighter at 8 wells across 660-foot spacing in the Midland Basin. And that's partially due to the completion
design being a little bit smaller frac job but also the costs being lower and therefore getting a little lower
EUR per foot, but from a returns perspective, you're drilling and completing those wells for multiple
hundred dollars per foot cheaper.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then my follow-up question is on the conversation of maintenance spending into next year.
How many wells does it take to maintain your production? And to maintain that 170,000 to 175,000 on the

oil side, would your oil cuts stay flat, go -- I mean, what [ does your oil cut do through like '20 and '21 ]
on a maintenance plan?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes, I think oil cut comes up a little bit from where it was in the second quarter because of the
curtailments, but we're probably still somewhere in the low 60s now. Our maintenance plan in 2021 is
moving more and more towards the Midland Basin. So that probably means a few more wells than if you
were 50-50 Midland-Delaware, but I think something similar to our gross operated well count this year,
with 2/3 or more focused on the Midland Basin, is kind of where our head is at. And I think, as we're doing
our work right now to refine that analysis and refine that 25% to 35% less capital number, we'll update
the market when we have that data.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens.

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

You guys have had a nice improvement in LOE. Can you just talk about how you think LOE trends
particularly in the back half of 2020 and then more importantly in '21 and what drivers you have done to
gain that further improvement?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes, Gail. Really credit to the team and the field organization who went from ramping up in April to
curtailing in May and bringing that curtailed production June to keep LOE as low as it did in the second
quarter below $4. I think that naturally that number is going to come up a little bit in Q3 and Q4 but still
probably be somewhere in the lower half of the 4s. And then as we think about the next year, our large
capital spend on the infrastructure side in terms of electrification of some fields as well as going to gas lift
projects will help LOE stay in that kind of low 4s range as we head into 2021. And every cent at current
production is about $1 million a year of cash flow, so we're picking up pennies and going to stay focused
on being as close to that $4 bogey as we can.

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. And then in '21, your take-or-pay obligations or firm sales increase with the start-up of Wink to
Webster. I was just kind of curious on how you guys are thinking about price realization expectations in '21
[ as percent ] of WTI and the importance of having that exposure to Brent as we move forward in time.

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes. I think the exposure to Brent stays about the same 2020 to 2021, about 60%, but once Wink to
Webster comes on, that contract moves from a Midland-based price to an MEH-based price. And I think
our mentality there and thought process is these pipe commitments and the long-term sales agreements
are essentially large insurance policies for when things go bad. And right now, with Brent-WTI as narrow
as it is, we're probably losing a few cents versus selling those barrels in Midland, but if Brent-WTI blows
out to $4 or $5 a barrel, then we're probably receiving somewhere close to 100% of WTI.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Asit Sen from Bank of America.

Asit Kumar Sen
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

The DUC count of 110 to 140 at year-end '20, and you talked about drawing those. What's a good way to
think about a normal DUC level in this scenario? And if you could -- I know it's a little early. If I'm thinking
about maintenance capital into 2022 at current strip, how should we conceptually think about Midland-
Delaware split and capital needs for infrastructure?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes. So I'll take the second part first, Asit. I think overall infrastructure is -- the line that we define as
infrastructure will be cut almost in half going into 2021. And I think that number -- we've had a large
infrastructure build across our position over the last 3 or 4 years, and there's a lot of scrutiny on that
number to not come back up. So as we have executed on our onetime projects on electrification and
gas lift and we have very few new batteries to build, instead we expand our existing batteries. That
infrastructure budget is going to keep being driven down even in 2022. That's a long way from today, but
I think our goal is to try to be at least 2/3 Midland Basin weighted for the foreseeable future. And whether
that's in a growth or a stay-flat scenario, I think we have the inventory to do that.

Asit Kumar Sen
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up question is on the ESG front. Travis, you've emphasized ESG. And on Slide
20, flaring as a percent of net production has come down pretty nicely year-over-year. Could you talk
about the strategies enabling this? And again remind us on the compensation matrix as it relates to ESG.

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Yes. Specifically, our field organization and operations organization jumped ahead and took advantage
of some of the slowdown in our drilling activity to kind of get caught up on some of the Diamondback
required drilling and completion operations, particularly in the Delaware Basin. In some instances, we
brought our balance sheet to bear where we spent dollars to eliminate flaring, but it's essentially across
the board a heightened emphasis to not flare at all. And we do need at times help from our gathering
partners to make sure that -- once we're hooked up, that they can move the gas, but in general we've
adopted a policy of every well is connected to a gas sales point before it's brought on. And that's -- that,
plus working closely with our gathering and processing partners, has allowed us to really substantially
reduce our flaring.

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes. And Asit, I mean, we've even taken the matter into our own hands by converting some of these
contracts that we -- the legacy contracts that we have from POP, percent of proceeds, over to 100% fixed
fee. And that's what's driving our gathering and transportation costs going up by a little bit this quarter.
Now we catch the benefit of that on the realized price side on the gas front, so it's really a neutral trade.
And the higher gas goes up, the more we're exposed to that on the Diamondback side. So using the legal
and the contracts route to incentivize our gatherers and processors on a fixed-fee basis to take our gas.

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

And we've got on the -- in fact, you can read it, Asit, on Slide '21, some of the changes we've made
to our short-term incentive compensation program. And as a reminder, this scorecard, this corporate
scorecard that we presented in our proxy, that makes up half of every employee's short-term incentive
compensation on an annual basis. So we've got a 15% weighting on our ES&G measures, and you can see
what those are on Slide 21. Listed their safety metrics, flaring, greenhouse gas emissions, the percent of
recycled water, oil spill control and TRIR or total recordable incident rate. So there's 5 measures that make
up that ES&G score now.

DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Grampp from Northland Capital.

Jeffrey Scott Grampp
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

You guys have communicated very clearly an aspiration to reduce debt here on an absolute relative basis
over the next few quarters, so I was wondering if you guys have kind of targeted either an absolute or
relative level on the debt side that you guys would want to get to before assessing increasing returns to
shareholders.

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Jeff, I don't think they're mutually exclusive. We've raised our dividend every year since putting it in place
3 years ago. And I think, that being the primary return of capital, we're going to look at that very closely
at the end of the year and see what 2021 holds on that front. The one consistent theme we've received
from our largest shareholders over the past few months is to protect the dividend and, in exchange for
protecting that dividend, cut capital. And that's what I think we're going to do. I think overall we would
like our debt to be lower than higher. And I don't want to put out a 2-year or a 5-year target on that
front because a lot can change in this business, as you've seen in the last 3 months, but I do want to also
emphasize that at the parent company -- we still have 3 companies, right? And each of those 3 companies
has debt that's manageable. All 3 companies will be generating free cash flow, starting in the third quarter,
going forward. And on top of that, Diamondback has a lot of ownership in those 2 subsidiaries, which while
it won't -- you can't sell all that in a day, at some point, that is a safety valve for how much debt you think
you have at the parent company.

Jeffrey Scott Grampp
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it, appreciate that, Kaes. And for my follow-up, Travis, I wanted to pick your brain on the M&A front
maybe from a couple of angles. First is just generally your comfort level of taking a serious look at any
deals in this environment. And second is just any level of interest in terms of diversifying the asset base
outside of the Permian. Do you see benefits to that from Diamondback's perspective? Or do you think it's
more of a competitive advantage to have the concentration and the knowledge base that you have in the
Permian?

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Look, in terms of the first part of your question, M&A. We are so internally focused right now on doing
the things that we need to do. Look, our industry has been rightly criticized for all kinds of noise that
have distracted from returns. And our focus right now is singularly trying to deliver the highest returns
and cash flow for every single dollar we invest. And look, from the public guys, the debt is trading so
poorly for the public guys that could potentially be targets. It's just doesn't make any sense for us right
now. So that's kind of my view on -- that's my view on M&A. And then I just don't think that it makes
sense for Diamondback to be looking at other basins. We are -- one of the core philosophies we talk
about here is know what you're good at. Diamondback is really, really good at Permian Basin, extraction
of hydrocarbons; and that's borne out by our cost structure and our execution metrics. And that's our
emphasis. That's what we're good at. That's what we know we're good at, and that's what we're going to
maintain.

DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Travis, your guidance implies a -- call it, a 60-40 split in footage between the [ Midland and ] Delaware
Basins this year. I was wondering if you could give us maybe [ some more ] thoughts on how that mix
could look as we head into the back half of the year and perhaps any preliminary thoughts on '21.

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Sure, Arun. I'm going to let Kaes answer that. He's got his spreadsheet in front of him.

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes. Arun, the 60-40 really is driven by a lot of the first half of the year being in the Delaware Basin. And
looking to the back half of the year, Q3, Q4, and into 2021, we've really moved the rig schedule [ on ]
the frac schedule to about 70-30 Midland-Delaware. And while I don't have my spreadsheet in front of
me, that's kind of the path forward is let's get more focused on the Midland Basin where we have less
infrastructure needs, less midstream needs, lower LOE and probably better returns and an overall cost
structure. So I think, for us, 6 rigs operating. 4 of them are in the Midland, and 2 in the Delaware.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. And Kaes, if you're going to characterize what the spread and, call it, an oil breakeven is today kind of
using some of your leading-edge well cost, what do you say the spread is?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

I'd say it's less than $5 but somewhere around $5 a barrel, your breakeven in the Midland a little bit lower
than the Delaware. I mean I just think, if you're running $5.75 or $5.80 as your cost per lateral foot,
that's a pretty good-returning project with some of these Midland Basin wells in the 80, 90, 100 barrels a
foot EUR range.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And just my follow-up: Quite a few incoming questions just on next year's CapEx
thoughts. Obviously, you released this a couple -- 2, 3 weeks ago, but just the 25% to 35% decline year-
over-year to keep 4Q oil flat, you did highlight some lower infrastructure costs, but what type of well cost
is kind of embedded within that range? Or are you using basically the 2020 updated outlook for well costs?
But maybe just a little bit of color on that would be helpful.

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

I don't think we would use the 2020 updated outlook, the real-time costs, to drive that number. We're
really kind of using the lower end of our full year 2020 guidance rate. We -- I think Travis mentioned it
early in the call. Well costs are down 25% year-over-year, probably 50% of that service costs related, but
I think for us to guide to all-time-low well costs in 2021 would not be a prudent idea.

Your next question will come from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first question is following up on some of the higher ones on productivity and activity allocation. Can
you tell us how you anticipate the corporate-wide productivity per foot to trend in 2021 relative to 2020?
And I guess we're asking because I know that there's been some change recently and there's some

preference between high-grading zones in a more modest price environment versus more co-development,
versus kind of [ lease retention ].

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Well, I think, Jeanine, overall with more Midland Basin as a higher percentage of your total capital, your
Midland Basin EUR per foot is lower than the Delaware, but your well costs are significantly lower. So while
I can't give you an exact productivity on well EUR per foot, I do think in general the couple hundred wells
we're going to complete in 2021 will be a higher productivity on a returns basis than 2020 because, in
2020, we were heading into the year to complete 350 wells. And we have slowed that machine down to
complete 185 this year and something close to that next year. And I think just in general our next 80, 85
wells I see on the schedule for the second half of 2020 are significantly better than the first half of 2020.
And then we expect that level of detail on drilling our best stuff first to carry into 2021.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's really helpful. My second question is just back on CapEx. I know you pre-released the
updated production and CapEx guide. Last night, you provided the helpful breakout between the different
components, which were kind of reset to the higher end. And not to rehash old news or anything like
that, but I still think that there is a lot of questions on some of the moving pieces of that 2020 update,
especially on the D&C side, given that you're completing the same amount of net wells as you previously
planned and exiting with some less DUCs. So maybe just a little bit of color there for some clarification
would be helpful.

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Sure, Jeanine. I think what's unique about how Diamondback reports CapEx is that it's a number that
actually matches the cash flow statement. And sometimes that's been to our detriment, particularly in the
first half of the year. So in general, we came into the year running 23 rigs and 8 completion crews, and
we're going to exit the year running 5 or 6 rigs and 3 or 4 completion crews. And that results in a net cash
outflow and a cash drag of $250 million or $300 million on the budget. And I think for others who report
accrued CapEx, that doesn't match their cash flow statement. We on an activity-based basis are going
to do kind of $1,550 million to $1,600 million of capital this year, with a with a large cash outflow drag
heading into next year.

Your next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I wanted to follow up a little bit on the costs side, certainly looking at your leading-edge well costs that
you guys are talking about on your slide deck in both the Midland and Delaware. Certainly, those appear
to be below your 2020 guidance in terms of cost per foot. Just trying to get a sense there. Do you think
kind of the full year '20 Midland and Delaware DC&E well cost per foot guide might end up being a little bit
conservative? Or are you just kind of maybe being a little reluctant to kind of just change things sort [ the
near here ]?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

I think we're a little reluctant to change it just because there's -- half the year has gone. And the way we
report CapEx, probably 3/4 of the year is essentially gone on a well cost perspective, but these lower well
costs that we're seeing today in real time will benefit the company in the fourth quarter and into 2021. So
I think -- I just think it's prudent for us not to change that guidance, but certainly we expect the trend to
continue.

DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And that's helpful. And I guess clearly you guys are very focused, it seems to be, on maintenance
mode in a $40 oil world and rightfully so. Travis, you certainly talked about not having kind of the right
signals in this current environment to really indicate for anyone in the industry to pursue production
growth. I guess, what do you think the right signals might be for the kind of FANG and the U.S. industry in
general to kind of maybe start thinking about returning to production growth?

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Well, certainly we've got to have, you've got to have a lot higher commodity price. I don't know what
higher means but certainly materially higher than what you see today. You also have to have access to
capital, which right now has been -- there's been a capital starvation for a number of quarters for our
industry and rightfully so, as I mentioned earlier, because of our industry's inability to generate true
returns, but it's -- and then the last part of that will be that certainly investor sentiment will have to
change dramatically from where it sits today. So there is quite a bit of headwinds, I think, for our industry,
as you look ahead, to try to think about any kind of meaningful production growth.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

I wanted to ask, Travis, and this goes back to a comment you made earlier in response to one of your
earlier questions about the rig count staying under 200 and service costs. If we go back to the end of
last week, a couple of the bigger operators out there, 2 majors, I think everyone is expecting them to
be dropping rigs, but they really indicated that they're going to be dropping quickly or dropping a lot of
rigs into year-end. And I'm curious. As you look forward in the back half of '20 and into '21, as that rig
count continues to go down, how do you see things changing for you as an operator or maybe just in your
environment or the greater ecosystem out there?

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Well, certainly if we continue to have this environment, as I mentioned earlier, well costs are either
going to stay the same or they're going to go lower. If -- and I think it's reasonable. And if commodity
prices increase, you'll start to see the service sector respond, but look. This -- the Permian Basin is going
through a seismic shift in capital allocation from all the operators, and you can see it in the production
responses. We're now below 4 million barrels of oil a day of production. And so I just -- it's just hard to
see in this environment any meaningful change in the current operating situation that all the companies
are faced with here in the Permian. And Charles, just to add to that, though: I said, with this continued
reduction in activity and even in this environment, I can't emphasize enough that Diamondback's clear
advantage is not only the number of locations we have that we laid out on our slides in terms of inventory,
but it's our cost structure. And so the lower and the lower the price of the commodity goes and the more
the margins get squeezed, the more really efficient, high-margin companies get highlighted. And certainly
Diamondback, as evidenced by our numbers in this release, falls into that category.

And your next question will come from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.

Brian Arthur Singer

on the oil price, on the right amount of production to hedge; and then if we are in a lower Diamondback-

plus-industry growth environment in the Permian, the strategic value of your interests in VNOM and
Rattler?

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Brian, the -- Kaes mentioned earlier about how Diamondback has a large ownership position in both our
subs, and that continues to literally and figuratively pay dividends to Diamondback shareholders. And
it's something the Diamondback Board is aware of, but it's we're comfortable in our position and our
ownership of those subs today. Do you have anything to add, Kaes?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

No. And I think on the hedging side, most of our hedges, we've structured as 2-way collars. And so we
have a slide in our deck where we are exposed to the upside here, and we have a good amount of 2021
production hedged. We haven't added much on that front. We've actually restructured and lowered the
total exposure in 2021, but overall I think, if we're moving towards a true free cash flow model that
distributes a lot of cash to shareholders, Diamondback should emulate what Viper and Rattler have
done over the past couple years, which is distribute a lot of cash back to their shareholders, one being
Diamondback. But more hedging, I think, is probably in our future, and making sure your dividend is
protected on the bottom end and you print a bunch of free cash on the top end of those 2-way collars.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up is, what are you seeing from outside operators in the Permian? And if oil
prices do rise, do you have a sense if the level of discipline from the on-site operators will be lower or
greater than your own?

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Well, certainly our industry doesn't have a good track record of that discipline, but I believe that there
has been a change in C-level in terms of discipline. And I'm confident that all operators that at least have
any awareness of our industry are going to be very judicious in trying to resume activities that generate
production growth.

Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy.

Michael Hall;Heikkinen Energy;Analyst

Appreciate the time. I just want to do, I guess, follow up on one thing; and then also ask, I guess, on
base declines. Maybe first, on the declines. I'm just curious. As you guys have slowed down a bit here this
year, what -- how would you think about the impact of that on the base decline profile as you look at '21,
exiting '20, entering '21, relative to how things looked exiting '19 heading into '20? What's the change in
base decline rate there?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes. Michael, on the oil side, we released high 30s was our base decline exiting 2019 going into 2020. I
think that probably goes somewhere into the mid-30s. I can't guarantee the low 30s yet but probably the
mid-30s on -- at least on oil. So probably 300 or 400 bps of benefit. On the BOE side we were at low 30s,
kind of 32%, 33% this year, 2019 going into 2020. And that probably goes down in a couple hundred bps
lower into the -- near the 30% range.

DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I guess the follow-up was on the M&A commentary. It seemed like
maybe, Travis, you were referring to the public space in that commentary. I just wanted to follow up. Is
your view that M&A doesn't really make sense? Is that applicable in both public and the private space, or
is it worth differentiating between the two at this point?

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Well, it's all about the rock, right? So I mean, if you find good rock, you shouldn't care whether it's public
or private, but the problem that we're seeing on the public side is how poorly the debt is trading for public
companies. And that has a significant detriment on acreage valuation. On the private side, there's just not
that many opportunities out there, truthfully, of Tier 1 acreage. I mean we're not going to -- there is no --
there's just not a lot of Tier 1 rock that's out there. And that's kind of how we differentiate it.

Your next question will come from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities.

Richard Merlin Tullis
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Kaes, it was mentioned a couple times that the dividend is the primary vehicle for returning cash to
shareholders. We just wanted to get your thoughts on potentially Diamondback implementing, say, a
variable dividend that paid out a certain percentage of excess cash flow yearly.

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

Yes. I mean, Richard, my opinion is I've heard a lot of talk about the variable dividend, and the only
variable dividend I've ever seen is at Viper in our space, but for us, the fixed dividend is the priority. And
I think, in the conversations with our largest shareholders, they want to be running kind of a dividend
growth model as how they're getting cash back from their investment in Diamondback. And I think overall
it's a good concept, but it's just not a concept that we're focused on right now. We're focused on the base
dividend, which in our peer group is the highest yield today. And I think investors knowing that's safe is
important, and knowing that that's going to grow in the future is also important.

Richard Merlin Tullis
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Sure. And then just as a follow-up looking at the base case 2021 budget of around 6 rigs, maybe for Travis
or Danny. Do you envision allocation of some level of capital in that scenario to continue testing your
acreage, such as going back to the limelight area or other intervals?

Matthew Kaes Van’t Hof
CFO & Executive VP of Business Development

There might be a little bit in there, Richard, but it's going to be as muted as possible. I mean I think given
the shocks that the industry has gone through over the last 4 months just exemplifies how precious capital
is. And I think a lot of our landowners have been pretty accommodating through this. And we're going to
do what we can to hold acreage but also only drill our best stuff with the majority of the capital.

Travis D. Stice
CEO & Director

Yes. Richard, we remain singularly focused on delivering the highest returns and cash flow per share for
each dollar that's invested. And every capital allocation decision that we make runs through that aperture,
and we'll be consistent with that on a go-forward basis.
