BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Sharon, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2020 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you
may begin your conference.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Sharon.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release earlier this
morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our home page and on our Investor Relations
home page.

With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and
our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list.

Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements,
which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly
from the matters discussed today.

During today's presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer
picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes of prior periods. When you hear
us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable
items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say
organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A.

We will also refer to outgrowth compared to our markets and when you hear us say market, that means
change in light vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our
organic revenue change versus the market.

Please note that we have posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We
encourage you to follow along with these slides during our discussion.

With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Pat. And good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for the second
quarter today and provide an overall company update, starting on Page 5.

While the industry production rates were clearly weak during the quarter, we performed strongly on a
relative basis. With approximately $1.4 billion in sales, we were down about 43% organically, and this
compares to a market being down about 50%. This means we drove a significant outgrowth. In fact for
the quarter, we saw outgrowth in all major regions. Our decremental margin was about 28% in the quarter
as our margin performance was impacted by the COVID-19 related shutdowns and inefficiencies related to
the production restarts.

We delivered positive free cash flow for the quarter despite lower production levels, which we believe
is a testament to the underlying cash-generating ability of this company. I am proud of how the entire
BorgWarner team has reacted to this extremely challenging environment. We met the challenges of
managing costs and cash during the production shutdowns, while ensuring our ability to supply our

customers as production resumed. All this was done putting the health and safety of our employees in
front.

Let's now turn to Slide 6 where you can see our perspectives on the global industry production. Overall we
expect the challenging environment to continue throughout the remainder of 2020. However, our industry
production expectations for the full year have improved primarily due to the second quarter production
coming in at the high end of our prior expectations. It is important to note that the market environment is
still volatile with the risk of future production disruptions arising from COVID-19.

With that important caveat in mind, on a full year basis, we expect the market decline to be in the minus
22% to minus 25% range compared to our prior expectation of a 25% to 31% decline. Looking at this by
region, we're planning for Europe to be down in the 26% to 28% range. And in North America, we expect
a 24% to 27% decline. On a relative basis, the outlook for China is stronger where we still expect 13% to
15% decline for the full year.

As you will see from the line chart showing our different scenarios, we expect the second half production
declines to be less significant than those we experienced during the first half. However, at the midpoint of
our guidance, we still expect low double-digit market declines in the second half. As we manage through
the challenging global market environment, we continue to maintain a very active dialogue with both our
customers and our suppliers, while remaining focused on pursuing new business and technologies.

Next, I would like to highlight a significant new business program that we announced this morning on
Slide 7. I'm really excited to tell you that we're building a power-packed integrated drive module, or so-
called iDM, for Ford's new all-electric Mustang Mach-E. The iDM comes complete with the BorgWarner
thermal management systems and gearbox integrated with motor and power electronics from other
suppliers and showcases our system integration expertise. The iDM is being supplied to power the Mustang
Mach-E's rear wheel and all-wheel drive configurations. On the all-wheel drive GT version, BorgWarner
is supplying the secondary drive unit as well. We were able to capitalize on our experience with scalable
and modular approaches to iDMs to deliver this customized drive module that met Ford's stringent
requirements.

We're excited to partner with Ford to deliver high quality, clean and efficient propulsion solution to the
high-performance electrification market. This is another significant milestone for our electric business, and
there is still more to come, particularly as we expand our power electronics portfolio following the close of
the Delphi Technologies acquisition.

Let me provide an update of that particular pending acquisition on Slide 8. We achieved several milestones
towards closing during the past -- during the last few months. First, we completed a $1.1 billion senior
notes offering at favorable terms, and Kevin will discuss this in more detail later.

Second, Delphi Technologies' shareholders approved the transaction by an overwhelming majority. We
believe this underscores the value that is inherent in bringing our companies together.

Third, we've now received regulatory approval in 6 of the 7 jurisdictions required for us to close the
transaction. Importantly, there have been no conditions placed on the regulatory approvals we've received
so far. We expect to receive approval in the remaining jurisdiction in the coming months.

And finally, the integration teams continue to work very well together. There is a high level of commitment
and excitement among the teams as we drive towards day 1 readiness and capitalize on the value-creating
opportunities of the combination.

To sum up, I'm pleased with the overall progress as we drive towards the expected closing of the
transaction in the second half of 2020.

Next, on Slide 9, I'd like to highlight that we published our sustainability report last month. At BorgWarner,
we embrace sustainability to deliver value to all stakeholders, and there are 3 pillars to our sustainability
strategy: First, create a cleaner, more energy-efficient world. We do this, first and foremost, through the
products we offer. Products that drive cleaner mobility and efficiency in moving vehicles from point A to
point B. We're also very focused on how we manufacture these products in a cleaner and more energy-

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

efficient way. Our goals include reducing our energy intensity usage by 37% and our greenhouse gas
emissions intensity by 50% by the year 2030.

Second is to live the BorgWarner beliefs. We encourage our employees to live our beliefs, which serve
as a foundation for how we work together. I would like to highlight that we are focusing on developing a
talented and diverse workforce.

In late 2019, I signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, where BorgWarner is pledging to take
actions to cultivate a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected.
BorgWarner employees around the world are also involved and engaged in their communities and have
given about 63,000 hours of service helping others last year.

And finally, we partner with and report to our stakeholders. We want to promote responsibility and
sustainability within our supply base, while also providing transparency in our impact and reporting
accordingly.

In summary, BorgWarner strives to make the vehicles we drive more efficient and the world we live in
cleaner. We embrace diversity and inclusion, develop our employees, and give back to the communities
where we live and work.

Before I turn it over to Kevin, let me summarize our second quarter results and our outlook on Slide 10.
We achieved a significant second quarter outgrowth in all major regions, and we are excited to continue
to drive that outgrowth as the market shifts towards electrification. Wins like the iDM for the Ford Mach-E
continue our evolution into electrification.

We delivered positive free cash flow during this exceptional quarter. And as Kevin will discuss, we expect
the second half free cash flow to meet or exceed our year-to-date generation.

We are on track to close the Delphi Technologies acquisition in the second half of this year.

There have been tremendous challenges in 2020 with the COVID situation. As I look at what we've
accomplished at BorgWarner, despite this environment and what we're positioned to accomplish over the
balance of the year, I am confident that we remain strongly positioned to execute in the near and long
term from both a financial standpoint and a technology standpoint, driving our profitable growth. Now
over to you, Kevin.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Fred. And good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to highlight
the 2 important takeaways regarding our second quarter results.

First, our financial results were solid in the face of a very challenging production environment. During
the second quarter, we delivered strong revenue outgrowth in all regions. We were able to maintain
decremental margins below 30%. And most importantly, we generated positive free cash flow.

The second key message is that we continue to execute on the financing measures that position us to
successfully close on the Delphi Technologies acquisition.

Let's turn to Slide 11. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q2, you can see that the
stronger U.S. dollar reduced revenue by about 1.4% from a year ago. Excluding this impact, our organic
sales were down just under 43% compared to the 50% decline in weighted average market production.
That means we delivered revenue outgrowth of 730 basis points in the quarter. And importantly, that
outgrowth occurred in all of the major light vehicle markets around the globe.

In Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue was down 58% compared to the market decline of
approximately 63%. The outgrowth was driven by better-than-expected diesel-related revenue as well as
new programs. The good news in diesel has been a trend for us the last few quarters as we believe our
mix of diesel business has held up better than the overall market, but we don't expect that tailwind to
necessarily continue over the longer term.

6

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

In North America, we outperformed the market decline of 69% by over 7% driven by strong mix and new
programs. From a mix perspective, our slightly overweight position in SUVs and pickup trucks has boded
well for our ability to deliver outgrowth.

And in China, we outperformed the market by approximately 6% primarily due to stronger-than-expected
year-over-year growth in our DCT products as well as strength in our China commercial vehicle business,
which was about 150 basis point positive contributor to our outgrowth. Overall we're pleased that we
continue to deliver revenue outgrowth even in this challenging end market.

Now let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on Slide 12. Our Q2
adjusted operating loss was $9 million compared to $303 million of income in the second quarter of 2019.
Our adjusted operating margin was negative 0.6%, which was down compared to the positive 11.9% we
delivered in the second quarter a year ago. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income decreased
$310 million on almost $1.1 billion of lower sales, which translates to a decremental margin of 28%.
As you know, when markets move downward quickly, we tend to see decrementals that can be 30% or
higher, just like we saw at points in time last year. So we view the 28% decremental as a reasonably good
level of performance, given the suddenness of the dramatic decline in industry volume during the quarter
and the costs and inefficiencies related to the initial production restart.

Adjusted loss per share was $0.14 for the quarter. The decline in adjusted earnings per share compared
to the second quarter of 2019 was driven by the lower adjusted operating income and a slightly higher tax
rate.

Moving to cash flow. We are proud of the fact that we delivered $10 million of positive free cash flow
for the second quarter. In a quarter where global production gets cut in half, which is what we saw in
Q2, it is critical to maintain a very clear focus on cash flow. And in the second quarter, we did just that.
We achieved this through discipline in managing decremental margins, focus on driving working capital
performance, and effective management of capital expenditures.

Now let's discuss our full year revenue outlook on Slide 13. Our guidance is based on the end market
assumptions that Fred reviewed earlier, with global production being down 22% to 25%. We expect to
drive market outgrowth for the year, but not at the level we saw in the first half.

Our guidance now incorporates full year revenue outgrowth of approximately 450 to 600 basis points. This
assumes our outgrowth for the remainder of 2020 is in the range of 0 to 300 basis points, which at the
midpoint is relatively consistent with the outgrowth guidance we provided to start the year. This range of
outgrowth expectations is wider than typical, given the volatility in OEM weekly production schedules and
launch timing of new programs. We expect this volatility will continue through much of the second half.

As a result, we expect a full year 2020 organic revenue decline of 16% to 20%, which translates to an
expected 2020 revenue range of $8.0 billion to $8.4 billion.

Let's turn to Slide 14 where you can see an update on our cash flow guidance and other important
considerations. During the first half of 2020, we generated $156 million of free cash flow, which we view
as a tremendous achievement in such difficult markets. And as you can see on the slide, we expect the
trend of positive free cash flow generation to continue with $300 million to $400 million of free cash
flow for the full year. This implies approximately $150 million to $250 million of free cash flow in the
second half, despite the working capital investment needed to fund the production ramp-ups and the
sequential increase in capital spending in the second half. You should note that we do expect second half
free cash flow to be weighted more towards the fourth quarter as we expect a much larger working capital
investment in the third quarter with the sequential step-up in revenue.

Turning to margins. We continue to expect full year decremental margins to be in the 30% range for
the full year. Second half decremental margins will be impacted by expected volatility in weekly OEM
production schedules and some higher costs versus the first half, namely, the end of our temporary wage
reductions and higher R&D relative to Q2. As we mentioned last quarter, we intend to continue to sustain
the pace of our R&D investment during this downturn because we view it as important to deploy our
positive free cash to invest in our long-term growth.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

Also on decremental margins, I would point out that Q4 decrementals will likely be higher than the full
year decremental margin due to the really strong 13% operating margin comparable from Q4 2019.
Nonetheless, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow guidance for the year.

And that confidence is reflected in the Board's decision to maintain our current dividend again for this
quarter. As we went through the depths of this COVID-19 downturn, we continued to generate positive
free cash flow, which allowed us to sustain our dividend uninterrupted and unreduced.

Next on Slide 15, I'll summarize the financing actions that we've undertaken related to the upcoming
closing of the Delphi Technologies acquisition.

First, as many of you are aware, we successfully renewed and upsized our revolver in March. While
our revolver is $1.5 billion today, as part of our revolver renewal from a few months ago, the capacity
will automatically increase by an additional $500 million upon the closing of the Delphi Technologies
acquisition.

Next, during the second quarter, we completed a $1.1 billion senior notes offering. The proceeds from
this offering will be used to repay amounts outstanding under the Delphi Technologies' senior secured
credit facility, while also allowing us to repay our own $250 million in notes maturing in September.
Concurrent with this transaction, we entered into a cross-currency swap that synthetically converted the
notes to euro-denominated debt at an effective interest rate of 1.78%, which we view as an attractive rate
particularly in this environment.

And finally, over the next couple of months, we plan to initiate an obligor exchange offering on Delphi
Technologies' $800 million 5% notes. We intend to exchange substantially similar BorgWarner notes
for the Delphi Technologies notes, with the exchange becoming effective shortly after the closing of the
transaction. By executing this exchange offering, we would avoid the potentially significant cash cost of a
make-whole and refinancing transaction. Importantly, this exchange represents the last major financing
action that we need to complete ahead of the closing of the acquisition.

So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall we had a solid quarter in spite of the industry
pressures, delivering strong outgrowth and positive free cash flow. We expect the markets to remain
under pressure throughout 2020, but we've increased our revenue and cash flow guidance for the year.
And finally, we were able to execute an important financing transaction that positions us to close on the
Delphi Technologies acquisition in the second half of 2020. Just as I said last quarter, we are proactively
navigating through the current environment while ensuring the company is very well positioned for the
eventual industry recovery and our future profitable growth.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Kevin. Sharon, we're ready to open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.

Aileen Elizabeth Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

This is Aileen Smith on for John. First question, I appreciate that your outlook doesn't incorporate the
impact of additional production downtime from COVID. However, for internal planning purposes, how
closely are you monitoring your supply base and your production footprint? And are there any proactive
measures you're taking to mitigate potential hiccups to production that may pop up in the back half of the
year? And specifically, how are you planning for launches in this environment?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So the answer is absolutely yes. We are running the company, at all times, ready for a downturn. And
we've shown in Q2 that we managed that. So plants have downturn plans ready to be implemented.

The good thing is that we've just done it. So it will be a repeat. And like most of the repeats, it's easier
than the first time you do it. We are also as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are staying very
close to our customers and suppliers to figure out in detail, details of schedules and expectations and
potential issues.

So as far as launch is concerned, we don't -- we see a little bit of program delays. But so far, we're pretty
confident that we're going to be able to honor all the launches that we have up and running and ready to
launch in the second half.

Aileen Elizabeth Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. That's very helpful. And a second more strategic question, on the announcement of the iDM win
on the Ford Mach-E, as you think about further quoting for integrated drive modules, should we expect
a similar level of content coming through other suppliers that you're then integrating with your own
components? Or is there a substantial opportunity to get some of the electric motor and power electronics
content over time, particularly considering what you acquired with Remy and what you will be acquiring
with Delphi?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would say first that we are super excited to partner with Ford on this great product. And as I
mentioned in the past, we don't have to sell a system. We are flexible. We have modular design. And you
may be right, we've extended our product portfolio in the past few years to be ready to have more internal
content. But we're very flexible around adapting our content intensity with what the customer wants.

Aileen Elizabeth Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And one last question if I may, more housekeeping on the outlook for free cash flow. That's
improved to $300 million to $400 million. Is that just consistent with higher revenue outlook? Or does it
also reflect more progress than expected on some of your cost savings or cash conservation initiatives?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

It's really in line with our revenue outlook. And I think you can see that with the low end of our revenue
outlook now matching the high end of what we had before. And that cash flow, not coincidentally, is $300
million at that revenue range. So as we look at the $400 million upside at the top end of our range right
now, that coincides with the $8.4 billion of revenue.;

Operator

Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

A couple of questions. One is, nice backlog this quarter. Just wanting you to clarify, are you including mix
in that backlog line? Because it looks like your -- obviously your production mix was pretty helpful in the
quarter or is the backlog really backlog?

And what I'm getting at is you said backlog is 100% hybrid and EV, and we're seeing really impressive
strength in those categories around the world. So is that something that we can extrapolate from as we
think about how solid the backlog that you've previously disclosed is?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean backlog includes anything that's not market or FX effectively. So it can pick up mix impacts.
And absolutely we're seeing some positive mix impacts in the quarter. So that is a piece of the equation.
It's basically anything that's driving us to outgrow the market.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

So any color on what's happening with regard to the hybrid and EV? And is that a significant contributor
already now or not yet?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

I mean I think from a mix perspective, a lot of the mix benefit that we were seeing in the second quarter
in particular has to do with our exposure to pickups and SUVs in North America, as well as our diesel-
related content in Europe seems to be holding up better than the overall diesel market as we've seen for
the last few quarters now. We have seen some DCT growth over in China as well, which is supporting that
backlog. But as we think about the H&E content in our backlog, most of that's coming in the years to come
in terms of where we expect to really see that driving our outgrowth and becoming more than 100% of
the net backlog. That's really a comment on 21 to '23 time frame.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Got you. And then secondly, can you just update us on the status of the $110 million cost reduction
plan that you've talked about? This is specific to the BorgWarner business, not the synergies or the Delphi
side. And is that -- 30% decremental that we're seeing right now, is that including some benefit there?
How should we be thinking about incrementals into next year with the savings and nonrecurrence of
temporary actions you've taken so far this year? Any color on that?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean decrementals absolutely include the benefit associated with the restructuring actions. And
we've started to see the benefits of both obviously last year's restructuring actions that are taking hold
and helping us on a year-over-year basis, as well as we're starting to get some benefit associated with the
restructuring that we announced back in early February time frame. So that is mitigating the decrementals

10

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

and should continue to be a tailwind as we look out to the next few years to help offset any other bad
news that could come into the equation, like COVID-19 did this year.

And so overall though, I would say to the question, that is on track. We're continuing to execute according
to the plan that we laid out several months back, and we're on track for that.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just to help us out, if we wanted to just sort of disaggregate that 30% decremental, what is the
incremental savings that you're seeing this year? And what is the incremental number that you are
targeting for next year?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think we disclosed back in February time frame that we expected the 2020 numbers to benefit
by about $50 million of incremental savings. And I would say we're on track to deliver that in our
decremental number. So that is a tailwind in the decrementals in addition to any of the temporary types of
cost actions that we executed in the second quarter, like temporary layoffs and wage reductions and those
types of things, were temporary in nature, but did help us in the second quarter as well.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

And then next year, you've got another $50 million, was it? Or do I remember that wrong?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

I think it was in the 35-ish ZIP code as I recall, but we'll give more specific guidance on that when we get
to the beginning of next year. But I think you should think overall that plan directionally remains intact and
on track.

Operator

Next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Maybe this is definitional, but your backlog today has been very strong. [indiscernible] in your guidance
[indiscernible] inclusive of the backlog. But the midpoint of your range for the year is basically equal to
what you did in the backlog for the first half. So can you just explain the bridge between the 2 metrics? Or
are you saying there's no backlog in the back half?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think -- backlog and outgrowth are 2 slightly different things. Backlog is basically our growth before
you consider pricing. Outgrowth actually is backlog net of pricing. And so if you look at what our backlog
actually is to date through the first 6 months, I think it's around $525 million or so. Our backlog for the
full year effectively, if you take the outgrowth and you add pricing back to it, we're somewhere in the $580
million to $730 million range. So there's -- that's kind of how we get to the walk of outgrowth to backlog.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then just on the Mach-E and the iDM, one, maybe you could let us know when Ford sort of
brought you into the process. And I know you mentioned some other suppliers. Are you at liberty to
mention if one of those other suppliers on like the power electronics is Delphi? And then finally on that,

you talked about how your integration expertise really helped with this business. But if you have all the
elements, what you [indiscernible] Fred [indiscernible].

Executive VP & CFO

I think we got the gist of the question though.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So yes. So Joe, we lost you at the end. But Ford and Borg have been working together for a few years on
this and right from the get-go. So it's a few years back.

Two, no, Delphi is not the power electronic supplier.

And three, yes, with the portfolio that we've added over the past years, we certainly are in a position to do
the whole thing. But again as I mentioned before, we don't have to. And we work very, very constructively
with the OEs. And depending on what they want to do and what they want to work with, then we are
absolutely flexible.

Next question comes from Brian Johnson, Barclays.

Jason Flynn Stuhldreher
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. Kevin, you've already given some good color around 2021. I was
just going to try to ask again because I think 2020 is fairly straightforward. But as we think out to 2021,
I was wondering if you could maybe just comment on how the cost base in 2021, the fixed cost base,
compares to that of 2020. And I guess the moving pieces I would wonder about are the incremental
restructuring savings that we're supposed to get in 2021, have any of those been brought forward into
2020? Any step-up in engineering that we need to think about? And then any COVID-related inefficiencies
in 2020 that may bleed into 2021? Sort of all those things wrapped together, should we still see the fixed
cost base lower next year versus this year?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think it's premature for us to start talking about 2021, but I can comment on a few of those
elements. I mean from a restructuring perspective, as I mentioned in response to Rod's question earlier,
we are on track for executing against the plan that we laid out a few months ago. And I wouldn't say
there's any accelerations or delays in that plan. I think it's right on track. So I think it's fair to think about
the incrementals that we were showing back in February going from 2020 to 2021 to remain intact.

From an engineering and R&D perspective, I think you should continue to expect us to invest in that low
4% to 4.5% range as a percent of revenue. Now this year, it will be elevated because we're sustaining our
dollar investments in R&D around that $400 million level. And that's a conscious decision we made as a
leadership team in this environment to sustain our investment supporting long-term growth prospects for
the company because we have strong liquidity and strong cash flow generation.

And then in terms of the inefficiencies arising from COVID-19, I think we're going through that process
right now as we're building our long-range plans to understand what, if any, types of inefficiencies do we
expect to carry into next year.

The last thing obviously, and we're not prepared to comment on it further, as we start to think about 2021,
obviously we expect to close on the Delphi transaction in the second half of this year. And that's going to
obviously have some meaningful implications on what 2021 looks like as a consolidated company. So those
are some of the things to consider.

Jason Flynn Stuhldreher
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood. Okay. Very helpful. And maybe just on your last point, just a quick clarification on the Delphi
deal. Can you remind us of what the last jurisdiction requiring approval is? And I think you mentioned it
would happen in the next month. Is the approval of that jurisdiction really the last bottleneck in this deal?
I know there's the exchange you need to do with the Delphi bonds. But if you could just maybe remind us
of what the bottlenecks are between now and when the deal closes.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

The last jurisdiction that we have at this point is the European Union. And we've been going through
interacting with the regulators and going through that administrative process. And we think where we are
in that process keeps us on track for a closing in the second half of the year, consistent with what we've
been saying for the last number of months. So that is really the last major, I'd say, administrative hurdle
between now and closing.

The other big one that we had were obviously the 6 -- other 6 jurisdictions, which are now behind us, as
well as the Delphi shareholder vote, which took place back in late June and received overwhelming support
from the shareholders. So I'd say that's really the last major step.

And then as we get to closing, then Delphi will have to test the conditions to closing to make sure that
they meet those, and we fully expect that they'll be on track to do that. But we'll obviously assess that at
the time we get to closing.

Next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I think we've covered the margins. Maybe 2 questions on a little bit of the cadence of outgrowth. And
this is more qualitative, I know we're not commenting on '21 or '22. But I think as we see these big
EV win announcements, and as a lot of people are seeing the amount of new EV introductions is only
going to accelerate as we get into sort of the 2022 time frame, I know you've talked about this sort of
balanced approach where you have a rough 5% outgrowth. But maybe you can just add a little qualitative
commentary too, can we see that outgrowth get better in '21 into 2022? Because we have just opposing
forces. '21 is going to be the height of all things. Legacy powertrain should be a great outgrowth for you.
But then if you're making these new announcements on products that are coming in 2022, that leads us
to think that there's also growth. So maybe just a little bit of qualitative about how we think about when
these EV products could start to really be accretive to the overall outgrowth number?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Chris. So electrification accelerates our outgrowth. And being E or H, what you see is that everything
that is being booked at this point in time is going to see delay past 2022. And business for 2022 is pretty
much already awarded.

And this is in our goal of outgrowing the market year-by-year by 500 basis points, and we are on track to
do that. The current guide for the full year 2020 is 450 to 600 basis points.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

So that's what I would tell you also. I would also tell you that we see -- we don't see a slowdown of
request for quotes or system support and discussion at a very high level between OEMs and BorgWarner
to discuss the next-generation iDMs, but also the next-generation most advanced hybrid architectures.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's great. And then maybe just a question around the more near term. This idea of diesel within -- in
the mix, I think at one point probably about 2 years ago, we thought sort of the "diesel drag" would be
sort of done late '19 into 2020. And the diesel numbers are less bad than we feared. At what point will we
sort of stop talking about diesel where it probably doesn't have a mix and sort of Europe is balanced from
gasoline turbos versus diesel turbo? Like when are we essentially fully balanced on the European diesel
front?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So I think you're right. You see the quarter-over-quarter reduction reducing. So it's plateauing around
29%, 30% take rate. We are starting -- we've outgrew that diesel market for a few quarters. And I think
we're going to start letting the European diesel benefits that have started in the second half of '19. And I
would say that in 2021, the diesel headwinds will start fading away. You won't see any impact at all as far
as we're concerned.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's great. So if we see 30% go to 20% from 2020 to 2025, you think by that point, you'd be balanced?
So we won't be really talking about a drag, even though the number of diesel will be going down.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I would say so.

Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I guess just first on the subject of the vertical integration of some of these electric solutions, given that
there's been some focus on that with the Ford announcement this morning. I think a couple of weeks ago,
you announced 3 awards in China to supply the EDM, 3 new electric models. I presume those, well with
the exception of power electronics, those are vertically integrated for you? You're supplying a complete
solution there?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. Is it generally the trend? Or do you see like a regional variation in trends where you were tending to
have more vertical integration in one geography versus another? And if so, can you provide color on that?

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

No, there is no geographic trends. It's certainly not a one size fits all. You see customers that want us
to integrate the full system. And we do that and we capitalize on our integration and system knowledge
and experience. Some customers would want us to supply transmission and motor. So we're flexible. It is
true that more will come as we are adding more products in our portfolio and be able to do it all, and by
doing that, drive the maximum efficiency out of that device. But again, there is not one size fits all. And
certainly, as far as we're concerned, more to come on this field.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And last question, I think we've seen an uptick in interest and frankly in public capital market
assets for alternative powertrains on the commercial vehicle side in the last quarter, both EV and fuel
cell. Can you talk a little bit about the positioning and the interest level you're seeing from customers on
the commercial vehicle side, and where that interest might be coming from medium duty, electric bus,
regional delivery? Just how are you positioned? And how is the interest?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, all of the above. No, we see a decent acceleration in electrifying different vehicles including long-
haul trucks with different types of technologies. Obviously, light vehicle will be the biggest volume for us,
but we're very committed in supporting commercial vehicle electrification too with all the product portfolio
that we have. There is no -- very little product in the propulsion area from an electrification standpoint
that we can't supply. So we're supporting all our customers and commercial vehicle included. And yes, we
see an acceleration in this field.

Next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Firstly, are you able to quantify the non-repeat in the back half, or I don't know, maybe even catch-up
from any austerity measures taken in 2Q? I'm trying to gauge the degree to which the implied back half
decremental guide may be driven in part by conservatism versus something maybe more specific you're
seeing from a cost perspective, such as you mentioned R&D, just given the outlook for 30% decrementals
for the full year versus 26% in 1Q and 28% in 2Q as hopefully the industry backdrop in the back half
should be improved quite a bit from the first.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think -- I mean I'm not going to mention the specifics of each component of the -- of how we
mitigated the decremental margin. We're able to manage it down to 28%. But obviously, you can imagine
our contribution margin as well, north of 28%. And so the types of things that we had to execute to
manage to that level include the restructuring actions, which are providing a tailwind and are more
sustainable and permanent from a cost reduction perspective. But then we do have benefits coming from
some of those temporary actions like the temporary layoffs and the wage reduction. So those will creep
into the second half.

We'll also see some level of higher R&D spend in the second half of the year. As I look sequentially from
Q2, we were a little bit lighter in the second quarter than where our full year run rate average is expected
to be.

And then the other thing just to keep in mind, Q4 decrementals are going to be impacted mathematically
by the fact that we're jumping off at 13% plus operating margin from a year ago. And that just makes the
comp pretty challenging as you look at Q4.

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe lastly, a question on the integrated drive module win. Ford is into --
they have a lot more electric vehicles coming down the pipe with their Team Edison initiative. I'm curious if
you're working on the Mach-E puts you in a strong position to win additional awards with that automaker?
Or if you can't comment specifically, maybe just any kind of an update you can provide on what your
discussions with automakers have been like with regard to iDMs, maybe what those discussions have been
like since coronavirus. I think announced awards generally across this sector have slowed a little bit as
automakers sort of focused on the crisis. But I'm curious if behind the scenes, you see discussions with
regard to electric vehicles accelerating.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

The development and the design work for proportional architectures in electric vehicles and hybrids are
being done and on time. It's pursuing as planned. We're confident that awards are going to carry on. And
again, more to come on this field.

We are very uniquely positioned, especially with the Delphi Technologies acquisition to have again both
mechanical, motor and power electronics under one roof and being able to work on all the types of
efficiencies that those subsystems interact with. And so we think that we're well positioned to supply
whatever customers want us to work on either the full system or subsystems. So it's moving at the right
pace, and I'm happy with what I'm seeing.

Next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley.

Armintas Sinkevicius
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

With regards to the Delphi integration, I'm curious what you've seen since you announced the transaction
that may be progressing better or worse than you expected? I think the first quarter results were quite
strong for Delphi. They had similar benefits from diesel with regards to their growth over market. The
decrementals were a bit better. So maybe -- and it seems like there's some momentum there around GDI,
power electronics that wasn't really the case the last couple of years. So maybe you can comment on what
your integration teams are working on and what you've learned from the company over the last several
months?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

What I would say is that we're very pleased on how the integrated -- integration teams and the match
players on both sides are working and collaborating in a virtual environment. This is -- we have not missed
a beat. I'm very, very happy with the way those teams interact and create value.

We're not in a position to update the financials. We'll do that closer to the closing date. But it's moving at
the right pace, and I really like the engagement and the results that I'm seeing.

Armintas Sinkevicius
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe on the cost side, your restructuring; actions are helping you get to those 30%
decremental margins for the back half of the year. I think their cost action it seems like were also
necessary to drive their incremental decremental margins at the rate that you'd be comfortable with in
order to get to those 11% margins. Maybe you could talk to where there will be opportunities for upside
from the restructuring program outside of the normal course of incremental decremental margins for
either company?

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean with respect to the restructuring, we're pleased with the fact that our program remains
on track. I mean both the program we announced a year ago, about 15, 16 months ago as well as the
program we announced earlier this year, which was a pretty aggressive program to manage and sustain
our margin profile to offset headwinds including things like COVID-19, which we didn't know about at the
time. So it was a proactive measure to sustain our margin profile, and we're going to execute against that
plan to help mitigate the impact of things like COVID, or whatever else might get thrown at us.

From a Delphi perspective, I'm not going to comment in detail on their business, other than overall we're
pleased with the progress they've made on their restructuring programs and feel like they're on track
to delivering what they've committed directionally. I think you'll see -- I think they'll file their financials
today or tomorrow. And so you'll get to see what their results are looking like here for the second quarter.
But directionally we're pleased with what we see, and we'll give a more fulsome update on the financial
outlook of the combined companies when we get to closing.

Next question comes from Dan Levy with Crédit Suisse.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

2 questions on backlog. First, when I look at the $2.1 billion 2-year backlog you gave back in February,
obviously there's a production assumption underlying that. So we do have a lower environment today, so
could you give us a sense of how we might be thinking about how much we need to haircut that backlog?
Or is it potentially intact, given we have a more favorable environment on hybrids or EV? How to think of
the haircut on backlog?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'm not sure the haircut you've been referring to, but I mean directionally we're pleased with how
our backlog's shaping up this year. As we entered 2020, we actually expected that we were going to have
lower revenue outgrowth than what we're actually seeing is, and that's really across the globe. So our
backlog in total if you look at it, we're guiding to $580 million to $730 million of backlog coming through
our P&L in 2020.

In terms of what our -- the 2021 through 2023 and beyond horizon looks like, I'm not provided -- not
prepared to provide any updates to that other than directionally. I think we still feel very confident
about the fact that we're going to deliver 500 basis points of outgrowth from a BorgWarner stand-alone
perspective in terms of what our overall outgrowth is expected to be over those years. Some years might
be higher or lower than others, but on average we should be in that 500 basis point ZIP code. And the
good news is that's actually playing out this year in 2020 as well, which we didn't anticipate as we started
the year.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up also on backlog, so we know that the majority is China. We
heard some good news in the quarter. I think hybrid is getting better credit in the NEV system in China. So
what could you tell us on hybrid demand in China? Is this potentially upside to your backlog? And to the
extent we do have an uptick in hybrids in China, what would be the timing of this incremental demand?
Do you think this is over the next year or 2? Or is this really outside of your 3-year planning period and
accruing more so beyond 2022?

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

So no, you're absolutely right that -- and I think we've always been talking about the fact that
electrification. And in China, it's not only battery electric vehicle, but it's also including the most advanced
hybrid propulsion architectures. We see launches. We see requests for quotation. We see partnership with
Chinese OEMs on hybrids. And we're part of that. Will it have an impact before the end of the current
backlog season? Probably not because this will be launched past the backlog season for the majority of
the businesses. But will you see more hybrid powertrains in China, especially the most advanced hybrids?
Absolutely, yes.

Operator

We have time for one final question. That question comes from [indiscernible].

Unknown Analyst

Just regarding China, I had a -- I just wanted to check with you the situation in the overall business
situation in China. As we know that during the first half, the sales of EVs kind of fell much faster than the
overall market. So are you seeing any cancellations of EV programs? Or how is the business developing?
And do you see the trend improving in the latter half? Or is this going to continue?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So the trend of electrification, we think is profound. It's not going to be quarter-over-quarter steadily
increase. You will see some ups and downs. So we'll see some downs in the first half in China, but the
long-term trend as far as we're concerned, we think is unchanged. It's just timing related. We see some
program delays, but we see a lot of focus in getting this done and bringing those hybrid and electric
powertrains into the marketplace.

And it's true in other parts of the world too. It is essential, when you look at the newly published
regulations, it is essential for all of us to move into cleaner and more energy-efficient powertrains being
electric or hybrid or also efficient combustion powertrain. So efficient combustion powertrain, yes, is what
I meant. So it's accelerating and we're not missing a beat.
