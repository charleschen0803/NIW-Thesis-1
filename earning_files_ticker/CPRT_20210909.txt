COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc., Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Just a
reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to
Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks. Good morning. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include
adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, acquisition-related integration
charges, foreign currency-related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to
accounting for stock option exercises.

We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures in our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these
non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our
results and assessing our business trends and performance.

In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal
securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and
uncertainties in our markets, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties.

For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in
our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, and each of our subsequent quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation
to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

So now that we've got the safe harbor language out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Liaw,
President.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for a review of our fourth quarter
and fiscal 2021. We're pleased with the results for the year, another record-setting quarter on multiple
dimensions. We look forward to discussing some of the underlying factors in the business with you as well.

The big news, of course, since we last spoke with you in May, has been the emergence of the Delta variant
of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we've seen ongoing recovery across the industry, including key measures such
as vehicle miles traveled published by the Department of Transportation, gasoline consumption and the
like. So we're beginning to see the return to normal driving activity, accident volumes, et cetera, though
we note it's still likely down on an apples-to-apples basis versus 2 years ago.

Given the growth in our business, nonetheless, our inventory levels, we'll talk about in a bit, are up
meaningfully year-over-year and up double digits versus July 2019 as well. And due to several drivers,
we'll discuss later on the call as well, our average selling prices, the values we generate for our customers
remain elevated and are in fact at all-time highs.

Before we dig in, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the Copart team, which has had an active
and productive few weeks, certainly. As many have projected over the years, we're seeing more severe
weather events with each passing year and just recently have observed flooding and other severe weather
in Germany, in Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and now, of course, Hurricane Ida in the
Northeastern United States.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

We're wishing all of those affected in those communities, including our employees, our own team
members the very best in a speedy recovery. Hundreds of us, myself included, who were in the Northeast
over the weekend and we have still more Copart team members headed there leading the charge from
here forward.

We'll discuss the financial implications of these events -- of these recent weather events in future quarters,
but the first order of business, as always, is to serve our customers and to take care of our own people.
I wanted to start with a couple of statistics that we provide every quarter and close with a handful of
remarks about the future as well.

Our global unit sales for the quarter increased 25% year-over-year with a U.S. increase of 26% and an
international increase of 18.5% year-over-year. We continued to see more aggressive COVID-19 measures
in many of our international markets than we had here in the U.S., which has caused more of a volume
reduction or less volume growth in those markets.

Within the U.S., our insurance business grew significantly year-over-year versus the fourth quarter of
2020. That is the net effect of lower driving activity -- well, increased driving activity year-over-year, still
slightly lower driving activity on a 2-year basis, but increasing claims frequency and increasing total loss
frequency as well.

Our noninsurance business, which we talk about each quarter, includes dealer consignments, wholesales
and charities business, our Copart Direct business in which we buy cars from consumers and institutional
volume as well. We've historically provided the unit growth, in particular, excluding wholesalers and
charities. And on that basis, our U.S. noninsurance business grew 17% year-over-year, including solid
growth for our dealer consignment business despite inventory shortages, of course, throughout the
automotive industry.

Our strong used car prices or used vehicle prices are driving strong returns and therefore, consignment
growth across these noninsurance categories. Our global inventory at the end of July increased 21.7%
compared to a year ago and double-digit growth on a 2-year basis as well. That's comprised of a year-
over-year increase of 28% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 13% for international inventory attributable
to the COVID-19 measures I described a few moments ago.

We are especially proud of the record average selling prices that we're delivering for our customers.
The ASP strength is a reflection in part, of course, of market dynamics for used vehicles, but it's also a
byproduct of our member recruitment and retention efforts. ASPs worldwide grew 20.7% for the quarter
with USPs -- U.S. ASPs up 20.6%.

The question we often get is how much of that is attributable to mixed shift and it's not. So our insurance
ASPs are up, comparable levels are even up more still than that. While growth in used car prices have, of
course, contributed to our ASP growth, our selling prices throughout the pandemic and prior to it as well
have generally grown at a rate in excess of that of used car prices as well. That being a reflection of the
marketing and member recruitment efforts I mentioned a moment ago.

The Manheim Index, which is one of those third-party indices we do track, is at 194.5 for the month of
August, an increase of 18.8% year-over-year. We track other indices as well, which would provide similar
directional guidance.

Our average selling prices are certainly the ultimate output metric for auction liquidity, but the underlying
figures that support that notion, the notion of the flywheel effects, certainly continue as well. In the fourth
quarter, we noted more bids per unit, more domestic bids per unit, more international bids per unit, all
compared to a year ago. Our auction liquidity is stronger than it has ever been.

The natural questions, of course, will continue to be about what happens after the pandemic goes away.
I think we certainly hold an appropriate level of humility given the once-in-a-lifetime nature of the event
and our comments will largely be U.S.-centric. But I think it's worth revisiting some of these longer term
assumptions we've talked about on prior calls and how they've been affected by the pandemic.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

Driving activity certainly is rebounding by the measures we have seen, gasoline consumption and vehicle
miles traveled, but not yet back to 2019 levels. We continue to believe that longer term, mobility will
continue to grow at miles per person in the U.S., but certainly in our emerging markets, in many of the
countries they're buying our highest value vehicles, will grow significantly.

The -- we saw accidents and claims frequency decline somewhat during the pandemic, but it actually
increased relative to miles driven. That is a new learning for us in the pandemic to see. I think the
historical -- conventional wisdom has always been that if there are fewer vehicle miles traveled, that
accident frequency per miles traveled will decrease. But in effect or in actual practice, we've seen arguably
more distracted driving, certainly higher speed driving and therefore, accident frequency can, in some
respects, be inversely related to vehicle miles traveled -- accident frequency per miles driven.

On total loss frequency, the most important driver of our business long term that we've talked about
at length in the past, we've seen that increase during the pandemic as well. And I wanted to offer 1
addendum to that in a moment. On the durability of ASPs, we note the longer term trends in favor of
ASPs. We continue to see increasing demand from emerging economies for the wrecked vehicles from the
U.S., U.K., Canada, other mature economies. These emerging economies are especially eager to purchase
our vehicles, which -- our wrecked and totaled vehicles become their drivable fleet. That trend has been a
30-, 40-year trend that we think will be so for the foreseeable future.

I wanted to know 1 important consideration that I think can be easily overlooked. The natural questions
are about when the selling prices could face weakness in light of an eventual recovery in semiconductors
and new cars and the like. What I think is sometimes misunderstood is that all else equal, high ACVs or
high pre-accident values actually reduce total loss frequency. The higher -- the more a car is worth before
the accident, all else equal, the more prone it is to be repaired. And so eventually, certainly, if there is a
decline in ASPs or a decline in vehicle values, the offsetting consideration is that we would see higher total
loss frequency and therefore, higher consignment volume.

We continue to make our operating and strategic decisions predicated on the expectation of long-term
growth post pandemic, consistent certainly with what we've communicated over the years. We're grateful
for the strong financial performance this quarter against the backdrop of a pandemic and now severe
weather events all over the world. It can feel awkward to sound with a congratulatory tone on the call.

But nonetheless, we're certainly pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, excited about the year
ahead. Our business is stronger than it has ever been. The quality of our team, the sophistication of our
technology stack and the depth of our auction liquidity, we think, is yielding better results than ever for
our customers.

With that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John North.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Jeff. I'll make a few comments on more of our operational results, and then we can open up some
questions. For the fourth quarter, global revenue increased $223 million, or 42%, including a $12 million
benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $162.4 million, or 36%, primarily due to higher
average selling prices. U.S. service revenue grew 36% and international experienced an increase of 29%.

Purchased vehicle sales increased $60.6 million, or 89%, due to higher ASPs and increased volumes.
U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 99% over the prior year, and international grew 73%. As a result,
purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $1.6 million
overall.

Global gross profit in the fourth quarter increased by $107.1 million or 43%, and our gross margin
percentage increased by approximately 11 basis points to 48%. U.S. margins improved from 50% to 51%,
driven primarily by higher ASPs, and international margins decreased from 34% to 30% due to a higher
purchased vehicle mix at lower margins, partially offset by higher ASPs and cost leverage.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

I'll now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and depreciation
expense. G&A spend increased $5 million from $34.6 million a year ago to $39.7 million in 2021, but
decreased from 6.6% of revenue to 5.3% of revenue this year, an improvement of 130 basis points. We
anticipate G&A to continue to improve as a percentage of revenue in future years.

As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 47% from $205.7 million to $301.5 million. We
delivered 114 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs and
leveraging volume.

Net interest expense increased $0.2 million, or 5%, year-over-year, primarily due to our upsized revolving
credit facility, which we upsized in July of last year. Q4 income tax expense was $43.1 million at a 14.4%
effective tax rate, reflecting an $11 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, which
have been adjusted for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings included in our release. On a non-GAAP basis,
our effective tax rate would have been 17.6% and our full year rate would have been a normalized 20.8%.

Fourth quarter GAAP net income increased 55% from $165.5 million last year to $256 million this year.
Adjusted to remove the effects of currency, acquisition-related costs and the tax benefit on the exercise of
stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 51% from $163.4 million last year to $247.3 million in the
fourth quarter of this year.

For the fiscal year '21, on a full year basis, global revenue increased $486.9 million, or 22%, including a
$31.6 million benefit due to currency. Global gross profit increased $335.3 million, or 33%, and our gross
margin percentage increased by 419 basis points to 50%. Operating income increased 39% to $320.3
million and operating margin improved by 521 basis points.

Finally, GAAP net income increased 33% -- 34%, excuse me, from $699.9 million last year to $936.5
million this year. And non-GAAP net income increased 45.7% from $610.5 million last year to $889.7
million this year.

Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights as of July 31, 2021. We had $2.1 billion of
liquidity comprised of over $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility
with a capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $570.5 million over July 31 of last year. Operating
cash flow for the quarter decreased by $38.2 million year-over-year to $228.7 million, primarily driven by
working capital investments as we increased inventory levels, which Jeff spoke about a few moments ago.

We invested $98.6 million in capital expenditures for the quarter and approximately 76% of this amount
was attributable to capacity expansion. For the year, we invested $463 million in CapEx of which
approximately 85% was associated with capacity expansion. We continue to prioritize investing in physical
infrastructure above other choices and believe this continued investment is creating a durable advantage
in our ability to handle increasing numbers of total loss vehicles and adjacent opportunities in the whole
car marketplace.
We continue our relentless focus on investing for the future in both capacity and technology while
maintaining a conservative capital structure that allows operational flexibility regardless of economic
changes or transitory market dynamics. And that will conclude our prepared remarks this morning, and
we're happy to open it up for some questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

Congratulations on fantastic results. Yes. So I wanted to start, obviously, really, really strong sales growth.
And you talked about inventory a little bit, too. But kind of looking sequentially from last quarter to this
quarter on the service revenue basis, service revenues were roughly flat but yard expenses were up
sequentially quite a bit. Is that all inventory build? And is that kind of -- is inventory seasonally building at
this point or are there other factors behind it? And if it's not inventory, what are the other drivers between
the cyclical yard cost increase on flat revenues?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. Fair question, Bob. And that is certainly a healthy portion of the explanation is that the activity that
comes from inventory growth. That's -- this is -- the fourth quarter is not historically an inventory build
quarter for us. We tend to build in the second quarter, in particular, ending in January through the winter
to some extent, the third. The fourth quarter is usually a quarter in which we are liberating inventory and
preparing for the seasons ahead. This year, in part because of the pandemic effect and in part because of
growth in the business for the reasons we talked about a little while ago, yes, that is a meaningful portion
of the driver of yard cost.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

Got it. Okay. Great. And I know you touched on this, Jeff, but just maybe if you could kind of wrap it up in
terms of the insurance growth is recovering. How do you put us versus -- now versus the pre-'20 -- pre-
pandemic levels in terms of insurance activities? And how long do you think it takes to get back to kind of
a normalized rate of driving accidents, et cetera, looking ahead?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes, that's the right question and almost an impossible one. My answer might have been different even
in June when the vaccines are rolling out, and I thought that we were on our way to being done with it
all. And then the Delta variant emerged and we've seen, of course, case counts rise again in many of --
certainly across the U.S. and in many of our other markets as well. So I think that the forecast is, I don't
know that we would have a more insightful perspective about the unwinding of COVID-19 that others
might.

On driving activity, we look to the same metrics you might, which is the DOT data, the gas consumption
data. We have certainly information from our insurance company clients as well, which would suggest
huge growth versus the fourth quarter of last year but not yet back to fourth quarter 2019 levels. When
that bounces back, I don't -- the candid answer is we don't know. I would guess multiple quarters though.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

Got it. Okay. Great. And then last one for me. Obviously, Copart dealer cars have been a big growth driver,
and you've been talking about it as such for quite some time. How does the type car like the ASP for your
dealer cars compared now to maybe 2 or 3 years ago? Obviously, adjusting for the Manheim Used Car
Index.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

I guess, in other words, are you still selling the same mix of cars you were before, presumably aged
inventory, older cars, et cetera? Or have you expanded the mix? And what is the typical Copart dealer car
look like now?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes, I think the "typical car," as you're describing, looks somewhat similar, though higher ASP and off
the cuff likely even adjusted for the Manheim Index. And that the natural liquidity pool for us, as you
know, from the insurance side of things becomes a better and less damaged and more valuable car over
the years. That's been true forever, as you know. That, therefore, has cultivated a different buyer base,
different member base who's looking for a drivable car and that, in turn, that liquidity has benefited us on
the dealer side.

That trend certainly continues. And I think if you visited some of our yards, you'd be astonished by some
of the high-value Range Rovers and European vehicles that you would see on the lots that, at least on
their surface, look perfectly good and perfectly functional, in many cases are. So it is a gradual shift over
time. This is not an overnight shift, but the liquidity certainly has nudged us upmarket, so to speak, in our
Copart dealer business as well.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Truist.

Stephanie Lynn Moore
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to touch a little bit on the impact of the catastrophic events that have really swept the globe over
the last couple of months. First, some of the pretty deadly flooding we saw across Europe, particularly in
Germany, and any impact that had on the quarter or expectations for the coming quarter in that particular
as well as what we should expect in the U.S.

And maybe you can remind us, I know there's been a lot of efforts to expand your catastrophic capabilities
to make it so it's somewhat more profitable or profitable given the situation. So any update you can
provide generally would be helpful.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Sure. Thanks, Stephanie. The significant catastrophic activity had largely occurred after the quarter. So
in the United States, in particular, we did experience some flooding in the U.S. and in Germany prior.
Compared to catastrophic events of -- in the past, these events were relatively modest in absolute size.

In terms of catastrophic readiness, I think you posed the question, Stephanie, we have invested massively
in this anticipating more severe weather over the years to come. In a catastrophe, the key questions are,
do we have the technology to support the suddenly accelerated volumes of activity? The answer is yes,
and we are continuing to invest behind it. Do we have the land to store the vehicles until we can process
the titles and sell them on behalf of our insurance company clients? The answer to that is yes. We have
bought and built catastrophic yards that, in many cases, run idle, simply awaiting a catastrophic event to
service our customers again.

We certainly, depending on where the cat event might be, also then lease land on a temporary basis as
well to expand our capacity. And then towing and trucking is certainly an important variable as well. We
pick up, of course, millions of cars a year on behalf of our customers and have, again, a more acute need
in the middle of a catastrophe. We have, therefore, invested in a fairly sizable fleet of our own, which we
expect to continue to invest in as well to support those efforts. So these are folks day-to-day who are
deployed in their home yards, but in a crisis are asked to join us on the ground where the need is most
acute.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

So those are all ways for us to address the -- to be more ready in anticipation of the weather events
rather than scrambling last minute. Those have been investments that we've made very consistently and
continue to grow year after year.

Stephanie Lynn Moore
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. No, that's really helpful. And switching back to Germany. Is there -- is this a situation where
thinking a little bit more longer term or maybe the impact of the kind of the flooding and where you guys
were able to come in and really show your value from a consignment model standpoint.

Is that an opportunity where it might accelerate the shift on what you're providing in Germany with
insurance carriers and maybe potentially get them to shift over to more of what the model looks in the
U.S. or any update there?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes, I think that's an insightful question or insightful premise. And I think it is true that in Germany and
elsewhere, the catastrophic events very much underscore the Copart value proposition that our service,
our hustle in a moment of crisis is still more visible at moments like that to insurance carriers, whether
they are long-time customers who have been with us for 30 years or German insurance customers we are
quoting for the first time or converting more of their volume to the consignment model under Copart's
business model. That I think is certainly true. So all else equal, this for sure, it better communicates our
value proposition to the German market.

Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Copart likes to innovate without much fanfare, I think. But I'm curious if you would call out any key
platform enhancements you might have made in the last 6 to 12 months that could be driving value for
your buyers or sellers.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Craig, I think the introductory clause there, I think, is accurate. We tend not to declare much victory,
in particular, on investor calls where we launched these products to our sellers, our customers and our
members as well. So I'll talk more broadly.

I think we have introduced a range of products and enhanced them that help our customers to process
titles more quickly. The loan payoff tool, we've talked about in the past, is better still today than it was
a year ago in terms of the lender coverage. Lien cars are an especially challenging title for insurance
carriers to obtain and therefore, to allow us to sell the vehicle. And I think our various offerings, lien pay
off included in that realm, are better than they ever have been.

When it comes to the member side of things, we have deployed a number of different tools, including
app-based tools, including mobile check-ins and scheduling of pickups and such that have made their
experience more seamless. And we think we are reducing friction for new and existing members to buy
cars at Copart and certainly have much to do on our to-do list to move that ball forward.

And then lastly and perhaps most importantly, the auction itself is arguably our most important single
platform that we invest in very aggressively to make the experience faster, to make it still more mobile-
friendly, to let anyone who wants to see and buy and track vehicles at Copart to make that a seamless
experience as possible. Our paid member growth is up very meaningfully year-over-year, a reflection of
our investments in that arena.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then we continue to hear stories about the exceptionally high cost of shipping containers and
naturally, your business relies on that to some extent. Are you surprised that there's no -- or has
seemingly no impact from the rising cost of shipping containers on your overall demand? I would think
that your customers would have to factor that in.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think that's -- no effect probably is overstating it. I think the point would be that the offsetting forces
have overwhelmed that. So vehicle demand, the member recruitment and auction liquidity have more
than covered it. I think it's also fair to say that when it comes to shipping containers and the inflationary
pressures there that those are much heavier on inbound volume to the U.S. as has always been the case
than it is the containers leaving or the ships leaving the U.S. and going elsewhere. I think those routes
tend to be a little less congested, the slots less spoken for. So those pressures, I think, are more modest
than they might appear at first glance.

Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

A question on, I guess, on the vehicle profile. I think Jeff commented that you're seeing less damage mix
over time. Could you talk about sort of what percentage of mix might be run and drive? And then the
inverse of that, what percentage of your mix is really sold as crushed car bodies on its metals content and
where you see that metals price environment now?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes, to the last portion of your question, which is probably the easiest, certainly, metals -- commodity
metals are rebounding like many underlying physical goods in terms of the prices. Still, it's a small
minority of our cars that are sold for pure meltdown value, so to speak, and a still smaller minority of our
relevant economics rate a car that sells for a few hundred dollars and is stripped off a part or 2 and then
melted down is a very valuable service that we provide to our communities and our customers to eliminate
those cars, but not as consequential when it comes to the economics of our business.

And then the run and drive mix as a percentage. I mean, obviously, with dealer cars, it's gone up, but is it
1/3 or 40% of your volumes sold or less than that?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

No. So we haven't disclosed that precise mix in the past and don't intend to do so. But in terms of the
run and drive mix, yes, it is a reflection of rising total loss frequency so that less damaged cars. And I
think it's probably easier, Bret, for that matter, to strip the insurance from everything else to isolate that
question. But when it comes to the insurance vehicles, yes, more cars are drivable today because a car
can be totaled because a rear sensor or front sensor or a lane departure warning sensor on the mirror is
knocked out and the replacement and calibration is expensive that, yes, there are more run and drive cars
as a percentage of the total.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

Okay. And a quick cash flow question. I guess, when you think about the land build-out strategy, I think
it was back in '15 or '16, what inning of land acquisition are we in? And when you think about your CapEx
expectations, what's the maintenance CapEx number versus the acquisition real estate investment CapEx
expectation?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Rob?

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens.

Joe Enderlin

This is Joe Enderlin on for Daniel Imbro. So our question, we're looking for availability on land overseas. I
wanted to know if it's kind of an arduous process to find land? And given the growth...

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Rob, can you hear us?

Operator

Yes. I can hear you gentlemen. Please continue.

Joe Enderlin

Okay, yes. Given the growth in Germany, do you have the capacity to support more growth?

Operator

Please stand by. We're experiencing technical difficulties. We'll resume momentarily. Gentlemen, if you can
-- this is your operator. If you can hear me, you may continue with your presentation.

Gentlemen, you may continue with your presentation.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Bret, apologies, we got disconnected there. Hello? Bret, can you hear us?

Joe Enderlin

This is Joe. So I was looking for some color on the availability of land overseas. I'm wondering if it's an
arduous process to find land. And then given the growth in Germany, do you have the capacity to support
more growth there?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Great. Good question. And certainly, the challenge of land acquisition and development is universal. It
varies and -- it certainly varies by degrees, even here in the United States, depending on what -- which
city and state we're talking about. It then varies across countries as well and within those countries as
well.

So it's difficult to provide a thoughtful nuance answer there. But yes, the challenges are similar. We
do have the capacity in Germany to support the business we have, and we have built for growth. But
certainly, we would expect to invest more over the years to come to support our ongoing growth there.

There is lead time to do so. So you've heard us tell the stories here in the U.S. in the past, in which we
would buy a parcel of land in California, for example, that we've been pursuing for 20 years. We don't

expect that severe lead time in these markets, but it does take time to identify, to permit and to develop
the land before we can operate on it.

Joe Enderlin

Great. And then as a follow-up, what about Spain or other markets? Do you have capacity there?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Same answer. Yes, we have the capacity to serve the business today and for near, medium-term growth,
but also that we intend to and will invest more still in it to support our future business there.

Operator

The next question will be coming from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Exane.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

A couple of questions for me. So first one is one of your salvage competitors spoke to inflation and towing
costs. Have you seen this at all? Can you give us a sense for the sensitivity of yard ops to towing cost and
what type of impact this could have in operations growth? And then historically, when you've seen periods
of inflationary towing costs, like what extent have you been able to pass that through to sellers would be
helpful.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Got it. Well, inflation, perhaps to generalize first, is always a consideration in our business. In different
years, there are different inflationary inputs for our business. And many years, of course, it's been health
care, fuel and other such commodities. Today, yes, somewhat more acute for all the reasons you're
reading about in the [indiscernible] press already. We're comfortable we can manage that inflation and
continue to deliver operating leverage in our business.

So in short, towing costs are a significant portion of our cost at the yard level. So they certainly do matter
to us. But we think it's manageable, and we haven't proactively raised it as a consideration this quarter
because it's just part of the business, as is labor cost, health care costs, power and utilities and so forth.
It's part of what we do.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Got you. Okay. So it sounds like you do a lot of like logistics services for insurers by managing the towing
and all that. Is there an opportunity to do like container side, like shipping side for ocean freight for your
international buyers? Like who are the international buyers? Do they tend to be smaller one-off consumers
or small business -- like small businesses? Are they other wholesalers that are managing this process for
them?

I guess what I'm trying to get at, is there an advantage to use your scale to be able to get better shipping
rates on behalf of your customers? Or is this not a way to arbitrage that market? Just kind of curious how
you think about that.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. I think there's a healthy distribution of buyers. So in some cases, pure one-off buyers who will
literally buy 1 car and then disappear. And there are others who make it their business and buy hundreds,
in some cases, thousands of vehicles to rebuild and sell in their native markets.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

We have experimented and dabbled certainly in international shipping over the years. There is a healthy
ecosystem that emerges, of course, around the business of our size, other folks who do ship, who do
aggregate vehicles, who do marshal them on behalf of buyers. So it's something we would continue to
evaluate, but there's a robust enough and healthy enough ecosystem around us that has never been a
barrier to auction participation.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Got you. Okay. And then just a quick housekeeping one. It looks you did a small acquisition this quarter,
$5 million or so. Like I'm not sure if it was proceeds for past acquisition or something, but anything you
could shed color there would be helpful.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes, it's a small regional provider in our space that we've had a relationship with years and bought it in the
Midwestern United States.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

How much of the increase in transaction prices do you think is driven by the rise in used vehicle and
crushed auto body prices, which would have, of course, or could, of course, cyclically decline after having
experienced such a large run-up versus how much of the increase in transaction prices do you think is
being driven by your member recruitment or other company-specific efforts, which could prove longer
lasting?

And then also, I think it's difficult to make such projections. But I'm just curious about the extent to which
you think or estimate or handicap that increases in used vehicle in commodity prices that we've seen
may actually be partly structural in nature rather than cyclical given fiscal or monetary policies and that
whatever level we do cyclically decline too might, in fact, prove potentially higher than where we stood
pre-pandemic.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Sure. I think you've got probably 8 questions nested in there, but we'll try to tackle them. On the question
of ASPs and what is driving their growth? The third variable I'd add to your list in addition to I think,
first, you were citing the market dynamics in used vehicles today; second, you're citing our member
recruitment retention expansion and the experience. The third variable I'd add to that list is total loss
frequency that as carriers total more cars, as they total newer and less damaged vehicles, that has a
healthy effect on ASPs as well.

So the latter 2, I would describe as durable long-term secular forces. The first, I think, is an open
question. I think that all 3 have mattered a lot over the course of the past year. The first question on to
what extent the vehicle values are cyclical or reflections of more secular structural forces, I think, is a fair
question.

I don't know that we have, and especially in light of the perspective on that, I think some of it, for sure, is
here to stay. Perhaps not all of it. Now how the semiconductor universe and the new vehicle universe, et
cetera, how those forces unwind or how they rebound over the course of the next 6 to 24 months, I think
is -- I don't know that we have a different perspective on that.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

Okay. Very helpful color. And then just last question is what the latest is that you're seeing in terms of
the recovery in miles driven? LKQ has made some comments recently about how well miles driven is
recovering, the distribution of when people are driving throughout the day is different, less centered
around commuting hours, meaning less congestion, which can result in accident frequency, maybe not
recovering in a linear fashion along with miles driven. Just curious what the latest that you're seeing there
might be.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think our latest data, June, July, August, would suggest ongoing recovery and certainly now as the
Northeast goes back to school also post Labor Day, we're seeing a recovery, but not yet back to 2019
levels. I don't know that we have a finer resolution on that question than you would. We're looking at the
same underlying data.

As for the distribution of driving hours, I think we've seen a change both in when people drive and where
they drive to. So less commuting, much more retail, much more recreation that they, in some cases,
as folks have avoided airlines and such. Now the -- that has frankly yielded, in the end, higher accident
frequency than I think had been predicted going into the pandemic.

If you told folks that vehicle miles traveled would go down by X percent, I think the conventional wisdom
is that accidents -- the number of accidents and the absolute would go down by more than X percent. And
in fact, it has gone down by significantly less than X percent a reflection of higher speed driving, more
distracted driving and the like. So even though the congestion, I think, has been appreciably less than it
once was, I think that has not yet yielded the effect you just described.

Operator

Our next question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

My follow-up question got lost in the shuffle earlier. It was cash flow. When you think about your CapEx in
the last 5 or 6 years of real estate investment, what inning are we at in building out the North American
real estate? And as you think about your CapEx number, what number would be maintenance versus
acquisition of additional real estate going forward?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. It's a fair question, Bret. I think we launched, you may remember Jay talking about it in the spring
of 2016, our then 20/20/20 program to expand our footprint, to absorb the growth that was to come.
If anything, we had then underdeclared our ambitions by a fair bit and have continued to invest even
through this past quarter, as you've seen.

The issue with a forward prognosis is this is a dynamic question. It's a reflection of what we see in volume
growth, share gain, growth of our noninsurance business, cycle times, et cetera. But we are certainly
continuing to meet literally weekly to review our investment opportunities in land and the like, both in the
U.S. and the overseas, so -- and overseas.

So my expectation is that we'll continue to invest in land. It's each quarter, as you know, tends to be very
lumpy because the nature of land is that we chase it for a long time, and it finally comes through and
therefore, 1 quarter suddenly much more substantial than the prior one. But we continue to invest in our
business, it's essential to what we do. So we expect that to continue.

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

Okay. Could you give us sort of an expectation on maintenance CapEx so we can sort of bucket what is
acquisition versus ongoing spend?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. Maintenance CapEx, I think, as a proxy depreciation and amortization is a decent starting point. It's
a reflection of the useful lives logic that we are diligent to balance and review with our accountants and
so forth that should reflect how long that asset should last. And it's a good proxy certainly across the
company overall.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Truist.

Stephanie Lynn Moore
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I just had a quick point. I think you touched on many times, just the efforts that are done -- that have
been done on a member recruitment side on the buyer side. So maybe you can touch a little bit on, is
there anything different that has been done? Is the strategy needed to change? Or just remind us what
you're doing specifically just to reach that larger buyer base? Has anything changed to create maybe a
more stable buyer base where you have more consistent purchases? Just anything there would be helpful.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Excellent. I appreciate the question, Stephanie. And this is -- the logic is a little bit circular, but it is the
growth -- the quality of our cars, the vehicles that we earn the right to sell from dealers then brings
additional members on board. The increasing total loss frequency brings more members on board. The
increasing members who are on board then brings more consignments from dealers and insurance
companies. So it certainly is circular. So it very much works in both directions.

In terms of the actual active measures we take on member recruitment, it very much varies by country,
by market, by type of buyer. It can include things as mundane as the trade show attendance, physical
media, certainly social media and the like, but it -- radio ads, et cetera, it's all over the map, and we try to
have a sophisticated market-specific approach to each of our major member buying countries.

It's also a major to do of ours to anticipate the next country which has the characteristics of one that
should be a major Copart buyer and to invest proactively in that. And then once they're in the funnel, it's
-- we view the member experience is paramount as well, not just the registration and becoming eligible to
bid and participate at Copart auctions, but really the lifetime journey with Copart, what it means to buy a
car, pay for it, pick it up and so on and so forth. And there are certainly enhancements we'll provide there
over the years to come as well.

Operator

Our final question is from the line of Ali Faghri with Guggenheim.

Ali-Ahmad Faghri
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'm wondering about the impact of these cat events on your margins. In the past, you talked about
upfront costs related to towing and land and you've seen kind of a pretty sizable margin impact initially
before you actually sell those incremental total loss vehicles. Given all of the investments you've made in
land as well as your fleet on the towing side as well, is there a chance that these cat events have maybe
less of a kind of near-term cost and margin impact than they have historically?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

COPART, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 09, 2021

I think it's perhaps more accurate, Ali, to say that for the same catastrophic event relative to 10 years
ago, the financial effect -- impact to us is more muted than it otherwise would have been. Now every
catastrophic event is unique. In the East Coast, it's very different from Louisiana, which is in turn very
different from Houston, Texas, which is certainly in turn different from Germany as well.

So it's a matter of investing proactively. It's partially a question of cost because it allows us to clip the
extremes of the supply curve. But it's largely about service too. The reason we own trucks and land and
have a catastrophic team already assigned here at Copart who is ready to deploy at a moment's notice,
that's as much about customer service as it is about cost. But yes, all else equal, the margin effects would
be more muted today than they otherwise would have been, but the priority really is providing excellent
service to our customers.

Ali-Ahmad Faghri
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. That makes sense. I appreciate the color. And then a quick follow-up. What drove the stronger
vehicle sales growth in the quarter? Is there anything you'd call out there?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

The vehicle sales growth, there are a number of different avenues through which Copart purchases cars,
including our Copart Direct business, which is -- which reflects vehicles we buy directly from consumers
and, in turn, sell at our auction platform. It certainly includes our international business in Germany as
we penetrate the market and show the market why the consignment model with Copart makes the most
sense. We also help to get the flywheel going by purchasing cars there as well.

So there are a number of different forces. The -- I think, unfortunately, the vehicle sales number just has
an awkwardly outsized effect on the P&L results, especially if you're focused on basis point changes and
margin rates and the like. But certainly, we continue to evaluate the business on a per vehicle economics
basis, which is a little bit less transparent to the outside world.

But yes, vehicle sales have grown, but even still relative to the actual size of our business, very modest,
meaning if we were to gross up every car we sold to its actual selling price, you would see that the
purchased vehicles is pretty modest in the grand scheme of things.

Ali-Ahmad Faghri
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And 1 final question, if I can squeeze it in. I'm sure you do a lot of work on this internally, but any
insights about what your market share currently may be within kind of the insurance business on the
consignment side versus your primary competitor?

I know this industry has historically been viewed as a duopoly, but it's pretty clear that Copart has taken
share over the last, call it, 5-plus years. So I'm curious if you have any kind of numbers that you would
put around your market share versus your main competitor?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

No, I appreciate the question. I don't think we could provide an absolute number or an estimate of our
market share. We certainly do know that our customers have alternatives, and we act that way and
invest and operate that way as well. Our market share gains, which you just described a moment ago, a
reflection of some of the things we talked about on the call, including catastrophic readiness, including
auction liquidity and day-to-day service, including the technology stack, our member experience, et
cetera.

So over the years, we certainly have grown our market position because we take it -- that's one of our key
aspirations as a business, and we hope to do so in the future as well, but not in a position to provide an
absolute estimate.
