Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies second quarter earnings conference call.
[Operator Instructions] And now I would like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Ankur
Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Jody, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year
2020. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy.

On the webcast today are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior

references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and revenue growth will be
referred to on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and
divestitures completed within the past 12 months.

We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no
obligations to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of
our risks and other factors.

And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and
hope that you and your families are safe and healthy.

I'm pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the
first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now
leading ACG. I know you enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I'm glad he could be here
with us on the call.

Last quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much
has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back
in February. But what hasn't changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering
focus in 4 key areas.

Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and
safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered a global work-from-home policy and severely restricted
travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service
engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our
response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.

It should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is the unwavering commitment to our
customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient
ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities to promote technical assistance,
to urgently delivering Bravo Liquid Handling systems for their COVID-19 tests or providing live online
guidance to keep labs functioning. We're doubling-down on reps just to support our customers. This is
especially true as their needs change and evolve.

Our third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet.
When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made a change in our
supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured accounting of order intake and our ability to
deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn't shy away from taking swift action to reduce
expenses. We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritizing sustaining our growth
investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk.

Bob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken
actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. The positive impact of our approach
shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2
revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis.
Our Q2 operating margins of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during
the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.

Before covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued
prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are
taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to
prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help
us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised
for growth.

Our Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of
our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach in investing for growth continue to serve us well
and will be a major factor to help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example
of our approach of continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our
cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the
marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need
for our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development
program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we've created into
areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about the continued growth in
NGS cancer diagnostics.

Let's now take a close look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today's COVID-19 world. Last
quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business. As
COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February
and March, our overall business was up about 1%. However, in late March, we faced significant disruption
in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities.

Our China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China, with
increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other
geographies experienced declines. We expect the China growth recovery to continue throughout the year
as lab operations and investments continue to resume.

The near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new
equipment parts just across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testings.

Some quick highlights across our businesses. Both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG's 5% growth
is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our
LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of
growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end-market perspective,
pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

The food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental
and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the
end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in
these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical
production regionally as some customers shift supply chains.

Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement
during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4.

As a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against
COVID-19. Before closing, I would like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the
COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth for this time, Agilent is supporting several
aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this
resulted in a 1-point tailwind of growth primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this
will become a more meaningful tailwind of future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized a cross-
Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range
from instrumentations such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing, to consumables and components
necessary for testing as well as lab support for these customers.

As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on
supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a
continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company, with a bias for speed,
execution and growth.

Thank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look
forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you're up.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur
said in hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will
get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings
again. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second
quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with a framework for
thinking about Q3.

Given the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we're not going to be providing specific forward-
looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide
a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process in how
things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP
results.

Reported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis.
Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points. And acquisitions added 3.3 percentage
points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter.

The pacing of revenue during the quarter varied significantly by region driven by where each region was
in the cycle of precautionary measures being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously
disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-
home measures in those regions reduced lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install
equipment. This lower level of business activity carried through the month of April, resulting in double-
digit declines for the month in those regions.

On the other hand, and as we had anticipated, business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China
as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch-up from
lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our
initial expectations at the start of Q2.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%,
resulting in the 1.7% core decline.

Before getting into some additional group details, it's also important to note while we have seen some
order pushouts, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of
cancellations, in both March and April, cancellations were actually lower than the previous year.

Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging
environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument
business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter but did see some bright spots, with growth in
large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition, as Mike mentioned,
we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG, the impact of COVID-19-related closures was most
pronounced in the academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1%, with
China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays in installations
and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I'm pleased to say that our DGG
business delivered 5% growth during Q2 and was on track for double-digit growth prior to the slowdown
in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics boosted by products used to develop testing
capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on
track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well.

The pathology business grew in all regions, except for the U.S., where the effects of delay in the non-
COVID-19-related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions
ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter, with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific
flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%.

Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we
moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost structure through targeted discretionary spending program
reductions. We continued to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities such as
digital. For example, we leveraged digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to
continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access.

While we took actions across the P&L, we focused most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a
percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result, operating margins of
22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis
points versus the prior year mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services.
In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This
combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share, flat with
the number we posted a year ago.

Now in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million
shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all share repurchases to maximize our
liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate
when repurchases will resume.

We generated $313 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement
over last year despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we've taken
steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly 1/3 for the rest of the year.

In addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position, with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3
billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio,
as defined by net debt-to-EBITDA, was 0.9x. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there
is no change to our dividend.

As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding
the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic
environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of
global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won't be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could
unfold in the coming quarter.

When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity -- very similar to April
and the business activity we've seen in the first few weeks of the month confirm that. We anticipate that
China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery relative to the rest of the world. We
expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our
service revenue, to remain resilient, and we will be following the consumables business very closely to
monitor early signs of recovery in demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our
revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume
activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a
more significant impact than the 1% contribution in Q2.

Now on the higher end of the decline, we're building in the assumption that there would be no significant
improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S. and Europe that non-COVID-19 testing
would not recover and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there's still significant uncertainty
in the pace of recovery as the U.S. and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15%
decline proves very conservative, but I wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we're using
to manage going forward.

In Q3, we expect a 2-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a 3-point tailwind. Again,
this is not formal guidance but should give you a sense for some of the variables we're looking at within
the business and believe this is the best way to view third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As
Mike said, we also believe that Q3 will be the most difficult of our fiscal year as the world works through
reopening the economy.

Overall, I feel very -- I feel we are very well-positioned to deal with this challenging environment,
accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy reopens.

Before I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent's performance for the first
2 quarters truly shows the resilience of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining
focused on supporting our customers during this time. And I would be remiss without a shout out to the
finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from
home. We've taken actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future.

And with that, I believe, Mike, you would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to Q&A.
Mike?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn't be more
proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations
and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at
Agilent. The team has been tested during this crisis like no other time, and they have not shied away from
it. Instead, we have answered the call with world-class execution, an even stronger focus on customer
service and inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced that we will emerge from
this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace.

And with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'm going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what, I guess, sequentially
is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter? Why should things be deteriorating
for the upcoming quarter? And then on the COVID tailwinds, did the 35% growth you called out in NASD,
does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the
strength there, too?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Do you want to take that, Bob?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob. I'll take the question. I'll actually take the second question first
around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had
nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It's mostly the activities that have continued in our
pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened, and we're very pleased with the progress
there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing.

On the first question that you had, again, this isn't guidance. It's kind of a range of scenarios that we're
planning, and we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15 would be very conservative. If you
look at -- we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom, and
then improvement in June and July. And -- but if there are relapses, if China does relapse or there is a
slowdown in that growth, that would be the bottom end of the range. So it's a wider range than we would
normally have, but there's obviously very much -- a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customers shifting supply chains. Can you
maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step-down here is C&E and given the volatility in oil
prices, how much of a factor that is?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Yes. Bob, I'll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume it kind of looks like
Q2 and with the potential that the investments, that we're starting to see inclinations of a regional
approach to this pandemic is really -- cause many parts of the world to rethink their supply chain. So
we're seeing early indications of moving, of onshoring certain types of critical chemical components in
certain geographies. So that could represent some upside in our thinking. But basically, we're assuming
kind of the current situation continues into Q3.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Tycho, if you look -- if you -- if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first
2 months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn't
have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. And so

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

academia and government, with the lab closures and so forth, was worse in April than it was in other
markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now, albeit down.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then one quick piece before I hop off...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Sorry, I was going to add too, I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it's important to keep in
mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then one clarification before I hop off, on Lasergen. It sounds like you -- this is a full write-down. Is
that correct? You're kind of abandoning the project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked
about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify what changed there?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Well, actually, you referenced your conference, a lot changed after the conference, where we
saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain
competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our
current investments, and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to
invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own.

And Bob, I'll let you comment on the financial side of that.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It is a full shutdown, and we will have a write-off in Q2.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.

Stephen Christopher Beuchaw
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in the space. One thing that we've seen across tools
and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise, in part, with a view that there's an opportunity
for accelerated capital deployment given the potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely
strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you
think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have 2
follow-ups.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where
we would like to deploy capital in M&A that makes sense for the company. And we've talked about our
criteria around in markets that we know, where companies that we've acquired have higher levels of
growth than the overall company average, accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. We
have noticed some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the
M&A pipeline across the industry.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

I would also tell you that valuations haven't moved much. So this is not a buyer's market and you can buy
things on the cheap. So you really have to be -- think through what you're looking at, and does it make
sense for the company.

Anything else you would add to that, Bob? Yes? Steve, do you have a follow-up or...

Stephen Christopher Beuchaw
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Sorry. I thought Bob chimed in there. But I had 2 follow-ups. One is I wonder if you could speak to
activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might have been any sort of
April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the
world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just
in China, but on growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions? And then one -- just a quick
one. I'm curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab
has historically been a very strong grower. And some component of the CrossLab growth story has been
penetration into new categories. Is that penetration story still active in the current environment?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I'll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve. And you're right, what we have seen is the
pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming
back. And so what we saw was more pronounced, obviously, in China that has -- I wouldn't call it a
snapback, but it's a recovery. And we're actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt
more of the pain, and that's actually coming back faster. And then the U.S. -- and now we're starting to
see some of the U.S. It's still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that kind of wave of
recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions.

And I'll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about CrossLab's business, but we remain incredibly
bullish about that business and I think even more so now given some of the proof points that we have in
terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?

Padraig McDonnell
Senior Vice President

Yes. Thanks, Bob. And I think, yes, very, very strong demand. We're seeing, for example, in our service
business, a lot of strong demand holding up on our contracts, which really help our customers be
productive and help with start-up services and actually achieve a critical component for customers in
the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback on
-- in terms of demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue,
especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we've developed and our way of interacting with
customers.

The last thing I would mention is that, also, our productivity story in CrossLab, that our Lab Enterprise
business is doing extremely well, and also really shows the customer need for productivity in these times
and beyond, going forward, is going to be very strong.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

And Steve, let me add just one other thing in the case. Obviously, ACG grew 1%. It would have been
stronger, several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn't install the equipment,
and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so
that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.

Stephen Christopher Beuchaw
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. So this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciated.

Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Mike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment. It's certainly encouraging to hear there was no real
deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil
prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacted to the oil decline? I know typically, low oil could
actually be a positive if it's oversupply. It feels like at least part of what's going on now is low demand, but
maybe just talk through what you're seeing there and the expectations going forward.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. That's a great, great question. And what we also try to think through is what's really behind the lower
oil price. And I think this time, you've got 2 things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really
driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services.
But I'm really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty
subdued right now. But over the years, we've continued to have more and more of our business move into
the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really
saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through -- all Q2, where the energy segment
was pretty subdued, where -- limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our
ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, a different kind of scenario on the chemical
side.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this,
understandable that they should snap back quickly. I guess how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does
it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger
because of the oil prices? What's your outlook maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but
over the next 6 to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that
should snap back quickly?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

In my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable
future. So it's really just tied to events that I'm just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when
does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point
out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of the C&E business, particularly that
COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world's supply chain. And we're seeing many customers and
many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region.
So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which
would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don't get too excited. This -- I would
just say, let's assume that it's going to stay subdued for a while as we're thinking about it right now.
Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2 because some of these are just too difficult to
predict, the timing of transition.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation...

Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely.

As -- and we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Absolutely.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho's question there. Do
you guys have capacity to increase the addressed demand for -- from COVID? Or are you already kind of
maxed out in terms of the buildout and just as you build out capacity it's kind of addressing?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

We are not capacity-constrained. And as you know, we're continuing to build out the new facility in
Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can't share specific names, I can tell you
that there are programs underway that aren't in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19
work.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

A couple of questions. Just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what's that -- where are we in
terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I'm just curious on the base.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's tracking well to the number that we talked about at the -- or what people have estimated,
ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It's tracking well to that.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And what are you going to do with the -- are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the
business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to -- and can you remind us on what you were
spending on that? I think it was around $50-ish million?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes -- no, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We've spent
basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that will be a combination of reinvesting where
appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we're in, in terms of COVID-19.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And
there's some real talent in that team, and there's some really great intellectual property that we think we

13

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

can really deploy in other programs. So we're looking to go forward with that combo approach, as Bob
mentioned.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So you mentioned that you're seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains
and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean obviously, there's a push at looking
about bringing API manufacturing back, and you're a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with
another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what's
happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I'll -- hey, Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I'll take the first one, and I'll leave the second one to Mike. I think
on the pharmaceutical one, we're actually watching that very closely. It's different than the chemical
side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there's
regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S.
-- providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think -- we're watching
that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come
out because our offering here is, I think, second to none. And so more to come there. It's probably not as
fast-moving but certainly is on our radar screen.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And without weighing in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we're
actively scenario-planning. We -- under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply
chain. So we don't want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced
a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And if I can squeeze one more in...

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Sure.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Well, while Agilent doesn't do -- you don't supply testing products for COVID-19, I mean, obviously, how
are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I'm sort of curious about
are your customers demanding that you get tested when people come in because there's some very large
numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I'm just curious in terms
of what you're thinking.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. A couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don't provide kits directly ourselves, we
provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits.
So we've -- I've personally been involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are
looking for us to assure -- assurance to supply them. So I think we've got a good feel for the demand that
we're seeing out there.

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

Relative to our own employees, right now, we're not requiring employees to be tested for -- return in the
office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and
we're going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we're thinking this through. Once
more routine testing does become available, that's probably something we would look at pretty closely.
But we're in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now.

Relative -- it's funny. We keep asking that question of our -- particularly our service teams, and that has
not come up yet. So we're continuing to monitor it. But right now, we're not seeing requests from our
customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have
to follow their safety protocols and we outfit our team with the right PPE and the right training. But the
testing side, we've not yet seen that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So I hate to overanalyze 1 month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so
bad for all of the news we've seen. Can you -- you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China?
I mean I was doing some back-of-the-envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20%
growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Pretty good math.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. You're in the ballpark.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

You have pretty good math, Dan.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe separately, a follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don't trust the trend in China.
And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any
other things?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Dan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn't come through
that way in my remarks. So we actually...

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Because of the word "plateau" earlier. I wasn't sure.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Oh, no, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario, that Bob was trying to put together this framework,
I said, well, we could be wrong, and if it's wrong, we -- this is what the implications would be. We don't

15

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

think we're wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is -- you would see that far end of the framework
that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it's
going to continue to return to a higher level of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you
noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.

Doug Schenkel
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan's question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to
be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to
get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of
April into May. Maybe I'm just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I'm just wondering
are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid- to late
May.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We haven't seen any continue -- again, these are one point out of the month, right? But -- or one
point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we're not seeing anything
that is dramatically off base.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And I think, Bob, it's maybe just worth mentioning that although we don't go in a lot of details on the
order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time
through May. So yes.

Doug Schenkel
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumables side, what did you see
in April? And then what was that trend into May? Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign
that more people are getting into labs and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demand.
So I'm just wondering, recognizing it's an unusual time, if you would be willing to go to that level just
because it's important for you and the group and if so, if you would say anything about specific end
markets and geographies.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I will just
leave it at that.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And it's tied directly to the opening a facility...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. You can draw a parallel where things are opening up, you see the consumables recovering. It's
recovering much faster than the instrumentation.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

And that's really -- that's why we keep using word "uncertainty" because we can't project exactly how
certain facilities will open up, but we know when they opened up in China, we've gotten the business. We
know as they've been opening up in Europe, we're getting the business. And then when they've slowly
been opening up in the U.S., we're getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren't
opening up right now, unless you're doing COVID-19 research.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Correct.

Doug Schenkel
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Super helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the
quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think, on the surface, that's a bit
surprising just because of the heavy mix, the heavy exposure to academic research. How are you able to
pull that off?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Doug, thanks for the observations there because there is a big footprint of the business in academia,
but the overall business did grow. And I think I would like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little
about what's going on there.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean as you say, Doug, it is a
tale of 2 cities, that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time,
while our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite
some interest for the biotech, ELISA, and Roche's and for the technology testing. So with that, there's
actually quite good demand. We also see the ACEA flow, which have a tremendous growth. We see a lot
of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine
that is happening in -- related to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong
demand. We've seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia
and government overall is challenging, but we do see a pocket of interest still there. So overall, great
performance.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

A first one on NASD. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering was
there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given -- heading into
COVID.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Sam, I think the answer is no, but I'm going to -- you haven't had a chance to talk today. So why don't
you confirm and deny this rumor of mine?

Samraat S. Raha

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

Yes. Yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it's a long lead business
where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out to work because
there's a lot of a preparatory work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling, all the pre-
validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We've got things scheduled out for months ahead
already. So no stocking effect.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. Just to add on to what -- yes, just to add on to what Sam said because there's
been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven't seen any of that in our
demand for NASD.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's great to hear. So Sam, if I could, and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics.
Obviously, a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities
there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your
genomics portfolio and overall market position longer-term?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'll make some initial comments, and I'll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all,
important just to remind the audience, we actually do have a cancer diagnostics business day from
an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation
into these workflows today. We're overall very -- we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer
diagnostics market for NGS-based -- cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there's a path forward for
incremental growth on top of what we're doing that doesn't require a -- or having our own sequencer
because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments
on that?

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

Yes. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are -- we remain the leading provider for library preparation,
particularly target enrichment kits, that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have
some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS quality control and so forth. And also, our
combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDx business,
where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics, so we believe, together with what
we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability
set by bringing that together, and there's partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven't really changed
our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don't believe we need to directly develop the sequencer
ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS, continues, and we feel good
about it.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And if I could squeeze the last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots
that you have, obviously, are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and
genomics community. So I'm trying to see if that was a meaningful number this quarter. And is that
something you expect to continue and if you can -- if there is something you can quantify along those
lines? And I wasn't sure if this is in Sam's bucket or it's actually in the LSAG bucket.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

Yes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I'll tell you, it's in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the
instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about a 1 point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So...

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

So that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of
consumables associated with instrumentation.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

One, Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you guys say April was down 7%
because I'm trying to figure out if May is in line with April, 6.5%? So if May is, I guess, in line with April or
even, I guess, if the next 2, 4 or 3 months are in line with April, like how do we get to minus 15? Maybe
just help us understand the range that...

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

It wouldn't.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Vijay, it wouldn't. That would be kind of towards the lower end, right? So what we're saying is if things
kind of backtracked, we didn't get any better in the U.S. and Europe, and we didn't really have -- there
was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we're saying we don't expect that. We hope that that's very
conservative, but things are just now opening up in the U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that
you're saying, you don't get there. You get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. Understood. No, that's helpful, Bob. And then I guess on the China topic. I know, in the past, you
guys have -- or I guess some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus, China stimulus. Any details
around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus and perhaps how that could benefit you guys?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We haven't heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market
demand in the latter part of this year. But that's not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a
recovering China marketplace for us.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.

Brandon Couillard

around capital equipment. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 21, 2020

No significant disruption, but it's relatively flattish, I think, for the quarter. That's about 70% of our
pharma business. About 30% was growing quite strongly in biopharma. Small molecule is relatively flattish
on the instrumentation side.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. We -- our business in India is fairly small today.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost
structure breakdown between fixed and variable and maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into
the third quarter?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would say, I mean, we've been -- we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind
of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million
kind of reduction. About 1/3 of that, quite honestly, was travel-related as we put the brakes on, and I
would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3, obviously variable and then discretionary
spend. And then we do have some element of our variable comp that reduces with performance. But what
I would say is Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments,
but we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Bob, if I could just jump in there. I mean the fact that we were able to increase margins in the
quarter, in the midst of a pandemic, we're really quite pleased with that. And we didn't take shortcuts
here. So we -- there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent, and we've got a team that is not worried
about their future employment. They're all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our
customers.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS.

Daniel Gregory Brennan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I was hoping maybe to maybe to go back to China for a moment. Could you break it down a little bit more
kind of what you're seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew, and I think
you've given some other tidbit. Or maybe just give a little flavor for your segments in China. And then
specifically, if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which have been 2 big
drags for you guys.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'll take it, Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter, we were very pleased with the performance. All 3
business groups grew with DGG, albeit the smallest one, growing the fastest, followed by ACG, and LSAG
was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups, all but, I
think, academia and government grew to varying levels. And food, as we talked about, was up in China,
and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we've been very
pleased with our performance in China.

And maybe through, Bob, like the generic issue, obviously, maybe gets a little lost right now given
COVID...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up. It's really driven by the biopharma business, but our
small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat
globally, and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we've got the view that now, COVID-19 kind
of throws some variables in here, but we continue to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing
long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are
disproportionately our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

No. I can add to that, that you are right, that consolidation just continued with the generics, but according
to our expectations.

Daniel Gregory Brennan

Yes. Got it. And then another -- there was already a question, I think, that -- and I know Puneet asked
a question on the diagnostics business. But if you think about DGG, ex NASD business, obviously, that
business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you're selling
there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the
ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there...

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Maybe I'll jump on that because -- yes, I think, actually, hospital access for -- and patient's willingness to
go to the hospital medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology.
So that's one of the areas of "uncertainty" we're looking at, is when will those -- when will patients start
to return to hospitals to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe, Bob, in Europe, but
we've not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business, and that's -- and that puts somewhat of a -- that's
put a drag on our Q2 results, which were -- so it was still -- we're quite pleased we posted 5% core
growth in that business despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But
again, this is when...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Dan, that's one of the variables that we were taking into account with the framework that we
were talking about if, in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there's not any
resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business. Because
right now, biopsies aren't being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer,
then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We're hoping that, that will resume throughout the course of this
quarter, but it's still very early days. Ultimately, we see that as bad for the health care of the world, quite
honestly. And so we hope, not as -- not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers
and fathers that, that happens. But that's one of the things that is still in front of us.

Operator
Thank you. And that's all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes
today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
