Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone
Thanks for joining us today
This morning, I will review highlights from our first quarter results and provide an update on the market conditions in each of our regions
Laura will follow with the financial review of each of our businesses and an update to our outlook before we open the call to your questions
In the first quarter, segment operating income was $385 million, which is in line with our most recent guidance, and a great achievement given the headwinds in the quarter
As we said in February, we expected a decline in unit volume in the first quarter which was driven by our planned exit of some of the smaller rim size tires in EMEA and expectations for reduced OE demand in both the U.S
and China
Since then, volumes have been weaker than expected, especially in replacement and sell-out in the U.S
during the first quarter was softer than anticipated
In addition, we believe the timing of our price increases which came relatively early in the quarter had a negative effect on our volume
Even amidst these headwinds, we delivered segment operating margin of 10% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.74. These were simply excellent results for our teams who stuck to our strategy in an environment of rising raw material costs
We delivered cost savings, stayed focused on price and mix and did not diminish our value proposition for short-term volume increases
Our balanced plan to create value through sustainable revenue and profit growth is the objective of our strategy roadmap
It provides us with a constancy of purpose and informs the execution of our strategy despite market conditions that could tempt us to do otherwise
We are committed to the strategy roadmap and remain confident that we will continue to execute over the long-term
Regarding the first quarter, I can't recall a time when it was more critical for us to have the discipline and commitment to the execution of our strategy, and we will need to do more of the same in the second quarter
The Americas provided an example of this approach in the first quarter as our discipline and commitment to the execution of our strategy was critical
This was particularly true in the U.S
as domestic auto production declined and consumer replacement sell-out trends were somewhat weaker than we expected
Americas total unit volume declined 5%, driven by our U.S
consumer OE business
The Americas consumer OE unit volume declined by 13%, driven in part by lower U.S
auto production during the quarter
In addition, our OE performance this year is related to last year's very strong comparable where we saw first quarter 2016 U.S
consumer OE shipments up 11% while the market was up just 2%
Overall, our OE volume performance this quarter is generally consistent with what we had expected at the time of our fourth quarter call
For the rest of the year, we continue to expect softness in U.S
OE production, particularly in the second quarter and third quarter
It's important to keep in mind that the SAAR continues near last year's levels, the auto industry still has favorable macro tailwinds, and mix is shifting in a more favorable direction toward light trucks and SUVs
This mix-up plays to our strengths in OE where we have fitments on popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 and drives pull-through in the high-margin replacement segment
We're committed to winning in OE, and we'll continue to collaborate with OEMs in ways that both deliver value for them and are consistent with our strategy
For the company overall, the important takeaways in this quarter is that despite a decline in U.S
auto production, we are delivering on our plan with positive price/mix versus raw materials performance
That's the strength and the power of the Goodyear brand
Turning now to the U.S
consumer replacement industry
Sell-in demand remains solid and was up about 1%
We saw a growth in the 17-inch and larger segment of the industry at 8%, which is driving continued mix-up in our business
Total industry sell-out during the quarter was softer than expected
We believe the weakness in sell-out is related to warmer weather trends in the Northeast and Midwest as well as a delay in tax refunds affecting the U.S
consumer
You'll also recall that our price increase announced early in the year took effect February 1, which was the first in the U.S
market this year
This timing also played a role in this quarter's volume story, as our Americas consumer replacement volume declined 1%
We continue to expect moderate U.S
industry growth in replacement in 2017, as many of the key economic indicators continued to be positive
According to the most recent data, U.S
vehicle miles traveled rose 2% in February and gasoline demand rose 1% year-over-year in March
In addition, employment levels and gasoline prices all remain favorable and provide a productive platform for growth throughout the remainder of the year
Turning now to Brazil
I'm pleased to share that its first quarter was a very strong start to 2017 on all fronts
Brazil showed high-single-digit volume growth in consumer replacement, almost 8% volume growth in our commercial business, and our consumer OE showed slight but positive year-over-year growth for the first time since early 2012. I'm very pleased with these results, and I'm encouraged that the countries beginning to show tangible signs of climbing out of its two-year recession
And while our business in Brazil is far from its historical earnings level, we're clearly headed in the right direction
Across our markets in the Americas, our value proposition has allowed us to excel to improve price/mix, operational excellence initiatives, and a commitment to executing our strategy
Shifting to Europe, our EMEA business unit delivered $98 million in segment operating income during the first quarter, up 23% versus the prior year
EMEA's volume performance in the 17-inch and greater segment of the replacement market outpaced the industry, which grew at 12%
We are executing on our plan to mix-up our product portfolio in EMEA
Goodyear-branded summer tires, particularly the Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance and the Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 claimed podium wins in several important magazine tests this year, which led Tyrepress recently naming Goodyear as the overall victor in the 2017 summer tire test season
In addition, Dunlop presented the new Sport Maxx Race 2 at Geneva International Motor Show in March
This successor to the Sport Maxx Race has been developed together with Porsche to meet the demanding requirements for its new 911 GT3. With the first-generation Sport Maxx Race tires fitted on the previous models of the GT3, Dunlop continues its commitment to provide specialty tires for Porsche vehicles
As we look ahead, we expect to continue to see declines in the smaller than 17-inch summer segment in EMEA, particularly in the second quarter
We've been strategically reducing our volume in this segment which has been influenced by increased competition, including a significant presence of low-cost imports
This reduction includes the previously announced footprint action in Philippsburg, Germany, which will be completed by the end of this year
Simultaneously, we are realigning our go-to-market model in EMEA, similar to the approach that we successfully implemented in the U.S
Adjustments to our approach include refining our value proposition by focusing on the growing more profitable segments of the market
Re-energizing our efforts to collaborate with and support our OE partners, introducing new products from the market back, aligning our distribution, taking advantage of the value of the Goodyear brand and adjusting our high cost footprint
These actions are consistent with our strategy, and we are committed to their execution even in the face of inevitable hurdles along the way
Finally in Asia-Pacific strong volume growth in our consumer replacement business offset weaknesses in consumer OE particularly in China
Similar to the U.S
, auto inventories in China were higher during the quarter, which we believe is the result of a slower pace in the first quarter auto sales following a very strong pull ahead of demand in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are expecting weaker volumes in our OE business throughout the first half as our OE customers who are mainly the large Western JVs adjust production to align this with near-term reduction in their demand
I think it's important to keep in mind that our first-half performance in consumer OE last year was also very strong, up about 20% year-over-year and was fueled by the tailwind from a tax incentives put in place at the end of 2015. We remain pleased with the performance of our OE business and we continue to believe that the auto market in China is healthy
As is the case with the industry overall, the OE segment in China will not grow in a straight line, but will continue to grow as the world's largest new car market for years to come
Despite the near-term weakness in OE, our China consumer replacement business remained strong
We saw robust double-digit volume growth in the quarter, driven by strong replacement pull through as well as some pre-buy in advance of our price increase there
We continue to expand our retail presence in China and see enormous growth potential in tier 3 and tier 4 cities
These are lesser-known cities, but have populations of more than a million and are continuing to grow
India also had an outstanding quarter with volume growth in both consumer OE and replacement in mid-single-digit range and one of the final positive notes on Asia-Pacific after several years of malaise, we are beginning to see an increase in demand for OTR tires
Although, off a very low base, the increased level of order activity is encouraging and we continue to remain optimistic about the long-term value proposition of our business in Asia-Pacific
So, looking back at the quarter, I am satisfied with our results, more importantly, I'm pleased with the way we continue to execute our strategy in both strong markets and challenging ones
Our teams have made the commitment to winning with consumers and helping our customers build their businesses every day, while taking the long view of creating sustainable value
Our 2017 plan remains on track
We continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver our SOI target of $2 billion this year and we remain committed to our long-term plan of $3 billion in SOI in 2020. We are confident in our ability to deliver strong results across the entire company, because of our commitment to and execution of our strategy
It's what you've seen from us for several years, we will not chase volume for volume sake, we will compete for profitable growth in market segments with a value of the Goodyear brand, our innovative quality products, our pervasive distribution and service networks, and the best team in the industry provide us with a competitive advantage
We are achieving real cost reduction, driven by our operational excellence initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our supply chain to help us get the right tire to the right customer, at the right cost
And we're not running our business for one good quarter or one good year, but to create sustainable value for the long term
Now I'll turn the call over to Laura
Good morning, Rod
From about 27% to about 19% full-year now
So, Rod, a good question
A lot of sort of moving parts in there and I guess the first thing that I would – I'd comment on because I – and I said it in my remarks on the call, because I think it's got to be the pillars of what we do and that's to have the discipline to stick to the strategy that we've had around putting a value proposition out in the marketplace
And I know you've heard me say it before and I'll – I guess I will repeat it again, because it's so important to us
Our strategy is predicated on a value proposition that goes beyond just recovering our input costs, if you like
We have a value proposition around innovation, around brand, around promotion, around training, service, supply the digital customers we bring, national accounts so on and so forth, that's the competitive advantage that we predicate our strategy on, and that we're driving as we go forward
So this is important for us, particularly as we go through, as I've also said an industry that doesn't necessarily just move sequentially forward
So there is volatility in our industry and we're experiencing some of that right now
Now, having said that, you know we have a proven track record on being able to offset our raw material costs with price mix
We've done that over time, we've done that time and time again I should say and we've done that over time because there's a lag between when this raw material prices come in and hit our P&L and when we recover them and then we add onto that those customers that are covered from our raw material indexes that have a lag as to when those things cover
So, as we have volatility in raw material prices, it takes us a while to recover those costs as we've often said
But our strategy says that we've got a proven track record to do it, and we're sticking to that with the discipline and as we have and as we will
You mentioned earlier, the raw material price increase – the raw material headwind now about $750 million
Q1, we took $42 million of that, which obviously implies the balance of it comes in over the rest of the year
So we have our announced price increases out there to go cover that, and we're committed to doing that because that cost is very real for us as we move ahead
And as you talk about that, we have announced price increases out there, but we did not implement any incremental rebates out there
In fact, Rod, I would say, the reverse is true given that headwind, the raw material coming in ahead of us and you made reference to our volume numbers as well
Take OE out of that, our volume numbers weren't where we necessarily would've liked them, but at the end of the day we know that we're sticking to our strategy, and that's a bit of an outcome
So, I would say we certainly didn't put in any rebates in there
Our volume certainly wouldn't indicate that
But having said that, you got to remember we're playing at a higher end of the market
At the low-end of the market, I would tell you the value proposition is different from what I described
The value proposition at the low-end of the market really is where customers are more price-sensitive, and I think you see a different sort of equation there than you have with us
So, we're sticking to our strategy, we are – we continually reassess, we're going to move with agility and discipline, and that's how we're going to continue to drive forward, and there are consequences to that in the context of not just going for volume, candidly, if easy, right, but that's not the name of the game over the long-term
Sticking to our megatrends, and we're sticking to where we see this industry going over the long-term and so
Hopefully that helps
I would say, Rod, overall no, but we also acknowledge you've got a period of raw materials going up and then raw materials coming down
We announced our price increases, we were early in the market to do that, right up front
So you got a lot of moving parts right now, and that's why you can't look at this as sort of a snapshot in the quarter and use it to say that's indicative of everything that's going to happen going forward
As I said, the raw materials are coming
So, overall, I don't see what you're suggesting, but we – as you know, we look at this daily around the world to make sure we're sensing what's going on and taking the right steps as we deal with it
I think, Rod, I wouldn't do sort of an extension of that
I mean, when we look at our price/mix, and we typically don't break it out, as you know, but I think what that's indicative us – indicative of is our focus on mixing up our business, taking steps
We haven't talked a lot about EMEA, but in EMEA, we're taking steps to assess our position in that low-end of the market that's highly competitive with a lot of imports and we're continuing to mix that business up as well, and that's how we're thinking about driving price/mix and particularly mix in our business going forward
And so, I think that's some of that in the quarter as well, but I don't think that you should do the math as an extension like that to make that assumption
Well
First off, I'd say, our business OE or otherwise has been competitive, is competitive, will always be competitive and that's the environment we're working in and we assume that will continue
But, David, our approach to our OE business has really been strategically focused as well
We don't pursue just volume for volume sake in OE just like we don't in replacement and I would say that that approach has really served us very well and we do that really to find the balance in the partnerships to serve those OEMs to meet their needs and to get on the fitments that we can deliver them the technology they need and try to exceed their expectations
But also then have a business model that has the mix – the right mix in the pool
So we can get that first, second, and even third replacement and that strategy has been ultimately working
But as you know, OE productions, the fitments, demands, all that sort of thing changes from time to time and I think we're at one of those points right now
So you can't – I would suggest you can't take our OE business and again look at the performance in one quarter because it doesn't – it's not really indicative of what happens, you need to judge us over longer periods of time and I think as one of the charts we included in our material sort of indicates we are really pretty pleased with how our OE business is tracking, particularly in terms of mix with what's going on there
And in fact, maybe two other quick points – to Laura's point what we – when OE production changes happen, which they are, we are impacted maybe a little bit bigger because of that because of our share market with those OEMs. But I'd also point out, as I think many know that the shift is moving from sedans production coming out, retooling to bigger SUV, CUVs and light trucks and I would say that's a trend that bodes well for us
We like that
So we're seeing a little bit of that volatility right now, but I would say that, that's kind of due course and we're going to continue to try to create value for our OEMs and to create value for us going forward
And again, David, I'm sorry, I should have also mentioned
I think you'll see it in the script it's also a comp from last year
We had a – we outperformed the market significantly last year and you're just seeing that, that sort of rollover right now
Hi, Brett
Yeah
And Brett, you're talking about particularly our North America business
where we made that announcement
I suspect that's what you're ultimately referring to and I just say, I go back to what I said and what Laura said, it's the value of the products that we have
We have our input cost, we have the value proposition we're putting out in the marketplace
We put all that and analyze that together and ultimately that's the conclusion that we came to
Raw material costs are clearly a part of that as we go
Remember, we started out with the $1 billion – $1.1 billion, as Rod said, down to $750 million, but we want to point out $750 million is still a 19% year-over-year increase in raw material costs and it's still coming, again not to be repetitive, $42 million in the first quarter
It means the balance is ultimately coming in the remaining three quarters of the year
Hey, you're welcome, Brett
And again, we appreciate everyone tuning in today
Again, we're very pleased with the quarter
We've got a lot of work to do over the continuation of the year
But we're focused on our strategy
We are staying to what we said we were going to do and I think we're off to a great start and again appreciate everyone listening
