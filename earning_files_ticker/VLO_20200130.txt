Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation's Fourth
Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference
is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker
today, Homer Bhullar. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.

Homer Bhullar
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings
Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman,
our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO, Jason Fraser, our Executive
Vice President and General Counsel; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial
Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.

If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at
valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information
on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to
contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-
looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release.

In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the
company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements
intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors
that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our
filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that we had a good quarter,
delivering solid financial results. Our refineries operated well at 96% utilization, allowing us to take
advantage of wider sour crude oil differentials and weakness in high sulfur residual feedstocks. Overall,
2019 was a challenging environment for the refining business. We started the year with gasoline
inventories at record high and gasoline cracks at historic lows. We were also faced with narrow sour crude
oil differentials for most of the year, primarily due to sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, in addition to OPEC
and Canadian crude oil production curtailments. And differentials on inland sweet crude oils narrowed in
the second half of the year with the start-up of multiple new crude pipelines from the Permian Basin to the
Gulf Coast. Despite this challenging backdrop, our team demonstrated the strength of our assets and prior
investments to improve our feedstock and product flexibility, allowing us to deliver another year of steady
earnings and free cash flow. We demonstrated our crude supply flexibility by processing an annual record
of 1.4 million barrels per day of North American sweet crude oil as well as a record of approximately
180,000 barrels per day of Canadian heavy crude oil in 2019. We also achieved another milestone by
delivering the best ever year on employee safety performance and the lowest number of environmental
events in company history, demonstrating our strong commitment to safety, reliability and environmental
stewardship. We continue to invest in projects that enhance the flexibility and margin capability of our
portfolio. In 2019, we successfully started up the Houston Alkylation Unit and completed the Central Texas
pipeline and terminals project. And we have several growth projects that will be completed this year,
including the Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation unit and the Pembroke cogeneration unit. Looking
further out, the Diamond Pipeline expansion should be completed in 2021 and the Diamond Green Diesel
and the Port Arthur Coker projects are still on track to be completed in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

We also continue to explore growth opportunities in our renewable fuels business, which is already the
largest in North America. As we previously announced, the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture is in the

advanced engineering review phase for a new renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas facility. If
the project is approved, operations are expected to commence in 2024, which will result in Diamond Green
Diesel's renewable fuels production capacity increasing to over 1.1 billion gallons annually or over 70,000
barrels per day. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, a constant in our strategy for several
years, which prioritizes our investment-grade credit rating, sustaining investments and maintaining a
sustainable and growing dividend. We expect our annual CapEx for 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion,
which is consistent with our average annual spend over the last 6 years, with approximately $1 billion
allocated for high-return growth projects that are focused on market expansion and margin improvement
and the balance allocated to maintain safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations. And you
should continue to expect incremental discretionary cash flow to compete with other discretionary uses,
including organic growth investments, M&A and cash returns to our investors. Looking ahead, we have
a favorable outlook for refining margins with the IMO 2020 low sulfur fuel oil regulation, which just took
effect on January 1. High sulfur crude oils are expected to be more discounted due to lower demand as
less complex refineries switched to sweeter crude oils. Valero's complex refining system is well positioned
to take advantage of the discounted high sulfur crudes and fuel oils as feedstocks. And our growing
renewable diesel segment continues to generate strong results due to the high demand for renewable
fuels.

In closing, our incredible team's relentless focus on operational excellence, a steady pipeline of high-
return organic growth projects and a demonstrated commitment to shareholder returns should continue to
position Valero well. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you.

Homer Bhullar
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Joe. For the fourth quarter of 2019, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.1
billion or $2.58 per share compared to $952 million or $2.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $873 million or $2.13
per share compared to $932 million or $2.19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018. For 2019, net
income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.4 billion or $5.84 per share compared to $3.1 billion or
$7.29 per share in 2018. 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.4 billion
or $5.70 per share compared to $3.2 billion or $7.55 per share in 2018. The 2018 and 2019 adjusted
results exclude several items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. For
reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables. Operating income
for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the
fourth quarter of 2018. Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was in line
with the fourth quarter of 2018. Throughput capacity utilization was 96% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Refining cash operating expenses of $3.93 per barrel were in line with the fourth quarter of 2018. The
ethanol segment generated $36 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a
$27 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 was
primarily due to higher margins resulting from higher ethanol prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged
4.3 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019
compared to $101 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. After adjusting for the retroactive Blender's
Tax Credit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $187
million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $167 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase
in operating income was primarily due to higher sales volume. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged
844,000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 124,000 gallons per day versus the
fourth quarter of 2018. For the fourth quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $243
million and net interest expense was $119 million. General and administrative expenses for 2019 of $868
million were lower than 2018, mainly due to adjustments to our environmental liabilities in 2018. For the
fourth quarter of 2019, depreciation and amortization expense was $571 million and income tax expense
was $326 million. The effective tax rate was 20% for 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities was
$1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the unfavorable impact from the change in working
capital of $434 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash
provided by operating activities, excluding changing in its working capital, adjusted net cash provided by

operating activities was $1.9 billion. With regard to investing activities, we made $722 million of capital
investments in the fourth quarter of 2019, of which approximately $445 million was for sustaining the
business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. For 2019, we invested $2.7
billion, which includes all of Diamond Green Diesel's capital investments of $160 million. Excluding our
partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's capital investments, Valero's capital investments for 2019
were approximately $2.6 billion, with approximately $1 billion of the total for growing the business.

Moving to financing activities. We returned $591 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter. $369
million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 2.3 million shares of Valero common
stock. This brings our 2019 return to stockholders to $2.3 billion, and the total payout ratio to 47%
of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, we had approximately $1.5
billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a
9% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.98 per share or $3.92 per share annually, further
demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our investors. With respect to our balance sheet at
quarter end, total debt was $9.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion. Valero's debt
to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 26%. At the end of December, we had $5.3 billion of
available liquidity, excluding cash.

Turning to guidance. We continue to expect annual capital investments for 2020 to be approximately $2.5
billion with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth.
The $2.5 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. For
modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following
ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.63 million to 1.68 million barrels per day, U.S. mid-continent at 410,000
to 430,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 230,000 to 250,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic
at 470,000 to 490,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter
to be approximately $4.15 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.2 million
gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes
$0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to renewable
diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2020. Operating expenses in
2020 should be $0.50 per gallon which includes $0.20 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation
and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $113 million and total
depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $560 million. For 2020, we expect G&A
expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $860 million. The annual effective tax
rate is estimated at 22%.

Lastly, we expect RINs expense for the year to be between $300 million and $400 million. That concludes
our opening remarks.
Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of
limiting each turn in the Q&A to 2 questions. If you have more than 2 questions, please rejoin the queue
as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So first question, 2-part question. I was wondering if you could discuss in the fourth quarter, what
incremental actions Valero took in order to run more fuel oil as a feedstock across the portfolio? And how
much of that you're actually able to capture in the quarter? As well as why you think the high sulfur fuel
oil prices have started to strengthen here in the beginning of 2020?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

I'll start with -- in terms of how we maybe looked at our operating conditions and our operating envelope,
and then Gary can sort of finish up with the market. On the operating condition, we widened our window
-- our operating window to try to reach out and get more challenging high sulfur resid. We always --
we've, for years and years and years, really for decade, we've been somebody who buys a lot of high
sulfur resid on the run. But we opened as to market, we went out to look as we believe the idea was -- as
the market changed and try to conform or at least to the IMO 2020 that some of these high sulfur resids
would free up in the marketplace. And so we -- and we want to get the resid before it gets blended into
the high sulfur fuel oil market because of quality reasons. So that's really what we did. We reached out
and ran quite a few high sulfur resid that we have not historically ran.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So the second part of that in terms of, I guess would how much of it showed up in the fourth quarter.
We ran a lot of high sulfur resids, but we really didn't see the discounted barrels coming in until about
mid-December. So it didn't have a real significant impact on fourth quarter results, and you'll see that
more going forward. But in terms of high sulfur fuel oil getting more expensive, it's -- we're still in the
very early phase of what's a significant transition in our industry as we respond to the IMO bunker sulfur
spec change. And so with a change in the magnitude, you would expect it to create some volatility in the
markets and it will take some time for the markets to reach equilibrium. So we certainly see that there's
not a lot of liquidity in the physical fuel oil markets, we -- there's a lot more liquidity in the paper markets.
If you look at the forward curve, steeply backwardated and kind of showing fuel gets back to 60%, 65%
of Brent, which is kind of more where we think it will be. So our view really in respect to high sulfur fuel
oil and the crude oil quality discounts hasn't changed. As the markets normalize, we expect to see the
discount widen back out as the forward curve reflects. And as high sulfur fuel oil blend stocks have to
compete for space with heavy sour crudes and complex refining capacity like we have in the Gulf Coast.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay, got it. The second question, just on the capital allocation side of things. You continue to keep capital
spending flattish here in 2020, and you had a really healthy dividend increase that you just announced,
which looks pretty well covered by cash flow. So just curious how you're thinking about this increase in
the dividend? And is it just a shift from the dividend to the buyback and you're sticking with the same
constructs that you've had, 40% to 50% of cash flow? And obviously, the buyback will reduce the dividend
burden over time, but just curious how you're thinking about this today.

Donna M. Titzman
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

7

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

No, we haven't changed our policy, and it continues to be that we want to return 40% to 50% of the cash
flow from operations to the shareholders. The dividend increase is just a part of that payout. We don't
have anything particular in mind in regards to the dividend only payout. It's just part of the overall cash
return. You might see that dividend as a percentage of the total vary each year, as our cash flow varies,
but buybacks will continue to fill in the balance of that return.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from Crédit Suisse.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Joe, could you talk a little bit about the Gulf Coast operating results, you were almost up 75% on
operating income on the Gulf Coast. And the context I'm trying to understand this is like you have global
majors, one of which indicated that downstream earnings could be down 80% quarter-over-quarter.
Another one reported today, downstream earnings down 36%. How is Valero in an alternate universe
where you are so much better than others?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Manav, that's a really good question, and I'd love to give you an intelligent answer, but why don't I get
one of these guys to cover it here, Gary and Lane.

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

So Manav, I mean, first of all, we did see higher discounts, crude oil discounts and obviously the resid
discount in the fourth quarter. So if you're comparing third quarter to the fourth quarter, that's part of
the answer. The second part of the answer is, we got better naphtha netbacks because naphtha prices
improved over the quarter. And again, also it's butane, so butane -- when you compare fourth quarter
to third quarter, it is our ability to run cheaper butane or at least blend it, obviously, helped us with our
capture rates when compared to the third quarter.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

A quick follow-up on the renewable diesel and the expansion of targeted for late 2021. You guys have
indicated a normalized margin of only 125 versus 180 or something realized in this quarter without BTC.
But if you put the basic even 125, you could get like $250 million EBITDA on the base margin and then
about another $140 million. So you're looking at a return of like $390 million of EBITDA on this project. So
from your capital expenditure point of $550 million, it looks like a 2-year payback on this entire project?
Like is the math right or is something off here?

Martin Parrish
Senior Vice President of Alternative Energy & Project Development

We feel pretty good about it Manav. This is Martin Parrish. We still feel good about the pro forma guidance
of the $1.26 as it excludes the Blender's Tax Credit. So that puts you at $2.26 per gallon EBITDA. I think
that kind of checks out with what you're saying.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

So Manav, you're very close.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Joe, I got one on the market and one on Valero. Let's go with the Valero first. Maybe Donna wants to
take this. But Phil already asked about the 40%, 50% of your cash flow payout. I guess I'm more curious
on the mix with the dividend. I mean you were very early to get on this trend of returning a significant
amount of cash to shareholders, and it's paid -- pardon the pun, but it has paid dividends in both the
credibility of the business model as well as the relative performance of the stock. But why not more
dividends over buybacks? I'm just curious how you think about that?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Do you want to take a crack at it?

Donna M. Titzman
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So look, we have told -- we've explained to the market that we do consider that dividend to be part
of the nondiscretionary piece of our capital allocation. So when we look at that, we look at it in the context
of it being [effective] to the market with our peers and the market in general, but also, more importantly,
sustainable through market cycles. So again, we regularly review that with those objectives in mind.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Doug, what I would -- and Donna is exactly right. What I would add to what she said, you've got the
sustainability aspect in a down market cycle, which is something that we spend a lot of time looking at to
be sure that we don't find ourselves cutting the dividend. And you reinforce that by having a very strong
balance sheet. But if I think about it longer term, okay? And this is really where my brain goes, it goes to
the sustainability of the growth of the dividend going forward. And we want to continue to be able to grow.
We want to give our owners more every year. And the way that you go about doing that is tempering it
a little bit. I think we started talking last year about moderating the dividend a little bit more, which I
think you saw we did this year. And the other thing that's really encouraging from my perspective is that
we've got these capital projects that are coming on stream. They are providing significant future earnings
potential. And some of them are longer cash flow cycles, which we haven't done a lot over the last bunch
of years, but we got another renewable diesel plant, we've got the coker. And then if we end up doing the
Port Arthur renewable diesel plant in the future. These are huge EBITDA producing projects, which are
going to really reinforce our ability to go ahead and continue to deliver dividend growth going forward.
Now I'm not making you a promise because Lord only knows what might happen, but that would be our
objective. And that's kind of the way we look at investing our capital. The component part, the percentage
of the total payout that's made up of the dividend, that the dividend comprises that's not formulaic. It's
more us looking at all of the factors involved. And there's a lot of sausage-making that takes place there
that we won't get into here. But I always want to be in a position when we do something like this to let
you know that we feel fairly assured that this isn't going to be an issue going forward.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I appreciate the lengthy answer, guys. My follow-up, Joe, I don't know if you want to throw this to one of
the guys and may I also offer my congratulations to the new officers and titles in the team. But maybe
Lane wants to take this. But there's a lot of chatter about new capacity coming online at back end of this
year and maybe for the next couple of years. Obviously, things are kind of soft, it seems on the demand
side, given what's going on with China. But I'm just wondering how you see the prognosis for the short-
term IMO tailwinds transitioning maybe into a more challenging refining environment longer term? Are you
guys thinking about that? And I'll leave it there.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Thanks Doug.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So I think for at least for the next year to 2 years, we see global oil demand growth, kind of keeping
pace with the capacity additions, and we don't think we have favorable balances between production and
consumption. But then yes, we start to show 2 to 3 years out, that capacity additions start to outpace
global oil demand growth. And at that time, we would expect to see some rationalization in the industry.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So the next couple of years, you're not concerned about -- I mean, obviously, Aramco has got a bunch of
stuff coming online, and then Asia kicks up '21, '22, so you're not concerned about the short term -- kind
of medium-term outlook then?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

No, we still show that oil demand growth outpaces capacity addition for the short term.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho.

Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

If I could have a follow-up on that -- Joe, you ran higher than we expected in every region. Could you
talk about them, and that's obviously versus your guidance. Could you talk about the pattern of higher
volume? I don't know if there's a volume mass issue there. But certainly, your capture suggests that's
not the right direction to be looking in. And furthermore, once you've hopefully help us explain how come
you're running at the levels that you are right across the system, could you -- and this is a follow-up
to the previous question. Could you talk about any expectations you have for shutdowns in refining, if
margins stay extremely weak and potentially get worse with this whole situation in China?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Okay. So Paul, we'll look -- we're kind of looking at each other, let us give -- take a crack at this and then
we'll give you the opportunity, if we're not answering your question to follow-up, okay.

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Paul, this is Lane, I'll start. We've had a long strategy really dating back to 2011 to work in a very
organized way on our reliability projects and what we've seen is our refining system has gone from,
say, 95% to 96% availability all the way up to sort of over 97% availability, and that's helped us. We're
available when the market is right and have been able to perform better. And in addition to that, we do
believe that we're the best in the industry in terms of understanding what feedstocks go where in the
systems that we're in and we're highly adaptable to that. So I think that helps us versus some other
people in terms of our capture rates, so...

Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Lane, could you just dig in a little bit on that better than anyone else argument because to an extent, I
guess, the computer programs commoditized or not? If you could just go a bit down that rabbit hole, I
would be grateful.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

President & COO

It's interesting, you would say they're commoditized because everybody has tools. Everybody believes
that they're all implementing these tools and to some degree or another. I would say that I believe we
are more integrated and more aligned on making sure that our tools characterize the feeds, and we
understand our units very well. It's one thing to have the tool. Sometimes people have tools, but they
don't use the tools. We have a world-class planning and economics group and they do a fantastic job
coordinating with our refineries in terms of having those sub models very well understood. And therefore,
we understand the operating envelopes and how those feedstocks are characterized in our systems.

Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes. I mean, I guess, further to a previous, previous question, we've seeing big [ mega-royals ] you
would think have a similar structure in terms of their refining footprint to you guys wildly underperforming
against what you guys are achieving. So it's just interesting to try and establish what the competitive
advantage is.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Well, we appreciate on that, Paul, and then the follow-up question was on capacity.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So I think the situation in the Far East is just developing. And it's really too early for us to be able to
judge the magnitude of the impact that's going to have and whether it leads to refinery shutting down or
not.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

The reality of it is, we've got capacity coming on stream. We've also got capacity that isn't running well
and that in the foreseeable future, probably won't be able to run well. And so -- and Paul, if you assume at
some point, it's a zero-sum game. There's going to be a lot of capacity that shouldn't run. Certainly, post
IMO world, it's going to have an effect on that. And so if you got poorly performing assets today, turning
them around is a lengthy process. And then if you've got a marginal asset due to economics, you're going
to be the guy that has to bow out at some point in time. So that's why we look at it, I mean, frankly, our
tendency is to focus a whole lot more on our business and what we can do to make it better and more
efficient than kind of what's happening more broadly.

Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes. Got it. If I could just ask a very specific follow-up. If we assume that there was extreme weakness in
jet fuel demand, what would that mean for you and the global industry? And I'll leave it there.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Our jet yield is about 8%. So we make 200,000, 250,000 barrels a day of jet. Some of that is contract
demand and inland demand, which is going to stay, but a lot of it in our Gulf Coast refineries, we have the
ability to put that into diesel if jet demand got soft, and I suspect that's what would happen.

Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

I know you just said you focus on your own business and not the market, but I have a market question to
start. So...

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

I didn't say we don't focus on the market.

Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC

So a lot of attention is being paid to this collapse in diesel cracks. Part of the reason that the drop has
been so pronounced just because the peak that it started from was so high. And at the time, when we
were at that peak, it seemed obvious why, but in retrospect, IMO is having more of a feedstock effect than
a product effect. So do you have any updated thoughts about that period just 3 months ago when diesel
cracks were peaking in retrospect. What was really driving that? And maybe that will help inform how we
can escape this headwind in the intermediate term?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, Sam. So I think as we got to the back half of the fourth quarter, obviously, fall turnaround season
winded down and we started to see refinery utilization ramp up and with higher refinery utilization,
of course, distillate production increased. And then overall, demand has been weaker than what we
anticipated. So a lot of that's been due to warmer weather. The warmer weather has somewhat offset a
lot of the demand increase, we thought we would get as a result of IMO. In addition to that, certainly,
in the U.S. Gulf Coast, we've had a very heavy fog which has limited our ability to export the diesel to
some of the export markets. In addition to that, we've had very high freight rates, which again, hinder our
ability to export. Of course, South America is a big export market for us. They've had a lot of rain in South
America, which has delayed the harvest. So again, having a hit to demand. And then I think the final thing
is there was a lot of prestocking of very low sulfur fuel oil that happened in the industry. And so, so far,
it's muted the impact that IMO will have. We certainly are confident that, that demand will show up, but it
may be more of a second quarter type demand increase than what we're seeing so far in the first quarter.

Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And my follow-up is on renewable diesel. It's been said on this call already, the economics are really
strong, it scales very accretively. On the feedstock side, are there any constraints as you imagine this
business getting bigger. There was another operator in the business who recently pivoted a little bit on the
feedstock side and said, tightening was possible in the future. Do you see any of that? Or is your -- does
the strength of your partnership with Darling kind of help you avoid that friction.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Well, definitely, the strength of our partnership with Darling helps us. They process 10% of the world's
meat byproducts. So we're in a unique position with the JV we have. This feedstock is tied to GDP growth
per capita and that's growing in the world. So it's going to tighten up some, but we still feel good about
being able to source it, and we don't see that as a constraint with what we've talked about so far.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I think that the first one is probably either for Lane or Gary. You guys historically run the M100, I suppose
that directly through the crude unit. Have you tested or whether that you will be -- have the configuration

12

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

to run the high sulfur fuel directly through the coker and that if you do that, how big is that capacity you
may be able to do here? And also whether you have export any low sulfur VGO in the fourth quarter?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Paul, this is Lane. I'll start and Gary can round me out. As you have alluded to, we have a history running
M100, but not all M100s are created equal. There's varying quality. We had a what we would consider to
be a quality window that we've historically ran. We've widened that. We do run that. We run those types of
long resids. They obviously have a little bit of cutter stock, and we typically run them in our crude supply.
And so as we raise the percentages of them, you think about, well, what we're doing as we're running
those to fill, to destroy the resid and obviously it makes -- builds out at the bottom of the refinery. And
then we're running light sweet crude as a supplement to that because that's been an advantage crude
really for the past year. So it's really, over time, we were optimizing by looking at all the domestic light
sweet with these resids opening the call -- the operating envelope for all the resids that we can find in the
world. And then we are constantly optimizing that versus the heavy sour crude availability. And that's kind
of how we always run. We've just -- we've worked really hard to characterize some of these that are new
to the market and are trying to run more of them. So what was your second question.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

No. I mean, the first one, have you exported any low sulfur VGO.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So our economic signals have been to pull low sulfur VGO out of the cat crackers, and we did sell
quite a bit of it in the fourth quarter. And so far in the first quarter, we're seeing the same economic
signals.

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

In addition to that, we're -- so Paul, in addition to that, we're also exporting a lot of low sulfur ATV that we
normally run in our [ FECs ] as well.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

What kind of economic and how much you have export? I mean is that part of the reason why your margin
has been perhaps the better than people thought?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Yes. I mean we were selling those, particularly low sulfur ATVs and some of the other hydro process
resids, quite a bit above -- quite a bit above what they historically been worth.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Yes. And is there a volume that you can share? Is it, say, 50,000 barrel per day or 100,000 barrel per day.
Any kind of rough number?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

No, we probably don't really want to share that.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Okay. Final one, you run 180,000 barrel per day of the WCS. Is there any more room that you would be
able to expand that?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, there is. So we have -- we primarily run the Canadian at Port Arthur in Texas City. We can also take it
to St. Charles, and we have plenty of capacity to run more Canadian.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

How about supply? Can you get it there?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, we can. So today, a lot of the problem is certainly pipelines coming out of Western Canada are full,
but we buy off the pipeline, and we also continue to take volume by rail. So I think in the fourth quarter,
we did a little below 38,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian by rail. We're seeing those volumes ramp up
in the first quarter and expect them to ramp up even more in the second quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Let me add my congratulations to Lane and Gary here on the promotions. I guess, my first question is, we
spend a lot more time than we ever have with investors on the issue of sustainability of carbon intensity.
And it's really the "E" side of the ESG. And Joe, maybe you could just talk high level how you think about
Valero's framework for talking to investors about ESG and carbon intensity. Do you feel like you're there
where you want to be on carbon targets and disclosure and then I would think the renewable diesel
business becomes a big part of the narrative of how you respond to any difference that might emerge
around.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Neil, that's a really good question. And you are right, we do spend a lot of time on this. And frankly,
I think Valero's got a great story. Jason is responsible. He and John are jointly responsible for our efforts
around this. And we made a lot of progress. And I'll let those 2 guys speak to this in some detail.

Jason W. Fraser
Executive VP & General Counsel

Yes, this is Jason. Neil, I'll be glad to talk to you a little bit about it. And as you -- the point you made
about strategy is of course correct. 2 of our 3 segments are now renewable. We're largest renewable
diesel producer in the U.S. through DGD, second largest producer of ethanol and we continue to look at
that area and expand it as we've discussed. And we're also looking at other low carbon fuels and ways
to lower our carbon intensity in our existing business. So just as a business footprint, I think, we've
been evolving to -- as the market expectations have changed. I think we've done a good job on that
side. And on the environment side, we're very mindful about environmental impact. We've always been
proud of our record. In 2019, we had our best ever performance on our environmental scorecard event.
It is the lowest number we've ever had and safety has always been a big focus of ours. In 2019, our
refining employee injury rate was our best ever, and the combined employee contractor rate was of second
lowest in company history. We think we have a good governance structure. 10 of our 11 directors are
independent. We have substantial diversity is something we're always working on. We have really good
risk oversight and risk management within our governance structure. And then on the disclosure area,

14

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

which is one of the things you asked about, we've definitely beefed it up here in the last couple of years
as we put more focus on the ES&G area. In September 2018, we published our report on climate-related
risks and opportunities. And we prepared that in alignment with the TCFD recommendations, which seems
to be more and more -- our investors seem to be coalescent around that as being the standard they want.
There are a lot of competing regimes out there. Just good to see some standardization kind of come into
play. And they were also putting out a stewardship and responsibility report annually, where we talk about
-- some about the carbon stuff, but also about other sustainability oriented areas, and we're continuing to
work on that every year to try to make it better. And I know there's been some large investors, focusing
on SaaS as being maybe the standard. And once again, outside of carbon, there's been a lot of variability
in different disclosure structures and what people may want. So we're taking a hard look at SaaS this year
and comparing to what we're doing to see if we need to tweak some things there. We are always looking
to improve.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Right. Appreciate it. And then the follow-up question actually relates to RINs, which I know is collectively
our least favorite topic. But there were some headlines recently around the court cases around RINs
inceptions and a small waiver. The waivers for some of the smaller refiners from a couple of years ago. Do
you see any risk that this becomes an issue that could put upward price pressure on RINs again?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Go ahead.

Jason W. Fraser
Executive VP & General Counsel

Okay. Yes, this is Jason, again. We did see that Tenth Circuit case out of Denver last week. And what it did
was vacated SREs for 3 refineries, 2 of HollyFrontier's and 1 of CVR's. And the EPA has several options,
including appeal, expect they will probably will appeal, like neither appeal and have the Tenth Circuit that
-- hear the case as a whole or go straight to the Supreme Court, and we know they're evaluating their
options to see. So court took a reading of the statute in a fairly constrained view that as far as I know, has
been done by court in the past and it's definitely not in keeping with the view the EPA has had. The way
they've interpreted the statutes in the past. So we really have to see what the EPA does with it to get an
idea of how impactful this is. One important point is because it was at the Tenth Circuit instead of the DC
Circuit, which is a decision that plaintiffs made and when they filed it, it's only has legal effect within the
Tenth Circuit. So it only by the EPA within those 6 states that are covered by the Tenth Circuit. So let's see
how it evolves.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes, we'll see how it plays out. I think, it's probably too early to give a market signal on RINs prices as a
result of this case really.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Joe, I'd like to touch on your comments earlier about Permian pipes to Gulf Coast and narrowing of inland
diffs. And as far as developments at Corpus Christi goes, there's been continued discussion on potential
dock constraints in the area. And based on one of your competitors' releases yesterday, it seems that one
of the bigger dock projects that may be delayed a bit. What is your current outlook on the possibility that
we might have a glut of crude at Corpus, which I'm sure would benefit your facilities there. And if there

15

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

are indeed dock constraints, would this affect MEH first since there's no public corporate price and then
affect Midland if things really get backed up? Or how should we think about that?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Theresa, it's a good question. Gary is close to this. Let him talk about it for a minute.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So we're -- when we look at this, it looks like the -- that there will be plenty of dock capacity
available, but there are some periods of time where it could get very tight. And so our focus really has
been to make sure that we're connected to all of these lines coming out of the Permian, and we can take
barrels to Corpus or Three Rivers. And then we've also put effort into expanding our dock capacity from
our Corpus Christi refinery. So part of that project is completed. By early second quarter, we'll have that
project 100% completed and essentially double our export capacity that we'll be able to put through our
system. The second part of your question, yes, I would expect it to really affect the MEH posting first. And
then yes, it will probably work its way back into the Permian as time goes on.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And switching gears a bit. So the natural gas pricing outlook seems pretty depressed. Can you talk
about how much of a tailwind this could be for your business this year?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Well, this is Lane. So obviously, energy is a big part of the cost structure in our business. And it's been
depressed for a while. So it's -- obviously, it works not only to our advantage, but really the industry's
advantage to compete in the world. I mean natural gas is how we run these refineries largely. And it's a
big advantage for U.S. refining in general.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes, really all industrial activity.

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Yes, really all industrial activity.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley.

Benny Wong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just kind of want to follow-up on Paul's question around the Canadian barrels. There's more talk up north
about building diluent recovery units. Just wanted to get your perspective on that, if that's kind of a viable
path for more Canadian barrels to reach the U.S. Gulf Coast. And just curious, have you kind of tested any
of these unblended bitumen in your facilities? And if they're really the more desirable type of feedstock,
that's what's been touted as.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

So this is Gary. And yes, we took bitumen directly from Western Canada and ran it at our refinery at St.
Charles and have ongoing discussions with several producers. You can just move a lot more by rail if you

take the undiluted barrel and it would fit well into our system, and we have plenty of capacity to be able to
run it.

Benny Wong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I appreciate that. And my follow-up is more on the RFS program and maybe Jason can chime in on this.
There seems to be more focus in D.C. about what that program will look like after it sunsets in 2020? And
it seems like the start of setting a higher octane gasoline standard is alive again. Just wanted to get your
thoughts on that? And if there is really a path for at this time? Or -- and I guess, how you think about that
program beyond 2022.

Jason W. Fraser
Executive VP & General Counsel

Sure. Yes. And this is Jason. And you're right, the tables that set the volumes expire in 2020. The program
falls back into the hands of the EPA to set the volumes using certain standards as a guide and it's still
open. They hadn't signaled a lot about what they're going to do, but we would like the higher octane
fuels to be part of the solution. We think that's a great answer. It's great for the autos, it enables them
to meet their CAFE, it's great for us. It keeps internal combustion engine more viable in this lower carbon
world and more of a vibrant competitor. And it is great for the ethanol guys because they're a good choice
of low-cost octane. So really, it's a win, win, win solution and we would like to see get traction. And we
definitely are talking it up. We think it's a great solution for the country.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Lot of the good stuff has already been hit here, but maybe just to dig in a little bit more on sort of the,
let's call it, the North American performance versus the global performance. And you've mentioned
some benefits from naphtha, some benefits from natural gas and from butane. There were also in the
last couple of months, issues with tanker rates and things like that. So as those events, let's call it,
normalized or in this business where everybody takes advantage of them pretty quickly, we [ give ] away
those advantages. What looks more sustainable for you here in the next few months versus what looks
transitory, not just worried so much or thinking, hey, we're going to go to summer-grade gasoline, which
has its own benefits, just curious there what you're seeing?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, I think overall, as long as the U.S. production is having to clear to the export markets despite where
freight rates go, we'll see good advantage running domestic light sweet crude in many of our assets. We
also see that running the heavy sour and the high sulfur fuel oil blend stocks into our high complexity
assets looks to be very favorable for the foreseeable future as well as a result of the IMO bunker spec
change. Outside of that, I don't know what else I would add.

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Roger, it is Lane. I just wanted to add one thing. I think what you're really seeing is, as we alluded to,
we're marketing low sulfur VGO and low sulfur ATB into the low sulfur fuel oil market. And then what that
does is that really is constructed for FCC -- for gasoline because FCC are going to be cut. I mean we've
sort of talked about it over the past -- really for the last 2 years, when we were talking about IMO, and
that part of it is certainly playing out. I mean you'll see as the gasoline season rolls in, you'll get a --
essentially, that market is going to have to compete for feed into the gasoline market. So it should be
supportive of both really sort of both gasoline and diesel.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And then maybe back to Theresa's question about natural gas. Obviously,
cash OpEx guidance of over 4% is kind of higher than what we've seen over the last few years. And I
know there's been some changes in the consolidation of VLP and all that. But I was just curious, is that
something that can be a help on the OpEx side that we should see? Or are there other things moving
around here they're going to keep OpEx on the upper end?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Roger, if you look at -- Lane again, if you compare our guidance to last -- basically first quarter '20 to first
quarter '19, it's pretty much flat. That's sort of our large turnaround time frame. And so I would just sort
of say that's flat year-over-year. But when you look at the longer term, certainly we've had realignment
reporting structures. We moved the renewable in the Diamond Green Diesel out, and we've taken all the
MLP stuff, which would have been in our sort of cost of goods, and it came into our OpEx. And so as we
realigned all that stuff, it sort of resulted in a little bit -- in terms of our OpEx a little bit higher. And then
overall, there are -- obviously, there's some inflationary pressures in the world. When you -- again, when
you compare our overall cash OpEx performance on sort of what we would call a solvent basis, we are by
far in the first quarter, so which means we are the pacesetters in the industry when it comes to cost.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

A question maybe for Lane on throughput. So this quarter, there was almost 1.7 million barrels a day in
sweet. I think you guys have quoted that capacity historically is more like 1.6%. So is there something
that's changed? Is that something that running the resid is allowing you to do? And then how should we
think about that going forward with some of the diffs like Maya widening out?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

So what you're, I kind of touched on it a little bit earlier, as we're running more and more resid, the resid
doesn't really have that much light-end components. So as it substitutes and sort of moves out either
heavy or really -- the real thing that we're backing out, if you look at year-over-year is medium sour. So
what's happening is we're running more and more light sweet, which -- and what that's doing is sort of it's
substituting for medium sour which does have some light into it. So that's a journey we're on. We've been
signaling max light sweet crude and max heavy, and we optimize between heavy sour crudes and resid.
And so we'll -- and I don't know that we can go a whole lot higher, but we'll just see quarter-to-quarter
and see how much higher we can go.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then, Joe, in your prepared comments, you were talking about sort of the different things
competing for capital, and you mentioned M&A as you have in the past. I know you haven't done a whole
bunch recently. You've done some ethanol deals and the terminals acquisition. I guess, can you just put
any meat on that in terms of what you would potentially be interested in on the M&A front?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes, why don't we let Rich talk about that?

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Sure. This is Rich. So yes, we continue to look at the opportunities as they arrive, as they arise. A lot of
this stuff tends to be in niche markets. And we're focused on the Gulf Coast and just haven't seen a lot of
things arise there. That's where we would capture the synergies and where we would have the advantage.
So I mean we look at everything as it comes up, but we don't see any opportunities that compete against
the pipeline of organic projects that we have.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

So nothing major in those enterprises. Yes, that's right.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I'd like to ask a question about the ethanol and renewable diesel segment. It looks like the indicators have
fallen quite a bit from 4Q to year-to-date. And I'm just wondering what's going on in those 2 markets?
And how you see that evolving throughout the course of the year? And I have a follow-up.

Martin Parrish
Senior Vice President of Alternative Energy & Project Development

Okay. This is Martin. On the renewable diesel, the indicator drops because the -- you have the blenders
tax credit in place now. So we gave up a little bit on the RIN, feedstock costs got a little higher, but you
need to add $1 a gallon to that indicator to get really where market is. So again, we're $1.26 pro forma,
but that's really a $2.26 EBITDA per gallon. So that one is not concerning at all. Fourth quarter ethanol
was, what, $0.14 a gallon EBITDA was our performance, that's come in, and you're correct there. January
is always tough in the business. I mean domestic gasoline demand is low, ethanol inventories always build
in January. Really what's happened in the ethanol space, we've been oversupplied in the U.S. for several
years. Exports were growing at 30% CAGR, up through '18, '19. They took a breather, and that was really
due to low sugar prices in the world. So Brazil made more ethanol. Right now though sugar prices are up
20% versus where they averaged 2019 and export demand is strong. We're seeing really good numbers
in December, January, February and March. So we still -- ethanol is in the fuel mix to stay in the U.S.
Little bit of incremental E15 and then hopefully, this higher octane standard would really help the industry,
obviously. So we're still optimistic about the future.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I appreciate those thoughts. And then if I could just go back to running resid, high sulfur fuel oil. Can you
just put some numbers around or discuss how much of that -- those intermediates you're running and
backing out crude as a result? And how much of that is incremental feedstocks? And in addition to that,
are there any type of indicative economics that you could give on running those barrels. I understand
there's a lot of moving parts, but are we talking low single-digit dollar per barrel, high single-digit dollar
per barrel in the double-digit range? Just to give us a sense of what the uptick is.

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

So this is Lane. We're not going to share our detailed volumes in terms of how we do all that. And
obviously, the relative margins are all a function of what the market is. They're not fixed off one another.
There is a dynamic market out there. There's a function of the crude market, the high sulfur fuel oil
market, the low sulfur fuel oil market, the latter 2 of which are still trying to sort themselves out with
respect to IMO 2020. So these things vary just like any other feedstock that we run. There's not a
guaranteed margin relative to one another. And the -- as all the refining capacity looks at all this and
optimizes, then if they -- the margins are going to be different over time. So there's nothing that -- there's
not anything we can communicate that you can hang your hat on, per se.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering and Holt.

Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to check in on asphalt and pet coke. I know it's only about 3% of your product slate, but how
has pricing and realizations fared on these areas, just given all the volatility on high sulfur fuel oil and the
recent weakness?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So this is Gary. I think, overall, we've been surprised that asphalt margins have stayed relatively
strong. We thought that there may be an attempt to push a lot of these high sulfur resids into the asphalt
market, and you would see weakness. But thus far, asphalt margins in our system have remained strong.
And I wouldn't say we've seen much of an impact at all on pet coke.

Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

Sounds good. And then the sales volumes in renewable diesel were quite strong in the fourth quarter. Just
wanted to confirm, was that a result of selling down some inventory? Or did the plant actually run at those
levels?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

We ran at those levels.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies.

Christopher Paul Sighinolfi
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to follow-up on Neil's earlier sustainability question, if I could. And I just have 2 quick questions.
I guess, first, Joe, have you looked at CCUS investment to capture incremental carbon off the facilities? I
know some of your integrated peers are working on that specifically on ethanol facilities to use in some of
their EOR operations. So I'm just wondering if it's something you looked at and what the opportunity set
might be?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

We are looking at it. Yes. And Martin and Rich are -- they got a team put together, and we're kind
of down the road on this. I think -- I guess, the real question that we're trying to -- we always are
wondering about what's the cost of carbon are going to be, what are the economics going to look like on
an investment in a project like this. So we are looking at it, though.

Christopher Paul Sighinolfi
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess, second, in light of the BTC extension DGD JV has clearly become more valuable
as noted, it's a key pillar in your environmental sustainability story, which is clearly set apart from your
refining peers. But, Joe, I'm just curious, do you think you get appropriate credit for that and the ethanol
franchise within Valero? And I guess, what are any thoughts or internal evaluation about if or when those
businesses might make more sense being independent?

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, those are 2 very different questions. One is, do we think it matters from an ES&G perspective,
and I think it definitely does. We have a very clear view of what -- where things are going and what
the world is demanding now. And we really believe renewable fuel is a key component of that. And the
good news is that they both happen to be great businesses, and we've got great assets and good teams
running them. So I think as time goes on, people will see that Valero is somewhat differentiated perhaps
from others out there because of these investments. As far as separating them off, my view is they are
producers of motor fuels and different types of motor fuels, very low carbon intensity motor fuels, but
they're motor fuels, and Valero produces motor fuels. That's what our business is, and we do it really well.
And these are largely process operations and they integrate well. Processes that we've implemented on
the refining side are scalable to our ethanol plants and to the renewable diesel operations. And so I think,
frankly, being embedded in the company, it brings more value to Valero than it would to split it out.

Operator

At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Homer Bhullar for
closing remarks.

Homer Bhullar
Vice President of Investor Relations

Great. Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions,
please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now
disconnect.
