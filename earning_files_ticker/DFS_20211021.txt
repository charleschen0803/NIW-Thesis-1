Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon. My name is Ashley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would
like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Eric Edmund Wasserstrom
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our
earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website,
investorrelations.discover.com.

Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding
forward-looking statements that appear in our third quarter earnings press release and presentation.

Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial
Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions]

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had another period of strong
financial results in the third quarter with earnings of $1.1 billion after tax or $3.54 per share. In many
respects, these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated digital banking and payments model,
which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to
consumers and merchants and differentiating our brand.

These advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology and analytics
while generating substantial capital. In an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying
competition, we believe the strengths of our model position us to accelerate our growth.

Underlying our results this quarter were 3 important advancements. The first was our return to year-
over-year receivables growth, which is driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing and
continued strong sales trends. Total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all
categories. Even travel sales increased. And while they dropped a bit in August due to concerns related to
the Delta variant, travel has steadily improved since then.

We also continue to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing
investment to take advantage of this. While the competitive environment has intensified, new accounts
are now up 17% over 2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition. This value proposition
remains anchored in our industry-leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees and useful in
transparent rewards.

While some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings at substantial cost, our rewards costs
were up only 6 basis points year-over-year and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer
spending as evidenced in our strong discount revenue. Given these dynamics, we will continue investing
in new accounts as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and a robust account growth
and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports our view of stronger receivables
growth in 2022.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

The second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong. Our disciplined approach to credit
management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge-off rate and continued
low delinquencies. The delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's
levels for the full year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter.

And third is the continued expansion of our payments business. PULSE saw a meaningful increase in debit
volume with 9% growth year-over-year and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating
both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit use through the pandemic. Our diners business
has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12% from the
prior year. As the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our
international reach.

In summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive, and our integrated digital banking and
payments model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital generative. I
continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects
of our financial results in more detail.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you Roger, and good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong
execution and the continued economic recovery.

Looking at our financial summary results on Page 4, there are 3 key things I want to call out. First, our
total revenue net of interest expense is up 8% from the prior year, excluding a $167 million unrealized
loss due to market adjustments on our equity investments. Including this, revenue was up 2% for the
quarter. Second is a continuation of very strong credit performance. Net charge-offs were down $343
million from the prior year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter. Lastly, we
continue investing for growth with increased marketing spend. Higher operating expenses in other areas
were largely related to the economic recovery. I'll go over the details of our quarterly results and our full
year outlook on the following slides.

Looking at loan growth on Slide 5. We saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up 1% over
the prior year and up 2% sequentially. Card loans were the primary driver and were also up 1% year-
over-year and 2% over the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in card receivables was driven by
strong sales volume and robust account acquisitions.

Sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, new
accounts were up 27% from the prior year and up 17% over 2019 levels. The contribution from these
factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high payment rates as household savings and cash flows remain
elevated. The payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre-pandemic levels. We anticipate
that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal COVID support programs have ended and
consumer savings rates have started to decrease. That said, we expect payment rates to remain above
historical levels through 2022.

Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with
originations up 7% as most schools have returned to the normal in-person learning model. Personal loans
decreased 4%, driven by high payment rates. Our underwriting criteria have returned to pre-pandemic
levels, and we expect a return to growth in this product in future periods.

Moving to Slide 6. Net interest margin was 10.8%, up 61 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis
points from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the increase in net interest margin was
primarily driven by lower interest charge-offs and lower funding costs. This was partially offset by a higher
mix of promo rate balances.

Card loan yield was up 1 basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased
promotional balance mix. Yield on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially due to lower
pricing. The margin continued to benefit from lower funding costs, primarily driven by maturities of higher
rate CDs and an increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The quarter-
over-quarter decline was largely driven by consumer CDs. We also saw a slight decline in savings and
money market deposits as consumers continued to spend excess levels of liquidity.

We also continue to optimize our funding stack. Late in September, we executed our first ABS issuance
since October 2019, consisting of $1.2 billion security with a 3-year fixed rate coupon of 58 basis points
and a 5-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of 103 basis points. These were our lowest ABS
coupons ever and show good execution and timing by our treasury team.

Looking at revenue on Slide 7. Total noninterest income increased $90 million or 20% over the prior year,
excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments. Net discount and interchange revenue was up $61
million or 26%, driven by strong sales volume. This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to
high sales in the 5% category, which were restaurants and PayPal, both this year and last. We continue to
benefit from strong sales through our partnership with PayPal while restaurant sales were up 62% year-
over-year as dining activity recovered. Loan fee income was up $21 million or 21%, primarily driven by
lower late fee charge-offs and higher nonsufficient funds and cash advance fees..

Looking at Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year. The
details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating costs. Employee
compensation increased $12 million, driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year. Excluding
bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from the prior year from lower headcount.

Marketing expense increased $70 million, supporting another quarter of strong new account growth. Other
expense included a $50 million legal accrual. Professional fees were up $47 million, primarily due to higher
recovery fees. Courts reopening, combined with strong credit and economic conditions, have driven an
increase in recoveries and their associated fees. Year-to-date, recoveries were up 20% compared to the
prior year. The benefits of these costs is reflected in lower credit losses.

Moving to Slide 9. The trend of sustained strong credit performance continued. Total net charge-offs were
a record low at 1.46%, down 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially. Total net
charge-off dollars decreased $343 million from the prior year and were down $131 million quarter-over-
quarter. Credit performance was strong across all products as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on
card, private student loans and personal loans.

Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $165 million from the
reserves, and our reserve rate dropped 35 basis points to 7.7%. The reserve release reflects continued
strong credit performance and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of these was
partially offset by a 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter. Our economic assumptions include
an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and GDP growth of just over 6%. These
assumptions were slightly less positive than those used in the second quarter but still reflect a strong
economic outlook.

Looking at Slide 11. Our Common Equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target.
We repurchased $815 million of common stock and, as we had previously announced, increased our
dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share. These actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to
our shareholders. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goals of having deposits to be
70% to 80% of our funding mix. Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62% in the prior
year.

Wrapping up on Slide 12. Our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution
against our financial and strategic objectives. In summary, we remain well positioned for profitable
growth from improving loan trends. Credit performance trends remained favorable, reflecting positive
macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management. Investments for
growth have supported a significant increase in new accounts while we've contained operating expenses.
Lastly, our integrated digital banking and payments model is highly capital generative, allowing us to
invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on
our conference call in January.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Ashley, to open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I want to see if you can give us a little more color on your payment rate expectations. I know you're
expecting to remain elevated through 2022. But I just wanted to see if you're going to see signs of
accounts that typically revolve, start to see some declines in payment rates there? And then I guess, how
material of an inflection you think we can see through 2022? Or do you think that's not likely until '23?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Great. All right. Thanks for the question. So the payment rate has been persistently high. And what we
did see in the month of September was that ticked down mildly. It did increase from July to August, which
was, frankly, a bit of a surprise. But as I look at the data we're seeing here in terms of revolve and the
forecasted trends, my expectation is that in the fourth quarter, it will continue to step down. Some of
that has to do with government support programs ending in September, and some of it has to do with the
holiday season.

And then as we look on the holiday season into 2022, I do expect that it will continue to step towards
a normalized rate. But frankly, I don't think that will happen until 2023. So how do we think about the
implications from that? Certainly, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth. But what we've seen
is really strong account acquisition and strong sales, which to date has helped offset some of that payment
rate impact. So overall, we feel very, very comfortable that the balance of '21 and then '22 will have a bit
of tailwind related to both payment rates declining and then strong execution from the new accounts and
sales growth.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then on the account acquisition front, I know you indicated that you expect marketing
costs to be higher in the second half. So if you can give us a little bit more detail around the expectation
there and how they could trend for the fourth quarter? And then does that imply that you could see some
continued upside pressure into 2022 on marketing as you drive account acquisition in light of pressured
payment rates?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Yes. So from a marketing standpoint, we spend the money as we see opportunity to drive profitable
new accounts. And frankly, we've had a great quarter and a great year with that. The third quarter spend
actually came in mildly lower than what we originally anticipated. And the guidance I had provided on the
last call was that we would approximate the 2019 levels for marketing expense. I think it will be a little
bit under that -- a bit under that, largely not because of opportunities, but basically kind of some process-
oriented stuff in terms of account targeting. So we feel like the money we will spend in the fourth quarter
will certainly generate positive new account growth. It will tick up from the third quarter certainly and
provide us a good trajectory for 2022.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Roger, you talked about intense competition and the impact of new entrants. Can you maybe just expand
on those points about what you're seeing competitively? How you think Discover is positioned for it? And
where do you believe this is having the biggest impact on your business? And how are you responding for
it?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Thanks for the question. I think my actual comment was good growth in the face of intense
competition, and I think it really sums it up well. The competition in the card business is always intense.
We were lucky enough to have a lapse in 2020, and so we saw extraordinarily good cost per account,
but it's what we're used to facing. It will vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have
more of a desire for growth -- for growth than others. But I think our focus on a clear differentiated value
proposition has resulted in continued strong generation of new accounts, and I'm excited about what I
see.

In terms of the new entrants, we see that less in the core credit card space, but I would say very, very
aggressive competition around personal loans. And that's an area where we focus on the long term,
remain disciplined in our underwriting and what we're willing to invest in new accounts and are used to
seeing competitors come and go.

Ryan Matthew Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And if I could ask a follow-up question to the question John asked prior. So, John, in terms of
marketing, the level you'd be hitting in the fourth quarter as it steps up a little bit, should we think about
that as a go-forward run rate? Or are there more investments that needed to be made? And then second,
there was comments about BT's increasing and -- as it relates to marketing. Can you maybe just help
us understand where are we today versus pre-pandemic levels? And what is the strategy to continue to
increase balance transfer activity on a go-forward basis?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. On the marketing spend, that will determined based on the opportunities we see. As we look at '22,
we do see continued benign credit environment and frankly, a very strong opportunity to drive profitable
new account growth. So as that opportunity continues to persist, we'll continue to spend marketing
dollars. So what I would suggest is we concentrate here on 2021. And then in the January call, we'll talk
about '22 in terms of the opportunities there. But I'll leave you with this point that the fourth quarter
trajectory should help inform what we intend to spend in 2022.

In terms of balance transfers, we did see an impact from some of the increased balance transfers that we
executed in early part of '21 in the third quarter in terms of a mild impacts to margin. We'll continue to
take a look at that space and see what we can generate profitably. It has been a good source of account
acquisition for us historically, and we'll continue to remain disciplined and put those prime revolver
accounts on the balance transfer.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.

Donald James Fandetti
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess, Roger, a little bit of a longer-term question around your debit business. It seems like we're going
to have more direct to bank payments in the United States over time. And there's a lot going on PayPal
potentially buying Pinterest. Can you talk about how you see debit evolving over the long term? And are
there any implications given that you own a network?

Roger Crosby Hochschild

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

CEO, President & Director

Sure. Great question. There are always, I would say, new payment schemes and methods out there. A lot
of them though tend to rely on existing payments. So you think about when Apple launched their wallet --
even PayPal, the vast majority of their volume is processed through existing payment networks. And debit
processing is incredibly complex and, quite frankly, very low margin and very efficient as you look at how
sort of the 3 major debit networks, us, Mastercard and Visa operate.

And right now, given the interchange caps that a lot of banks have, the economics for them are relatively
thin. So while we look at what the Fed might be proposing, what goes on in other markets, I don't see
anything in the near or even medium term. It looks like it has the potential. And quite frankly, you're
starting to see an increase in volume on the debit side, even a lot of the buy now pay later players are
leveraging debit for their payments.

Donald James Fandetti
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

You don't see debit really going away per se and being replaced by direct-to-account payments in the
U.S.?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

No. The risk management of payments is quite complex in terms of both fraud and identity. There are a lot
of processes and controls that the major networks have in place. There's a robust ecosystem, if you think
about point-of-sale devices, merchant acquirers. And so to think that, that will change suddenly, I see as a
low probability.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Roger, just following up on that, is there an opportunity for you to take your debit network and debit
capabilities and expand it into that new -- I wouldn't call it new, I guess, but into that revitalized interest
in debit that we're seeing?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Great question, Betsy. Certainly, we have a unique set of network assets and can provide connectivity
to merchants, whether through proxy card numbers or a series of other technologies and work closely with
a number of fintechs around that. So that's at the core of some of what we do with Sezzle. Actually, that
was the beginning of our relationship with Marqeta many, many years ago, and there are a lot of others
that are either in the market now or that we're in discussions with. So I think that the pulse and the debit
assets we have, combined with our signature network are an advantage and one that we look to monetize.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then as we're thinking about the dance that's coming over the next couple of years between
loan growth and credit normalization. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about managing
that trajectory? Because what I heard earlier in the call is you've been getting more and more efficient
at account acquisition, right? Part of your marketing spend coming in lower than expected or at least
lower than consensus than we expected is a function of you doing something. I don't know if it's cloud or
technology or what to get more efficient at account targeting and account acquisition.

So on the one hand, you've got that running in a very positive direction. You talked about the payment
rates being a little bit of a headwind to monetizing that, but at the same time, we've got credit

normalizing. So is there an opportunity for you to pull levers on marketing to generate some more
loan growth? Or is it more likely to come from the personal loan side or student loan side? As credit is
normalizing, how should we think about how you're managing that?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Betsy, I'll take this one. So there's a lot to that question. So let me just give a view in terms of what
we're seeing as we closed out the third quarter. So as I mentioned, the payment rate is stepping down.
And from August to September, we expect that to continue. That will help certainly drive loan growth. My
sense is today that there's a relationship between payment rate and sales activity. So the persistently high
payment rate, I think, has driven sales activity across the industry. Now we benefited, I would say, slightly
disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales, partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned.
So there's 2 dynamics.

The third dynamic is credit normalizing. And my sense is that credit normalization will continue through
'22 into '23. So today, where I said I'm positive on credit. So those factors in the aggregate, in addition
to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting, I think position us pretty well in '22 for positive
loan growth. Not the specifics will come a little bit later in January when we give our view, but we're all
positive on that front today.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And could you touch on what was driving that account acquisition being more efficient? You
mentioned the process-oriented improvement. So what specifically are you talking about there?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

So Betsy, it's Roger again. A lot of the enhancements that we're seeing are leveraging the advanced
analytics. And so that's really helping both on the underwriting side with sort of swap-in, swap-outs as
well as better targeting combined with investments we're making from beginning to end in the Marchex
stack. And we think those are already serving us well, but there's also plenty of upside as we continue to
focus on that area.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Roger and John, I wanted to follow up on your conviction in more robust loan growth in 2022. If we were
to get even just modest mid-single-digit spending growth next year, do you think the incremental tailwind
from payment rate normalization could be enough to support double-digit loan growth? And just to clarify
on this point, did you say earlier, John, that you think we could see payment rates get back to sort of
normalize to maybe 2019 levels by the end of 2023? Is that a reasonable expectation?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

So 2023 is the horizon that we're looking at for payment rate to normalize. And when that happens, we
expect savings rate to return to normalized levels. So one view is continue to watch the savings rate and
that should help inform payment rate. That's frankly one of the metrics we look at.

In terms of robust loan growth in 2022, let me just put it this way here because we're going to hold off
until January on providing explicit details. But the new account originations have been important for
growth. Sales activity has been important for growth. The payment rate, as I mentioned in the prepared
remarks, has been a headwind, not completely unanticipated. We did see it mildly higher than what we

had modeled, but we're still on track for delivering the loan growth that we talked about for '21, '22, it will
be informed by all those factors and share it, Bill with more -- in more detail in January.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Understood. If I can follow up on a separate question on BNPL risk. I guess there's a group on one side
that thinks that it's largely customers who can't qualify for credit and are just using the BNPL to turn their
debit cards into credit cards. We've heard the CEO of Sezzle, which we know is one of your partners sort
of speak to that point. And then there's this other group that is more concerned about the competitive
threat posed by certain BNPL players that do longer-term installment lending and the risk that they'll
eat into margins and pricing over time. Can you frame for us how you're thinking about the competitive
threat? And now that you've had a little bit more time to study what is happening with the different BNPL
players?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So I'll start with . We've had more time to study it. I'd say the market is not yet mature. And I think
market clearing economics have yet to be established. Part of the challenge is there are many segments
within Buy Now Pay Later from the people financing a multithousand-dollar purchase, which, by the way,
they've done for years in terms of traditional sales finance versus sort of more spreading out payments on
$60 worth of cosmetics. So those segments all have different characteristics.

Certainly, at the lower end, there are many customers who are either debit preferring or do not have
access to significant amounts of credit. But I think you'll continue to see it evolve. You're starting to see
some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay take rates above what they pay in card. So right
now, we certainly see opportunity on the payment side, as I talked about earlier, leveraging our assets.
Over time, we think there may be opportunity for us as an issuer and again, partially leveraging our
unique model and our proprietary network. But right now, I would say we're not seeing any noticeable
impact on revolving loans and believe that we are well positioned to respond if it does emerge.

We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.

I wanted to follow up on some of Ryan's questions on competition. I guess, Roger, when you think about
the competitive landscape on a go-forward basis. If you look at the post financial crisis period, a lot of that
competition was transactor-oriented, like people going up transactor customers. Do you think this time it's
going to be a little bit different given what unfolded last time? Or do you think that it's sort of going to be
the same? I'm just curious as you think about how you're setting up competitively?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

So Sanjay, I am lucky enough to be able to look back over multiple cycles of competition, and it has
varied everything from sort of an intense focus across the board on prime revolvers to transactors. I think
certainly, American Express will stay focused on that spend-based model. A lot of banks focus on those
transactors because they are very profitable customers not so much in card, but in other segments of the
business. The prime revolver space has historically been the most challenging in terms of what it requires
from a value proposition and underwriting. For transactors, it's really about rolling out a risk rewards
program. So we expect to see competition across the spectrum. But what impacts us most will be that in
the prime revolver space.

And you don't see any of that really intensifying relative to what you anticipated, it's pretty consistent?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would say it's intensified significantly since sort of the lull during the pandemic, but it's now getting
back to, I'd say, more normalized levels.

Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then, John, just 1 follow-up on NIM. I know we're not talking about next year's guidance until
next quarter. But just broadly speaking, as we sit here today with your NIM pretty high levels relative
to history. As the growth comes, do you envision that to be a tailwind for the NIM? Or does that start
counteracting some of this because the BT rates increased? I'm just curious sort of how we should think
about the progression going forward?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. So if you go back and look at NIM historically, you'll see that it was subjected to,
frankly, higher funding costs from unsecured debt. What we've tried to do is shore up the liability side of
the balance sheet. So targeting 70%, 80% based on -- or from deposits. And then the rest, a combination
of secured and unsecured security offerings. So that will create stability in terms of the funding cost.

In terms of pluses and minuses to the revenue line, what we'll see is some BT-related impacts to NIM.
You'll see credit, if it does normalize, a bit of credit normalization in terms of NIM. But you'll also see that
sustained impact from funding I just talked about. So we're looking at NIM to be higher than what we've
experienced historically. And we're going to compare '21, how we ended end the year in terms of the
balance sheet position and see how that impacts '22. But overall, I would say the funding position has
created more stability and an economic benefit to investors.

We'll take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.

Mihir Bhatia
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe to start, if we could just clarify a little bit on the marketing expense guidance, I guess, maybe for
the fourth quarter? I understand you don't want to talk about 2022 yet. But just for the fourth quarter,
when you talk about marketing expense relative to 2019 levels, are you talking on a quarterly basis or
fourth quarters, we're looking at $235-ish million? I understand you may not want to give exact numbers,
but should we be thinking on a quarterly basis or on a full year basis? Because just given the backup in
the first 3 quarters of the year, that would be a pretty big increase versus on a quarterly basis? I just want
to make sure we clarify that.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

So thanks. So we -- when we referenced 2019, we're talking a full year basis. So then that would force
us to do a little bit of math on the third quarter and fourth quarter. We came in lower in the third quarter
than we anticipated. Fourth quarter, we expect it will increase from the $210 million. So to frankly, remove
some ambiguity on this. So it will be somewhere in the range of $220 million to, call it, $280 million. And
then I hesitate to give that level of specificity, but given the confusion, I just wanted to kind of put it away.

Mihir Bhatia
BofA Securities, Research Division

Sure. And we appreciate that. Just maybe just taking a step back on the credit side and just longer-term
consumer credit performance. As you underwrite new accounts, can you just talk about what kind of

through-the-cycle loss rate assumptions you're making? I guess what I'm really trying to understand is
what is the normalized loss rate for your credit card portfolio as we think about longer-term economics?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So what I would confirm is we do use a through-cycle loss rate, so do not use current losses, but
that's not something we disclose.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi.

Arren Saul Cyganovich
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

The pace of spending by your cardholders accelerated a little bit in 3Q relative to 2019. Is that consistent
through the quarter? Or did it show any signs of rising or falling in terms of the cadence there?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

We've seen ups and downs. In particular, we talked about a bit of a softening around travel, that occurred
in August, and I think that was driven by a lot of what was going on with the pandemic. But we continue
to see very robust sales volume even continuing into October.

Arren Saul Cyganovich
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then the comments on the personal loan pricing and competitive pressures there, is that mainly
from new entrants in the market? We're seeing a lot of different types of personal loan models coming to
market in the past couple of years. Is that something that you would expect to continue as a competitive
pressure going forward? Or is this more of a just marking down relative to where the existing book was?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

A lot of it is coming into -- from new entrants. Personal loans are probably the easiest to fund outside of a
bank and have the easiest servicing requirements. And so it's where a lot of the new entrants will go with
new models. We are disciplined both on it as well as pricing and will not go below the targeted returns we
want to hit. A lot of times, that will flush its way through when they either don't get the performance that
they want to see or have other challenges. You do get some times people who are prioritizing growth over
returns, but that tends not to last for too long.

Operator

We will take the next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays.

Mark C. DeVries
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

A question about what you're seeing in the student lending space and one of your competitors has noted
some headwinds in the quarter. Just how is that shaping up?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

So we feel pretty good about peak season. Volumes were up roughly 7% year-over-year. And we
believe that we gained share, although we're still sort of processing. So clearly, it's -- we saw one major
competitor step back last year. But we're very excited about that market. We underwrite it in a very
disciplined way, and it's a great way to get a really good product in our brand in front of next generation of
prime cardholders.

Mark C. DeVries
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up question on PULSE, as you know, you had some pretty strong
volumes there. Roger, is there a point at which you start to get some meaningful scale benefits and the
earnings contribution from that becomes more meaningful and grows faster than the volumes?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

We would love to increase the percent of our earnings that comes out of the payments segment. I think
one of the challenges, we also are working pretty hard to increase earnings from our banking segment.
So we're not standing still there either. It's -- while we're excited about PULSE, it's also very competitive.
We're battling for routing at the merchant level with Visa and Mastercard day in, day out. We've seen a lot
of growth from expanding from traditional PIN debit to card not present. And so that's been particularly
helpful. But yes, we're very focused on growing that business.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.

Moshe Ari Orenbuch
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Maybe just to come back to the new account acquisition. Is there -- particularly in card, is there a way
to talk about either if there are any different channels that you're using? Or what's the nature of the
consumer? Are there any differences in the type of consumer that you're seeing?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Not really, Moshe. I don't think we've seen anything dramatic since prior to the pandemic. Clearly, the
continued migration to digital channels, direct mail becomes a smaller and smaller piece, but that's been a
trend for many years now. So we continually are fine-tuning the digital channels. I guess, what we've seen
is a greater ability to measure the results of top of funnel spend. As it shifts more digital, when that spend
moves from TV to even video that's online, you can do a better job with tracking and attribution. And so
we are repositioning how we spend, and that's one of the areas we're leveraging some of our advanced
analytics.

Moshe Ari Orenbuch
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. And as you mentioned kind of using balance transfer as part of this, can you talk a little bit about
anything that you can share with us in terms of whether they're all at 0, whether there some that are at
yields above 0? And any kind of update on what you've seen in terms of retention of those balances?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So probably one of the bigger trends, there was a real collapse in balance transfer demand during
the pandemic. Clearly, a lot of issuers we're pulling back on credit line increases. But I think consumers
were much more focused on paying down their debt versus moving it around. So you saw a softening in
demand for personal loans and balance transfers. That's starting to come back.

For us, a lot of our acquisition offers are at 0%. The portfolio offers tend to either be above 0 or have a
fee that provides a pretty effective yield. And as John pointed out, for most of those, we see a very high
return from the balance transfer itself given this funding environment as well as a good percent sticking,
and that's something we model very carefully.

We'll take the next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer.

Dominick Joseph Gabriele
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I guess if we just think about comments around the economic outlook getting -- or the assumptions
around your economic outlook becoming slightly worse from the third quarter -- from the second quarter
to the third quarter, but then being incrementally positive into '22 credit trends. Can you just square those
2 pieces together?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes, happy to, Dominick. So when we modeled in the second quarter, frankly, the economy saw a higher
level of GDP growth and employment returning to normalized levels sooner. And when we updated those,
the GDP had come down, employment returning to normalized levels pushed a bit. So that was one of
multiple inputs. We provide that detail because it's, frankly, the most transparent that people can take a
look at to get deal with how we're thinking about the reserves.

Now the other items that are important in terms of our thinking here in the third quarter was, first, the
portfolio performance, and it's been super strong. Second was the ending of many of the government
support programs related to COVID. So most of those ended in August and September. What we'd like
to do is see some seasoning of the impacts of those into the fourth quarter and perhaps even in the first
quarter next year.

If what we expect is that the impact of that season will be very, very mild on the portfolio and the broad
macros continue to look favorable, there is enough kind of points of reference that would lead us to begin
to step the reserves back to day 1. But a lot of things need to happen. And we ended up where we were in
the third quarter. We ran through multiple models, multiple scenarios. And we got comfortable with where
we were to make sure the balance sheet was fairly stated. But we do see that the broad macros out into
the future are positive. So we'll see how they sustain and make a call in the fourth quarter and in 2022.

Dominick Joseph Gabriele
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And if you all think about how the hierarchy of products that you have as well as across the
consumer space for normalization on which products could normalize. Perhaps let's just, I don't know,
to even maybe 2019 levels, NCO rates. Are there certain products you would expect to normalize either
faster than other products? Or any color you can provide along the trajectory of one product versus the
other, given what you're seeing in your customer base, that would be awesome?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. That's a difficult thing to do in that it will be subject to the economic environment. So we know
historically, right, if there's a period of tougher financial situation, the personal loans will be the ones that
get the least priority in terms of payment. Credit cards tend to be high. The student loans given the long
duration of those contracts, they don't seem to gyrate as much with the economic outputs plus there is so
much of our portfolio is co-signed that it provides additional coverage there.

So you get to kind of personal loans subject to the economic environment. And then the card, my sense
is the card has been prioritized in terms of the payment hierarchy because of what has happened in terms
of cash in the digital environment. It's really difficult shop without a card these days. So I look for stability
there.

Seaport Research Partners

A couple of questions. One on the personal loans business. I believe you've been in the business since
2007. A lot of new entrants in the marketplace today, you kind of talked about it. But I remember, 2/3 of
your book is roughly from the existing Discover credit card file, but the other 1/3 historically coming from
the other places out of market or out of your existing file.

As far as the underwriting you're seeing from the new entrants, you kind of talked a little bit about it, but
I was wondering if you could take a little bit more granular approach to it and talk about, are they making
compromises relative to what you're willing to do on credit payment income, yield verification, all of the
above? And second, just kind of going back to the bonus accruals. A lot of companies are stepping up
bonuses as employee retention efforts. Is this something we should kind of view as transitory one time?
Or might this transfer into a little bit higher compensation expense going into next year?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'll start with the bonus accrual. We haven't made any changes to our bonus program. So to the
extent there are changes in bonus accrual, it just reflects our stronger financial performance this year
versus last year and then how that translates.

In terms of the personal loan space, it is very hard to get line of sight into the practices of these
companies and there are many of them. We've seen them come and go over multiple cycles. In general,
I would say they tend to have fewer manual or labor-intensive processes. So I'd be surprised if they did
the extent of employment verification we do. And again, it might be appropriate if their average ticket is
lower, they may have different return profiles. The one thing I would say, the vast majority lend to a much
broader spectrum than we do. And so we focus on the prime segment, again, primarily debt consolidation,
but it is hard to generalize across the many different new entrants that may have different models.

Eric Edmund Wasserstrom
Head of Investor Relations

Excellent. Well, thank you all for joining us. And if you have any further questions, please reach out to the
