SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Thank you, everybody, for joining us, and welcome to SL Green Realty Corp.'s Fourth Quarter 2019
Earnings Results Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded.

At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make
forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements that
management may make today. Additional information regarding the factors that could cause such
differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's Form 10-K and other reports found by the
company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during today's conference call, the company
may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure
most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed in the reconciliation of the
differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can
be found on the company's website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the
company's fourth quarter 2019 earnings.

Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty
Corp., I ask those of you participating on the Q&A portion of the call, please limit yourself to 2 questions
per person. Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Mark.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. And we'd love to speak
with you today about our earnings release yesterday, which brought to a close 2019, which turned out
to be an exceptionally good year for the company. We're certainly proud of the results we've achieved
throughout the year on your behalf, including highlights, such as the generation of $7 per share of FFO,
representing a year-over-year increase of nearly 6%; the leasing of 2.5 million square feet of space in
our Manhattan office portfolio, which activity carried a 38% mark-to-market on replacement leases and
brought the same-store portfolio to 96.2% occupancy.

We also achieved the near-complete liquidation of the Suburban portfolio, a high level of performance
in the debt and preferred equity portfolio, and the total return to shareholders in excess of 20%,
reflecting the success of our innovative and strategic business plan centered around disposing of assets at
compelling prices and redeploying those proceeds into share repurchases.

Just last month, we held our Annual Investor Conference, which was well attended, and we thank all of
you for that. We took a new approach in our conference presentation and focused almost exclusively on
the work we've been doing these past years to position the company to benefit from a spectacular set
of new developments. The 8 projects that we detailed will contribute an enormous amount of earnings
growth to SL Green, estimated to be nearly $300 million of incremental NOI creation when combined with
expected increases in the retained portfolio. The success of these development projects and the positive
impact they will have on our city will cement SL Green's position, not only as the leading owner-operator
of commercial properties, but also as one of the premier developers in New York.

The SL Green team is completely energized to take on the challenges of the new year and is already
hard at work to fulfill the mission we laid out. Our mandate for 2020 is quite clear, meaningfully progress
our construction and leasing efforts at our development projects, maintain virtual full occupancy in
the retained portfolio, actively sell mature noncore properties, aggressively invest in ourselves by
repurchasing stock at a significant discount to underlying value and continue investing in our properties to
support SL Green's sector-leading sustainability initiatives.

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

We feel confident in our ability to execute on that program, in part, because we believe we have the exact
right team to do it, and in part because we believe the New York market will stay strong throughout the
year, benefiting from low interest rates, record job growth, positive economic sentiment and white-hot
capital markets.

As an example, last year private equity fundraising in the U.S. hit record territory, with firms raising north
of $300 billion. As levered, that $750 billion of total PE buying power with more to be raised in 2020,
and real estate will certainly be a beneficiary with significant portion of those investment monies. So in
recognition of our recent presentation at our Investor Conference, where we went through, in detail, our
business plan and New York City market dynamics, we're going to go right to questions on the call as
we've done in past earnings calls that follow immediately our investor conference.
So with that, operator, we'd like to open it up for questions.

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Manny Korchman from Citi.

Emmanuel Korchman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Mark, just given the recent rise in share price, does it change your perspective of the pace on the buyback
you presented at the Investor Day.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Just -- does it change buyback plan from investors, is that -- I didn't hear the final word?

Emmanuel Korchman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Sure. Yes, that works.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No. I mean, we say there's a change, it got slightly more expensive, so that's a reality. The prices
fluctuated throughout the program, we bought it at prices in the 90s, down to in the 80s, maybe even
high 70s, I'm not sure. But I think our average price at the moment is somewhere around 95 in change.
We think anything within that range where we've been buying, we continue to be a buyer as much or more
today as a year or 2 ago because we believe there's more value in the platform today than a year or 2
ago, in part because rates have continued to lower, we see cap rates stabilizing, maybe even compressing
a bit for higher quality assets. And we get closer to the realization date of these development projects that
I mentioned earlier, all of which brings more value to that portfolio. So it does cost us a little more. Some
of that is incorporated into our projections that we put out for -- in guidance that we put out for 2020. But
it doesn't -- the pricing levels we're at now, we're still an affirmative buyer. And I think you've seen that in
what was disclosed as buying activity in the recent press release, at least through the date that it was --
of the quarter.

Emmanuel Korchman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then if we think about acquisitions that you're potentially looking at in the market, are those going to
be concentrated on the west side similar to the last couple you've done?

Unknown Executive

I think we're going to be opportunistic in terms of acquisitions, and I think we'll go where we see the best
risk-adjusted returns. I mean, it's going to purely depend on deal flow, and I think anywhere in the 5
boroughs is game, if we can find the right returns.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis from SunTrust.

Michael Robert Lewis
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Great. It looks like several of the fourth quarter lease expirations turns into month-to-month or hold over
tenants, about 423,000 square feet, $35 million of annual cash rent. Was that expected? Or maybe you
could provide some color on that?

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

Matthew J. DiLiberto
Chief Financial Officer

$35 million? Part of that -- it's Matt. Part of that is, Polo actually leaves in January, I think. So that's the
bulk of that. And beyond that, every quarter there's a little bit of carryover month-to-month as guys
get their things sorted out. But that big number was Polo in January. Their natural expiration was end of
December.

Michael Robert Lewis
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. And then I just wanted to ask about the rent spread during the quarter. I think it
was 50%, even better than the 38% for the year, overall. Was there anything there that stood out in that
high rent spread?

Unknown Executive

There's 2 deals that drive a lot of that. The Amazon deal in the west side is a 222% mark-to-market on
280,000 square feet of their deal, and the BMW early renewal is 91% over at 555 West 57.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Maybe a question for Steve, just on the leasing front. Can you talk about just kind of the city's leasing
pipeline today and maybe compare it to this time last year? We've seen a lot of big leases get done over
the last 6 months or so. But how do things stand today? And as it relates to interest in like 1 Madison and
some of your pending move-outs that we know about over the next couple of years?

Unknown Executive

Well, I can speak to our pipeline. I'm not certain I can speak to the city's pipeline. We've got a pipeline
of 0.75 million square feet, which, I think, is a pretty full pipeline given the amount of deals that were
closed, 1.25 million, in the fourth quarter of last year. So notwithstanding all that great leasing velocity
and signed deals, there's still a pretty full pipeline across the board in our portfolio with a wide range of
sizes, the largest of which in that pipe is probably about 115,000 square feet. One Vanderbilt continues to
see extremely strong activity. We have a couple of leases out that we're working on. We have a number of
proposals that we're also exchanging back and forth. We're starting to get to a point where certain tenants
are getting bumped from deals because they're competing for the same floors. And so we feel very good
about our pace at that building.

1 Madison, a little early to the game, we're still 3.5 years out from delivery. We are responding to 3 or
4 different RFPs that have been submitted to us. We expect some others to come through the door, but
I wouldn't read too much into that. I think it's early days there. Like what we saw at One Vanderbilt, if
you recall, when we started the lease-up there, there was a long period of just educating the marketplace
about what the product is all about. And then when we got into that kind of 2, 2.5-year away from
delivery, that's when things heated up because that's a natural time line for tenants to make their
decisions.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then just thinking about some of the known move-outs over the next couple of years,
[indiscernible] Cravath, NHL. Any early read on -- or maybe just talk through how you're approaching
those spaces and what we should expect to see?

Unknown Executive

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

7

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

Well, we're actively in the market with both of them. Cravath is still way out there, that's 2025, so it's
-- there's no tenant that is really, I think, at this moment in time, making that far ahead decision for a
product that's currently occupied. [indiscernible] is a little closer to us. We're probably doing a modest
capital program in the building to attend some of the public areas. I'll remind you that on both of those
buildings, it's the top of the house, it's the best part of the building. So we've got very -- I mean they're
both very strong buildings. So I think we're well positioned to be able to bring those products to market,
and particularly with Third Avenue, I expect it will -- we'll be leasing that at higher rents that are in place
today.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So 2 questions. First, just a big picture. Recently, there's the politicians who're proposing extending the
mortgage recording tax to mezz and other forms of subordinate finance for real estate. Maybe if you could
just give your view on this? I'm assuming it would be borne by the borrower, but still, it just adds cost and
friction to the system. So maybe you can just give your view on what do you think happens? And what
you may be hearing from your folks that you may speak to in Albany?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Alex, it's Marc. And the -- what you're referring to, I believe, is the -- is a bill that was just recently
introduced in the Senate and the Assembly by 2 of the more Junior Senators, Assembly people, it's been
introduced. It's not a part of any budget at this time. It's not on any committee agenda. So it's far, far
from something that I think has any traction. We've looked at the bill as drafted and, frankly, we think
it's flawed in a number of ways. So on the one hand, we think it's flawed. On another hand, we think it's
written in a way as to be so broad as it would apply not only to real estate, but maybe to commercial
loans much beyond, which I can't imagine there's going to be support for that type of disruption of the
lending markets in New York City right now, which is really helping to drive this economy. And while it
might have been narrowly construed, we don't read it that way.

So on the one hand, I think it's early. On the other hand, we don't think it's going to get traction. On
the third hand, it's not even clear how it would be enforced because it would appear to be not really
enforceable as a UCC loan or enforced was a mortgage loan, it sort of creates a third category of I don't
even know what. So I think we'll monitor it. I'm sure there'll be significant opposition to it from the
business community. We'll just see where it goes.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then, Steve, as you talk to some of the bigger, especially on the tech side, are you seeing
that when they look at Manhattan for space, are they trying to sort of create like a campus where if
they have to be in multiple locations, they want to have buildings that are within a few blocks of each
other? Or is your sense that as these bigger tech users come to the city, they're just happy to take
space wherever they can get it. So it means splitting it between Downtown and Midtown or in different
submarkets, they're buying? Or is it like -- I mean, I'm just thinking about Facebook, where it seems like
they aggregated pretty tight to one another on the west side?

Unknown Executive

Well, I think it's interesting. If you roll the tape back a couple of years ago, the tech tenants that were in
the city, by and large, migrated to older buildings. Buildings with a lot of character, smaller floor plates.
They were hampered with lots of columns, small windows, low ceilings, that kind of thing, but it was in
the Midtown South market, where they wanted sort of the quality of life. And as that industry has gotten
bigger in the city and the size of the tenants have expanded, and the sophistication of those tenants has

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

grown, their need for quality real estate has led them to better-quality buildings that can support the
occupancy, which means bigger ceilings, bigger windows, less columns, better infrastructure, where they
can support greater density of occupancy.

So that's driving them to new construction. It puts us in the catbird seat with the redevelopment of 1
Madison, because it's large floor plates in the part of town that they want to be. And I think that's the real
change that you've seen in that sector of the marketplace, where it was not just about which part of town
they want to be in. Now they're finding themselves needing to be in certain types of buildings.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

DPE balances dropped to $1.61 billion this quarter. Is this the new base to grow from? And have DPE
balances bottomed out? Or will we see a bit more shrinkage here?

Andrew W. Mathias
President & Director

No, it's Andrew. I think you'll see those balances rebound quite a bit by the end of the first quarter or
mid-second quarter. We've already added about $100 million of assets so far in first quarter and that $1.6
billion should be a low point. I think our guidance was to end the year a bit higher than that.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, great. And given the dispositions this quarter, how do you plan to reuse the proceeds? And what will
the split be?

Unknown Executive

Well, by dispositions are we talking about...

Matthew J. DiLiberto
Chief Financial Officer

We actually -- it's Matt. We didn't -- yes, we didn't dispose a lot in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter,
we expect to close 220 and that will fund the combination of share buybacks and debt repayments so that
we maintain leverage neutrality.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about how the conversation is going at 625 Madison,
where you mentioned you have a ground lease reset you're dealing with. Any updates there?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Well, no updates. And on past calls, we've gotten that question and it's going to be increasingly tricky
because it's -- there will be a fair market value reset. I think it's in '21 or second half of '21. So it's still a
ways off. Was that 20 -- well, '22 is the effective date.

Unknown Executive

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

But the determination will be in '21. So we get to work in '21, the effective date is '22 and it's still a ways
off. But to the extent it becomes subject of any kind of dispute or procedure or anything, we're going to
probably not say a whole lot about this other than, from our standpoint, it's a pretty straight, down-the-
middle FMB reset. We've dealt with them before and myriad of other lease -- space leases and ground
leases, and we think we have a fairly good handle on where it should come out. And on that basis, we
feel confident that we'll be in a position to have the rent reset, execute a modest building repositioning
program and relet the Polo space at the right time.

In the interim, we are actively pursuing interim leases on a short-term basis and getting some traction
there to create some ancillary revenue that actually wasn't really included in our 2020 guidance, but
notwithstanding that, we're hopeful that, that will be some upside in 2020.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a question for Andrew or anyone. In terms of all the tech leasing
that has happened last year, there's more in the pipeline, has that yet translated into any change in buyer
sentiment in the market or in terms of more assets, larger assets come into market in New York City
because of some of this confidence in the tech leasing in the market?

Unknown Executive

Yes, I think the short answer is yes. I mean, I think there's an understanding there's going to be an
enormous amount of hiring to fill a lot of the space that's being committed for 2023, let's call it, 2022,
2023, 2024 delivery. And that, obviously, has a multiplier effect. So generally, investors, other than public
shareholders, are extremely positive on New York City and its prospects. And we showed that analytically
at the Investor Conference and we continue to hear it more and more in our travels as people are very
bullish on New York and they love the occupancy statistics and they love sort of the makeup of the growth
in the market.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Wolf from Stifel.

John William Guinee
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. I think this is John Guinee here. You have another lease -- ground lease coming up, it's not for 20-
odd years Avenue of the Americas, but you've got some big tenants in that building, 1 million square feet.
When do you start having discussions with the ground lessor? And when do you start being reluctant to
put money into the building, knowing that you've got this down the road?

David Schonbraun
Co-Chief Investment Officer

John, it's David Schonbraun. I think any lease like that we're -- it's so far out. I think it's a little too
premature. I think as you get a lot closer to the expiration, and you have to make leasing decisions where
you don't have enough time to maybe get a lease and kind of give extension options, that's when those
conversations more ripen. Right now it's just too early and there's too much term on it. So it really doesn't
make sense to do it at this time.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

We did. We just completed a pretty significant repositioning in capital campaign at that building in advance
of the vacancy that you see now. So we did a lobby renovation, some systems work and sort of improve

10

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

the curve appeal of the building quite a bit. So we invested that capital in contemplation of getting long-
term leases that will sort of lead up to that revaluation. But beyond that, we'll see.

Unknown Executive

We're trading paper with some of that -- the nearest-term lease expiration, we're already trading paper
with prospective tenants.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Craig Allen Mailman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just curious, Greenberg signed another lease at 420. Does that affect at all kind of the lease at One Vandy
and the space needs? Could they transfer that or vice versa?

Unknown Executive

No, no, no. That was always part of their game plan from day one, was to have a split operation where
part of their people would be over at the Graybar building. The amount of space they took at Graybar was
a larger amount of space than they originally contemplated, so that was good news. And a number of the
tenants at One Vanderbilt have elected to split their operation, putting some of their support people in
surrounding buildings, and we've been a beneficiary of that as well.

Craig Allen Mailman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. Then just to go back to the slide you guys had at the Investor Day on the bridge
and the CapEx associated with the NOI coming online. Just 2 questions, follow-up questions to that. One,
kind of what's the threshold on probability for a tenant staying versus going for some of the bigger kind
of tenants you guys have here that have expirations in the next couple of years that we don't already
know about? And then how much capital, if any, is in there for complying with the first phase of the carbon
emissions in 2024?

Matthew J. DiLiberto
Chief Financial Officer

It's Matt. So your first question was, what's our probability of retaining tenants? I mean, generally, our
historical average is 60% to 70% retention rate. And for the leases that we know or the tenants that we
know are leaving or known vacancies, we put in assumptions there. I mean, there's -- I can't get into
specifics as to how we do it, but, obviously, we take those into consideration.

Carbon emissions, we've said and shown, we are compliant through the known compliance period. So if
there is any incremental capital that is needed there, and we feel our portfolio is well ahead as evidenced
by our scores of the New York City requirements and the other portfolios in the city, we always have things
in there ahead of regulatory requirements and safe to assume there's some in there in that capital plan
as well. But as for what happens beyond '24, those rules are not out yet and so we don't have a large
number or any specific number in there for that.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Yes. For what we know through 2030, the cost is de minimis.

Matthew J. DiLiberto
Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

Chairman & CEO

So I mean, for the next 10 years, we -- based on what we do know, we know it to be de minimis. If you're
asking 2030 and beyond, those standards will be set. And then we'll have a better sense of things. But
when I say set, they'll be revised and modified from what came out. And there's committees and task
forces that have been set up to do that. So it is being actively attended to, even though it's very early.
But the '24 hurdles, I think, we did a whole segment on that in December, showing that we were almost
entirely compliant today for '24.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Green from Evercore.

Jason Daniel Green
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a question on the Suburban sale. Are you able to provide a cap rate on that sale? And also, generally,
how deep the buyer pool was?

Unknown Executive

Cap rate, we're not in a position to give the buyer pool. I would say, it's a light buyer pool in the suburbs,
much lighter than in the city. That's part of the time that it's taken us to divest that portfolio. We still have
the 2 assets remaining, as you know, in Stamford, Connecticut. And we were very pleased to be able to
come to a resolution on those assets in White Plains.

Jason Daniel Green
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And I guess, just a follow-up, just what the activity level is and the remaining Suburban assets?

Unknown Executive

For lease or sale?

Jason Daniel Green
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

For sale.

Unknown Executive

I think one of them was going through a rent revaluation process on a ground lease, which is now
complete. It resulted in no increase in ground rent, and that asset is now, in our view, ready for sale,
given the rent is set and that uncertainty is taken away. And the other asset is Landmark Square in
Stamford, where we continue to manage and lease and collect significant income. But I'd say, for this -- at
this moment, we're sort of taking a pause on the marketing process there, completing some leasing and
other activity at the building, and then, ultimately, look to reintroduce that building for sale.

Unknown Executive

And Jason, just to be clear, we did not include the sale of Landmark Square in our business plan for 2020.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just with the news that WeWork sort of slowed down and potentially maybe giving back some space,
can you just sort of update us broadly on your thoughts on sort of how this may evolve from a demand

perspective, but more specifically on 609 Fifth, where WeWork did find leads. Like where are we in that
process? Are they already cash paying? Or is that yet to commence?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Well, on 609, specifically, I think WeWork commenced its rent payments, I want to say April?

Unknown Executive

Payments? Yes.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So they're close to but not quite at their rent commencement period. They just gave us an updated
construction schedule. So they seem to be going full bore ahead at this moment to complete their base
building work and installation. How long that will take them? I'm not quite sure. But based on the scope
of the work, I'd say, at least till the end of this year. But in all respects, there's nothing notable to note on
609 or the WeWork lease there, other than they are in the process of doing their work.

As it relates to the market generally, the coworking companies have definitely -- they downed their
demand in New York in the fourth quarter pretty sizably, but that certainly didn't seem to have an effect
that we saw in the fourth quarter.

Unknown Executive

And I don't know, giving back space, I haven't seen...

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Well, I haven't -- I mean, I'm not referring giving back...

Unknown Executive

No, the question was -- he referred to giving back...

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

No, no.

Unknown Executive

I mean, they have contractual obligations. We haven't heard of them walking away from any contractual
obligations. So I'm not sure...

Unknown Executive

So just to add to that. We've had a number of discussions with them. And what they have consistently
said to us is that the focus of their business plan is on their core cities, New York City -- New York, London
and the like, being -- they're just hyper focused on. And they realized that their outer-borough cities,
that's where you may hear about them pulling back from. But New York City, they expect to continue to be
expanding as the years to come and certainly not retracting on any of their current commitments.

Unknown Executive

Yes. I mean, I know a lot of the focus is on WeWork, but Nutella is out there also as someone who is going
through a lot of the same things that we hear about and see and have had experienced where they seem
to be pulling back from deals, not giving up space, if that was the question, but certainly, downsizing their
demand greatly and laying off employees. So I think you're going to see it within that sector. And -- but
the market, both in terms of what we achieved in the fourth quarter and the pipeline we have in front of

us, doesn't seem to be meaningfully affected by that pullback because the tenants that might otherwise
have gone into those facilities just seem to be back to -- coming to landlords direct. And so maybe that's
even a -- either way, whether it's derivatively through a coworker or direct, the leasing space, as I always
said, is a good thing for us, and we support any company that's leasing space, whether it's directly or
as part of a coworking community aggregator, if you will. But the important thing is the job growth is
there, the underlying demand is there, so space will get leased directly or through one of the coworking
companies.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. Just last, just to clarify on the income NOI from -- cash NOI from the retail
properties. Any anything from any of the leases recently signed, whether it's PUMA or anything, in terms
of like a bump up in the cash NOI? And can you give us update on the McDonald's space?

Unknown Executive

As it relates to PUMA, they started -- we started income recognition late last year when they opened. They
opened in August, September time frame, they and Vince. So you'll have a full year effect this year versus
just a partial year last year, but that's the most material on the retail side.

Unknown Executive

The McDonald's space is demoed and prepped, looks beautiful and is formally on the market as of about
30 days ago. So we'll look forward to activity this year, again, that space leased up. But McDonald's are
still paying rent on that space for several more years, as you know.

Operator

At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Marc Holliday for
closing remarks.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Well, thank you all for a somewhat abbreviated call, but we appreciate the questions and look
forward to a very ambitious and productive year in 2020 and look forward to speaking to you again in 3
months.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now
disconnect.
