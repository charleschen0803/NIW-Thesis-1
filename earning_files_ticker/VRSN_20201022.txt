Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being
recorded. Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. Now at this time, I'd like to turn the
conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please
go ahead, sir.

David Atchley
VP & Corporate Treasurer

Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Thank you to everyone for
joining our call today, and we hope each of you are staying safe and healthy.

Joining me remotely from their respective locations are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO;
Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and
presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under about
VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our third quarter 2020 earnings release.

At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay
of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include
forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in
our documents filed with the SEC specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. VeriSign
does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public
disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP
results and 2 non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.

GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found
on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. In a moment, Jim and George
will provide some prepared remarks, and afterwards, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I
would like to turn the call over to Jim.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, VeriSign reports $318 million in revenue for the
quarter, up 3.1% from the same quarter a year ago. But before we dive deeper into our results, I wanted
to speak just a bit about COVID-19 and how we're addressing it within VeriSign. With the increased
demand for internet and online services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the secure and reliable operation
of our infrastructure has become even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to
ensure the availability of our critical internet infrastructure for the benefit of Internet users.

We continue to operate our registry services for com and net, and our root operations at the rigorous
standards of performance and availability governed by our agreements with ICANN, while most of our
employees continue to work remotely.

Now I'll address our quarterly results. The third quarter of 2020 was another consistent quarter for
VeriSign, in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid
financial results.

Regarding third quarter operational highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base and .com
and .net totaled $163.7 million, consisting of $150.3 million names for .com and $13.4 million names
for .net. With a year-over-year growth rate of 4%.

During the third quarter, we processed 10.9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased
by 1.65 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the

VERISIGN, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.4%. This
preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2019 and 72.8% last quarter.

For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 3.5% and 4%. This updated range
reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectations for domain name base
growth for the remainder of the year, balanced with the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19.

During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 823,000 shares
of common stock repurchased for $170 million. At quarter end, $506 million remained available and
authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration date.

Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing
needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And
now I'd like to turn the call over to George.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As mentioned, for the quarter ended September 30, 2020,
the company generated revenue of $318 million, up 3.1% year-over-year and delivered operating income
of $207 million compared with $206 million in the same quarter a year ago.

Operating expenses totaled $111 million, up from $103 million in the third quarter a year ago and up from
$108 million last quarter. The increase in operating expense reflects our continued investments throughout
the year in personnel to support our cybersecurity and infrastructure initiatives, among other factors.

The operating margin in the quarter came to 65% compared to 66.7% in the same quarter a year ago,
and 65.8% last quarter.

Net income totaled $171 million compared to $154 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings
per share of $1.49 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.30 for the same quarter last year.

As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter included a previously unrecognized
income tax benefit of $24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 and resulted from
the remeasurement of VeriSign's accrual for uncertain tax positions.

Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $140 million and free cash flow was $125 million compared
with $208 million and $197 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year.

Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the third quarter were both lower, mainly due to the permitted
deferral of $52 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter, which we mentioned in our last
quarter's call. I will now discuss updated full year 2020 guidance.

Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.262 billion to $1.267 billion. This revenue range reflects
the updated domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier.

The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is now expected to be between 64.75%
and 65.25%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investments in
our operational infrastructure and security capabilities as well as sales and marketing expenses during the
fourth quarter of 2020.

Interest expense and nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $75 million
and $80 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $45 million and $50 million.

We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a net benefit of between 6% and 9%, which reflects
the $168 million and $24 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits recorded in the first
quarter and the third quarter, respectively. Cash taxes for 2020 are still expected to be in the range of
18% to 20% of pretax income.

VERISIGN, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter and
we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the remainder of 2020. Now I'll turn the call back
to Jim for his closing remarks.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Thank you, George. I'd like to say again that our priorities continue to be our mission of ensuring the
availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during
the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home
and isolating at home, online services are critical and more businesses and individuals that ever depend on
Internet infrastructure for their livelihood.

I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining our critical internet
infrastructure even during a pandemic. We'd like to walk through 2 questions, which we believe are on
your mind before we open the call for your additional questions.

First question, are there any updates regarding your plans to use the limited pricing flexibility you have
for .com? No update from what we said last quarter. We still expect to effectuate the dot-com wholesale
price increase before October 25, 2021, and the prices for all of our TLDs are frozen through March 31,
2021.

Second question. Are there any updates on the status of .web? As we noted last quarter, a final hearing
was scheduled in August. The hearing took place in early August. The participants, including VeriSign, then
submitted their post hearing briefs. A final decision from the panel may be issued later this year or early
next year. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but was granted the right to
participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose
of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions.
Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on
the delegation of the DoT Web TLD. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready
for the first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird.

Robert Cooney Oliver
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Jim, just to start with you. Just overall, I'd love to get your thought on the domain environment,
clearly coming out of COVID, a lot of concerns about small business, small business failure. And you guys
have consistently from that time when you took down the guide on domain growth have kind of ratcheted
back up and came in at 4 this quarter, pretty impressive. So I just was wondering if you could maybe step
back and talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the environment, a lot of new business starts and it
would seem that, that would be offsetting some of the kind of macro concerns that they may be weighing
on small businesses or maybe they're holding on to their websites? I would love to hear your thoughts
there. And then I had a quick follow-up.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thanks for the question. Well, I'll make a comment or two, and then I'll invite George and Todd to
comment as they see that market having developed over the crisis. I'll just say that, as I mentioned in
my remarks, obviously, people are making greater use of the Internet for a wide variety of reasons for
their livelihood or in the pursuit of a livelihood and starting new businesses. Others may not be faring as
well. There are a lot of complex reasons that people register, keep and delete domain names, and there's
a complex sort of analysis that leads to where the increased growth resulted in the quarter.

Overall, the numbers speak for themselves in that it was a solid quarter of additional growth. There's
clearly additional Internet usage. There's clearly additional growth in the domain name space as a result
of that. And it's quite clear as you see in our results and as you observed. And George and Todd, I'll invite
you to comment, if you like.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. This is George Kilguss. So as Jim mentioned, we had a good quarter. New registrations were $10.9
million, which was up about 980,000 new names from a year ago, but very similar to last quarter. And the
trends that we're seeing here in Q3 are very similar to last quarter in that we saw strength in registrations
from North American registrars, EMEA registrars and APAC registers.

New units from China-based registrars during the quarter were similar to Q2 level. However, they were
down year-over-year. But overall, a very solid quarter, continuing to see good demand here in the third
quarter. And I think, as Jim said, those are just secular trends that we're seeing with people, seeing the
value and the utility of having a website and getting a domain name to better service their customers and
maximize their e-commerce objectives. And I think we're helping to support that, those small businesses
in doing that. And those trends, at least so far this year have been good for us.

Robert Cooney Oliver
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up, George, is for you. I think you mentioned in your prepared
remarks, a common relative to Q4 in sales and marketing expenses. And just wanted to just ask on that.
Anything out of the ordinary relative to kind of standard practice on investing in your channel around.com
growth? And any color you can add there would be great.

VERISIGN, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Yes, Rob, I would say nothing out of the ordinary. I think if you look in the past couple of years, we have
tended to spend a little bit more in the sales and marketing area in the fourth quarter just based on the
timing of events. This year, we had some activities that we're going to do early in the year, but with the
pandemic in full swing, we kind of pivoted on some of those efforts, and we've repositioned them here in
the fourth quarter. So I don't think there's anything unusual there, just the normal management of our
marketing activities throughout the year.

Operator

I'll take our next question from Nick Jones with Citigroup.

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. I guess, 2. The first one, I guess, a little bit more on .web. Can you expand on the decision that's,
I guess, coming either later this year or early next year, I guess, in terms of is this kind of a definitive
decision that puts this matter to rest? Or is it more of a decision to potentially extend the matter longer?
Just any, I guess, color on how to think about the timing of what we're waiting to hear.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Well, we're waiting to hear the final resolution of this IRP. And just as a reminder, this IRP, this form of
arbitration, it's used in the ICANN community actually involves 2 parties primarily. That's affiliate who's
essentially the plaintiff here and ICANN who is the defendant. And as I mentioned in the question that I
asked and answered, this is about whether ICANN follows its own policies of procedures when it makes
decisions. So that is what the panel will decide. And our expectation, as I said, is that following that
resolution, the ICANN board then -- the matter will be returned to ICANN for its process, which is to make
a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. So that's the expectation. As in any litigation, it's really
not proper to speculate on those outcomes, obviously, when something is pending. But we do know in the
process, what's pending here, which is a decision by the panel. And they have the final hearing what's
scheduled and it was held. And of course, as a participant, but not a litigant, so to speak, we were there
at the table. So we're waiting. Hopefully, by the end of this year or early next year. We will hear from the
panel. They will answer the allegations by the plaintiff affiliates against ICANN and then the matter should
be handed to the ICANN Board for resolution on the .web issue. That's our expectation. And that's what
we hope to see, and then we'll certainly share with you what we know, when we know it beyond that.

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. And then a follow-up. Just 1 follow-up on, I guess, just .com market share. So there's some third-
party data out there that kind of indicates.com is regaining share despite they're kind of being more I
guess, new TLDs. Why do you think that is? Is that what you're seeing? Can you speak to kind of any
trends you're seeing there maybe making.com more popular versus new TLDs? I guess just any thoughts
or color around that would be great.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Well, I'll just say this I mean, I don't know what data you're referring to, so I can't really address that
specifically. I can tell you, though, that the market does not consist only of.com and then new gTLDs
or alternate TLDS, there's a large and thriving market of country code TLDs like .cn for China, .de for
Germany. Many of those have been commercialized like .co from Colombia, .co is a commercialized TLD
that many, many organizations and individuals have chosen to brand themselves on. And there are a large
number of those. So the market is far broader than that.

COM is a good brand, and its performance is strong. And registrants like the .com brand because it helps
them get found. But beyond that, without seeing what you're referring to, I really can't comment on it.
I would just caution that very often, when I've seen people talk about the market, they haven't really

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

VERISIGN, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

considered how large that market is. I would also refer you to our domain name brief. I think there's a
good survey of all of the TLDs there.

And I think if you look at that, you might get a slightly different picture. So I hope that's helpful.

Operator

We'll now take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So going back to the domain name growth. In the context of the guidance that you've given for the full
year, it would seem to indicate a slowdown in the year-over-year new registrations embedded in that. So
I guess my question is, do you think that there was some onetime benefits from COVID that you're not
factoring into the guidance for the fourth quarter? Or what else is kind of influenced -- influencing how you
kind of guided here for full and how you kind of guided here for a full year.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Sterling, this is George. Yes. So as you know, Sterling, there are just simply less selling days. I would
put it in the fourth quarter. Typically, we see the fourth quarter new registrations dip seasonally. So
we're keeping an eye on that. Also, I think there's still some uncertainty with regard to COVID and how
that disease may pick up here globally. And so some of that caution is also in the guidance that we're
providing.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. And I know that .com is a thin registry. But based on your interactions with registrars and
industry participants, any sense as to what percentage of domains that are coming on board have e-
commerce attached to them at this point? Or any other type of granular breakdown you might have?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. As you mentioned, Sterling, it's in registry. We don't quite have that detail. We do hear from the
registrars that they are seeing more small businesses stand up websites and grow that portion of their
business, which I think is good for our business. But as far as the granular detail, I don't have that for
you, I'm sorry.

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And that kind of brings. I don't know if you guys have seen it, but the Census Bureau has a number
of business applications. And it looks like there was a significant spike in late summer coming into the
fall. And based on that comment, I'm wondering if you're seeing some of those come in? Or is there the
potential that there might be a delayed tailwind from maybe new business formation?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Well, speaking for myself, I haven't seen that data. I don't know that we've correlated any data like that to
domaining registrations in our common net zone. I think registrars are probably the first place that there
would be some indication of that. I think clearly, we have some indication from them that new business
starts are on the up and that there are increased domain name registrations in the U.S. associated with
that. So I think in general, the answer to your question is yes, that there's nothing I can think of in the
data that would disagree with what you're saying. But any detail or correlation, I don't think we have any.

VERISIGN, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And one housekeeping, George, what's the number of names up for renewal in Q4?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

In Q4, 34.8 million.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. Great. And very last one. You commented a little bit, so I wanted to just put a fine point. Given
bringing down the high end of the operating margin for the full year, what would you say the incremental
spend that you're now factoring into that guidance is going to that maybe wasn't there before? Or is that
the wrong way to look at it?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. The increased expense year-over-year is really going
to increased headcount. We've added about 30 or 36 heads since -- 36 heads since the beginning of the
year. And a lot of those additional headcounts are people that we have focused on are cybersecurity and, I
would say, software, network engineering functions. And those show up in our R&D and our G&A functions.
And so at the end of the quarter, our headcount was about 908 employees, so that was up from 872 at the
end of the year.

So I mean the only other thing I'll say is, look, we've -- we came out of 2018 with a similar level of
headcount. We had about 900 people. We've been as high as 1,000 employees in the business.

If you step back and look at the prior years, we've been in a GAAP operating expense range of around
$110 million, $112 million a quarter, clearly in 2020 here. In 2019 as we got out of -- we sold the VSS
security business. We had some moving pieces as we were reorganizing the company. But -- and right
now, we're at about $111 million for the quarter of GAAP operating expense here.

So we've been in this range for a long period of time. And we're, as we always are, we're managing the
expenses of the business to meet the needs of the business. And I think we've been doing that reasonably
well over the past the 7 or 8 years, and we're going to continue to do that.

But the -- to answer your question, it's really been this additional headcount that we've added in our
security and stability initiative.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

And Sterling, this is Jim. Sterling, I would just add too, that there's always a baseline of funding that we
make available and increase just simply because a huge aspect of what we do is cybersecurity, which is
very difficult to predict, the threat environment is constantly evolving. It's generally always intensifying
and increasing and so there are constant investments we make in training, education, new hires, people,
technology, hardening our infrastructure, improving its resiliency that are ongoing. In addition, there are
responses that we have to make to new threats that are anticipated. These just are routine and happen all
the time, but the precise nature, the precise response, and therefore, the price -- the precise budgetary
aspect of the response is difficult to predict. What you're seeing is our best estimates based on a long
history of experience of doing these kinds of things.

VERISIGN, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

In addition, we fund research and that research evolves. And we recently identified, for example, a huge
number of queries that were out coming into the root servers, a massive spike in queries that were
literally the result of unintentional activities with that browser behavior that we were able to actually
highlight, point out, and help rectify and eliminate a huge amount of volume that was hitting the -- all 13
of the root servers.

There's quite a bit of this research that we do and published. We've done work in name collisions. We do
a lot of root instrumentation that helps manage and improve performance and security across the net, we
identified the names that are the source of botnets and other sorts of cyberattacks. We share those with
different companies, government agencies. So the teams that are working on that are always evolving,
growing, training, hiring additional folks. That's our primary mission.

We address it in many broad ways, but it's our top priority. So it shouldn't be a surprise that at times,
you're going to see increased spending on it. It's just the nature of the business that we're in. And that's
our expertise, and that's our mission.

Operator

And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to
Mr. Atchley for any additional or closing remarks.

David Atchley
VP & Corporate Treasurer

Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this
call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call.

Have a good evening.

Operator
Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now
