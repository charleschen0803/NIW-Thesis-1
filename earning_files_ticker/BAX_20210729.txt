Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Baxter International Second Quarter 2021 in
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter, and is copyrighted material. It cannot be rerecorded or
rebroadcast without Baxter's permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.

I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Vice President of Investor Relations at
Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.

Clare Trachtman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are
Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's Chief Financial
Officer.

On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's second quarter 2021 financial results and full year
2021 financial Outlook.

With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including
comments regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021, new product
development, business development and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current
expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially.

In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being
discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release issued this
morning and available on our website.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Thank you, Clare. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin with a review of
Baxter's second quarter results, and also share a few words about our upcoming investor conference. Jay
will then provide a deeper dive on our financial performance and outlook. And we will wrap up with Q&A.

Baxter delivered second quarter sales growth of 14% as reported, 9% on a constant currency basis
and 8% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by the ongoing global recovery from the COVID-19
pandemic, resulting in favorable performance comparisons for a number of our businesses versus the prior
year, as the pandemic affect the patient treatment dynamics and demand mix in the prior year.

On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, up 25% year-over-year and
exceeding our original guidance. All three of our geographic segments contributed to the positive quarterly
performance. The Americas and EMEA achieved high single-digit growth and APAC achieved a low double-
digit growth, all at constant currency rates. While we are clearly experiencing recovery from the pandemic
across all three of our geographies, the situation on the ground varies considerably by market.

As always, we salute the health care workers, who continue to face enormous challenges every day on the
front lines of care. I also want to express my personal gratitude to all the Baxter employees, who tirelessly
support these clinicians and caregivers while helping to ensure we address the needs of patients across
our vast life-sustaining portfolio.

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Turning to our performance by business, 5 of our 7 product categories achieved growth on a constant
currency basis. Performance was led by BioPharma Solutions and Advanced Surgery, which delivered 49%
and 48% constant currency growth, respectively. Growth in BPS was filled by contracts to assist in the
manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. Advanced Surgery growth reflects a favorable comparison to the prior
year spurred by improving surgical volumes as pandemic recovery advances globally.

As you saw in this morning's press release, we are building on our momentum in Advanced Surgery with
the acquisition of PerClot Polysaccharide Hemostatic System. PerClot marks our entry into the global
hemostatic powder segment, which will allow us to serve surgeons and their patients with an even broader
range of options to control into operative bleeding across active and passive solutions.

Our Medication Delivery business grew 12% at constant currency rates, also benefiting from a favorable
comparison driven by improving rates of admissions at hospitals as compared to the prior year. Looking
ahead, Medication Delivery is continuing to position for the U.S. launch of our NOVUM IQ infusion platform
including those IQ safety software in our IQ enterprise digital connectivity suite.

Following up on our recent FDA resubmission, we are now in the process of responding to an additional
information request from the agency. We continue to expect to launch NOVUM IQ in the U.S. before the
end of the year.

Our Clinical Nutrition category advanced single digits at constant currency rates, reflecting ongoing
strength in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals also grew at single digits constant currency. Adjusting for the recent
Caelyx and Doxil acquisition, Pharmaceuticals was flat year-over-year. Although we expect competitive
pressures to continue in this marketplace, we remain focused on launching molecules with differentiated
presentations and/or complex formulations.

We have several projected launches of new generic injectables in the coming years that will help to fuel
growth in this business and mitigate some of the competitive pressures we are experiencing. Performance
in Renal Care was comparable to the prior year at constant rates with growth in the U.S., offset by a
decline across international markets. On a global basis, the market continues to be dampened by the
impact of the pandemic, which has contributed to a higher mortality rate for patients with kidney disease
combined with a slowing of new patient diagnosis.

As we said last quarter, we expect the recovery of this market to continue, returning to its pre-COVID
dynamics over the next 1 to 2 years. In this quarter, we saw returned positive year-over-year PD patient
growth globally including mid-single-digit PD patient growth in the U.S.

The pandemic has highlighted the vital importance of the home dialysis therapy option. And as a leader
in recognized innovator in this space, it has never been more urgent to support education, awareness and
access.

Our global safer at home campaign, which has been underway for more than a year, is dedicated to
helping clinicians, patients and other stakeholders learn more about the benefits of home care, particularly
amid pandemic conditions. Lastly, performance in Acute Therapies declined mid-single digits at constant
currency rates year-over-year. This decline was expected given the extremely challenging comparison
following last year's historic surge in demand for continuous renal replacement therapy in light of the
pandemic. We remain excited by the prospects for the advanced treatment options in the CRRT market.

In fact, Q2 marked the launch of PrisMax to the latest version of our nex-gen platform for CRRT and
organ support with embedded TrueView digital health technology. From an ESG perspective, earlier this
month, we announced our 2030 corporate responsibility commitment, which will help to drive Baxter's
environmental, social, governance efforts over the next decade and beyond.

This work is integral to how we advance our mission to save and sustain lives and serve all of our
stakeholders from patients and clinicians to our communities and investors. Our 2030 commitment is built
around the three overarching objectives, empower our patients, protect our planet and champion our
people and communities. Full details can be found in our 2020 corporate responsibility report now posted
on baxter.com.

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Briefly looking ahead, we continue operating in an environment of some uncertainty. We fully anticipate
broader trend of pandemic recovery to sustain, but geographic disparities and emerging variants could
slow and undermine the pace. All storages like our health care peers and countless other companies,
Baxter is subject to the impact of inflation in the rising cost of freight, fuel and other raw materials and
commodities. We will continue to look for opportunities to offset the impact from these incremental
expenses.

As I wrap up, I want to highlight that our 2021 investor conference will be held on Monday, September 20
in Deerfield, Illinois. At the conference, we plan to focus on our key strategic objectives to enhance growth
and drive innovation. In addition, as a critical part of our ongoing business transformation, Jim Borzi,
Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, will outline the next phase of our manufacturing
supply chain journey, which is expected to enhance our operational effectiveness and drive margin
improvement.

Now I'll pass it to Jay, who will share a closer look at our results and our outlook for the balance of the
year.

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong second
quarter performance. Second quarter 2021 global sales of $3.1 billion advanced 14% on a reported basis,
9% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an operational basis. Sales growth this quarter reflects
the ongoing recovery in hospital and surgical volumes, along with the benefit from COVID vaccines. We
estimate these factors contributed just over 450 basis points of sales growth in the quarter. OUS sales of
Caelyx/Doxil totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter.

On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 25% to $0.80 per share, exceeding our guidance range
driven by disciplined operational execution, and a lower-than-expected tax rate.

Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories. Starting with our
three regional segments. Sales in the Americas increased 8% on both a constant currency and operational
basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 8% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an
operational basis, and sales in our Asia Pac region advanced 10% on a constant currency basis and 9%
operationally.

Moving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this quarter, constant currency growth
is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for our Pharmaceuticals business, for
which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusted for the acquisition of rights
in select territories outside the U.S. of the Caelyx and Doxil.

Global sales for Renal care were $964 million, were flat on a constant currency basis. Performance in
the quarter was driven by our PD business, where we observed both the sequential and year-over-
year improvement in global patient volumes. This was partially offset by declining international sales
of in-center HD dialyzers, reflecting the impact from the pandemic as well as competitive dynamics.
We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient
diagnoses resulting from the pandemic. Our expectation remains that PD patient volumes will continue to
ramp over the course of the year, although the pace may vary by market.

In particular, we are monitoring COVID resurgences in Asia Pac and parts of the Europe. Sales in
Medication Delivery of $697 million, increased 12% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in
this business reflects the recovery in the pace of hospital admissions in many markets following the height
of the pandemic last year.

We estimate that in the second quarter, the rate of U.S. hospital admissions was down approximately 7%
as compared to pre-COVID levels, a market improvement from the second quarter of 2020, which saw
U.S. admissions down approximately 20%.

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Pharmaceutical sales of $546 million, advanced 5% on a constant currency basis and were flat to
prior year on an operational basis. Performance in the quarter benefited from the recovery in surgical
procedures and hospital admissions, demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and
the contribution from OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil. This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S.
generic injectables portfolio, which faced a headwind from prior year sales of select injectable drugs used
to treat critical COVID-19 patients as well as increased competitive activity for certain molecules.

Moving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $237 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency
basis. Performance in the quarter was driven primarily by growth in the U.S., partially offset by lower
international sales of vitamins resulting from supply constraints.

Sales in Advanced Surgery were $256 million, increasing 48% on a constant currency basis. Within
the quarter, we estimate surgical procedures were at or slightly above pre-COVID levels, contributing
to strength in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $188 million, declining 4% on a
constant currency basis, reflecting the challenging year-over-year comparison due to surge in product
demand this time last year related to the COVID pandemic. As Joe mentioned, we anticipate that COVID-
related demand for CRRT will moderate this year, but will improve over time through the launch of new
products and increased awareness of this therapy.

BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $183 million, representing growth of 49% on a constant
currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines.

Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42.6% increased by 100 basis points
over the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in manufacturing and a favorable product
mix as the impact from COVID receives. Adjusted SG&A of $649 million increased 12% on a reported
basis, reflecting the impact from foreign exchange, the improvement in sales and resulting increase
in commissions and increased promotional spend in support of new product launches. Adjusted R&D
spending in the quarter of $139 million increased 18% on a reported basis driven by the impact of foreign
exchange and investments in our new product pipeline. Both adjusted SG&A and R&D spending reflect a
somewhat more normalized level of spend, as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a
result of the pandemic, particularly those related to employee bonus accruals. Adjusted operating margin
in the quarter was 17.2%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense
totaled $34 million in the quarter, and other nonoperating income contributed $2 million in the quarter.

The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, an increase over the prior year driven by lower stock-
based compensation award deductions as compared to the prior year period. The tax rate was favorable
to our expectations driven by a favorable change in earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted
earnings of $0.80 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.72 to $0.75 per share.

Within the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $300 million or 3.7 million shares of common
stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $600 million or 7.3 million shares of common stock, which has
been partially offset by option-related dilution. On a net basis, our outstanding share count has declined
by approximately 5 million shares through the second quarter. In addition, during the second quarter, we
announced a 14% increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate. The strength of our financial
position has fueled our ability to increase our quarterly dividend rate on an annual basis for the sixth
consecutive year.

We continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is balance between inorganic and
organic initiatives with the objective of accelerating growth and expanding margins, driving innovation and
returning value to our shareholders.

With respect to cash flow in the first half of 2021, we've generated $854 million of operating cash flow and
$525 million in free cash flow.

Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021. For
full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 8% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a
constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately
100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil

as well as approximately 250 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported
growth.

Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates will stay below pre-COVID
levels with rates improving throughout the year, and exiting down low single digits. Based on surgical
procedure data in the U.S. to date, we now expect surgical procedures will continue to be a 100% of pre-
COVID levels for the remainder of the year.

Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand between 40 to 60
basis points. For the year, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17.5% and a full year diluted
average share count of approximately 510 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2021
adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $3.49 to $3.55 per diluted share.

Specific to the third quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 9% on a reported
basis, approximately 7% on a constant currency basis and approximately 6% on an operational basis. And
we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share.
With that, we can now open the call up for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded, and a digital
replay will be available on the Baxter international website for 60 days at www.baxter.com.

And our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Securities.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can you hear me, okay?

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Yes. We can, Bob.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I just have 2 questions, and I'll just state them upfront in the interest of time. So I guess, first for --
maybe for Jay. Just wondering if you could flesh out the Renal performance in the quarter, a little bit more
what happened internationally? And how quickly you think Renal could get back to better growth rates.
So that's question number one. And then a follow-up on question number 2 is more strategic for Joe. And
Joe, I realize you won't talk about market speculation, but I do think it would be helpful for investors to
hear maybe a little bit of an update on your thoughts on M&A generally and maybe talk about what the
circumstances would have to be for you to pursue a larger deal? How important it is that M&A improves
the company's growth rate, things of that nature? I just think an update there would be much appreciated.
So those are my 2 questions.

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Great. I'll address the Renal question first from a Q2 performance standpoint and then turn it over to Joe
for the second question. Overall, as you mentioned, the U.S. had a solid performance in Renal growing
4%. We ended up -- TD was a little bit in excess of that 5% with the HD business slightly below that. And
then internationally, you're right, we had a decline in the quarter, which we do not expect to continue.
There were a couple of drivers of that. One is we've talked historically about patient census challenges,
and that being a headwind that we're facing and contending with this year, which is kind of disrupted the
normal orderly cadence of patient growth that we see internationally. And that was pronounced in the
second quarter. Our PD business actually slightly declined, so 1% decline in the quarter. We do expect that
to return starting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And frankly, we've seen, in certain markets,
delays in procedures of establishing new PD patients, like, for example, in Japan, along with this patient
census issue. All of these things came together to impact the growth rate in the quarter. Like I say, in the
second half of the year, we do expect to see an acceleration and feel solid about that.

And then in the HD business, we did have some pricing competition on dialyzers. We see that from time-
to-time. So the HD business declined in mid-single digits, and we will expect that to normalize in the
second half of the year. So while -- the Renal business has been a fairly consistent performer for us
internationally. And if you look at that over a series of multiple quarters, I think you can expect -- or you
can gain some confidence in the second half of the year, we'll grow that business internationally, roughly
3%. And I'll turn it over to Joe to address the other question.

Jose E. Almeida

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Thank you, Jay. Let me give you, how I think about M&A, to answer your question, Bob. First is size being
a secondary conversation. First is you strategically fit for the company. We look at the areas of growth
for the future. You look what is going to make a difference in the healthcare in 5 to 10 years, where this
Baxter is going. It's now where the puck is where the puck is going. Sometimes we get it attached to
growth rates and things of where things are. We've got to look where things are going. And Baxter is
doing a lot in connected health, and we need to make sure that we have the ability to deploy capital in
that area as well as adjacencies.

Going into areas of no correlation to Baxter to create [indiscernible] presenting much more challenging
environment for the company in terms of M&A. Not impossible to do it, but it's something that is more
difficult. Second is how do we see returns. The returns are always the same. We look at internal rate of
returns to be above our cost of capital, about a few hundred basis points as well as we look at ROIC very
similarly on a 5-year base posted deal.

We look also the ability for the company to generate cash flow and our ability to bring the company
integrated into Baxter, which I feel confident that we, through our digital transformation, have a much
better ability of bringing companies in than a few years ago.

And the third and last one is that not every deal is created the same, and we examine multiple
opportunities at all times. So the company has a significant amount of cash. And it doesn't go against
deals. It goes back to the shareholders in form of -- in terms of buybacks, as we have done. As you saw,
we just did some buyback this quarter. And for the year, we are around $600 million. So this is how I think
about M&A.

Operator

Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan is on the line with a question.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Appreciate it. Jay, maybe I could start with you. I wanted to touch on guidance. You guys had a really nice
EPS beat in the quarter. You have admissions trending towards pre-COVID levels over the back part of the
year. Maybe you could just walk us through the updated guidance and how you ended up, where you did,
especially on EPS.

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. You're right, Robbie. Thus far, we're seeing a fairly stable admissions environment relative to our
expectations. Underlying our guidance, we're expecting roughly 98% of admissions in the United States
in the fourth quarter of the year. We watch that, of course, very carefully, and I've talked about the risk
and the sensitivity around that in the past, and we're particularly watching given the delta variant, but feel
solid that we've got our hands around this at this point.

And so then as we translate that to the rest of the P&L, let me talk first about a full year basis and then
maybe make some comments on the second half. On a full year basis, we are seeing some challenges
in the Pharmaceuticals business related to competition and pricing. And so on a full year basis, probably
$0.06 of a headwind from pharma offset by $0.06 of a benefit from our BioPharma Solutions business,
which is performing better than our expectations. So those items kind of -- sort of counteract each
other. And then we have roughly $0.08 or so on a full year basis of global supply chain costs that we're
contending with. And so essentially, we're seeing things like freight and premium freight cost, that's
roughly $0.03. We actually have a fairly substantial manufacturing facility in Colombia. We've had a couple
of cents of impact from Colombia unrest and ensuring we're getting product to our patients and product
out of the country in an expeditious manner. And then, of course, through some purchase price variations,
which there is some inflation in that rounding out the $0.08.

But offsetting that, we have -- we're committed to really using resources efficiently as a company. And
so we're able to counteract the vast majority of that. So roughly $0.07 of benefit from measures that we

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

have in place that are enhanced versus our expectations, really looking at all of the spending categories
and challenging ourselves to make sure that we're using resources as efficiently as possible. Of course,
when we do those exercises, we don't touch things like quality or critical R&D programs, but we really do
look hard at the cost base to ensure we're being efficient and offsetting where possible.

So that's really the story on a full year basis. But if you think about it -- and then there's financial
assumptions that kind of wash out, we had some benefit in the first half from a number of assumptions,
and then we have some headwinds in the second half. But if you look at it exclusively from a second half
standpoint, I'll say that FX is actually $0.03 of impact. So that is really one of the big drivers of the second
half performance. We've seen dollar strengthening. And so that has an impact on our translation back of
our overseas business. That's roughly $0.03. BPS and Pharma, again, kind of wash out in the second half.
And then we have a couple of cents of supply chain expenses. But I think really the most notable impact
to the second half is this foreign exchange impact that we're contending with right now.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And Jay, I don't know if you want to take this, or Joe. I think it is worthwhile spending a little more
time on the $0.06 pharma headwind. What's driving that? What drugs? What makes you feel better, you
could overcome it in the second half? And just any detail there would be great.

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Robbie, when we think about pharma, what's the value proposition of our pharma business is complex
formulations and delivery in novel ways, premixes and waste that have not been yet launched or a
combination of both. So we are in process of delivering our portfolio. The conditions of the market have
deteriorated in terms of pricing headwinds as well as COVID, with the patients that have not gone to
a hospital, and the budget of the pharmacies, right? So when we look at this whole thing, where do
we stand today? We still see the headwinds that, that business has. Don't confuse the whole category
that we have, which is -- has two very separate businesses. One is our anesthesia business, which are
gases. Instead of gases -- and that has declined consistently over the last 24 months because the type
of delivery systems the anesthesiologists are using across the globe for gas from our Pharmaceutical
business. So I tell you that we just had three products conditionally approved. We're going to be launching
three in the next 6 to 9 months. We are excited about the portfolio and follows the same recipe of difficult
to formulate, and novel ways of delivering.

So if you think about that, it is still a good business, has very, very, very strong and healthy profitability.
So what we need to do is to make sure that our innovation will -- does not stop, and we continue to bring
products organically and sometimes inorganically to the portfolio to be able to augment the growth of this
business and keep ahead of the competition. Baxter has put together a very good group of R&D scientists
in the United States as well as India. And together, they are working 24 hours a day in tandem to be able
to deliver on that. I'm still fan up that portfolio, understanding the headwinds that, that portfolio can have
every so often, as some drugs will go out in contribution based on competition, but then we're able to
launch new products. Remember, there are 22 new product launches this year, probably around half of
them are Pharmaceutical products. So we do not see a long-term issue for this business, but more so a --
every so often issue that you have -- when you have competition coming into your market that has just
happened in the last 12 months.

Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank is on the line with a question.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Two on Renal. The first one is the U.S. grew sequentially about $1 million. Can you walk us through
sequential PD growth versus non-PD? And how much the January excess mortality from COVID impacted
that sequential growth?

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

So, Pito, I will start, and Jay will pick up from there. Our sequential growth has improved from Q1 to Q2 in
the overall U.S. market from 3.3% to about 4% in Q2 and going there to peak about 6% in Q4 for a pretty
good performance on a post-2020 year, which is -- which was really hit hard in terms of new patients and
the death of patients on COVID.

I would say that the PD market is still very much a good market to be in. It has grown above the overall
renal dialysis business across the globe. Particularly in the U.S., we're still very optimistic on the vector
of the growth that despite all that happened in 2020, we're able to have growth this year and expect to
return to a high single-digit patient growth to double-digit patient growth, probably towards the end of '22
going into 2023.

Clare Trachtman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. And Pito, just to add to that, basically, by the end of the year, we would expect the dialysis population
in the U.S. to grow just under 1%. So it is starting to recover after being down more than 2%. Again, this
is the treated dialysis population in 2020. So it will return to grow up this year and then continue to grow
even faster in 2022 and beyond.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then a follow-up question on the renal OUS. How much of the impact that you guys saw
in this quarter was from excess mortality from COVID? Like you mentioned to Bob that you expect this to
normalize in the back half of the year. I just want to understand how much is purely temporary like the
procedures in Japan for PD versus more permanent in nature?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So what I would say is it is really a mix of those two items, and we don't differentiate -- we don't split
that out for a number of different reasons, but understand those drivers internally. The 1% decline, we're
going to expect to see in the second half of the year 4% growth, as we start to see procedures normalize
and then we start to lap the headwind of the very unfortunate patient mortality situation. So again, if you
look at -- as I commented earlier, if you look at the international business on a rolling 12-month basis in
PD and renal internationally, it's a solid grower for us. We expect that story to continue moving forward.

Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI is on the line with a question.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Maybe my first one, a high-level big picture question for Joe. Joe, when you think about the business at
pre-pandemic versus post-pandemic, at a very high level, has anything changed fundamentally for the
business, right? Whether when you look at your end markets, margin structure -- and -- but fundamental
-- I mean, there are obviously some temporal issues here, but these all seem to be workable, solvable,
temporal in nature, but fundamentally, has anything change when you think about the pre- and post-
pandemic universe?

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Vijay, I think that there is changes in how patients are being treated and how hospitals are seeing the
influx of patients. I -- when you think about 2019, you saw -- and you see how we are looking at for the
rest of the year, we see this year as a recovery year where the admissions towards the end of the year,

12

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

they exit into 2022, will be probably 100% -- 98% to 100% of going back to the admission flow rates
that we've had before. So if you think about the major dynamics of the market, I would say there is a
move from the acute care to the less acute care. And what is the impact for Baxter? If you think about
Baxter as a healthcare supply company, with products that are must have, independents that are setting.
We follow the patient with our products in many places. If you go to a less acute site, you will need a
pump no matter what, you still need fluids, you need medicines, injectables, you still need things that are
needed to treat that patient. To the home side, we have that advantage and have spoken about the PD
advantage that is a positive for the company, not only by the rule in the U.S. with a kidney dialysis and
transplant changes that were done during President Trump's tenure, but also the place to be, if you have
sick patients that don't want to go to acute sites or dialysis clinics. So that is a positive.

When we look at what I see is temporary, the inflation that we are seeing in the disruption in supply
chain, I think not only Baxter is working hard to offset that, but also I don't believe those are fundamental
changes that will alter the -- completely the going-forward dynamic of our logistic costs as well as raw
material costs. We will face headwinds in this area. We have spoken about the cost of containers, are very
expensive, fuel and everything else. We're offsetting that, as you could see this quarter, and we have done
for the year, and we plan to continue to do it.

The thing is how do you see that? Is that a fundamental change in the cost structure? We don't think so.
We think that, that will eventually subside. But at the moment, we don't have that in our numbers. In our
numbers what we have is us offsetting headwinds coming in from the cost point of view. Market-wise, as
I said, they are changed a significant amount of telehealth, connecting the dots of information coming
from ICUs. So the better off -- we will be better off, but continue to develop our digital health products
as we're doing. If you think about our share source with the companion -- with the mobile companion
that we just launched earlier this year, a true view in our CRT as well as half of the portfolio with the FDA
today. Regarding our new pump, is not a mechanical/electrical pump, is actually software that is going
with it that will be installed in the hospitals networks as gateway to be able to manage traffic and bring
information back and forth. So that boat has shipped -- that boat has sailed. There's no way to not be in
the connected market going forward.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's extremely helpful, Joe. Jay, one quick one for you. You take a lot of pride in free cash flows.
Obviously, the pandemic, there's been a lot of moving parts. Year-to-date, the free cash conversion is up
70%. I'm curious what are temporal items here? And should we think about Baxter -- when should we
think about Baxter getting back to being a premium free cash conversion company?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks for the question, Vijay. As you know, Joe and I are both really focused on driving free cash flow
and driving free cash flow performance sustainably. And frankly, we've made a series of decisions over the
last couple of years to suboptimize the base case, to protect against severe situations that could emerge.
All of these things were absolutely the right thing to do, carrying extra inventory into the pandemic. As we
sit here today, carrying select inventory of incremental product, as we look at a hurricane season, which
could be a challenge. And so these things have -- we've had a little bit excess inventory relative to our
normal expectations. As we move towards the end of the year, and as we've been able to improve the
predictability of sales by product line in a post-pandemic world, we'll start to be able to optimize cash flow
a little bit more carefully and closely.

And so I think as we move to 2022 and '23, we'll start to see more normal years for cash flow. Obviously,
2020 was a huge anomaly. 2021 continues to be anomalous because of, again, just really being sensitive
to having enough product available to support patients in a very challenging situation. But as I said, I
think as we emerge in 2022 and '23, we'll be able to optimize the inventory a little bit better, continue our
focus on accounts receivable. And then furthermore, on the days payable really work to optimize that,
working closely with our suppliers.

And then finally, from a CapEx standpoint, there are certain investments that we always make, and we'll
continue to make those, especially those that support growth in businesses like our PD business. So we'll
continue to look for those value-creating opportunities, and those exist. So we'll have more CapEx, and
that will be a continued area for us of great investment. But I think 2022 starts to become a more normal
year and then even more so in future beyond that.

Lawrence Biegelsen of Wells Fargo is on the line with a question.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

One on BPS, one on NOVUM IQ. Obviously, Joe, BPS was really strong this quarter. I'd love to understand
the contribution from the COVID vaccine. And how sustainable that is? How should we think about --
is that still a $50 million to $100 million annual opportunity? And Joe, you signed a contract last year
with a partner on a non-COVID vaccine. So when could we start to see that contributing? Just trying to
understand the outlook for BPS. And I had one follow-up.

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

The outlook has been improving [Audio Gap] $100 million this year of contribution from BPS.

Clare Trachtman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Specific to the COVID vaccine.

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Specifically with COVID vaccine. Now BPS [Audio Gap]

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

[Audio Gap] there's no way to comment on that at this point.

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

It's tough, Larry. We -- on one side, we hope that we don't ever need to produce another [file of] vaccine.
So this disease goes away, and the world is back to normal. On the other hand, we're doing what we
can to help the world get through this. So I would say that you're probably going to have some residual
production in 2022. Because as you can see, it was overseas about a few weeks ago. And the scarcity of
vaccine is remarkable. So there's still a lot of places in the world that don't have vaccines. And I think
eventually, those vaccines will reach there. So we're not making a prediction in 2022, but we think there
will be residual production in 2022 for vaccines.

Clare Trachtman
Vice President of Investor Relations

And we do have, some of our projects, to extend out through 2022 as well.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

On NOVUM IQ, Joe. Obviously, it's a very important product for you. I'm wondering if you'll talk a little bit
about the nature of the questions you received and the timing of the response and your confidence in the
2021 approval.

Jose E. Almeida

Larry, I'll give you an update overall, but the nature of the question is a little too much. We're not going to
get into it. But I would say, all the questions are answerable and all the questions are not out of this world
in terms of complexity to put them on a piece of paper and get back to the FDA.

I don't comment, all of you know on the call. And outside the call that I don't comment on behalf of the
agency. The agency will do what the agency will do. What we can do is make sure that our engineers and
scientists and the regulatory folks are focused on this. We have a lot of people focused on getting those
answers to the FDA. We hope that they will be happy with the answers. And we can have the product
launched this year as we're planning at the moment.

I also want to just make sure that you all know, we're having pretty good demand for our spectrum pump
-- our current pump, so it's not all or nothing. We do have really good demand for our pump, very large
contracts coming about. So I just want to make sure that we feel very comfortable with where we are in
terms of our technical responses to the FDA, we think we have it. We are very happy with the design of
the bump and the future that holds because it's a very different platform that will hit the markets when
approved and hopefully bring this industry at a different level of technology. But nevertheless, Baxter has
three different groups of pumps, NOVUM IQ, Spectrum, Version 9 as well as the pump that is yet to be
approved by the FDA.

Operator

Danielle Antalffy of SVB Leerink is on the line with a question.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Just a follow-up to Vijay's question. Jay, this is for you on what's fundamentally changed. You did have
pretty strong SG&A control this quarter. And just wondering, is that something that's sustainable going
forward? And should we be thinking about that as a more meaningful lever going forward as we head into
the Analyst Meeting? And I have one more higher-level follow-up.

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I think the controls that we had in place, we were pleased that we were able to save a substantial
amount in the second quarter, roughly $0.06 relative to our expectations on the OpEx line. And as we
move to the full year, there's probably a couple more cents relative to our expectations. We'll always look
to optimize spending for sure. And what we were pleased that we were able to drive an impact in the
face of a challenging worldwide supply chain environment, in the second quarter. But there is part of the
savings that we experienced this year that are related to a slower resumption of activity. And so as we
look at the second quarter, we had sort of anticipated a very substantial increase in SG&A. You'll note that
we did have a nice-sized increase in SG&A, but it was just not quite at the pace that we anticipated. So
we'll expect that to resume.

Here's what I would say about SG&A and other spending categories and cost of goods going forward.
At the Investor Day, we'll talk about things like the work that Jim Borzi is doing to really optimize
manufacturing and supply chain and really taking a cutting-edge approach in that arena. And then the
other thing that I will tell you about is the digital transformation that we're undertaking, and that will
have a nice impact in terms of really spending across the company. And I think that's something that will
feature prominently. In the meantime, we were pleased to drive a short-term result, but I don't think all
the changes that we're making are the ones that we'll be talking about with you when we get together in
September.

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Understood. And then, Joe, I guess the question is for you. And again, back to shifting fundamentals,
you mentioned site of care, things like that. How are pricing conversations or contracting conversations
different between the two sites of care, talking more ambulatory or outpatient versus hospital and
inpatient. And is that something that we need to consider as we look over the long term for Baxter?

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

Danielle, I will say that a lot of these sites are owned by large hospital systems. They are not just
independent sites. The configuration of products in some of those sites are different than use in hospitals.
So price points may differ for products used in non-acute or step down -- significant step down of facilities
that are not part of a hospital campus. But that is not -- there's no 2 different conversations going on.
We believe that our products are -- have price consistency across customers. And we negotiate every
single contract with the intent to have as much penetration as we can within that integrated supply chain
for the hospital. So if you think about negotiations are all about class of products, and quality availability
of products and evidently, price is a big deal, no best price usually wins. So I don't see tremendous
distinction.

Operator

Matt Miksic of Credit Suisse is on line with a question.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wanted to ask a follow-up for Jay on some of the environmental trends that you're seeing. And then I
had one question for Joe as well, if I could. So on January remarks, you mentioned this sort of sustained
high level of surgical volume performance you're expecting in the U.S. throughout the rest of the year. And
I'm just wondering where -- what gives you that confidence or visibility that that's kind of where it will
stay. And I mentioned one follow-up.

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes, in my prepared remarks, we commented that we're seeing roughly -- at historic levels of
surgical procedures, roughly 100% of prior levels. We have some line of sight in the short term, but our
crystal ball gets murky as we look towards year-end. That's very clear. And so I would say that one point
of procedure volume in the U.S. is roughly $0.5 million of impact per month. And so that's something that
we watch carefully. I think when we put together the sales guidance for the year, we have the ability to
withstand a little bit of softness in surgical procedures and admissions, as it relates to Delta variant. But
this is an uncertainty that we're contending with, not only on the surgical procedure side, but also on the
admission side.

And I've talked historically about a lot of the work that we've done in terms of forecasting and modeling.
And I think we've done a really good job kind of relating our business to some of these fundamental
drivers. But you're right, there are -- this is a valve of world that we're living in today. And we'll have to
watch carefully as we move through the rest of the year if the virus changes course substantially. At this
point, we don't have any reason to believe that will be the case and feel good about the numbers. I've
sized the downside risk, it's not enormous. So I think we're in okay shape.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's great. And then just one follow-up for Joe. I think to Bob's question, you had mentioned that size
was not so much of a consideration or determinant, but -- that I'd love to get your sense of -- I guess
2 things on the M&A environment. One is sort of asset pricing or the challenges that you face in making
a med device or supply of acquisition in this environment. That's been a part of the conversation for
Baxter for a number of years. And then also the balance that you see, the pluses and minuses of putting

more capital work in a large deal, the risks associated with that and continuing with some of the tuck-in
acquisitions that you've done before?

Jose E. Almeida
Chairman of the Board, President & CEO

If you think about tuck-in acquisitions, they're always going to be there because it's a way for us to
augment product lines and adjacencies. We just announced actually one today. And that is a good way.
We don't have that kind of product. We need that kind of product to compete. So there's a really good
thing where we saw in our Pharmaceutical business with Doxil and Caelyx. So it is needed. But then you
think about where the future of healthcare is going, where the confluence of the forces coming about,
how do we look at our portfolio going forward and what would be a good complement for the portfolio.
So the size doesn't play a role, obviously, if it's something enormous and unachievable, we don't discuss
that. But the size by itself will never be a determinant. As I said before, this is strategic -- strategy or
strategic appeal. Second is the returns. The third would be our ability to integrate well. And if we don't
find anything to deploy the cash, we deploy the cash back to the shareholders. So don't think about size
ever been a determinant, think about strategic fit and future of healthcare.

The last question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi Group.

Joanne Karen Wuensch

Just a couple of pieces of clarification. What was the COVID vaccine benefit in the quarter on a dollar
basis?

It was just over $40 million.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I'm sorry, $30 million?

Clare Trachtman

$40 million, 4-0. Just over $40 million.

Joanne Karen Wuensch

Excellent. And how much NOVUM IQ dollars incentive in the current guidance?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We have approximately a little north of $25 million in the fourth quarter.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And just to confirm, you're expecting hospital volumes to be at pre-COVID levels exiting the year?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

No. At 98% in the fourth quarter. And so if we were to split it at the very end of the year, the run rate
would be basically at the prior year level, so into Q1 of next year.

I just want to make sure that you all know that our -- we are not predictors of disease here, neither
infection rates. So we do the best we can in putting our models in place. We base our numbers on that.
We will all expect to, hopefully, the Delta variant will be contained in most places in the world, and we
move on. But at the moment, the admissions in the U.S. of course were 98%, exiting the year hopefully
in 2022 at 100%, things can change, as you can see by the infection rates, but the death is still much
smaller than were before. So we do the best we can, when we give these numbers, is what we think is
