Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the CBRE Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Burke, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance and
Investor Relations for CBRE. Thank you. You may begin.

Bradley Kenneth Burke
Head of Investor Relations

Good morning, everyone. And welcome to CBRE's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference call. I am
pleased to introduce Kristyn Farahmand, who joined CBRE in October as Vice President of Investor
Relations and Corporate Finance. Many of you have already met or interacted with Kristyn and she'll
serve as your primary point of contact with the company. Kristyn will also host our earnings calls, so I am
pleased to turn the call over to her. Kristyn?

Kristyn Farahmand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Finance

Thanks, Brad. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and it is posted
on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that
you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an excel file that contains additional
supplemental materials.

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll provide an overview of our financial results
for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Leah Stearns, our Chief
Financial Officer, will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up
the call for your questions.

Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve
a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding
CBRE's future growth momentum, operations, market share, business outlook, capital deployment,
acquisition integration and financial performance, including our 2020 outlook and any other statements
regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that
we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or
circumstances.

You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors
may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may
impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings press release and our
most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have
provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP
financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures along with
explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck.

Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the fourth quarter
of 2019. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was up 9% to $1.32 on revenue growth of 13% and
fee revenue growth of 8%. For the full year, revenue and adjusted EBITDA set new milestones for the
company at $23.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Adjusted EPS for 2019 rose 13% to $3.71.

Now for an update on our business fundamentals, please turn to Slide 6, and I will turn the call over to
Bob.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, CBRE ended 2019 with solid growth,
highlighting the benefits of our diverse business and resulting in our 10th consecutive year of double-digit
adjusted earnings per share growth.

Our fourth quarter performance was led by very strong property sales, particularly in the U.S., U.K. and
Continental Europe. This performance has extended into 2020 as investors continue to believe commercial
real estate is attractive relative to other asset classes.

Growth was also very strong in our Occupier Outsourcing business, Global Workplace Solutions, where
our scale and increasingly differentiated capability enable us to capture a growing share of this expanding
market. This is particularly true regarding global multiservice opportunities. Leasing declined year-over-
year, partially offsetting the gains in sales and outsourcing. However, it is notable that Q4 2019 was
the second largest leasing quarter in the history of our company, trailing only 2018's fourth quarter. We
remain optimistic on leasing growth in 2020, although we will have challenging comparisons in the year's
first half. Our view is informed by a survey of our top leasing clients who indicated they intend to lease
slightly more space this year than in 2019.

The contribution from our Real Estate Investments segment was down due largely to a delay in the timing
of certain large asset sales. Several of these assets have already been sold in the first quarter. We expect
2020 to be a solid year for asset sales in this business with our development activity at record levels. We
continue to see a backdrop that supports strong business performance. While we are closely watching the
potential impact of ongoing risks, particularly the coronavirus, we expect global economic growth to be on
par with 2019 based on what we know today. With this in mind, we expect that macro conditions and our
ability to take market share should drive our 11th consecutive year of solid double-digit adjusted earnings
per share growth in 2020. Leah will describe our 2020 outlook in detail after she reviews the quarter's
performance and our financial position. Leah?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 3% over the
prior year period, while adjusted EBITDA rose over 4%. This positive operating leverage drove our fifth
consecutive quarter of margin expansion in our advisory business, with adjusted EBITDA margin on fee
revenue increasing 30 basis points to approach 21%.

Excluding the impact of OMSR gains, which can fluctuate significantly in any given quarter, our advisory
margins expanded by nearly 90 basis points. Performance was driven by notable strengths in EMEA and to
a lesser degree, Asia Pacific.

Revenue growth was led by global property sales, which grew 21%, resulting in new quarterly and annual
revenue records for property sales. Strong growth was achieved in most parts of the world, led by the
United Kingdom, up 44%; Continental Europe, up 34%, which was driven by double-digit growth in our
largest markets in the region, France and Germany; and the United States, which was up over 20%.

We continue to benefit from market share expansion, and for the full year 2019, we gained nearly 120
basis points of share in the U.S., according to Real Capital Analytics.

Our fourth quarter U.S. property sales activity was notably robust for large transactions with sales over
$100 million, up 88% compared to last year. We also saw broad-based growth across property types with
office, industrial and hotel transactions, all increasing significantly.

Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 15% as a result of slower activity from the
government-sponsored enterprises earlier in the year. Prior to the formation of the new caps, which, as
expected, impacted transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Origination with other lending sources,
notably private equity debt funds and insurance companies, continued to increase.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

At the outset of 2020, debt capital remains plentiful at attractive rates from a variety of capital sources,
including government-sponsored enterprises, which have actively returned to the market.

Our loan servicing portfolio ended the year at $230 billion, up over 19% from year-end 2018. As expected,
leasing activity decelerated sequentially in Q4, with leasing in our advisory business down nearly 7%,
which compares with a record quarter in Q4 2018 when leasing revenue rose over 25%.

Leasing revenue in our largest market, the U.S. declined by about 10%, driven by a particularly tough
prior year comparison, which saw growth of nearly 33% and the lagging impact of a slight macroeconomic
deterioration that occurred earlier in 2019. In addition, prior year growth included a benefit of about 6%
from M&A activity, and we did not see a similar benefit in the current year's fourth quarter.

Lastly, co-working adversely impacted leasing growth by about 3%, a similar level to that of the third
quarter of 2019.

Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by
approximately 19% and 13%, respectively. Strong revenue growth, combined with focused cost discipline
drove adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 24% on over 120 basis points of margin expansion. Notably,
margins improved on a year-over-year basis across all 3 lines of business, facilities management, project
management and transaction services.

Occupier demand for multiple services remains robust, with new contracts encompassing our full suite of
services accounting for 40% of the new business secured in the fourth quarter, as measured by EBITDA.

In one prominent example, we extended our relationship with Merck, the U.S.-based pharmaceutical
company. We have been providing facilities management and project management services in Europe and
have now added facilities management in the U.S. and Latin America and expanded into transactions and
other real estate services globally.

The GWS new business pipeline also remains strong as we kick-off 2020. This pipeline is dominated by
well-known companies with complex worldwide requirements that are well served by a globally integrated
firm like CBRE.

Flipping to Slide 10. Let's now take a look at our Real Estate Investment segment. The $9 million year-
over-year decline in this segment's adjusted EBITDA stemmed primarily from certain large asset sales in
the Development and Investment Management businesses, shifting from the fourth quarter of 2019 to
early 2020. This shift resulted in about $18 million of adjusted EBITDA, moving from the fourth quarter
of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Several of these deals have subsequently closed at valuations in line
with previous underwriting assumptions.

Investments in the start-up of our Flexible Workspace business, Hana, also contributed about $8 million
to the adjusted EBITDA decline. We opened our first 3 Hana units in 2019, and we expect 15 to 20 units
to be opened by the end of 2020. We are pleased with the reception to Hana and believe we are well
suited to operate Flexible Workspaces for institutional property owners, given our creditworthiness and the
secular growth of agile workspaces.

We are pursuing a variety of deal structures, including traditional leases and see these structures moving
towards partnerships, management agreements or other asset-light structures over time.

For the quarter, we had an adjusted EBITDA contribution of about $11 million, consistent with our
underwriting assumptions from Telford Homes, the U.K. multifamily development business we acquired
in October 2019. Our results also included about $98 million revenue related to Telford. The integration
of this business is proceeding as expected. And we remain excited about the opportunity this acquisition
affords us to expand our successful development business into EMEA. This is especially true given the
improved sentiment we are seeing in the U.K. with reduced uncertainty now that they have formally
withdrawn from the EU.

As expected, the U.S. development business improved in Q4 compared with Q3, despite the impact of
some deal slippage into the first quarter of 2020, and we are continuing to transact sales at previously

anticipated valuation levels. In addition, underlying market trends remain strong, as evidenced by our in-
process portfolio and pipeline, together reaching new record levels at year-end 2019, with our in-process
activity increasing by $2.1 billion, while the pipeline increased $2.3 billion, of which more than 65% of the
increase was attributable to Telford.

In Investment Management, we raised $13 billion in capital during 2019, while AUM increased by more
than $6 billion in the quarter to nearly $113 billion. Both our capital raising and total AUM are new records
for the business. Importantly, Investment Management revenue, excluding carried interest, which is
largely recurring fee-based revenue, climbed to approximately $395 million for the year. This drove the
contribution from recurring adjusted EBITDA within the REI business to over 40% of this segment's full
year total adjusted EBITDA.

Turning to our outlook for 2020. On Slide 11, we anticipate another year of solid growth for CBRE, given
our current expectation of the continued appeal of commercial real estate relative to other asset classes
and our cautiously optimistic view that GDP will expand versus 2019.

We also expect the diversity of our revenue across lines of business, our client base and geographies will
be supportive of our growth in 2020. Advisory Services fee revenue is expected to increase in the mid-
single-digit range, driven by growth of a similar range in both leasing and capital markets. This outlook
reflects the tough comparisons we will face in the first half of the year and the activity we've seen so far in
2020. It also reflects a subdued set of expectations for the APAC region, primarily China, as a result of the
impacts from coronavirus.

For the Global Workplace Solutions segment, we anticipate fee revenue rising in the low double-digit
percentage range. We expect to renew and/or expand around 90% of our expiring contracts, consistent
with our historical average. Given the strong growth we've been delivering in this segment and the highly
differentiated platform CBRE offers to our outsourcing clients, we expect to be increasingly focused on
profitability. As a result, we expect to continue to be selective going forward about the accounts we are
willing to service and how we design our commercial approach to them.

Continuing on Slide 12. We expect solid adjusted EBITDA growth from our Advisory and GWS segments
and project adjusted EBITDA from our REI segment will increase significantly to around $250 million, in
part due to the previously discussed shift of certain asset sales into 2020. We expect the contribution from
REI to be roughly equally weighted between the first and second half of the year as compared to 2019,
when over 2/3 of this segment's adjusted EBITDA contribution was recorded in the first half of the year.
This also includes an expected $20 million contribution from the Telford acquisition, which we anticipate
will be roughly offset by our incremental investment in Hana.

As we ramp up Hana, our OpEx investments for 2020 should be approximately $40 million, with almost
half attributable to noncash rent expense.

We also expect the quarterly headwind caused by to abate over the course of the year as occupiers are
drawn to our high-quality workspaces, resulting in revenue growth.

In light of all of these factors and our expectations for below the line items, we expect full year 2020
adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.05 to $4.25. This indicates anticipated growth of around
12% at the midpoint of our range, which, if attained would be our 11th consecutive year of double-digit
adjusted EPS growth.

I would also note that given the cadence of growth achieved in 2019, we would expect 2020 adjusted EPS
growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, with around 60% of total EPS to be generated
in the second half of 2020.

Turning to Slide 13. Our long track record of delivering solid growth across our key financial metrics
has been supported by our capital allocation process. During 2019, we deployed nearly $930 million of
capital. This includes about $272 million for CapEx, net of tenant concessions, of which about half was
discretionary in nature and largely attributable to investments made to enhance the value of the CBRE
digital platform through enablement CapEx.

7

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

This discretionary amount also includes just over $28 million of CapEx to support the launch of Hana.
While we expect the investment per unit to decline in 2020, total CapEx related to Hana should increase to
between $60 million to $70 million as we get more units up and running.

We also spent over $500 million for acquisitions, mostly for Telford as well as for infill M&A. And $145
million for share repurchases, including $51 million in Q4 at an average price of $50.85.

While supporting these investments, we also lowered net leverage by nearly 0.2 turns and ended the year
with significant balance sheet capacity. The investments we made during 2019 are part of our long-term
commitment to enhance the resiliency of our business while extending our leadership position within the
commercial real estate services industry. In fact, since the last cyclical peak, we have reduced our net
leverage by 1.3x, while simultaneously increasing the diversification of our revenues and our exposure to
less cyclical businesses, primarily through investments in our outsourcing business.

This, combined with our healthy balance sheet should afford us the ample capacity to take advantage of
any potential market dislocations that may occur. Our financial position is unrivaled by our peers and will
enable us to opportunistically invest in enhancing our capabilities and extending our long-term growth
trajectory across all parts of the economic cycle.

Finally, we have added free cash flow to our earnings release disclosures. Internally, we are continually
focusing on optimizing our existing business and evaluating new investments on their ability to accelerate
growth while expanding our future cash flows. We believe our ability to grow cash flow while pursuing
strong top and bottom line growth helps drive returns for shareholders. And given this, we believe it is
important to actively report on free cash flow on a regular basis.

With that, I'll ask you to turn to Slide 14 as Bob provides a few closing thoughts.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Leah. Before we take your questions, I'd like to briefly comment on CBRE's efforts around
environmental sustainability, since this is a subject that we are hearing about increasingly from our
shareholders.

CBRE has long been at the forefront of sustainability issues in our sector. With responsibility for managing
nearly 7 billion square feet of space around the world, we are very well positioned to have an impact
on sustainability, and we've been doing just that for some time. We've registered more than 5,600 U.S.
properties in the ENERGY STAR program and have completed more than 1,000 Lean certifications on
behalf of our clients. In our own workplaces, we pledged in 2016 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
30% by the year 2025. We are well on our way to exceeding this goal with emissions already down 28%.

The strides we are making have resulted in CBRE's inclusion in indexes that benchmark sustainability
performance, such as the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good Index. Most
recently, Barron's named us the 13th most sustainable company out of 1,000 major U.S. companies
that were evaluated, reflecting our leading performance on a variety of environmental, social and
governance metrics. We look forward to updating the market in May when we publish our annual corporate
responsibility report.
With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Green with Evercore ISI.

Jason Daniel Green
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just on coronavirus, which seems to be front of mind for everybody right now. I know it might be too
early, but what are you seeing from a sales and leasing perspective in regions or countries that have had
issues with the coronavirus? And then to the extent possible, what's your expectation for how this will flow
through to the real estate sales market moving forward?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Jason, this is Bob. We have not seen a big impact outside of China so far this year, but we're like
everybody else. We're watching this very closely. We're concerned as it spreads. And if it becomes a bigger
issue in the economy, in general, then, of course, it will impact our business. But we don't have a point of
view about this that's different than what you're reading in the papers by others.

Jason Daniel Green
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And then on the U.S. sales being up 18%. Were there any specific regions or asset classes that
captured an outsized allocation of those revenues?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, Jason. It's Leah. In terms of U.S. capital markets, we saw broad-based activity really across almost
every sector. Office, industrial, were very strong. So overall, I would say, quite a good quarter, and
probably the only area of weakness was retail.

Jason Daniel Green
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And then just the last one for me. Just given co-working impacted leasing adversely by 3% in
the quarter. Is that something we should expect over the next 3 quarters, roughly a 3% headwind, just
considering the first 3 quarters of the year didn't really have any slowdown in co-working leasing?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

We saw that 3% last quarter. So I'd say there's probably about 2 more quarters left in terms of that
headwind for leasing.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.

Anthony Paolone
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just to follow-up on the virus impact. So can you just give us a little bit more detail? Like are employees
working from home? Are you seeing lease signings just get pushed out or sales closings pushed out? Like
what is the day-to-day effect in the places where you've seen the most impact?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

Sure, Anthony. With respect to the day-to-day impact, it really is more of a supply issue. I would say
demand continues to be there. We have people who are very active. They're working remotely. It's really
about being able to get out and perform, for example, diligence on properties if we have sales in the
transaction pipeline, things like that. It's not that we're seeing that demand go away. It's just -- there's
a bit of pause with respect to people actually being able to do physical activities on the ground. But we
continue to see a very strong overall environment in terms of asset allocations continuing to flow into
real estate, particularly given their strong position on a relative basis to broader equities and other asset
classes. So we still feel very good about the overall real estate market and the demand drivers there.

Anthony Paolone
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Did you all push any of the activity into 2H because you talked about the growth being a little more second
half of the year loaded? I know there's comps and things like that involved, but is there any of that just
related to pushing back activity because of those?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

I think you're right. I think this is -- we likely won't see it in Q1. It will be more of a Q2 event, and we
have reflected some of that expectation in our international growth within the advisory segment. But we
don't guide to quarterly numbers. So other than just letting you know that we do expect this year to be
more back-end loaded. I think that's probably the extent to which we can give you color.

Anthony Paolone
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then the U.K. and General Europe, capital market trends were very strong. Is that mainly a
comp matter for 4Q? Or how should we think about that parts of the world and even more broadly in
2020?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So we saw the fourth quarter strength really coming in, I guess, a handful of key markets. Really our
largest markets in Continental Europe as well as the U.K. I think in the fourth quarter, we certainly saw
a bit of resumption of activity after the U.K. exited the EU. I think that was just an overhang on the
market, and we certainly saw activity pick up in a very healthy way. I do think we took share in terms
of overall capital markets activity in the U.K. as well as across Europe. And we just had really strong
results, primarily in France, Germany and Spain. So just a really nice quarter from our team from a capital
markets perspective there.

Anthony Paolone
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just last question on Telford. I think you said $20 million EBITDA contribution in 2020,
which would put the multiple over 20x. Is that how we should think about the economics of that? Or
what's...

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

No. Actually, there's a slight difference just in terms of GAAP versus cash with respect to how you would
see those numbers come through, given it is a development business. We actually on a cash basis think
it was more of a 10x deal. It's just with respect to the timing of the divestitures for the development
pipeline.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Funk with Bank of America.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

Michael J. Funk
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a couple. So Bank of America, we cut our global GDP forecast this morning down to 2.8. So just
hoping to get your commentary on the correlation of your business to potentially lower GDP growth versus
things like rates and capital flows. That's the first question.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. I would go back to -- there continue to be very strong fundamentals around real estate. As an asset
class, it continues to be very attractive on a relative basis. And so while there are drivers that influence
us as a result of overall GDP activity, I would just point to the fact that on a relative basis, real estate
is quite an attractive asset class for investors, and we aren't seeing that demand go away. I think that's
probably...

Michael J. Funk
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And then on the mortgage side, obviously, a little bit of a pullback from the GSEs in second half of 2019,
probably there was uncertainty there. What's your expectation for activity in 2020?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think the -- as I noted in my prepared remarks, we had expected there to be a pullback from the
GSEs in the second half of 2019, and that was really a result of the reform around the caps that were put
in place. And since then, we've seen a normalization of activity around that part of our business. And in
fact, a very strong amount of demand coming out of the GSEs.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And then last one, if I could. Just any commentary on strength or weakness of the customer verticals in
terms of leasing activity you're seeing?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Mike, this is Bob. We continue to see real strength in leasing from technology companies. And we see
real strength from distribution-oriented companies in e-commerce. So those are the most notable areas of
strength in our leasing business.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.

Stephen Hardy Sheldon
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

You talked about GWS renewals trending in line, I think, with historical averages this year. But I think
you may have also said something about walking away from certain contracts. Can you talk about that
dynamic, if I heard that correctly? And I guess, some detail on the situations and what you might be
making that decision.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. And then some of the situations where we don't participate, those are RFPs that may not be related
to existing contracts that we are currently managing. So it really is about bringing continuous amount of

to bring a wealth of suite, really -- a comprehensive suite of solutions for our clients. And as a result, we
believe we can provide better service and higher quality experience for them from a facilities management
perspective. And so we're just being very cognizant of that and making sure that as we do pursue new
accounts that we are very disciplined in terms of making sure that we aren't overextending where we
don't need to.

Stephen Hardy Sheldon
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. On the Hana rollout, it seems like you're going to push the pedal more there this
year with 15 to 20 locations opened by year-end. I think you said you would only expect a drag of about
$20 million in 2020 from this expansion on the profit side. So I wanted to ask about that. Can you maybe
help frame what revenue contribution you're roughly expecting this year? And how unit economics may
trend, especially with the different structures you're at least considering?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. In terms of Hana, overall, we are expecting that to be a further drag on 2020 numbers. However, we
do have the expectation of a ramp-up of activity in the second half of the year. That will vary depending
on the ultimate type of transactions that come through the pipeline, whether it's a lease management
agreement or a partnership. Let's say, all in, in terms of revenue, and we expect there to be around $30
million of revenue from Hana in 2020. And again, that will ramp into the second half of the year. There
really isn't much of that in the first half.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

When you think about the guidance, how much risk do you think there is from coronavirus? I'm somewhat
surprised that you're willing to provide guidance at this point, given how much uncertainty there is? And
how it could potentially impact transactions?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Well, again, I think, it's important to remember that a significant portion of our business is indicated
through a very strong pipeline. And as I said in the beginning, demand from our clients, both on the
outsourcing as well as the transactional side of our business continues to be very strong. We are not
seeing today any material pullback as it relates to the broader sentiment from our client base as a result
of coronavirus. Now we are being cautiously optimistic that, that will continue, but we certainly will
provide an update on our next earnings call with respect to that.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Turning to the APAC region, is China approximately 4% of fee revenue? And is it reasonable to
expect that half of that is Property Management and the other half Advisory Services? And then can you
also give an update as to what's going on in Japan, where I believe the Prime Minister just requested all
schools to be shuttered for the next 30 days. How big is Japan as a market for CBRE?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So in terms of China, China is only about 50 basis points of our EBITDA in 2020. So again, a very small
amount of our current expected activity for the year. And Japan is only around 1%, 1.5%. So relative to
our overall business, those are very small components.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And APAC as a whole is about 16% or so of fee revenue, maybe half of that as a contribution to EBITDA.
So what are the other major APAC markets?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So you have Australia, South Korea, Singapore, India.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Has there been any impact to those markets as yet?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Not material. As I said, demand continues to be there. We really see this as more of an issue around
execution if there are necessary kind of in-person diligence activities that need to happen. But again, with
technology, we think that we can leverage that to continue to move transactions to the pipeline. We don't
think it will come to a standstill.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And touching on EMEA, has there been any impact, for example, Italy and perhaps some other Western
European markets are seeing cases and there is a decline in activity reports on Milan, is that the streets
are basically empty? So just wondering if there's any impact in Italy and other close by markets.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Not to date. So we continue to watch that. Italy, again, is less than -- it's about 60 basis points of our
total EBITDA for the year. So we have a very -- again, very diversified global presence. And so again, we
have large multinationals as our client base. We are in over 100 countries around the world. And so while
the majority of that continues to reside in the U.S., and we are growing our contracted revenue base. We
do have some pockets of our business that are in areas that have initially been hotspots of concern as it
relates to the coronavirus, but we are not seeing that flow through to our pipeline as a negative impact.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Turning to leasing. I wanted to ask if there are any markets where you're seeing any changes
in behavior from VC funded companies that are facing pressure for increased discipline around capital
spending? I've heard anecdotally, in some cases, the sublease space increasing in New York and San
Francisco. So I wanted to check in on that.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Jade, we did a survey of our big leasing clients in January and talked -- and sought information on a
number of topics, most notably what markets they were interested in leasing in 2020, and the top markets
were New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago. So we are not seeing weakness in sentiment
from our leasing clients in those markets at this time.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

Okay. Wanted to touch on the GAAP tax rate, if you could give any additional clarity around what drove
that? There's some disclosure in the press release, but I wanted to see if you could provide additional
color.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. We completed a restructuring of some of our international financing entities that resulted in our
ability to recognize that benefit as it relates to our tax rate in 2019. We expect that to provide some
additional benefit in 2020 and 2021. And that will flow through from a cash perspective over the next, let's
say, 18 to 24 months.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Should we be thinking about a lower tax rate from an adjusted earnings perspective for 2020? We're at --
modeling about 23%.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

I think it's going to be about the same from 2019. Just slightly down from that, yes, on an adjusted basis.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Slightly down from that?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Exactly.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And I wanted to also ask about the material weakness disclosure in EMEA, just not sure what caused that
and what the impact was? If you could provide any clarity.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So we did identify the material weakness in our GWS EMEA business, which is about 5% of our
overall consolidated EBITDA. What's important to note is that there was no material misstatement in our
financials. Management identified the issue and has identified the cause as just the rapid growth that,
that business has experienced, and we need to put in stronger controls and reinforce the support for that
part of our business that it's just become much broader and complex than it was 18 to 24 months ago.
That is an isolated issue. It's something that we have a unique system in place there that we'll work on
upgrading. And so those remediations are already underway, and we feel very good about being able to
get that behind us.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And lastly, I just wanted to ask about the M&A outlook. And specifically, if there are business
lines that you believe CBRE would benefit from increased scale. I would imagine that leasing capital
markets and Property Management are already functioning at full scale. So those business lines wouldn't
necessarily benefit from a economies of scale perspective.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

Well, it's important to note that we believe there's lots of headroom for growth along all our business lines.
So you wouldn't -- let me say it differently. We wouldn't be surprised and you shouldn't be surprised to
see us do acquisitions in any part of our business. We have a very active program. Our leaders around the
world and across our lines of business, are always looking for acquisition opportunities that will improve
our ability to deliver to our clients. And of course, when we do those acquisitions, they help us with scale.
We don't start with scale as the parameter we're after. And every once in a while, we'll do one of these
transformational acquisitions if we find the right things. So our strategy around M&A has not changed. And
we think our opportunity to potentially grow any part of our business remains intact as it relates to M&A.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jason Weaver with Compass Point.

Jason Price Weaver
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on rounding yet another strong year in 2019. I just had a couple of questions. Starting
with leverage down considerably at 0.4x now, does that reflect more in your conservatism of the outlook
moving forward, and/or a lack of attractive acquisitions and scale-sized acquisition opportunities in the
marketplace?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

I wouldn't say that. Certainly, our leverage is in a very positive -- relatively strong position for the
business, and we continue to look at allocating capital. Just as we did last year, we spent nearly $1 billion.
We invested in our existing business, we invested in M&A, and we also thought to buy back some shares
from the market, principally to offset the dilution from stock comp. So we'll continue to look at following
that same capital allocation plan. We believe we're very well positioned if we see opportunities in the
market, both in terms of investing in M&A as well as any potential dislocation in terms of valuation from
our shares that we could step in and play a meaningful role on both sides, just to continue to enhance our
ability to grow earnings per share on a go-forward basis.

Jason Price Weaver
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And the adjusted EBITDA margins on the Global Workplace Solutions business seemed reasonably
strong versus peers. I know that there's some differences in structure and accounting treatment out there.
And I know you're also getting more selective in your customer pursuits. But any comment on whether
you can expect that level of profitability to be sustainable on a go-forward basis.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, that's really a top focus of our teams within the GWS segment. If you want to look at a pure
comp on a gross margin basis, that's another way that you can look at it. And I think on a relative basis,
we continue to see improvements on our gross margin, gross EBITDA margin basis as well. So yes, we
believe we'll continue to drive that margin improvement, and that is a top focus for that group this year.

Operator

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back
to Mr. Sulentic for any final comments.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, everyone, for being with us today, and we look forward to talking to you again when we report
our first quarter results.
