Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Edison International Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Teleconference.
My name is Missy, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj,
you may begin your conference.

Sam Ramraj
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Missy, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer,
Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the call are
other members of the management team.

I would like to mention that we are doing this call with our executives in different locations, so please bear
with us if you experience any technical difficulty.

Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-K,
prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute
our regular business update presentation.

During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and
its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that
could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully.

The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to
the nearest GAAP measure. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Pedro.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you, Sam. Let me start the call with our sentiments of support for the residents of Texas and
all the other states that were impacted physically and financially by last week's frigid weather. Climate
change is a major part of the story there, and our industry just has to continue our collective efforts on
climate mitigation and adaptation.

Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $4.52 for 2020. This exceeded the
midpoint of our initial guidance range and is within the narrowed range we updated on our last earnings
call.

Core EPS of $4.52 was lower than $4.70 a year ago, and the decline was due to $0.44 of equity share
dilution. On an operational basis, excluding dilution, core EPS was $0.26 higher, driven by strong
performance at SCE. Maria will discuss our financial performance in detail in her remarks.

In 2020, SCE made substantial progress on its comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy. This continues
to advance one of SCE's top priorities, increasing grid resiliency to adapt to the change in climate and
to protect public safety. SCE accomplished the vast majority of its 2020 program targets and, in many
cases, exceeded those goals despite the challenges we all faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have
highlighted several measures of SCE's progress and execution on Page 2 of the slide deck that we issued
with our earnings release.

Since the end of 2018, SCE's execution of its wildfire mitigation strategy has reduced the risk of wildfires
associated with utility infrastructure despite a record-setting California wildfire season last year. For
the second consecutive year, we do not believe damages from any wildfire alleged to be caused by SCE
equipment will exceed insurance.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

SCE is further accelerating its wildfire mitigation efforts. Earlier this month, the utility filed its 2021
wildfire mitigation plan update, which describes how it has matured its wildfire mitigation capabilities and
outlines the long-term plan to further advance risk informed decision-making, data management, grid
hardening and community engagement. A prime example is the covered conductor program, which will
increase the percentage of distribution overhead circuit miles covered within SCE's high fire risk areas
from approximately 15% today to over 60% by the end of 2023, subject to CPUC approval.

The utility continues to innovate and implement technology-based solutions at options such as early
fault detection for reducing ignition risks. As described in its 2021 WMP, SCE estimates a 25% reduction
in ignitions in high fire risk areas by 2022 as compared to 2020, assuming the same conditions as
experienced in 2020.

SCE continues to improve its public safety power shutoff, or PSPS operations, with public safety being the
paramount consideration. SCE uses PSPS only when conditions warrant. Let me underscore the need for
PSPS despite the hardships it creates. By noting that in 2019 and 2020, post PSPS patrols found at least
60 incidents of wind-related damage that could have potentially caused ignitions. In 2020, the installation
of more weather stations and sectionalization devices, paired with the automation of existing devices,
all enabled SCE to limit PSPS footprints wherever possible based on risk assessments, achieving a 22%
reduction in customer minutes of interruption. All that said, SCE recognizes there are opportunities to
further improve the execution of PSPS and better support its customers. That was loud and clear in the
January '19 letter from President Batjer and in the CPUC and community input that SCE leaders received
during the 4.5-hour PSPS hearing on January 26. All this especially underscored the need to improve
SCE's communications with customers. And the PSPS action plan filed on February 12 includes important
near-term commitments to use this essential tool of last resort in a way that shows better care for our
customers.

Beyond SCE, the state has been building on significant investments in its firefighting capabilities. In his
2021-'22 budget, the governor proposed an additional $1 billion to support a coordinated forest health and
fire prevention strategy, that maximizes technology and science-based approaches to protect state lands.
This includes prioritizing firebreaks around high-risk communities and grants for individual homeowners
to harden their properties. Recognizing the needs to move quickly, the governor also proposed that $323
million out of that $1 billion would be for early action to start these prevention projects before the next
fire season. For fire suppression, the budget adds funding to support 30 additional statewide fire crews
and 7 large air tankers.

The state will continue phasing in Black Hawk helicopters, with 7 expected to be in operation this fire
season and another 5 in 2022. These new suppression resources will help the state move more quickly to
combat wildfires before they become catastrophic.

The governor and the California Insurance Commission also announced a plan to establish statewide
standards for home and community hardening that will reduce wildfire risk and help make insurance
available and affordable to residents and businesses.

Shifting to past wildfires. SCE has made significant progress toward resolving pending litigation. Last
month, SCE resolved all insurance subrogation claims in the pending 2018 Woolsey Fire litigation. The
utility continues to make solid progress settling remaining individual plaintiff claims across the 2017 and
2018 wildfire and mudslide events. In total, SCE has resolved approximately 2/3 of the best estimate of
total losses established last September. Maria will provide an update on the equity financing needs related
to these events later on the call.

Turning to regulatory actions. We welcome the reappointment of CPUC President Batjer for a 6-year term,
subject to confirmation by the Senate. President Batjer's leadership has energized the commission's
implementation of the state's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. Yesterday, the CPUC hosted an
en banc to share ideas about affordability across many stakeholders. Given the economic impacts of
COVID-19, this is a timely discussion, and it follows on many years of SCE leadership to manage system
average rate growth well below the other California utilities, which we were proud to see acknowledged
by the commission staff report and others. The discussion reinforced many of the issues we have raised
in our Pathway 2045 analysis, including that the grid investments needed to decarbonize the economy

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

and improve local air quality through clean energy and electrification may increase electric costs, but will
actually result in greater affordability and equity, with the average customer spending 30% less across all
forms of energy in 2045 than they do today, thanks to the greater efficiency of electric technologies.

Looking ahead, SCE is planning for their critical role it plays in sustainability, particularly from the unique
vantage point of a wires focused business. This will include significant capital investment opportunities
to support the electrification of transportation and buildings as outlined in SCE's Pathway 2045 and
reimagining the grid white papers. The governor's budget proposal also underscores this, with its proposed
$1.5 billion comprehensive strategy to achieve zero-emission vehicle goals by 2035 and 2045.

This includes infrastructure investments for and improved access to new and used zero-emission vehicles.
SCE has received CPUC approval for over $800 million to support electric vehicles including investing in
electric charging infrastructure for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The utility launched its Charge
Ready 2 program, the largest light-duty EV charging program by an investor-owned utility in the United
States, which will support approximately 38,000 light-duty charging ports. Charge Ready Transport, SCE's
program to build charging infrastructure for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, will grow through 2024,
eventually building charging infrastructure to power 8,500 electric medium and heavy-duty vehicles.

SCE has also committed to a long-term goal to electrify its own vehicle fleet, including 100% of all light-
duty vehicles by 2030. In the area of building electrification, SCE launched new programs in 2020 to
incentivize heat pump installations and expect to continue to expand these offerings going forward.

Before I conclude, I would like to say that I am just very, very proud of what our employees accomplished
over the last year in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has reshaped the way that all of us
do business, and how we interact with our customers and communities. And we adapted to continue
delivering an essential service. We cared for each other, whether working in the field or teleworking.
We care for our customers, providing relief for those facing economic challenges, and we cared for our
communities and their safety.

Looking forward, I am excited about our near and long-term business opportunities. SCE is well
positioned as an electric-only utility, with investments highly aligned with the states and now the federal
government's long-term decarbonization goals. We will continue to accelerate our wildfire mitigation
efforts, while building toward an equitable, clean energy future. With that, Maria will provide her financial
report.

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover fourth quarter 2020 results,
our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts and an update on our financing plans for 2021.

Edison International reported core earnings of $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter 2020, an increase of
$0.20 per share from the same period last year. Full year 2020 core EPS was $4.52, which exceeded the
midpoint of our initial guidance range, and is within the narrowed range we updated on our last earnings
call.

Core EPS of $4.52 was lower than $4.70 a year ago, and the decline was due to $0.44 of equity share
dilution.

On an operational basis, excluding dilution, core EPS was $0.26 higher, driven by strong performance at
SCE. On Page 3, you can see SCE's key fourth quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I would like to
highlight 4 items that accounted for much of the variance.

First, EPS increased by $0.16 related to higher revenue. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.22 of this
increase due to the escalation mechanism from the 2018 GRC decision. There was also a negative variance
of $0.11, primarily related to benefits captured in our tax balancing account. This is offset in the income
tax line with no effect on earnings.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

FERC and other operating revenue had a positive variance of $0.05, largely due to higher rate base.
Second, O&M had a positive variance of $0.11, primarily due to higher regulatory deferrals related to
wildfire mitigation activities and customer uncollectibles, and from approval of the GRC track 2 settlement.
Third, depreciation had a negative variance of $0.07 due to higher rate base.

Lastly, SCE's EPS in the quarter was lower by $0.07 because of dilution from the increase in shares
outstanding, primarily associated with the equity offering in May 2020.

I would now like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast, which are shown
on Page 4. We continue to see opportunities to significantly grow SCE's rate base, driven by investments
in electric infrastructure. The capital program reflects expenditures of $15 billion to $16 billion between
2021 and 2023. This represents compound annual rate base growth of 7.6%, over 2 rate case periods at
the request level. Our total CapEx forecast during this period is unchanged as we are awaiting a proposed
decision in SCE's 2021 GRC track 1.

In 2020, SCE's capital spending was $5.5 billion, approximately $400 million higher than forecast,
primarily as a result of higher fire restoration costs. For 2021, SCE has developed, and will execute against
a robust capital plan that targets key programs, while maintaining flexibility in later years to adapt to
levels authorized in the final GRC decision.

Please turn to Page 5. While the commission schedule calls for a proposed decision this quarter on track 1
of SCE's 2021 GRC, based on the level of inquiry to date from the CPUC compared to our past experience,
we believe it is unlikely that SCE will receive a PD by the end of the first quarter. We remain hopeful that
SCE will receive a PD in the second quarter. As a reminder, the CPUC can vote out a final decision no
sooner than 30 days after it issues a proposed decision. Consistent with our prior practice, we will issue
earnings guidance after we receive a final decision on the GRC.

Page 6 shows a summary of the substantial progress on receiving approvals for recovery of incremental
wildfire mitigation costs. SCE expects to receive over $1 billion of cash flow through September 2022
as the utility implements CPUC approval. This is in addition to ongoing securitization of AB 1054 capital.
You may recall that last quarter, the CPUC issued a financing order, authorizing SCE to securitize the
first tranche of AB 1054 capital expenditures approved in the grid safety and resiliency plan settlement.
Yesterday, SCE successfully closed that securitization, issuing $338 million of AAA-rated recovery bonds.
The proceeds will be used to repay short-term borrowings issued for AB 1054 capital expenditures.

In January, the CPUC approved SCE's GRC track 2 settlement, which allows SCE to request another
financing order to securitize the approved AB 1054 capital expenditures and recover the O&M expense.
Additionally, SCE filed a WEMA application for wildfire insurance premium for the second half of 2020. If
approved, SCE will recover $215 million beginning January 2022.

I would now like to provide an update on the approximately $1 billion equity issuance that we had
discussed previously. As Pedro noted, SCE has been making significant progress resolving pending
wildfire-related litigation, and thus far, has settled claims that represent approximately 2/3 of the best
estimate that we established. We continue to ground our financing plan in a framework that supports
investment-grade ratings by targeting consolidated FFO-to-debt in the 15% to 17% range.

To support this outcome, EIX will issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content in 2021, consistent
with the previously identified need.

We will consider a range of options to achieve this equity content, including preferred equity, internal
programs, and, if needed, our existing ATM program. We will be flexible regarding the specific timing and
monitor market conditions to efficiently finance the need.

Beyond this year, we expect to have minimal equity needs associated with our ongoing capital program,
and will quantify these after receiving a final decision in the 2021 GRC.

Overall, the company is well positioned to achieve the growth associated with the safety and resiliency
investments being made in the grid, and the longer-term opportunity associated with our clean energy
objectives. That concludes my remarks.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Perhaps, if I can start with the balance sheet here. I'm just curious to get a little bit of an update.
Appreciate your remarks. But curious on how you would characterize the conversations with the rating
agencies? And where you stand with cushion? I know that GRC is outstanding, but if you can provide any
context as to how you think about your metrics relative to what the agencies are thinking about, would
really appreciate any commentary here. And again, I appreciate perhaps commenting around perhaps the
proposed GRC, your filing, for instance.

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Julien. As you can probably imagine, we are talking to rating agencies all the time. We are talking to
them about our operational risk mitigation as well as just what's going on more generally in California, and
providing them with updates as we have with all of you on where the settlements landed back last year
and all of that. So we've been having those sorts of conversations.

As we've mentioned before, we think that the equity plan that we have in place or the financing plan that
we have in -- have had in place and announced last year is very supportive of the FFO-to-debt range that
we're targeting and supportive of investment-grade ratings. I'm sure you've read all the recent reports
that the agencies have put out. The metrics on a look back basis are skinny, but that's why the plan to
issue equity and to move forward with that so that we can support the balance sheet appropriately.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Appreciate it. And then if I can pivot over to the PSPS commentary. I appreciate what you guys
provided in the remarks. Can you elaborate a little bit on the action plan and the expectations for response
from CPUC around their inquiry with respect to the PSPS events from the last year here? What should we
expect in terms of process at a minimum, if anything?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start with this, and Maria may have more. Kevin Payne is also on the line, so he can add as he
sees fit. So just a process, you saw the letter that President Batjer sent, you monitored the hearing that
the PUC had for Kevin, and Steve Powell and other members of the team participated. That provided a
lot of, frankly, good helpful input from commissioners and communities and other state agencies. Based
on that, SCE developed the action plan that has a series of steps and commitments. You saw there are
some things in there around or, frankly, continuing work on trying to minimize just the impact and scope
of PSPS. I would put that in the category of work that's been going on and continuous, right? Areas like
[indiscernible] sectionalization and to work on continuous improvement of weather modeling and the
like to -- just really to help to narrow the gap between the approach we have, which is, frankly, the right
approach for SCE to have of notifying customers based on forecast conditions, but then de-energizing on
real-time conditions. But the more that we can narrow the gap between the number of customers that get
notified versus those get de-energized by having better and better forecasting and modeling, that helps.

So you saw some actions around those lines, but, say, a lot of the focus was really on, how do we help
the SCE team better improve the communications process, communications with the emergency agencies,
with government, with community leaders, with end use customers. And so you saw a number of actions
around that.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

In terms of process, there's going to be a series of meetings every couple of weeks for the next while
with commission staff just to continue to keep them updated. SCE has taken the step of now dedicating a
Vice President to PSPS, who's, frankly, a pretty strong leader back to SCE, and he's moving from the T&D
business to over the next few months, spend all of his time, along with the dedicated team, on the PSPS
improvement approach. So that's -- I'd say it's somewhat informal process. And then there's the action
plan, more formality to it and formal discussions with the commission on how it's coming along and check-
ins with them. But frankly, wanting to make sure that the SCE team can move on all the elements and
meet its commitments. Kevin, anything you would add there?

Kevin M. Payne
President, CEO & Director of Southern California Edison

I think you covered it really well, Pedro, the pieces of the action plan and also the process with the
commission. So good.

Operator

Next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just if I could ask 1 on the success you've had with settling the legacy wildfire claims and appreciate the
quantification in simple terms around the 2/3. But are you seeing any change in the pace of being able to
move these things along, now that you've reached the subrogation settlement with Woolsey, if anything
you can report sort of latest update, Pedro?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

I'll give you a quick answer. Maria may have more. The remaining plaintiffs are largely the individual
plaintiffs, just by the nature of that you're not talking about thousands of individual cases. In many cases,
multiple individual plaintiffs might be represented by a common legal counsel, and so you might see all
packages, settlements that can be done, but it's just a more time intensive, laborious process to work
through that. There is a more formal process that's been established in the Thomas, Koenigstein and
mudslide cases. We're working through that. We're working with individual plaintiffs in the Woolsey cases.

And so it's just harder to pin down a time frame for that, Jonathan. But the team is going at it and,
frankly, has a good steady pace of progress. And so I think, from an investor perspective, you'll see the
outcome of that every quarter as we update the kinds of numbers that we shared with you today. What
did I miss here, Maria?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

No. I think that's it, Pedro. I mean we have a process on Thomas, Koenigstein and mudslides, where we
are trying to move through -- with various plaintiffs. It's not going to be sort of an endpoint that we can
pinpoint for you exactly, Jonathan. But as Pedro pointed out, we'll be updating that every quarter. So you'll
see the progress as it happens, as it occurred.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. So that Slide 9 is going to be a live thing effectively?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes, very much so. And it's -- maybe just to put a fine point on it, don't expect a big bang when it comes
to individual plaintiff cases. You should expect just continued natural progress because it's case by case.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

And those cases are all very individualized, different -- different stories, facts and circumstances for a
homeowner in this kind of area versus a business owner in that kind of area.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I think this is a good way of helping people track it, though. So I appreciate that.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Well, thanks for the feedback. That's helpful.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

If I may, I'll just ask 1 other thing. You've obviously said that the GRC PD might not come until the second
quarter. What sort of point does a delay start to affect your decision-making about spending capital and
sort of throwing you off a bit as this has happened in the past? I mean how long a delay could you sort of
work with?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Well, obviously, we like to know sooner rather than later. But from an operational perspective, what we've
done this year, which is what we've done in the past, in the first year of the GRC cycle as well, is we just
plan the work. We're going to do the work. We're going to progress against it. You can see that the capital
plan is very robust in 2021. But we have the flexibility in the back end to adjust based on what the final
decision comes out with. So I think we have degrees of freedom there. Again, we'd still like to get the
decision sooner rather than later. But from an operational perspective, I think we have it well in hand.

Operator

Next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just on the comments on the GRC timing. You mentioned that based on the CPUC questioning later. Is it
just a lot more questions than normal or just the timing of things? Just any more color on that comment,
please.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Just -- it's really more about timing by -- we have experience with these cases every 3 years. I guess,
now it will be every 4 years after this one. And so as the PD is getting put together, and as the commission
staff go through the analysis they need to do, you typically see different pace and nature of questions as
you get closer to the PD. And we haven't really seen a lot of that yet at this point. So that's what suggests
to us that PD is not likely imminent within the quarter. So it's really about -- there's just a different set of
questions, kinds of questions that you get as you're getting down to that final evaluation and writing of the
PD and staff don't seem to be quite at that point yet.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then with respect to the equity commentary, I think you said $1 billion
of equity content. So that's, I guess, if you did preferreds or some things that are not full equity content,
you're kind of saying focus on equity content, not total dollars? Is that the way to think about that?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

That's right. Yes, as we've said in the past, we are -- we are trying to think about this very holistically,
monitor market conditions. So when we talk about equity content, it's the equity content that we're
targeting. So absolutely right, Steve.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. One last question along those lines. I'm sure you saw that PG&E did this transmission tower sale of
access to SBA. Is that something that you could potentially look at as well?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we did see the transaction and it's interesting. So the team has been learning about it. There
might be somewhat different circumstances for SCE in that we do have obviously, transmission
towers with attachments on them already today, like PG&E did. In our case, they're part of a bit more
comprehensive telecom business. Edison Carrier Solutions, which is essentially a competitive telco inside
the utility, that not only does sell antenna attachments, but also has managed fiber services, dark fiber
as well as lit fiber, providing bandwidth to carriers. And so in SCE's case, there's that broader telecom
business it also operates under a little different framework. I noticed that [indiscernible] there's some
revenue sharing that the PG&E deal contemplates. But the SCE business operates under a different
revenue sharing mechanism. So there's just a number of different bells and whistles that are made for
just different maturity of the business and different scope and scale today. So my -- the PG&E transaction
might not be fully transferable or applicable.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great.

20 years ago. So...

Next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just want to go back to Slide 9 for a minute there. And you discussed that after the Woolsey recoveries,
you expect to exhaust insurance. Can you file for CPUC recovery of settlements? Or are there other kind of
gating items that we should be thinking about here?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So if you look to the past as sort of an indicator, our experience has been that the commission
generally wants to understand sort of the quantum of the ask before they make decisions around recovery.
So I think we have a little ways to go still to get a total size of the ask that we would make, ultimately, to
the CPUC. Obviously, we said before that we've prudently incurred cost, we will be asking for recovery. At
this point, based on history and prior precedents, we can't say that, that was probable recovery, which is
why we took the charge a couple of years ago. But that's generally the framework that the commission
has.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

Got it. That's very helpful. And just thinking about PSPS discussions and just the environment in the state
right now, just wondering if you might be able to comment on how you see overall kind of relationships,
political risk currently in the state, any thoughts you could provide would be helpful.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'm happy to chip in on that. Look, I think the headline is that -- we continue to view California as
one of the most constructive states in the country when it comes to utility regulation, right? And it's
both because of the backward-looking and current mechanisms, like the fact that we have our forward-
looking rate cases, we have the balancing accounts for elements like procurement purchases, energy
procurement, I should say. We have decoupling, right? So you have a number of elements that have been
here for quite a while that make for a constructive environment.

You also have, frankly, looking more towards the future, a state that's been fairly aggressive in terms
of wanting to push the edge of technology and have -- has wanted utilities to play a significant role in
advancing the ball for the sector, right, for the benefit of California customers. That's meant that utilities
has to take on some added operational risks in managing more distributed resources than our peers in
other states or -- and having deeper penetration renewables or being earlier in the curve around storage
and the like. And that has lent itself to providing an opportunity for ROEs that have reflected a premium
based on those risks that we are being asked to manage.

And then finally, looking solidly well out in the future, it's a state that is really committed to decarbonizing
the economy. And so you've seen through our papers like Pathway 2045 and [indiscernible] the grid
papers that we see that, that decarbonization getting to net zero for the state will require a significant
ramp-up in renewable and other carbon-free resources along with storage. This will lead to a dramatic
increase in load across the state, 60% or so increase in order to then electrify a lot of the economy, and
that all requires a really robust grid with significant more investment than what we have in place today to
make that all happen. So that all adds up to a good opportunity for utilities.

Now -- by the way, it's also a good opportunity for the customer because, as I said in my prepared
remarks, we see all of that been leading ultimately to a 30% decline in the total energy cost that the
average customer has had in 2045. It may put some pressure on utility bills, but it will help bring down
overall cost for the customer and make the states more affordable.

Now that said, there are always bumps in the road. There are things that can give [indiscernible] pause.
The wildfire experience has been a challenging one over the last several years. We've had a lot of
encouragement in getting items like AB 1054 to help create a restored framework. We're still going
through implementation of that. I know that there's some discount that the utilities are carrying today
relative to our peers in other states. And hopefully, over time, as investors see that the framework is
working, that the physical risks are being mitigated and that the structure is there to help mitigate the
financial side of the risk, too, that will help to get investors fully comfortable with that and better align the
value of California opportunities for the long-term opportunity that we have.

One final item is there's a lot going on, and it's all going on in the middle of COVID. So I feel for the CPUC
staff, the 800-or-so of them have a lot on their plates. I think President Batjer, as I've mentioned in the
comments, has done a great leadership and focusing the commission on that clean energy future. I think,
generally, she's also helped the commission to, in general, be timely in decisions, and you saw that in
elements like the track 2 success we had recently, but there's a lot on their plate. So while I'm a little
disappointed that we may not end up seeing a GRC track 1 PD this quarter, I know that they're on the
case, and they recognize the importance of overall timely decisions. And then when it comes to the PSPS,
there has been some tough feedback we got. So a lot of it, frankly, was merited. And it's a good learning
opportunity, and I commend Kevin Payne and the team at SCE for having sat there for 4.5 hours and
listened and take a note and reflected good feedback in the PSPS action plan that SCE filed. So there will
be bumps in the road in any relationship. But I think, overall, if you look at -- maybe a couple of trees to
get in the way now and then. But if you look at the forest, it's a really interesting forest for the long term.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful there. And maybe picking up with electrifying, specific to the transportation
sector there, you spoke about this in the past, you spoke about it in your prepared remarks. Just
wondering if you could provide some perspective, I guess. For the EV outlook, how it looks today versus
maybe a couple of years ago and kind of down the future, how big do you think this opportunity is for EIX?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

So we started talking about this a few years ago. We had our Charge Ready application. I think our
Pathway 2045 paper at the time was forecasting something like a need for 7 million electric vehicles in
California by 2030. At the time -- or shortly after, I think the state was talking about a $5 million mark.
Since then, you've seen the state really look at doubling down on the electric vehicles and progress like
Governor Newsom's executive order for zero-emission vehicles -- 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by
2035. That says something right there about the growing commitment by the state and, frankly, driven by
growing realization that -- that is a key tool and one of the most affordable tools to get to decarbonization
at the end of the day.

The other angle, I'd share on this is then there's the market, right? And so when we start talking about
this, there was Bolt. I remember when I got my first Bolt in 2011, the new model year, my colleagues
were driving some of the first Telsas, there were a whole lot of EVs out. Now you're looking at a rollout, is
reading one of the latest articles where, I think, over the next year, there's going to be, what, something
like 20 or 30 new model offerings across auto OEMs and it's an area where U.S. automakers are realizing
that if they don't run fast, they could lose leadership to Chinese automakers or European automakers.

So seeing things like Ford's commitment of $20-some billion investment towards EVs over the next several
years, seeing GM's aspiration to not have internal combustion engines anymore in a decade or so, that is
a very different landscape from where we started 4, 5 years ago. And it tells you that this is happening,
it's real, and I suspect, like other technology innovations, like the deployment of cellphones, folks may be
surprised by how quickly that escrow takes off.

Next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

A little bit of housekeeping question. So capital spend for 2020 came in about $500 million higher than
what you all had put out when you reported third quarter earnings or just after third quarter earnings.
First of all, what drove that $400 million to $500 million being done just so quickly? And then second
of all, does that all -- is there any change in the capital spend program potentially in terms of what you
think about long-haul transmission related spend? Or do you think you're still in a 5- or 7-year cycle
where there's more maintenance work on the transmission grid, there's not a lot of new sizable scale
development there?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

I'll go take the first piece at least, a little bit of second, and I'll let Pedro also chime in on his thoughts in
long-haul transmission, right? So that delta in the capital spending between last quarter and this quarter
was largely driven by wildfire restoration costs. So you will recall that late last year, there were a number
of large fires in our service territory, particularly up in the northern part of our service territory around
Big Creek. And so a lot of the spend that's been going on since then has been to really get all of those
facilities back into service and to repair them, et cetera.

So that's really the driver there, Michael. We have to go through an analysis and see sort of what in there
was otherwise going to have been replaced or upgraded, et cetera, what's incremental, but that's largely
the capital change from last quarter.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

In terms of transmission, we're still in the cycle. I think, obviously, the state is planning for the future,
the future that Pedro just described in his earlier remarks. And we have to look to the CAISO to do that
planning. There's obviously a lot of work going on around the need as well, both in Integrated Resources
Plan -- Integrated Resources Plan as well as the CAISO, but I'll let Pedro share his thoughts as well.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Just maybe a [ quick sound ] like Maria has said, again, you may have heard me share this before,
Michael, from our Pathway 2045 analysis. But that analysis estimated that California would need to add
80 gigawatts of bulk power kind of wholesale level renewables and 30 gigawatts of wholesale bulk power
level storage by 2045, that's in addition to 30 gigawatts of distributed generation and 10 gigawatts of
distributed behind-the-meter storage. But all that would require something like $175 billion investment
for the resource side for the renewables and storage side. And the counterpart to that is that you need
something like $70 billion in why your site investment, with most of that being for transmission, whether
it's new lines or enhancing of current lines.

Now that's statewide, right? So that's not all SCE, but that just gives you a sense of how big the
investment need will be in order to accommodate that electrified future to decarbonize the economy. And
then as a reminder that, under the current per quarter 1,000 structure, if the Cal ISO determines that an
existing line needs to be upgraded, then the utility has right of first refusal to do that upgrade on its line,
lines that it already owns and operates. If it's a brand-new line, that's not an extension of an existing line,
then that is bid out competitively. And I would expect the utility to seek to compete with third parties for
that new build.

So hard to quantify what the specific SCE opportunity will be from all of that, but it's clearly a very large
pie that will need to be met across the state. And I expect that SCE will certainly play a significant role
within its territory for that.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

When do you think we could start seeing that roll into 3 or 4 year, 3- to 5-year forecast views? Like when
do you think the southern part of the state might actually start to need it?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's a really good question. I'm not sure I'm going to have a sharp answer for you right now,
Michael partly because the Cal ISO, I don't think, has turned the crank yet on the underlying analysis for
what lines and in what timing? My guess is that -- or my sense is, not guess, my sense from the analysis
is that a lot of that spend may be post 2030 spend, because that's when you really see the load pickup,
too. In our analysis, load, which has been fairly flat statewide to slightly declining for the last decade. To
2030, interestingly, continues to be fairly flattish, right, because you have a lot of electrification between
now and 2030 being counterbalanced by continued distributed generation deployment as well as continued
energy efficiency.

But we see a big elbow -- turn in the curve upswing post 2030, and that's where the state really picks up
the bulk of that 60% load increase that I talked about before. It really happens mostly between 2030 and
2045. So that may suggest that a good chunk of that build maybe post that. But in the meantime, you've
seen our capital spend so far, as Maria described, we had a bump up from just that Creek fire restoration
last year. So I hope we don't have to do fire restoration like that for any future fires. But we continue to
say that we see an ongoing opportunity for significant capital spend just for the core capital investment
in the utility. And so I -- to think about the long-haul transmission that becomes an adder, that certainly
supports the long-term growth for the company.
