ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Zebra Technologies Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference
over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Michael A. Steele
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I need to inform you that certain
statements made on this call are forward-looking and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations and
assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to the
factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

During this call, we will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business
performance. You can find reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in today's earnings press
release and at the end of the slide presentation. This presentation will include prepared remarks from
Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer.

Anders will begin with our second quarter results, then Olivier will provide additional detail on the
financials and discuss our outlook. Anders will conclude with progress on advancing our Enterprise Asset
Intelligence vision and trends we are seeing in our end markets. Following the prepared remarks, Joe
Heel, our Senior Vice President of Global Sales, will join us as we take your questions.

Also, throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are
year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses
for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at
investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year.

Now I'll turn the call over to Anders.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I would like to emphasize
that our top priority continues to be the health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners.
I am particularly grateful for all of the frontline workers, including medical professionals, who continue to
serve our communities and keep us safe. Zebra and many of our customers' workplaces have commenced
reopening plans, and I am very proud of the ability of our teams to effectively serve our customers and
partners while working remotely through the peak of the pandemic.

In Q2, our teams remained agile and executed very well through the pandemic. It has been inspiring for
me to see our employees rally to keep the business and each other moving forward. Although the financial
results we published this morning reflect a challenging second quarter environment as we navigated
through the peak of the crisis, Zebra's longer-term prospects have strengthened as secular trends to
digitize and automate workflows have accelerated with the pandemic.

In Q2, we realized a net sales decline of 12%; adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.3%, which contracted by
290 basis points; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.41, a 20% decrease from the prior year.
As the virus spread, end-market weakness affected all of our major geographies, particularly our Asia Pac
and Latin America regions. The impact was most pronounced in our run rate business, which required our
distributors to reduce their inventory levels.

However, sales growth in services was a bright spot, and enterprise mobile computing relatively
outperformed. Although premium shipping costs due to the pandemic impacted gross margin more than

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

we had anticipated, we diligently managed discretionary costs across the company to preserve profitability
and cash flow.

Despite the challenging environment, our enterprise customers have been prioritizing spend with Zebra.
Our solutions are a key enabler of their strategy to digitize their operations as well as supporting essential
use cases during the pandemic. Large order volume was strong across vertical markets, increasing over
the prior year.

I would like to highlight some notable Q2 wins from large customers supporting critical use cases. A
leading home improvement retailer expanded their relationship with us by purchasing 10,000 of our
printers to address multiple front-of-store use cases, including curbside pickup and in-aisle label printing.
Their shift to mobile on-demand printing is expected to significantly improve worker productivity and
replaced a competitor's stationary printers.

We also secured a competitive takeaway win with a federal retail commissary to deploy more than 7,000
mobile computers. Our solution enables this customer to satisfy multiple use cases, including curbside
pickup. We were pleased to support a large health care organization by providing a wide range of mobile
computers, scanners and printers to quickly ramp their point-of-care and clinical communication needs as
they added 4,000 hospital beds to treat COVID patients.

Additionally, as expected, we began deploying TC7 Series mobile computers to USPS' postal carriers in
late Q2. We expect the majority of the deployment to occur in 2021. We continue to collaborate with these
customers to support their essential needs and drive further improvement in their workflows.

I am pleased that we have substantially completed our global product sourcing diversification initiative
despite modest delays due to the pandemic. Replicating production lines outside of China into broader Asia
mitigates supply chain risk and enables us to avoid tariffs on our U.S. imports.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q2 financial results and discuss our outlook.

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Anders. Let us walk through the P&L on Slide 6. Net sales declined 12.9% in the second
quarter, which is 12% before the impact of currencies and acquisitions. Despite our sales decline, we
believe that we continue to outperform the market in this challenging environment.

As Anders mentioned, large order volume was stronger than the prior period. Our performance was
entirely due to a sharp decline in small and midsized business to the channel, which disproportionately
impacted printing and data capture. We are encouraged that distributor inventory levels are healthy and
sales out trends have been improving.

Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales decreased 5.4%. We grew services revenue, and mobile
computing relatively outperformed. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment has been most impacted by
the global recessionary environment, with sales decreasing 24.9%.

Printing and supplies each declined double digits. Services was a relative outperformer. Managed and
professional services performed particularly well, with growth driven by strong product attach rates over
the past 12 months. Our location solutions and Zebra retail solutions offerings were extremely soft due to
a pause in project activity due to the pandemic.

Turning to our regions. In North America, sales declined 7%. Services grew, and mobile computing was a
relative outperformer. EMEA sales declined 13%. We achieved solid growth in services and slight growth
in mobile computing. We saw strength in Central and Northern Europe. Sales in our Asia Pacific region
declined 21%, driven by COVID-19 impacts.

China improved sequentially from Q1, but was the largest contributor to the regional sales decline. Japan
and Korea were bright spots in the quarter, where our go-to-market investments are delivering results.
Latin America sales have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and macroeconomic factors and
declined 33%. All geographies declined double digits, with the exception of Mexico.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Adjusted gross margin contracted 360 basis points to 44.1%, driven primarily by 2 points of impact
from unfavorable business mix, 2 points of impact from premium freight cost, other COVID mitigation
and China import tariffs, partially offset by improved services margin. Adjusted operating expenses
declined $44 million from the prior year period and improved 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. This
improvement was primarily due to prudent cost management and lower incentive compensation. We were
able to accomplish this while preserving our research and development projects.

Second quarter EBITDA margin was 18.3%, a 290 basis point decrease from the prior period, driven
entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.41, a $0.61 or
20% year-over-year decrease, which is inclusive of $0.27 negative impact from the transitory effects of
premium freight expense and tariffs.

Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $322 million of free
cash flow in the first half of 2020. This was more than double the prior period, primarily due to a lower use
of working capital and our expanded accounts receivable factoring program. Additionally, in Q2, we made
a $31 million incremental investment in Locus Robotics, a market leader in autonomous mobile robots
for fulfillment warehouses. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at a modest 1.3x net
debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio, which provides us ample financial flexibility.

Turning to Slide 8. We have been successfully navigating this unprecedented global environment. As I just
mentioned, our balance sheet is in excellent shape with low debt levels and $950 million of availability
under our revolver, allowing ample capacity for business investment. Our capital-light business model,
flexible cost structure and strong free cash flow profile allows us to preserve profitability and cash flow
in challenging times. The reliable cash flow generation gives us a competitive advantage as we prioritize
investment in the business through any environment.

Let us turn to our outlook. We believe Q2 was the peak impact to Zebra from the pandemic. We remain in
the recovery phase and expect sales trends and profitability to improve in the second half of the year. We
entered the third quarter with a solid backlog. We have seen an increase in business activity, and our deal
pipeline is building nicely.

Based on these factors, we expect Q3 net sales to decline between 3% and 7%, which is a meaningful
sequential improvement from Q2 trend. This outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point negative
impact from foreign currency changes. We will continue to preserve profitability while doing no harm to
the business. This enabled us to prioritize strategic investment so that we emerge stronger as the market
rebounds.

We believe Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin will be approximately 19%, which assumes lower operating
expenses and a lower gross margin, reflecting higher large-order mix; and approximately $9 million of
transitory premium freight expense. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to
$2.95. The premium freight cost expectation equates to $0.14 EPS impact.

You can see other modeling assumptions on Slide 9. Note that our outlook does not include any projected
results from the pending acquisition of Reflexis. Anders will discuss this strategic acquisition in a few
moments.

With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and end-
market trends.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Thank you, Olivier. We are excited to announce the acquisition of Reflexis this morning, which we expect
to close by early Q4. Reflexis is a leading provider of intelligent workforce management, task execution
and communication solutions for the retail, foodservice, hospitality and banking industries.

Combining Reflexis' market-leading platform with Zebra's complementary software offerings, including
Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect, provides us the unique opportunity to unify the store
associate experience. We also expect that Zebra's scale, vertical market expertise and go-to-market

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

footprint will drive substantial synergies, not only in retail but in other key vertical markets such as health
care.

Reflexis is a high-growth, recurring-revenue business with sales of $66 million in 2019, which doubled
over a 3-year period. And the gross margin profile, approximately 20 points higher than Zebra's corporate
average. The next slide illustrates how this acquisition fits into our broader vision.

Slide 12 highlights how we are building our capabilities as a solutions provider. Our deep understanding
of workflows and unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base uniquely
positions us to solve complex challenges at the edge. It is our top priority to invest in software solutions
and services that help our customers leverage real-time data to better orchestrate their workflows and
gain a performance advantage.

Methods for sensing, analyzing and acting on operational data from the front line of business are
transforming with emerging technologies, such as computer vision and machine learning. Increasingly
large volumes of data are generated and captured from our products. Enterprises are asking us to help
them put that data to work by amassing disparate points of information to drive actions to their frontline
workers in near real-time.

Our Intelligent Edge Solutions, including our SmartX and MotionWorks offerings, demonstrate how we
are enhancing the value proposition for our customers by addressing a wide variety of use cases across
their business. This evolving suite of solutions enables Zebra to fuel our customers' workflows with data
so they can be fully optimized. Reflexis' capabilities will be enhanced when they are combined with Zebra
prescriptive analytics, worker collaboration and physical inventory software solutions.

For example, Reflexis can provide dynamic prioritization of tasks extending across a broader set of
data-driven activities, such as stocking shelves, receiving a truck or delivering an order curbside when
integrated with our Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect applications. Ultimately, through
this acquisition, we expect customers to find even greater value in equipping all of their associates with
mobile computers.

On Slide 13, we highlight the primary vertical markets that we serve. We are excited about our longer-
term opportunities in our end markets as customers are driven to improve their technological capabilities
in an increasingly on-demand economy. Since our last quarterly update, we are seeing improvement in
this challenging global environment, although it is still a mixed picture depending on the sector.

In health care, our fastest-growing vertical, clinical care remains critical and is the primary area Zebra
serves. Our health care solutions help hospitals flex their capacity needs as the pandemic evolves. Our
solutions are being used in labs and drive-through testing facilities to provide safe and efficient care.
Noncritical care and elective procedures are resuming. Longer term, we believe the need for increased
visibility into the entire patient journey will drive increased demand for our solutions.

Approximately 2/3 of our business in retail is to mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers, who have been
prioritizing investment in our technology for their omnichannel fulfillment. E-commerce and buy-online,
pick-up-at-store transactions have increased dramatically through the pandemic. Department stores and
apparel retailers have been reopening their doors, which has been critical to those heavily reliant on brick-
and-mortar sales.

In the transportation and logistics space, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes
and last-mile delivery, which is favorable to Zebra. Conversely, passenger airlines, rental car providers and
parts of the distribution industry are resuming activity, yet far from capacity.

The manufacturing sector continues to be the most impacted in the current environment with COVID-19
and global trade tensions. Discrete manufacturers in aviation, auto and discretionary specialty goods have
been particularly challenged during the heart of the crisis. Many segments within process manufacturing,
such as food and pharmaceutical companies, have been less impacted.

In closing, we are successfully navigating through this challenging environment and are confident that our
business fundamentals and strategy are sound. By continuing to focus on advancing our enterprise asset

intelligence vision and addressing our customers' needs, we expect to emerge from this crisis in a stronger
competitive position. We continue to be very optimistic regarding our longer-term prospects as secular
trends to digitize and automate workflows accelerate with the pandemic.

Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike.

Michael A. Steele
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

I just wanted to dig into your guidance a little bit. So I'm having a hard time with your guidance for Q3
getting to that 19% EBITDA margin, in that I feel like it could be higher. So I'm wondering, with your top
line sales kind of guide where it was or where it is much better than expected, it really implies not much
expansion on gross margins. If that's what -- if I'm correct there, can you first confirm that? And then talk
a little bit about why you can't do or why you wouldn't expect it to be a little bit better there in margin.
[indiscernible] great comps and stuff in there.

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Andrew, so you're right. We expect in the quarter EBITDA margin to be around 19%. So OpEx, as a
proportion of revenue, will decline year-on-year. And gross margin should -- rate should decline due to
2 factors: first, premium freight, that would be about a point of impact in the quarter; but also mainly
higher level of large deals in the quarter. We have mentioned that now for 2 quarters.

Our business, large-deal business is doing very well, actually growing year-on-year and expected to grow
in Q3 and in Q2. And our run rate business has been impacted mainly by the pandemic. We believe that
this trend will not last. That's point number one. We believe that our run rate is starting to increase, and
will keep increasing. And an important point, on a like-for-like basis, margin has been improving.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. Okay. So -- so the gross margins sequentially will be up related to that?

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

Correct.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. And then if you could just talk about your backlog. It sounds like you have a strong backlog. Any
way you can quantify that? Like what is your visibility beyond Q3 there? You mentioned some large orders
or you talked to some potentially larger orders. Can you just provide some -- any additional commentary
on that?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. We entered Q3 with a solid backlog position. It was quite strong, considering the overall environment,
but that was driven by the higher proportion of larger deals. So we've seen a lot of our larger customers,
particularly in retail and T&L, accelerate their investments. And they've also been -- in this case, gave us
the orders prior to the start of the quarter. And that gives us, obviously, a great deal of confidence in the
outlook we give for Q3. Joe, I don't know if you have any further comments here?

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

While we have a strong backlog position, as Anders and Olivier said, some of the projects are multi-
quarter. So we do have some backlog already building for future quarters. But it's too early to determine
how strong, relatively, our future quarter backlog will be.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Got it.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

But it's great to say that -- the pipeline for Q4 is good. So we feel encouraged about kind of the -- the way
the market seems to be recovering.

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

And a final comment, Andrew. We're not giving, of course, a guide for Q4. Too many uncertainties at
the moment, for obvious reasons. But we believe that Q4, from a revenue standpoint and profitability
standpoint, will be an improvement relative to Q3.

Operator

The next question is from Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Question I have is just -- as we've gone through the pandemic and seeing the impact on brick-and-mortar
retail, e-commerce, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the changes in customer behavior? I
mean your -- if you could talk in terms of things that you see changing in the market as we start coming
out of this. What do you see it doing to the business? And I assume you've seen some early indications of
this, things like ship from store and whatnot.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say, in this environment, our solutions have become even more critical for our customers than
they were before. And we are uniquely positioned to empower frontline workers across all our end
markets. So the -- I'd say the crisis has been accelerating a number of secular trends around digitization
and automation. And I think that probably spans all our vertical markets, all 4 key vertical markets.

If we dig in a little bit deeper on retail, I'd say, grocers, which were certainly on -- large part of our
customer base before. E-tailers, grocers, mass merchants are about 2/3 of our business. But the growth in
just grocery revenues, but particularly buy online, pick up in store, has been quite significant. And we've
seen grocers across the -- particularly in the U.S., but across -- certainly, Europe and the U.S., invest
materially in enabling scaling up their ability to do omnichannel and particularly buy online and pick up in
store. So that has been a big, big change.

I think buy online, pick up at store's gone from being more of a niche application before to now
mainstream. And I'd say, across the board in retail, that customers who were in segments that were
struggling a bit more before or during the downturn, I think everybody recognizes now that they can't be
100% reliant on in-store purchases, that omnichannel and the e-commerce sides of their businesses needs
to grow or expand. So we see people spending more -- giving more attention to kind of the omnichannel
part of their business and how to be able to respond to situations like the one we had in Q2.

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

If I -- maybe I can add 1 or 2 things, I'd do that. This is Joe Heel speaking. Generally speaking, besides
the buy online, pick up in store, productivity and resiliency are at a premium for retailers, and think not
only of the store but also the warehouses, right? So the types of solutions that we have in improving
productivity in warehouses where there's less reliance on workers to do tasks, including things like the
investment that we made in Locus Robotics, are going to be an increasing trend in retail, which also helps
improve their resiliency when there are incidents, for example, in a warehouse.

10

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

And this also extends to contact-free solutions. One of the features of BOPIS is that it's contact-free.
And there are other contact-free elements of the retail interaction that we think will be here to stay, for
example, payment transactions or contact-free kiosks as opposed to interaction with workers. So those
are a few other trends that we're seeing that generally benefit us in retail.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

And my follow-up question is on Reflexis. How long have you known them? And is this acquisition -- does
it fill in some areas of your solution set that maybe where you had some holes? And is the -- is there any
customer concentration within Reflexis that you can talk to?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. So first, we're very excited about the addition of the Reflexis team to Zebra and that business. We've
known each other for quite a long time. Reflexis has been a premier ISV partner of Zebra's. And we've
been in dialogue with them about this transaction for some time. The transaction very much helps to
augment our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision of empowering every worker at the edge with insights
that drive real-time action. So this is entirely consistent with our broader vision. And it leverages our
existing software assets and some of our hardware.

So if you think of Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, which looks at all sorts of data sources to glean insights
and drive actions that can now fuel Reflexis' engine of driving actions, too. And our Workforce Connect can
be one of the ways that we augment the Reflexis platform to have a more efficient way of communicating
between employees and workers to ensure the right person get the right action at the right time.

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

And in terms of customer concentration, Jim, the asset has a low level of concentration of sales towards a
few customers. And Reflexis has been performing extremely well during the pandemic.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

It's -- obviously, we serve most retail customers. So there's a lot of overlap, and we think there's great
opportunity for us to do some cross-selling and up-selling across the portfolio. If you look specifically at
how the customer base of Reflexis has performed during the lockdown, 2/3 of their customers were open
and operated like normal. About 1/6 had some partial shutdowns or slowdowns, and 1/6 were fully shut
down but are now open.

Operator

The next question is from Paul Coster of JPMorgan.

Paul Chung
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Paul Chung on for Coster. So just a follow-up on Reflexis. It's kind of somewhat of a departure
from your typical acquisition as it's mostly software. Should we kind of expect a shift to the software to
continue? And if so, if we think about gross margins longer term, would -- should we expect kind of a
structural step-up to your current gross margins of 47% as your strategy evolves? And I have a follow-up.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

So first, I think the acquisition of Reflexis is very consistent with our broader approach that we've talked
about for some time, to align with our strategy of either driving growth in our core, identifying, acquiring
companies that expand our leadership in the core or rapidly grow in near adjacencies or accelerate
our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. And Reflexis fits into the -- accelerating the Enterprise Asset
Intelligence vision.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

I don't think -- we don't think of it as a big departure from how we have thought about the business or
how we have executed over the last few years. Software has become a bigger and bigger part of it. The
last 3 acquisitions now, including Reflexis, have been pure software acquisitions.

Although I'm not saying that, that, by any means, it's going to be -- that's the only thing we're focusing
on for the future, but we are building more and more software assets and software capabilities. And even
internally, more than 2/3 of our engineers are software engineers. So software is clearly a very important
part of how we deliver value to our customers, even if that is as a stand-alone software offering or as a
more integrated solution between hardware and software.

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

We believe that the asset will indeed increase the overall margin of the business, I mean, not only because
it's software, but also because of the impact it will have on the hardware part of the business as well. So
very synergic from a revenue and margin standpoint.

Paul Chung
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just on your SMB channels, are you starting to see demand pick up in July as
business start to reopen? Have you also kind of seen some consolidation in the channels, maybe some of
the smaller players, kind of, given some liquidity concerns we've been hearing about? And how does that
kind of impact your pricing, over time, in your view?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. I'll let Joe comment here also afterwards. But we have seen, I guess, first, stabilization and signs of
improvement in our run rate business, and which we tend to kind of talk about them as run rate and SMB
as being the same, but they're not necessarily the same, but it's not. Now I think the SMB segment was
harder hit by the shutdown.

Most SMB companies were not deemed essential, and therefore, were cut down -- shut down harder. And
we have also more manufacturers that's part of our SMB or run rate business, but we are seeing them
return to more healthy outlook and sequential growth.

We also say that our -- we work hard to make sure that we maintained healthy inventory levels within our
channel. So when sales out numbers went down a little bit in Q2, sales in went down more. So the end
markets were somewhat healthier than our sales numbers would indicate. But now we're in a position to
start growing with them as the economy expands.

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Two additional comments. Remember that nearly half of our business is outside of the U.S. And in regions,
including Asia as well as in Europe, we are seeing the run rate business improve. Whereas in the U.S., it's
still a bit too early to say that we have a sustained improvement. But for example, in several countries in
Asia, we are seeing growth in our run rate.

Second, in terms of the channels themselves, the -- it is fair to say that our channel business among our
larger partners has been stronger than it has been among our smaller partners. It may be too early to
speak of a consolidation, but it would be -- but at least that is what we are seeing.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Glad to hear that the large deals are holding up strong. I guess, Anders, are you seeing any large deals
being pushed off because of the current environment? Or are you finding that the prioritization of these
projects hold better than, I guess, what they might see for other products or projects?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

We have seen larger deals push into future quarters, more dependent than on the type of customer. So
some would be retailers that had to shut down altogether in Q2. They tended to push if they had bigger
orders on the books into future quarters. Another example will be around, say, RFID, which often requires
more in-store activities, and also focus more on apparel or fashion retailers.

So anything that had to do with -- where we had to go into our customers' facilities to set up and
implement the solutions would get pushed. But that's been offset by other customers that were operating
and had to really scale up their operations to deal with the increased business that we're getting as part of
the shutdown.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Great. Great to see that. And then as you look at, I guess, the Intelligent Edge Solutions, can you discuss
the progress you had with those solutions during the quarter versus the services growth? I think if I heard
right, the managed services were -- grew during the quarter. But how did Intelligent Edge Solutions do,
like Savanna, most importantly?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. I think our -- many of our software solutions did very well. If you look at, say, Zebra Prescriptive
Analytics, as an example. Yes, we were able to win several new customers in Q2, and we were able to
win and implement those customers without actually having to go on site. So that was one of the benefits
of having a software solution like that. But other Intelligent Edge Solutions that require on-site proof
of concepts, pilots and so forth, they tended to be pushed out, and we're not growing the way we had
expected.

The next question is from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley.

Erik Taylor Lapinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Erik on for Meta. Maybe we could just go back to the retail side quickly. I mean, given some of
the drivers you had noted, do you expect any sort of digestion period with some of the e-commerce or
grocery customers following the investments that they have been making? Or do you think that kind of
those investments just continue to scale as kind of the economy recovers?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. The -- I'd say the larger orders that we've seen in retail in the last quarter or plus are really to help
our existing customers scale their operations. So it's not -- they're not necessarily building ahead or
anything like that. So I don't see a need for them to, say, pause or catch or deploy and catch up on the
operations side with what they have deployed. But obviously, there's many customers and somehow
different profiles than others. But generally, they are just basically trying to deploy devices into existing
use cases where they scale in line with the number of headcount they have or the revenues they have for
those applications.

Got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up and kind of returning to some of the
gross margin impacts from the larger deals. Was the initial shipments to kind of USPS also a factor in
there? And should we maybe be expecting a similar impact to gross margins just as those shipments really
ramp up into the first half of next year?

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

So Q2 had an USPS order. This order was shipped at the end of the quarter, so relatively material to the
quarter. USPS is ramping in Q3. But as we have said before, the large majority of the USPS order will be
shipped next year, probably in the first half of next year. And we're not going to talk about margin, of
course, of USPS today. But usually, large deals have a lower margin and run rate, so it would impact the
company rate.

Operator

The next question is from Brian Drab of William Blair.

Brian Paul Drab
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I'll just ask one question at the moment. And I apologize if you've discussed this to some extent. There's
simultaneous calls going on. But I know you're expecting about $20 million in costs associated with the
move of manufacturing out of China that are adjusted out of the adjusted EPS figure. But you have other
costs that you're incurring this year. I guess there's about $19 million of premium freight and other costs
in the second quarter, $9 million in premium freight in the -- or coming in the third quarter.

And just as we're trying to assess costs this year, that likely won't be present next year. What is the
estimate for total premium freight in 2020 and other costs in 2020 that likely won't be present in '21,
for example, incentive comp, maybe down this year that comes back next year? And what -- I can't
remember what was the situation in the first quarter. Was there premium freight in the first quarter as
well?

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

So it's -- let me try to cover the key points on this. So if you look at, going forward, in terms of transitory
cost, we are now done, and our supply chain did an amazing job in diversifying our supply chain out of
China. So this work is done, and we're not going to have any impact due to tariffs going forward. So that's
not part of Q3 and, obviously, forward P&L. So that's point number one.

Point number two, we're going to have some impact due to premium freight in Q3. I mentioned in my
prepared remarks that about $9 million, about 80 basis points worth of margin rate, that will decrease
towards the end of the year. And we believe that this trend should now stop going forward. So that would
be a second item.

When it comes to OpEx. We have been able to manage OpEx, and adjust OpEx as revenue was declining.
We'll keep doing that in the year. Now you are asking, do we have some of those OpEx reductions, which
are going to be permanent? We believe so. It would be premature to mention a number today because we
want to keep investing in the business as well.

Brian Paul Drab
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. But Olivier, if I can just follow-up. What I'm driving at is the transitory costs. What's the total
estimate for 2020? And then -- so we can model '21. You're not -- you called out $19 million in the second
quarter, you called out $9 million in the third quarter.

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

What -- those costs and also including tariff costs, it seems like there's going to be like $50 million, like
5-0 or something, in that range of costs this year that we shouldn't expect and we shouldn't model for
next year in the total.

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

Your number is actually -- yes, your number is about right. I mean if I was to give you the phasing -- and
maybe we can take that after the call of today. Tariff impact in Q1 was about 1 point. That's is transitory.
In Q2, the impact of tariff and premium freight was about 2 points. Premium freight impact in Q3 will
be about 1 point. And we believe that all those transitory costs, to a large extent, will be gone by Q4
onwards. And we take the details after this call as well.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Just -- I'm looking kind of at the decrementals, kind of similar line of thought here. But the
decremental here in the second quarter at the adjusted EBIT line was about 40%. And that's obviously
absorbing some of the tariff costs, the freight cost, probably offset by some OpEx reductions. Is that -- is
the 40% decremental kind of run into the third quarter? And then, presumably, and maybe fingers crossed
here, decline in the fourth quarter with some of these transitory costs out of the number?

Olivier Leonetti;Chief Financial Officer

You're right, Rich. If you look at today, in terms -- if you look at Q2 and Q3, we believe we're going to
be able to scale OpEx as a proportion of revenue in about the same level. And then in terms of margin,
we're going to have, over those 2 quarters, the same impact of large bid mix, which will impact gross
margin. But we believe that, largely, those trends will stop as we enter into the fourth quarter. That's why
I indicated during an earlier question that profitability in Q4 will certainly increase relative to Q3 and Q2.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Okay. I got you. And then just maybe a quick thoughts around what appears to be maybe more
cyclicality in the printer business in general, AIT. Thought being that -- is that business impacted much
more as run rate business through the channel? Or is it just simply easier to defer purchases of a printer,
given the payback on the printer, just defer it for a couple of quarters. I mean how do you kind of view
that on the printer side of the business?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. The printer business is more -- has a much higher proportion of run rate as part of its revenue
stream. It supports more SMB and manufacturing customers. So the profile of the customer base is -- was
more exposed to COVID-19 shutdowns or slowdowns.

I'd say, if we dig into the printing portfolio a little deeper, our card printing business was particularly hard
hit. Card printing, they do -- they support events, obviously, there weren't a lot of events in Q2; badges
for employees; drivers licenses; all sorts of things that were hit more harder. But we did start to see,
particularly manufacturing opportunities to resurface in Asia Pac later in Q2.

And if you look at our supplies business, Temptime had a very strong Q2 and grew its vial monitoring
solutions for existing vaccines. And we were doing things in emerging markets for COVID-19 test kits. And
once we get a proper vaccine, we see opportunities for that to continue to do well.

We also worked here on making sure that the channel had appropriate inventory positions. So we did
reduce inventory in the channel but kept the days on hand just stable. So we're coming out of this with a
healthy inventory position, where we can grow the business now in line with how the economy grows.

But we do believe that we actually gained share in printing in the first half of this year. So based on all our
data points, we believe that we actually gained some share.

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

And one further data point just on that. In China, our printing business is rebounding faster than our other
businesses. So that gives you an indication that there is a positive trends that will likely come back at the
end of this cycle.

Operator

The last question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Firstly, with regard to your TAM. A couple of years ago, you gave a number with regard to -- I mean $9
billion or $10 billion out of the total market in the AIDC area. Clearly, with some of the new software that
you've developed internally, but also with some of these acquisitions, you've expanded the total available
market that you can play in and also the niche, if you want to call it that niche, that you are actually
directly affecting. Can you speak to how -- particularly this last acquisition that you've just announced,
can you just discuss the size of the marketplace that you are now affecting relative to where you were just
a couple of years ago?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

So yes, we've talked about our core markets being around $10 billion in size, and that we have -- we've
had an incremental $15 billion market size in our adjacent markets, right? The -- and some of those
adjacent markets that took us from $10 billion to $25 billion in total size will include tablets, supplies,
RFID.

Our -- many of our software solutions are new, and there is no -- it's a little difficult to say what the TAM
is because they -- you could calculate it by, say, if every retailer on the planet were to deploy it, the TAM
would be very, very large. It's not quite that today, but it is a substantial TAM, and it's a higher -- faster-
growing market than our core markets.

So clearly, this expands our addressable markets and positions us to participate in additional high-growth
markets, where we also get attractive synergies by being able to cross-sell and upsell.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And follow-up is, you've talked about the recovery in your business. But the fact remains is that,
at least in the United States, maybe not in Asia or in parts of Europe, where they seem to be recovering
from the virus faster, we seem to be still in somewhat of a state of a mess here. And it may be some time
before the virus allows business to operate at a more normal pace. Is the improvement that you're talking
about in the third and fourth quarter? How much of it is basically based in the fact that Asia -- parts of
Asia and parts of Europe are actually recovering and helping you and relative to the U.S.?

And is the percent -- is your geographic pie going to shift at all in the second half of this year and perhaps
into the first half of this year until there's some type of vaccine to -- and more importantly, the U.S. kind
of gets its COVID-19 act together, if you want to call that?

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

I think you summarized it well. We see all the regions improving in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2. But the main
recovery is outside North America. You're absolutely right.

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Although, I think, in the second half, we have a substantial number of large deals that are North America-
centric, with North American customers having increased demand for the products that they have been
buying from us previously. And so I think our overall deal mix will not shift that much, even though the
recovery, in particular, on the run rate will be stronger outside of the U.S.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr.
