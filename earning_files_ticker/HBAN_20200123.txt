HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Huntington Bancshares Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations.

Mark A. Muth
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Thank you. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides,
we'll be reviewing, can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com.
This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about 1 hour from the close of
the call.

Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial
Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer.

As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements.

Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to
changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.

We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties,
please refer to this slide and the material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q
and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Steve, where he'll start on Slide 3.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest
and support. We're pleased with our full year 2019 results and the continued momentum across the bank
despite a challenging operating environment. For the full year, we reported earnings per common share
of $1.27, an increase of 6% over 2018. Return on average assets for 2019 was 1.3%, return on average
common equity was 13% and return on average tangible common equity was 17%. The bank achieved
record net income for the fifth consecutive year and positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for
the seventh consecutive year.

Our balance sheet is very well positioned with robust capital and liquidity, and our comprehensive hedging
strategy has reduced interest rate risk. Credit quality remains strong, with 2019 net charge-offs at the
low end of our average through-the-cycle target range. We remain prudent with our allocation of capital
to ensure we are earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risks, consistent with our aggregate
moderate-to-low risk profile.

2019 marked the ninth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend coupling the dividend with $441
million of share repurchases during the year. We returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in 2019,
which represented a total payout ratio of 79%. As we previously communicated on many instances, our
capital priorities are: first, to fund organic growth; second, to support the cash dividend; and finally,
all other capital uses, including the buyback and selective acquisitions. These capital priorities have not
changed.

Now moving to the economy. We continue to see growth, and our expectation for 2020 is for continued
expansion. Consumers continue to perform well across our footprint, with strong labor markets driving
wage inflation. In the 12 months ending November 2019, unemployment rates declined or remained
the same in 17 of the 20 largest MSAs in Huntington's footprint states. Job openings continue to exceed
unemployment levels in the Midwest. Home prices continue to appreciate with especially solid increases

in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. Additionally, consumer confidence in our region has generally stayed at
the highest levels since 2000. The positive consumer sentiment is evident in the success of our consumer
lending businesses.

Our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for both full year 2019 and the 2019
fourth quarter. Our auto finance business also achieved record originations in the fourth quarter, and
we expect another good year in 2020 for our consumer lending businesses, again, driven primarily by
residential mortgage and auto finance.

Now we have seen a slowdown in commercial loan activity, consistent with the measured tone from some
of our commercial customers. Economic uncertainty, along with tight labor markets, remain headwinds
for more robust economic growth in our footprint. Overall, Huntington is performing well with disciplined
organic growth. Our customers are generally confident about their performance for 2020, and we share
that confidence in our performance. We continue to see good traction in our new specialty lending
verticals, mid-corporate lending, technology, media and telecom, our practice finance area which we
announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan.

Looking [out to 2020,] we proactively took actions in the fourth quarter to drive organic revenue growth,
reduce our future expense growth and increase our capacity for additional investment in our businesses
and technology. We repositioned $2 billion of securities, picking up approximately 70 basis points of yield
on those securities. The rebalance resulted in $22 million of security losses in the fourth quarter.

On the expense side, we completed the position reduction of employees and announced the consolidation
of 30 in-store branches. Now these actions, along with the disposition of other properties and a technology
system decommission, resulted in unusual expense of approximately $25 million in the quarter. Our
disciplined expense management allows for further investment in digital and mobile technology and
enterprise growth initiatives going forward.

I'm confident in our positioning entering 2020, and our colleagues are focused in executing our plans. We
are all aligned with our strategies of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile
through the cycle shareholder returns.

Zach will now provide an overview of our financial performance. Zach?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to be with you here on my first earnings call
with Huntington. Slides 4 and 5 provide highlights of our full year 2019 and fourth quarter 2019 results,
respectively, many of which Steve already touched on. Fourth quarter results include approximately $47
million of pretax impact or approximately $0.03 per share after tax from previously announced actions
that were taken to better position the bank for 2020, including the securities repositioning, workforce
actions and the pending in-store branch closures.

Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss the key fundamental drivers behind the financial performance for the
quarter. Average earning assets increased $2.3 billion or 2% compared to the year ago quarter. Average
loans and leases increased $1.3 billion or 2% year-over-year with balanced consumer and commercial loan
growth.

Average commercial and industrial loans increased 3% from the year ago quarter and reflected the largest
component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well diversified over the past
year with notable growth in specialty banking, asset finance and corporate banking.

Our fourth quarter commercial loan growth was below our expectations, as a portion of deals we expected
to close at the end of the year were pushed into 2020 and seasonal declines in line utilization at year-end
were larger than normal. Overall, commercial activity continues to be restrained by economic uncertainty.

[We continue to actively manage our commercial] real estate portfolio around current levels, with
average CRE loans reflecting a 2% year-over-year decrease, driven by paydowns and refinancing

activity. Consumer loan growth remained focused in the residential mortgage portfolio, reflecting robust
originations in the second half of 2019. Average residential mortgage loans increased 7% year-over-year.
As we typically do, we sold the agency-qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo
mortgages and specialty mortgage products.

Now turning to Slide 7. Average total deposits decreased less than 1% year-over-year, while average core
deposits increased 1% year-over-year. Note that both of these growth rates were negatively impacted by
the June 2019 sale of the Wisconsin retail branch network, including approximately $725 million or almost
1% of core deposits.

We continue to see a migration in deposit balances from CDs and savings into money market accounts,
reflecting shifting customer preferences, and we are focused -- and where we are focused on promotional
pricing. Average money market deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while savings decreased 9% and
core CDs decreased 16%. We expect this dynamic to continue in 2020. Average noninterest-bearing and
interest-bearing DDA accounts each increased 1% year-over-year. As shown on Slide 32 in the appendix,
we're very pleased that our commercial noninterest-bearing deposits increased 5% year-over-year in the
quarter. This growth highlights our continued focus on growing our low-cost deposit base through new
customer acquisition and relationship deepening.

Moving now to Slide 8. FTE, net interest income decreased $55 million or 7% versus the year ago quarter,
primarily driven by the 29 basis point decline in net interest margin, partially offset by 2% increase in
average earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.02% -- 3.12% excuse me, 3.12% for the quarter, down
29 basis points from the year ago quarter, down 8 basis points linked quarter and in line with the guidance
we provided at the Goldman Sachs Conference in December.

Moving to Slide 9. Our core net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3.08%, down 26 basis points
from the year ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 4 basis points to the net interest
margin in the current quarter compared to 7 basis points in the year ago quarter.

Slide 28 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of FirstMerit
purchase accounting for 2019 and 2020. Please note that this quarter is the last quarter we intend to
provide core NIM and PAA breakouts, as the PAA is expected to have a relatively immaterial impact in
2020.

Turning to asset -- to earning asset yields. Our commercial loan yields decreased 52 basis points year-
over-year. Consumer loan yields decreased 8 basis points and security yields decreased 16 basis points.
The decrease in our earning asset yields can be primarily attributed to lower interest rates following the 3
federal reserve rate reductions that occurred during 2019.

On the funding side of the balance sheet, our deposit costs continue to move lower as CDs and money
market promotional rates reprice lower, and we actively manage commercial deposit costs. Total interest-
bearing deposit cost of 87 basis points for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year, though, down 11 basis
points sequentially.

Slide 10 summarizes the actions we have taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate
volatility and the lower interest rate environment. Our hedging strategies reduce the downside risk from
lower interest rates and have significantly narrowed the band of modeled outcomes for net interest
income.

Our current interest rate risk modeling suggests little change to net interest income from either a 25 basis
point increase or 25 basis point decrease in 2020. We continuously monitor and will continue to prudently
refine our interest rate risk management as the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix and other
factors necessitate.

The graphs on the bottom left of the slide detail the mix of our loan portfolio as well as the significant
consumer deposit balances with repricing events in the first half of 2020. These repricing events provide
an opportunity for the bank to reduce the cost of deposits as these higher-priced CDs and promotional
money market accounts repriced lower.

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

Through December, the consumer deposit repricing activity is on track with our expectations. The success
of our consumer deposit repricing and retention has provided us the ability to remain more disciplined in
our commercial deposit pricing, particularly among the highest cost deposits. The graph on the bottom
right of the slide displays the impact of our actions. You can see the downward trajectory of our total
interest-bearing deposit costs by month since July. We expect this trend to continue given the significant
deposit repricing opportunities that remain in the first half of 2020.

Turning to Slide 11, you can see, it provides the detail on our noninterest income, which increased 13%
from the year ago quarter. The growth was highlighted by mortgage banking income, which increased
152%, primarily reflecting higher salable origination volume and secondary market spreads as well as
a $12 million increase in the gain on net mortgage servicing rights risk management. We also continue
to see steady growth in card and payment processing income, trust and investment management and
insurance.

In the 2019 fourth quarter, we repositioned $2 billion of securities, picking up approximately 70 basis
points of yield on those securities, prospectively, at a cost of $22 million in Q4. While negatively impacting
fourth quarter results, the prospective earnings pickup and the earn-back on the repositioning losses are
very attractive and consistent with our active management of the securities portfolio. The year ago quarter
in 2018 included $19 million of securities losses from similar repositioning.

Slide 12 provides the components of the 1% year-over-year decrease in noninterest expense. The 2019
fourth quarter included $25 million of expense related to the actions which Steve discussed earlier, while
the year ago quarter included $35 million of similar branch and facility consolidation related expense.
Adjusting for these items, noninterest expenses were essentially flat. We continue to drive efficiency in our
core expense base to ensure robust and growing investment capacity to fuel our investments in digital,
mobile,and cyber technology, enhanced product services and distribution capabilities. This disciplined
expense management allowed us to achieve positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the
seventh consecutive year.

Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength in our capital ratios. The tangible common equity ratio, or TCE,
ended the quarter at 7.88%, up 67 basis points from a year ago. And common equity Tier 1 ratio, or
CET1, ended the quarter at 9.88% or 23 basis points year-over-year. We continue to manage CET1 to the
high end of our 9% to 10% operating guideline.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 13.1 million common shares at an average cost of
$14.96 per share or a total of $196 million. We plan to use the share repurchase to manage our capital
following the CECL implementation back to a CET1 level near 10% by the end of 2020, excluding the
benefit of the CECL transition provision provided by the Federal Reserve. We feel managing internally to
a CET1 level, excluding the 3-year transition, reinforces our commitment to maintaining strong capital
ratios, which we see as a position of strength for the organization. As a result, we are currently planning
to repurchase less than 1/3 of the remaining $249 million of share repurchase capacity on our 2019
capital plan in the first half of 2020.

Now let me turn it over to Rich to cover credit, including CECL. Rich?

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

Thanks, Zach. Slide 14 provides an update on our CECL adoption. We estimate our allowance for credit
losses or ACL will increase 44% from the year-end 2019 ACL to $1.28 billion or 1.70% of total loans and
leases on an adjusted basis. As we stated on the third quarter call, given our 50% mix of relatively longer-
dated consumer loans, the CECL lifetime loss methodology results in a higher allowance than the prior
methodology. The increase in reserves is largely related to the consumer loan portfolio.

As we move forward under CECL, it is a new accounting standard with many variables. Our day 2
allowance for credit losses will be determined using various models that incorporate multiple scenarios,
historical loss and recovery rates, borrower characteristics and other factors. As a result, we expect more
volatility in our quarterly provisioning expense. Our parallel testing, however, indicates that key factors

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

being held constant, the aggregate annual level of provision expense is not expected to materially change
from the current incurred loss methodology despite that higher quarterly variability.

Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Despite challenges in our oil and
gas portfolio, our credit metrics remain strong. As we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is
expected given the absolute low level of problem loans. Consistent, prudent credit underwriting is one of
Huntington's core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk
management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite.

Net charge-offs remained near the low end of our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55
basis points. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 39 basis points of average loans and leases in the
current quarter, flat to the prior quarter and up from 27 basis points in the year-ago quarter. The increase
was centered on the oil and gas portfolio, which made up approximately half of the total commercial net
charge-offs. This portfolio was primarily impacted by geological issues compounded by low commodity
prices and limited capital markets activity.

We have a relatively small oil and gas portfolio, representing less than 2% of total loans, and we believe
we have it appropriately reserved for. Consumer charge-offs have remained fairly consistent over the past
year. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides.

Annual net charge-offs, excluding the $67 million of oil and gas related losses, were 26 basis points and
just 15 basis points for the commercial portfolio. The nonperforming asset ratio increased 2 basis points
linked quarter and 14 basis points year-over-year to 0.66%, again, primarily as a result of the stress in
our oil and gas book. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans remained relatively
stable at 1.04%, down 1 basis point versus the linked quarter.

Let me turn it back over to Zach.

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Thanks, Rich. Slide 16 illustrates our expectations for full year 2020. We expect 2020 to be another year
of sustained organic growth as we continue to execute and invest in our core growth strategies. We expect
full year average loan growth in the range of 3% to 4%, with continued growth in both consumer and
commercial portfolios. We expect growth to be modestly stronger on the consumer side, focused in home
lending and auto finance. We expect slightly more measured commercial loan growth consistent with
recent economic data.

Full year average deposit growth is expected to be approximately 3% to 4%, as we remain focused on
acquiring forward checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. Specifically, our expectation
entails continued decline in CDs, more than offset by growth in checking and money market. We expect
full year total revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5% on a GAAP basis, with growth in both net interest income
and noninterest income. We are projecting the NIM to rebound in the first half of 2020 from the 2019
fourth quarter before stabilizing in the second half of the year.

Given our relatively neutralized interest rate risk positioning, we remain confident in our outlook for net
interest income growth. While deposit pricing remains rational in our markets, we are closely watching
the competitive environment around rate and volume of deposits as this represents the primary risk and
opportunity for variance to our NIM forecast. We expect noninterest income on a GAAP basis to grow at
a slightly higher pace than total revenue in 2020, driven by the continued focus on deepening customer
relationships.

Full year noninterest expense is expected to increase 1% to 3%. Based on our active management in
2019, we are comfortable with our current expense base and the run rate trajectory. Our focus is on
driving continued investment in opportunities to further differentiate Huntington and drive revenue
growth. As we've told you previously and are demonstrating with our actions and our 2020 guidance, we
remain committed to targeting annual positive operating leverage. We anticipate that the full year 2020
net charge-offs will be within a range of 35 to 45 basis points.

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

As Rich just covered, fundamentally, our credit remains strong. We're taking decisive action to mitigate
the risk in our oil and gas portfolio. As a result, we have expectations for oil and gas charge-offs remaining
slightly elevated in the first half of 2020. These charges are fully represented in our 2020 guidance. We
believe we are adequately reserved at year-end and with the life-of-loan CECL adoption.

Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Well, lots to ask about, but I'll just maybe start, Steve, with just -- you talked a little bit about headwinds
in commercial, but we do have USMCA and Phase 1 China seemingly done. Just curious, if you could give
us a little bit more color on that and if you're seeing any changes in optimism at all from the commercial
customers?

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Jon, USMCA is just recently done. And obviously, there are other issues, distractions going on in D.C. right
now. So I don't think there's a meaningful change yet. But from what we reported at the prior conference
and I do expect there's going to be a second half lift. I'm optimistic in that regard. But I think it's going to
be a little hesitant, little reluctant in talking with different customers about the start of this year. We did
see more cash on balance sheets at the end of the year. So spot balances were down a bit from where we
expected them to be. That was particularly true in auto as customers kept more cash on sheet. So I think
that just reflects this conservatism and just sort of a wait-and-see approach. Again, in the Midwest, we're
hampered by lack of labor. So that is an element in this planning process as well as these uncertainties.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more, Zach or Rich, maybe, Rich, for you. Just can you talk about
the day 2 CECL impact again? I think what you said is, expect the provision to be roughly the same
in 2020 compared to 2019, I wonder if I heard that right? And Zach, how you want us to think about
provisioning in 2020?

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

Yes. This is Rich. The testing that we've done -- and again, this is new, so we're kind of going through
quarter-by-quarter. The testing that we did CECL to BAU showed that there were some quarterly volatility.
But over the course of the year, it tended to level itself out. So we don't see a lot of -- we see more
volatility on a quarterly basis, going forward, but we don't expect a material change in the overall
provision under CECL than we had under the incurred loss method up.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James.

David Joseph Long
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

With your revenue outlook for the year, what is the rate backdrop that you are assuming right now?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

This is Zach. I'll take that question, David. Good to talk with you. We're essentially assuming the forward
yield curve as it existed in November, although it's relatively consistent with where it looks right now. The
Fed funds expectation is relatively neutral. I think the actual forward rate, look at it precisely, included
forecasted one rate cut sort of in the late summertime period. But I think as we noted in the prepared

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 23, 2020

remarks, based on our hedging program, our net interest income, NIM, is essentially neutralized from one
rate increase or one rate decrease from today. So I would say, sort of taking a step back, so we're roughly
flat from where we are today.

David Joseph Long
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And if the rate backdrop goes against you, do you have additional levers that you can pull on the
expense side, so you can still produce positive operating leverage?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes, we do. I think under most realistic rate scenarios, as I mentioned, the hedging program will keep
our NIM pretty constant. So we're not expecting to have to pull those expense levers, but as always, we
do have a number of expense levers that we've got at our disposal. I'll take down a few of them. We can
always look at the pacing and phasing of our strategic growth initiatives. We've got the #1 branch share
in Michigan and Ohio. And so looking at our branch network and the costs around that is an opportunity. I
think, generally, as we see revenue soft than we typically see in just the linked variable expense reduction
from compensation tend to mitigate and offset that. So those are the levers we've got, and responsibly,
we look at all the time. There are other levers like staffing contingency plans, which you saw us pull in
the fourth quarter of 2019, which are out of disposal. But again, it's not our expectation that we'll have
to do that in 2020. The last thing I would just say is, you commented positive operating leverage, we are
managing and expecting to generate positive operating leverage in 2020.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.

Rahul Suresh Patil
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. Just have a 2-part question on your auto lending business.
Considering that one of the biggest players in auto lending is now becoming more active in this space,
are you seeing pressure on pricing or your ability to grow auto loans at the pace that you had previously
expected? And then the second part is tied to CECL. The CECL implementation impact your appetite for
auto loans going forward? Just trying to gauge what's your 2020 auto loan growth outlook following a
flattish average balance in 2019.

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

Yes, John (sic) [ Rahul ], it's Rich. I'll take that. So I'll take the second question first. So as it relates to
CECL, the auto business is really neutral. The weighted average life of our typical auto loan is not that
much different than what we had under the incurred loss methodology. So it's a fairly benign impact
from a CECL standpoint. As it relates to the overall business strategy, I think we have just a tremendous
franchise across multiple states with thousands of dealers that we've got the ability to drive volume. I
think we are in a very high FICO band that tends to be more price-sensitive than others. So I don't see
us having any real issues in meeting the origination goals that we've got for the indirect auto business in
2020.

Rahul Suresh Patil
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then last quarter, I believe you'd indicated that the consensus NIM estimate around that time of
3.20% for full year '20 was reasonable, but I believe that you had assumed, earlier a couple of rate cuts in
that 2020 NIM guidance. Could you just discuss your updated thoughts? I know you talked about rebound
in first half and then stable. But are you still comfortable with that 3.20% level right now?

Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll answer that one. So the answer is yes. We are still
comfortable with the approximately 3.20% guidance that we talked about in December at the Goldman
Sachs Conference and then just reiterated today in the prepared remarks. We expect the trajectory of
that to be ticking higher into the first quarter, so stabilizing around that level by mid-second quarter and
then oscillating around that level through the balance of the year. There's really a couple of big drivers of
that. So the most substantial of which is the repricing of the deposit maturities that we talked about in
the prepared remarks there's roughly $5 billion repricing in Q1 and another $4 billion repricing in Q2. And
so far, we're really pleased with both the retention and the pricing on that, which is proceeding according
to our plans. The other factor, which is a little smaller, but still helpful is the 70 basis points of pickup we
got on the securities repositioning that we discussed earlier. So those 2 factors are what's driving that
and helping us to get the NIM to back to 3.20%. With that being said, there's a couple of factors we're
watching: asset yields on new production. All of your previous question are around auto and residential.
We continue to see them where we want them, but that's something we look at very carefully. The other
one is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the volume and rate for the deposit costs. Again, we're
seeing the trend on our expectation, but it's something that we'll continue to watch. Those are the biggest
factors that could cause the NIM to be higher or lower than that 3.20%.

Rahul Suresh Patil
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then I just want to clarify one thing, and that is assuming a cut, a rate cut, in the summer of
this year?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. It's assuming essentially the forward rate curve that exists in November, as I mentioned, which if you
look precisely at the Fed funds expectation and that had one cut over the late summertime period. But
even if it's flat, we're going to be roughly at the same amount.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

One more question on the deposit side of things. See, what you're expecting for total growth, I'm
assuming that's still coming from core customer growth. You mentioned the $5 billion that's going
to reprice. Underneath that, can you just talk about what's happening in your markets as far as just
underlying core deposit pricing? And if that's still also coming down aside from what you're just scheduled
is going to reprice from the rollovers?

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean, I think we're -- as I said, we're seeing the repricing activity be pretty much in line with our
expectations ticking down, but also being somewhat competitive. So we've assumed and planned for the
rate environment we've got right now, and we're seeing it trend in that way.

Mark A. Muth
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Ken, this is Mark. I would say that generally what we're seeing on the consumer side is very rational
and as we would have expected. And the repricing coming in both with better pricing and better retention
has allowed us to then be a little more aggressive on the commercial side, which we do see is more
competitive. If you were to point to some of the competitive issues out there, it definitely is on the

commercial side, in particular, with your large dollar deposits on the commercial side. And we've just
allowed some of those to leave the bank as a result of the success we're having on consumer side.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then one more question just on the mix of the balance sheet with pretty good loan
growth and pretty good deposit growth, what do you see happening in terms of both the size of securities
portfolio? And can you talk about the underlying dynamics of -- in a stable rate environment, your front
book, back book?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

So the expectation for the securities portfolio, this is Zach, roughly constant from where we are today,
no material change. We like where it's at. And that's the expectation at this point. The second part of the
question was...

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

Front book, back book.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Rolling off securities and rolling on how -- if rates stay low -- stay where they are from here, what's the
dynamic happening in there?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

I mean, let's take that offline. I don't have that detail right in front of me.

Mark A. Muth
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Yes, Ken, I've got that downstairs. I'll follow up with you on that.

Operator
