Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor
Relations and Treasurer.

Daniel M. Meziere
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Brock. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. With me this
morning are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer.

Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared
remarks are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. Today's presentation also
includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the
slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP
measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.

As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of
our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and
the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from
actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 25 that are
more fully described in our SEC filings.

Our first speaker today is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos
Energy. We are off to a solid start to the fiscal year. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2021 first quarter net
income of $218 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance largely reflects positive
rate count and outcomes driven by system modernization spending, customer growth in our distribution
segment and lower O&M spending, largely due to the timing of such spending in both of our segments.

Consolidated operating income increased by 18% to $299 million in the first quarter. Slide 4 summarizes
the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate outcomes provide an incremental
$50 million in operating income. Customer growth in our Distribution segment contributed an incremental
$6 million as we continue to benefit from the strong population growth in several of our service areas,
most notably in our North Texas distribution business.

For the 12 months ended December 31, we experienced 1.7% net customer growth in our North Texas
distribution business and 1.4% net growth across our 8-state footprint.

The ongoing effects of the pandemic reduced consolidated operating income by approximately $9
million this quarter, primarily in our Distribution segment. Quarter-over-quarter, operating income fell
approximately $2.5 million due to lower commercial demand attributable to the effect of the pandemic
on the economy. Additionally, we experienced a $4.5 million decline in service order revenues, primarily
due to the temporary suspension of collection activities and bad debt expense increased about $2 million
quarter-over-quarter.

Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt, decreased $16 million. During the quarter, we deferred
noncompliant spending into later in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load. O&M in our

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

Distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel
and training costs. O&M in our pipeline and storage segment was approximately $8 million lower than
prior year, primarily due to nonrecurring low integrity costs incurred in the prior year combined with O&M
management during the first quarter of this year.

Consolidated capital spending decreased approximately 14% to $457 million with 87% of our spending
directed towards safety, reliability spending to modernize our system. This decrease largely reflects the
timing of product spending in our Distribution segment. We remain on track to spend between $2 billion
and $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year, with more than 80% of the spending focused on
modernizing our distribution and transmission network while reducing methane emissions.

We continue to execute our well-established regulatory strategy focused on annual filing mechanisms,
which mitigate the incremental impact of customer bills while reducing lag. To date, we have implemented
$110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. And currently, we have about $32 million in progress.
Slides 18 through 24 summarize these outcomes, and Slide 17 outlines our planned filings through the
remainder of the fiscal year.

During the first quarter, we completed over $700 million of long-term financing. We remain focused on
balancing the need to finance our capital expenditure program in a cost-effective manner with maintaining
the strength of our balance sheet.

Following the completion of our $600 million 10-year note issuance in October, we reduced our weighted
average cost of debt to 3.99% and achieved a weighted average maturity of approximately 19 years. We
also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 1.2 million shares for $122
million, and we settled forward agreements on 2.1 million shares for approximately $216 million in net
proceeds during the quarter.

As of December 31, we have approximately $247 million in net proceeds available under existing foreign
sales agreements that we will utilize by the end of the fiscal year. We have now priced a substantial
portion of our fiscal 2021 equity needs and anticipate satisfying our remaining fiscal '21 equity needs
through our ATM program.

As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.5% as of December 31, and we
finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward
agreements.

The strength of our balance sheet in our 5-year plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating
agencies. During the first quarter, Moody's and S&P maintained their ratings with a stable outlook. Details
of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on Slides 6 through 9.

So to summarize, our first quarter performance, our financing activities and regulatory activities were
in line with our expectations. As we continue through the winter heating season, we continue to remain
cautious, given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. However, with yesterday's reaffirmation, we
remain confident in our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance of $4.90 to $5.10.

Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his remarks. Kevin?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Chris. As you can see from our first quarter results, we are off to a good start. We remain
focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize
our natural gas distribution transmission and storage systems.

We are continuing our investments in people, processes and technology that will enable Atmos Energy to
scale and efficiently and safely invest $11 billion to $12 billion over the next 5 years.

Working to achieve our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we provide safety
messaging to our customers and our communities, innovate and advance employee training and invest
in the modernization of our system. Over the last 10 years, we have invested more than $11 billion

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

company-wide to modernize our pipeline infrastructure, over 80% of which was allocated to safety. And
over the next 5 years, we anticipate spending $11 billion to $12 billion as we replace approximately 5,000
to 6,000 miles of our distribution and transmission pipe, including the replacement of the remaining cast
iron by the end of 2021.

To build upon our continuous improvement efforts, in 2016, we started the process of implementing a
pipeline safety management system, following the American Petroleum Institute's 2015 publication of
the voluntary recommended practice. This voluntary measure encourages continuous improvement by
reviewing practices, policies and procedures as we learn from our experiences and from those of others in
the industry.

This quarter, the National Transportation Safety Board held a public meeting on January 12 related to
the incident that occurred at a Dallas, Texas residence in February 2018. The field investigation and lab
reports confirmed that unreported third-party excavation damage from mechanical equipment caused the
main to crack and leak. We are currently reviewing the complete findings and recommendations released
after the meeting and expect to receive the final report soon.

Because third-party damage remains one of the greatest threats to natural gas distribution systems, we
have been and will continue to be a champion for damage prevention. Through such efforts as auditing our
third-party line locating services to empowering our employees to proactively stop by excavation sites, to
provide damage prevention materials and ensure proper 81 notification.

We have seen our third-party damage rate continue to outperform the industry average. We continue to
undertake numerous safety and other continuous improvement actions, such as updating our leak survey
and leak investigation procedures to include mandatory 911 notification when a probable or existing
hazardous condition is discovered, if first responders are not already on site.

As I've discussed before, we've enhanced our technical training program to provide a virtual format,
coupled with hands-on experience for our employees. In this virtual training environment, we have been
able to reduce class sizes and duration to improve the training experience, all without sacrificing quality.
These are only a few of the improvements that Atmos Energy has been making towards achieving our
vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services.

You may recall on our FY 2020 fourth quarter earnings call, we announced 5 focus areas in our
environmental strategy, all designed to reduce our carbon footprint in combination with our pipe
replacement efforts. These 5 focus areas are gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. I also
discussed the progress made in minimizing our carbon footprint as well as our water and land impact at
some of our offices and service centers.

Today, I want to highlight another focus area for you, gas supply. We are working to increase the amount
of RNG that we have on our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. Annually, we moved
nearly 5.5 Bcf of RNG across our system, which represents approximately 2% of our distribution sales
volumes. We are currently assessing over 20 RNG opportunities adjacent to our system in several states
for additional supply.

During the first quarter, we initiated a project in Colorado with a dairy to connect RNG from their
facility to our system. Although it's too soon to commit to how much RNG we can ultimately transport
across our system, please note we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop
the frameworks for commercially viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the
environment.

Finally, during the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting as we published our
third corporate responsibility and sustainability report as well as our methane emissions report. Both of
these can be found in the corporate responsibility section of our website. These reports, paired with our
corporate responsibility section of our website, allow us to tell our story and keep stakeholders informed
about what we are doing to support the communities where we live and work.

As you can see from the highlighted continuous improvement efforts, we remain focused on the long-term
sustainability of Atmos Energy. And the foundation of that long-term sustainability is the 4,700 men and

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

women who are dedicated to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and
getting back to the communities where we live and work every day. They are successfully executing a
proven strategy that is focused on modernizing our system to safely deliver reliable and affordable natural
gas in an environmentally responsible manner.

The long-term fundamentals of this strategy remain the same. They are supported by the fact that we
operate in constructive jurisdictions where several of our markets continue to have strong long-term
growth potential, most notably, the DFW Metroplex, which is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the
country. Additionally, these jurisdictions recognize the value that natural gas provides to their economies
in an environmentally responsible manner.

The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves
us well positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to
homes, businesses and industries to fuel our industry needs -- energy needs now and in the future.
I appreciate your time this morning, and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. And we'll take any
questions that you may have, and I'll turn it back over to the operator.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to start off, there was a lot of concerns in the market, obviously, last March when COVID
hit. And this was the first heating season where you guys got to see the full impact there. And just
wondering if you could expand a bit on -- can you speak to the COVID impacts on the quarter versus
your expectations? And are you seeing impacts kind of consistent going forward into 2021 with your
expectations overall?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Sure, Jeremy. I'll start here, and Kevin, feel free to jump in as well. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, we had
about a $9 million quarter-over-quarter impact, but we've attributed to COVID between commercial load
loss, the decline in service order revenues and a little bit of bad debt expense.

On the commercial load loss, that is certainly well within the planning scenarios that we had developed
over the summer and into the fall as we established our earnings per share guidance. So from that
perspective, we're pleased to see that the commercial load loss is in line with those expectations. We'll
continue to monitor that as we move through the second quarter. We got still another 2 or 3 months left
in our winter heating season, which, by the end of winter heating season we'll have about 70% of our
distribution revenues booked for the fiscal year, and we'll have some more clarity around what the impact
on the margin line item will be.

Same thing with the service order revenues. A lot of it will be contingent upon when we resume full
collection activities. And we're working with our regulators on that, keeping you abreast of what we're
doing there and -- but again, that is completely in line with our expectation.

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Jeremy, the only thing I'll add to that is, as you've heard us say many times before, our team, our
risk management compliance team, our operations team, our shared service group, continue to adhere
and follow to our practices and protocols are in place, again, allowing us to continue to execute at the
highest level on all fronts.

Even though we've seen an increase in some parts of our territory in the number of cases, we are glad
to see the vaccine start to be rolling out across our service territory as well. But we believe with those
practice, protocols and things we've been able to have in place over the last 10 months, we'll continue to
execute on a go-forward basis at a very high level.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's very helpful. And maybe just kind of turning over to O&M, given the O&M tailwinds you've realized
already, what are the main drivers in timing of your expected O&M growth over the course of the year?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So in the O&M, as we talked about last quarter, we've assumed kind of a full O&M budget, if you will,
our full compliance program. So our strategy going into the first quarter was to defer some spending that

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

we didn't need to do in the first quarter to kind of see how the customer load loss was materializing. I
think we've got a better handle on that now.

And as you saw in some of the details around the guidance, we're still reaffirming the O&M range that we
initially put out last fall. So again, a lot of that will be focused on compliance activities as well as other
activities designed to mitigate risk.

As you heard Kevin talk about, third-party damage will continue to step up our efforts in that particular
area as well as just other system and maintenance activities that were not necessarily compliance-
oriented, but we certainly want to be performing to maintain the system the way that we like to maintain
it.

You've heard us talk before. We certainly assume in our O&M plan, not just what we need to meet
compliance purposes just to meet and just in time, but we're also keeping an eye towards what our
requirements are further down the line, later in the fiscal year or into next year so that we are well ahead
of those compliance requirements that we can meet those deadlines without having to wait to the last
minute.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And you touched on this a bit in your commentary, but I was hoping you could
expand a bit more. It seems for the -- in the marketplace for the LDC space as a whole, there's some
concern with regards to new laws that could impact new gas hookups effectively banning that. Just
wondering, I guess, how you guys see that risk for you in your service territories. And how, I guess, it
compares for Atmos versus other LDC peers and differences you see there?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Jeremy, I'll start with that. Again, as I've said, we have very constructive rate jurisdictions, and we
continue to see growth, as Chris talked about, across our service territory. We haven't seen any bands,
whether they're on hookups or usage or those sort of things across our service territory. We stay in close
contact through our stakeholder engagement strategy, our local public affairs and operating teams with
our city jurisdictions, our state legislators as well, keeping them informed of what value natural gas brings,
what Atmos Energy is doing in their communities. So we stay in touch with them to keep them up-to-
date on an ongoing basis and haven't really seen anything come up at the legislative level or through
discussions regarding gas bans or appliance hookups at this point.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And I think we might have seen some legislation in some states that -- at the state level that would
ban or stop these type of bans. Have you guys seen anything like that in your service stories or have any
expectations for that?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We're working with associations and peer companies in all of our jurisdictions to keep an eye on bills
that are being filed at the state level. These are called all fuels bills, if you will. You may recall that last
year, there was one approved in Tennessee and one approved in Louisiana, and we're very encouraged
by those bills. I think it highlights the value that natural gas continues to bring and the value of customer
choice and choosing an affordable energy opportunity across our footprint. So we're aware of those. We're
working with the different associations. We're working with our peer companies as well to make sure that
customers have that choice of fuel going forward.

The next question is from Richie Ciciarelli of Bank of America.

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

Richard Jude Ciciarelli
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just on the customer growth side, it's obviously pretty impressive this quarter. Just could you provide
any more color on what you're seeing from a customer class? Is it more on the residential side with new
customer hookups? And how has that kind of progressed into fiscal 2Q thus far with potentially more
immigration into the State of Texas there?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I'll start, and Kevin, you can certainly help out as well. As I said, we've got 1.4% across the 8-
state footprint, 1.7% here in North Texas and a lot of that is new residential growth. And it's a trend
that we started -- what we've really been seeing now for quite some time, but it's continued throughout
this pandemic. I think the stories are reading, you see more and more folks that are interested in
maybe moving into the suburbs looking for either a first home or be a different type of home as they're
accommodating their work-from-home protocols and strategies. So that's what's driving a lot of the
growth.

Certainly here in the North Texas area, we continue to see robust underlying economic activity in terms
of companies evaluating the Dallas-Fort Worth market in terms of relocating in this area, and we continue
to see them. Come to Dallas, there are cranes and construction everywhere. So I mean we're still seeing
that underlying activity. And again, a lot of that's being driven by the residential class and that's consistent
too, across the footprint. And then really, in our first quarter, the number of hookups that we had from a
residential perspective was among the highest that we've seen in a number of years. And we're grateful to
see that not only in North Texas, but across most of our service territories.

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Chris, I'll just quickly add to that. In addition, in some of our other states, Mississippi, Kentucky,
we're seeing industrial expansion as well, which is a good sign in this economy as well as new industrial
customers coming into those locations as well. So we see it, as Chris said, with residential commercial
starting to move into Metroplex, but again, good opportunity on the industrial side and our other footprint
as well.

Richard Jude Ciciarelli
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And then just on your equity needs, obviously, you mentioned you price a good
portion of the forward and then the remaining is through the ATM this year, but just as you think about
kind of your long-term plan keeping that cap structure towards the 60% level, given you can earn on
actual cash structure in Texas, I mean -- and just given where your multiple is, could you look at other
forms, whether it's portfolio optimization to kind of recycle capital or creating a Holdco structure? Just
curious how you guys are thinking about that just given where your multiple is today?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. I mean, we certainly -- we put together our strategic plan every year, refresh it, if you will. I mean
these are things that we're certainly thinking about. I'll just remind everybody that when we put together
our most recent 5-year plan and consistent with what we've done in the last several years, all of our
equity financing is already assumed in that 5-year plan.

So when you look at the 6% to 8% earnings and dividends per share growth, the projected share price
that we put out -- sorry, earnings per share out in the out years that has assumed a wide variety of
potential stock prices. And we put that guidance out after we've gone through that rigorous assessment.
So we feel, right now, the current financing strategy is one -- that is one, been successful for us in the

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

past. We continue to believe that will be successful for us in the future and -- but we will continue to
evaluate certainly different structures.

And we've talked about before in terms of asset dispositions, our 8-state footprint, we're very, very
comfortable with. We've got good jurisdictions, very constructive jurisdictions that we're very familiar with
these jurisdictions. And as this -- again, we always consider it, but that's not a key part of our strategy,
and we don't need that type of activity to achieve the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth over the next
5 years.

Richard Jude Ciciarelli
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And just one more, if I can slip in. On the RNG front, you mentioned you're looking
over I guess, 20 different RNG opportunities. Are you seeing this coming from new outlets or what's kind
of driving this demand? Is it more on the dairy farm side or landfills? Just curious what kind of customer
base you're looking at over there?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Yes. You hit the answer there with the last 2. It's the dairy industry itself and its landfill projects at this
point, probably have the majority of those approximately 20 projects that we're looking at. And it's
scattered across our footprint. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, we've just closed out a supply
project with a firm there in Colorado. And we continue to work on several others across Kentucky and
other parts of our jurisdiction as well, but they're in that area. They're in the dairy side and the landfill
side at this point.

Operator

The next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is a follow-up to the customer growth one. When you look -- when we look at what's
embedded in your 5-year growth plan, what's the range of customer growth across the jurisdictions that
you're assuming?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We put together the plan. We're pretty conservative on that growth estimate because it's difficult to
estimate when exactly it will materialize. So we basically just assume that the same customer count or
customer base that we had at the time that we published the plan and just let that growth be a bit of an
upside for us as it materializes. Again, primarily because it's very difficult to forecast in which period that
growth may occur.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. So I guess when we look at the capital spend and the rate base growth, it's not -- the bulk of it,
again, is just the infrastructure replacement and modernization as opposed to new customer line hookups?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Right. Safety here -- yes, yes.

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Exactly. As I mentioned earlier, over 80% is focused there.

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Got it. My other question is, to your comments on safety improvement initiatives and actions that
you've taken already and following up on the NTSB recommendations, when -- given the report that had
come out about a month ago, do you -- what do you see from either an O&M perspective or, I guess, a
capital perspective that could be elevated versus your plan? Or is that already embedded in the growth
plan that you've laid out?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Because we continually evaluate our practices and our protocols and adopted several of the
recommendations already into practices, you'll find that on our website. We don't believe that
implementing the recommendations that have been laid forth will have a material impact on capital or
O&M at this point.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Charles Fishman of Morningstar.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Just another follow-up on the NTSB report. So at this point, we're just waiting on the final report. You're
waiting on the final report. Is there anything else that's triggered by that final report? I mean, is there any
-- is the Railroad Commission waiting on that report to issue some kind of final -- their final report, any of
your city regulatory bodies, any insurance claims, any legal issues? I mean, is there anything else that's
out there besides this final NTSB report?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

There's a lot packed in there. Let me see if I can cover all of those for you. The final report itself, from
our understanding, Charles, is merely just corrections or edits to the abstract and other information that
you've seen out there already. And again, we anticipate that coming out really soon.

And the Railroad Commission was a party to the investigation just as we work, and they paused their
investigation until the NTSB was complete. So we anticipate them to pick up their investigation sometime
here soon. As you saw in one of the recommendations, they'll be partnering with FEMSA to do an audit of
our integrity management programs. So we anticipate them to pick their investigation back up and close it
out relatively soon. I think on your other question, there is no open litigation related to the incident.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And looking at the preliminary report or the virtual meeting last month, well, it appears the Railroad
Commission and pipeline and hazardous materials administration, they have a to-do list, too. So I guess, I
mean, their report would include the things they have to do.

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We'll all receive -- in that NTSB report, those recommendations, as you pointed out, were directed
to several of the parties to the investigation. We'll all have responses back to the NTSB. And it's my
understanding that our initial responses will have a timeframe of about 90 days or so to get our initial
response back once we receive that final report.

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

Okay. And then just one other almost a housekeeping question. Slide 13, Footnote 2, where you have
no regulatory assets or liabilities related to COVID-19 at this point? Yet, it's my understanding you have
received approval to record regulatory assets and just about all of your service territories. So the decision
not to record any regulatory asset at this point based on COVID-19, was your decision and is driven by
the fact that you were able to control your expenses at this point that they were reduced enough that you
didn't feel the need to record any reg assets. Is that a fair assessment of that?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's pretty close. I mean, as you mentioned, Charles, we've got the orders that cover about 90% of
our customer base right now. We're evaluating the language in those orders. They were sufficiently broad
and so we're interpreting how best to evaluate that order vis-à-vis our filings, talking with our regulators.
And we anticipate by the end of the fiscal year that we will establish some form regulatory asset. It's just
a matter of timing in this fiscal year when we establish that, but we are closely evaluating that right now
and that's been factored into the guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. So it's more timing that you didn't have anything in the first quarter. Got it.

Operator

There are no additional questions at this time.

Daniel M. Meziere
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer
