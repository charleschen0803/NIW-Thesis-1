Thank you very much, Adam, and good afternoon, everyone
I'm extremely pleased to tell you today about another great quarter for the CBS Corporation
As you can see from our results, we continue to have more and more success as the landscape continues to change
Revenue was up 9% to $3.3 billion, with top line growth in every one of our four business segments
And EPS was up 12% to $1.04, representing our 30th consecutive quarter of EPS growth
Both of these totals were second quarter records for us
Clearly, our company keeps performing in the way that you've come to expect
Our base advertising business is strong and growing, and at the same time, we're laying new groundwork to ensure even more growth ahead
To do this, we are not only capitalizing on the changes in our industry, but we are shaping the direction of these changes as well
In that regard, I have some important announcements to make right here at the top
Each of them shows how we're continually positioning CBS for the future while also building on the great results we're delivering to you today
First, regarding our OTT services, we can now say that CBS All Access and Showtime OTT are set to exceed 4 million subscribers combined before the end of 2017. We're only in year two of our five-year plan, and already we're more than halfway to our goal of 8 million subs by 2020, which is obviously quite conservative now
These services are just starting to hit their stride with much more and bigger programming to come, so being this far along so early in the game is a terrific development
Next, I'm also pleased to announce today that we will be expanding CBS All Access into the international marketplace starting in the first half of 2018. We will launch initially in Canada and then follow that up with additional countries on multiple continents shortly thereafter
Over time, we will add content from across our corporation to make our service more and more attractive
We are very aware of the international success that other streaming companies have had
We now see a huge opportunity for CBS to go direct to consumer on a much bigger scale worldwide
Also, over at Showtime, today we're announcing that our highly anticipated pay-per-view matchup between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor will be available directly to consumers over-the-top
This is the first time we've made a boxing or pay-per-view event available in this way, and it means that even if you're not yet a Showtime subscriber, you'll be able to purchase the fight directly from Showtime's app or website
Anyone who does will get a free trial to Showtime OTT, which will drive new subs for us as well
And also in the over-the-top arena, CBSN, our digital news service, has been a terrific growth engine for us with streams up 38% in the second quarter
We're now broadening its reach by making it available on CBS All Access, and for the first time as a stand-alone channel in skinny bundles as well
Also, taking the experience we gained developing CBSN, we're now in the early stages of replicating its success in the world of sports
Later this year, we will roll out a 24/7 live streaming channel like CBSN for sports as part of our ongoing OTT strategy
It does not yet have a name
We think sports fans are looking for something like this, and that opportunity is significant
So from All Access and Showtime to CBSN and CBS Sports streaming service, we're building extremely valuable OTT assets as bundles keep getting redefined and reimagined
Clearly, there's a lot of upside here
And as distribution continues to change, the rise of virtual MVPDs and skinny bundles are also a great story for us
These are smaller bundles that focus on the most compelling content and that pay us more per sub than the traditional bundles do
Already this year, we've signed on with Hulu, YouTube TV and fubo, and these new services have begun contributing to our results in a meaningful way
And today, fresh off the presses, we're very pleased to announce that we will also be part of DIRECTV NOW, meaning we will soon be available on the vast majority of all skinny bundles in the marketplace
As Nielsen continues to add these skinny bundles to its measurement, we are benefiting from a dual-revenue stream that includes advertising from ratings and increasing affiliate fees from carriage
Meanwhile, revenue from traditional MVPD distribution continues to grow rapidly, too, with retrans and reverse comp up 25% during the quarter
So when you add this to what I just told you regarding OTT and virtual MVPDs, you can see why this is such a great growth story for us
By exploiting all these different platforms and by successfully licensing our content around the globe, we have dramatically changed our overall revenue mix
Of extreme importance, during the quarter, we achieved a 60%/40% split between non-advertising and advertising revenue, which is a record for us
That's just 40% of our revenue that now comes from advertising
About 10 years ago, it was greater than 70%
We love advertising, but diversifying our revenue leads to more certainty in our earnings
We began pursuing this strategy a long time ago, and as a result our revenue is now faster-growing and more reliable
Don't get me wrong, advertising is doing very well for us, too, as evidenced by the tremendous success the CBS Television Network had in this year's upfront
Despite many predictions that upfront volume would be down, ours was up, plus we got pricing increases in the high-single digits
And in the morning and late night, we did even better with pricing increases up double digits
In addition, we continue to negotiate our upfront deals in a way that better reflects how people are watching our content
It is now standard for advertisers to pay us for commercials that are seen up to seven days after the show airs, otherwise known as C7. And for the first time, there are some deals that get us paid through 35 days
This is a major positive change for us, and when you look at the final numbers from the most recent 2016-2017 season, you can see why
Nielsen's new total content ratings show that our viewership went up 53% when you include days 2 through 35 after air, and last year's audience was just as big as it was 10 years ago
Plus so far, total content ratings really only include VOD and DVRs and not the majority of digital viewing
So there's a long way to go and a major upside for us, and what is clear is that on any given night, we have millions of viewers that are just beginning to be counted and just beginning to be monetized
To take advantage of this, last week we realigned our sales teams so we can more easily sell our CBS content across platforms
We promoted Jo Ann Ross, who's clearly the best in the business, to President and Chief Advertising Revenue Officer
We gave Dave Morris, who'd been Head of CBS Interactive Sales an expanded role; and then we brought in David Lawenda from Facebook who knows the evolving world of digital advertising as well as anybody, and will now oversee the interactive sales team for us
Together, Jo Ann, Dave, and David and our terrific CBS sales force are already fast at work creating new and improved ways for our clients to buy our number one lineup and all the industry-leading content we provide on both broadcast and digital platforms
Beyond advertising, as we mentioned, we derive significant revenue from our CBS lineup through content licensing
This coming season, our own CBS Studios will produce or coproduce more than 80% of our primetime schedule, including five of our six new series, as well as both of the shows we picked up for midseason
In addition, we are producing for Showtime and the CW, and increasingly for outlets outside of the CBS Corporation as well
When you put it all together, CBS Studios is producing an all-time high of 54 series across 11 different media outlets, including broadcast, cable, and some of the biggest streaming platforms in the industry, from Apple to Netflix
And last week, we entered a new content partnership with Imagine, headed by the incomparable Brian Grazer and Ron Howard
With this deal, CBS, Showtime, and All Access will now get a first look at Imagine's television projects
More importantly, going forward, all Imagine shows will be co-produced and co-distributed by CBS, meaning we will now begin monetizing a whole new set of programming from this terrific partner
A great recent example of the power of owning content is the new version of Dynasty that will premiere this fall on CW
We own 100% of the show and we've already licensed it to Netflix in 188 countries, similar to the lucrative deal we did for our new Star Trek: Discovery franchise last year
So this means Dynasty is profitable before it even hits the air
And speaking of international success, this season NCIS was once again recognized as the world's most watched drama, the third time in four years that NCIS has achieved this feat
And as a company, we're four for four because the only year it wasn't NCIS, it was our very own CSI, and we try very hard to get these initials right
Turning to late night, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden have incredible momentum
This was the first season in 22 years that CBS has been number one at 11:30. And this summer, Colbert is the only late-night broadcast show that's up in all demos, with viewers up 35%
And at 12:30, James Corden is growing faster than any of his broadcast competitors, and his online phenomenon continues to grow
Tomorrow, his Carpool Karaoke spinoff show will make its U.S
debut as a full series on Apple
And we've also licensed the show as a format into many territories around the world
We are extremely proud that both Colbert and Corden were recognized with several big Emmy nominations, including outstanding talk series
It's the first time since 2003 that two daily broadcast late-night talk shows from the same network were nominated for this award in the same year
And remember, these shows have only been around for two years
We also did very well with Emmy nominations at CBS News
Our 43 nominations were more than any other news organization in the business outside of PBS
Part of that was thanks to 60 Minutes, which continues to dominate in the ratings
Even in repeats, it remains the most watched news program this summer despite the direct competition of a new news magazine
So as 60 Minutes enters its 50th anniversary season, we will feature Oprah Winfrey as a new contributor, and it's as strong as ever
Turning to CBS Sports, we're looking forward to the NFL returning next month
We have been working with the league throughout the off-season to enhance the viewing experience, and we're confident this will pay off with higher ratings
We're also excited about the debut of Tony Romo in our broadcast booth, who will no doubt benefit from the tutelage of the great Jim Nantz
Plus, having an entire season of the NFL on CBS All Access is a very important development for us
Late last year when the NFL was added, our weekly sign-ups were on average 75% higher than in the weeks before it was added to our platform
Speaking of All Access, you've all heard quite a bit about the debut of Star Trek: Discovery next month
I've now seen the first six episodes, and I can assure you that it is terrific
It's a perfect vehicle to take All Access to the next level and beyond
After that, in addition to the return of The Good Fight, we've just announced three new All Access original series, including a comedy from Will Ferrell
So with a full season of the NFL, Star Trek: Discovery, and more and more original programming, every episode of every show on CBS this fall, and international expansion, we are just getting started with All Access
At the same time, our Showtime over-the-top service is coming off a terrific quarter as well, thanks largely to Twin Peaks
The premiere of the show led to our biggest day and biggest weekend ever for OTT signups, and the percentage of viewers streaming Twin Peaks is the highest we've ever had for a show, which is good news because OTT subscribers are more profitable for us
To keep up the momentum, last night we had the season premiere of Ray Donovan, and we'll have another new season of Shameless in the fall followed by the return of Homeland and Billions as well
We're also continuing the lucrative expansion of Showtime brand overseas
In addition to the CANAL+ deal we told you about last call, we recently announced an agreement with Fox to bring Showtime to Southeast Asia as well as a deal with Hotstar, India's largest premium streaming platform
Each of these deals begins a new recurring revenue stream for Showtime that will benefit us for years to come
Turning to publishing, Simon & Schuster turned in a terrific quarter as well, led by strong growth in digital audio
We have two big titles on the way here in the third quarter
The first one is a new book from Hillary Clinton called What Happened, in which she truly opens up and gives her personal story about last year's controversial presidential election
And the second is from New England Patriots, Tom Brady, who will share his secrets for nutrition and training, which I'm sure will be helpful to many of you on this call and in this room
And in local media, our TV stations continue to benefit from our big event programming like the final four which performed very well for us locally during the quarter
Looking ahead, we're having good success selling the NFL, and of course our TV stations continue to benefit from retrans as well
So as you have heard, it's been quite a busy few months for us
And as you can see across our company, we continue to manage our business and stay ahead of the game
In distribution, we are leveraging the strength of our content to be a leading player in the new skinny bundles and the traditional ones, too
And with our growing over-the-top channels, we are set up to succeed no matter how people choose to consume their content
In content licensing, we are more active than ever in terms of creating shows that we own
The capacity and the output of CBS Studios is growing rapidly, and as it does, so does our ability to monetize our programming on air and online, domestically and around the world
And in advertising, we are extremely well-positioned to in the back half of 2017. We'll have our new upfront rates, more primetime hours to sell without the political preemptions of last year, and more money in the marketplace without the Summer Olympics
Beyond that, we have political again in 2018 and the Super Bowl back in 2019. Once again, we are extremely pleased with this quarter as well as how we are set up for the future
Clearly across the board, CBS is set up for success and we know how to get the job done
We look forward to delivering for our shareholders in the quarters and years ahead just as we've been doing for a long, long time
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe
Ben, it's a very good question
And obviously, the whole key to international expansion is having the available content that we are making over $1 billion, and that is growing, as Joe had mentioned during the call
Once again, when you see a Netflix getting 50 million international subs, you say gee, that marketplace is so huge, we think there's a way to have our cake and eat it too, perhaps by selling it with the exclusion of our own OTT service
In terms of predicting numbers, it's really hard to do right now
As you saw, we're very pleased with how our domestic site is doing this fall with Star Trek and NFL and new programming
We think it should really grow quite a bit
So I think we're anticipating a great deal of success
And obviously we have the content from Showtime, from CBS, from our library, from all sorts of places that we'll be able to put on it
And once again, as each year goes by, that content should expand
Regarding news, Jessica, obviously we've expanded greatly
CBSN, as we said, is doing extraordinarily well
In addition, what's encouraging for the future is the average age of the news viewer is 20 years below what it is on the network
And then we announced our deal with BBC, so we're able to join with them and get the use of their news
And once again, 60 Minutes is still extremely profitable
The Morning Show has turned into a big hit for us, so that's a big change for us
And with CBSN, the revenues are growing and growing, and we're just trying more and more ways to exploit how we can do that
CBSN just had a primetime series on the network
Two episodes have aired already, and once again, that brand is growing greatly
And Joe, do you want to talk about the M&A?
Our mantra has always been you can't be a new bundle without CBS, and I think we're proving that to be the case
And so we're very pleased to have joined DIRECT
And as we said, we're in the vast majority of the skinnier bundles
Alexia, I'll take the sports question and I'll let Joe do the tougher question
Look, as you know we already have a very proactive online sports group down in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and as I said, we have the infrastructure that allows CBSN to thrive, which obviously will be used there as well
We have deals with the NFL, the NCAA, FCC football, PGA Tour Golf, lots of different areas
In addition, it's in the very preliminary stages of formation
But CBS is a big player in the sports world
We are going to look to differentiate ourselves from the ESPN and the Fox Sports as well, and we think we have a good opportunity to succeed
The other key, like CBSN, we can keep costs relatively minimal because we already have a great infrastructure for sports like we did with news
So the chances of profitability early on are very good
Mike, on the sports, yes, the competitive bidding is becoming more and more out there, and obviously there's digital players in the sports arena
The good news is we have the NCAA tournament till 2032, so I think we're fairly secure in the near- and far-term on that
In terms of the other rights, look, the NFL has always been extremely supportive of broadcast television
Yes, there's going to be a digital component, and you're right, this service could be – allow us to be a bigger player in that and perhaps get certain digital rights as these contracts come up more and more
But once again, we have proven that broadcast is better than cable, ascertained by our NCAA ratings versus some of the cable people who have the NCAA, and I think the NFL has always stated there's a reason that the Super Bowl is always on network television
It's just higher rated, nobody has the reach that we do
There's no question that digital players will become more important, but we think they will go along with broadcast, not alone
Some of them are
Obviously, we sold Star Trek to Netflix and they will have the worldwide rights going forward
However, a lot of our newer deals, we'll do it
For newer shows, we will sell with the exclusion of a CBS-owned streaming service
So once again, as time progresses there will be more and more available content that we'll be able put on CBS All Access internationally, same with Showtime content, same with CW content
The good news is we have so many different pipelines at CBS that produce content, we think we're going to have a pretty nice suite of shows available and that will grow as each year goes by
Yes
Our international content obviously sells for a lot of money, and it certainly covers our deficit financing
There is a way to do it where we'll be able to sell to international channels, as well as have them on All Access, or there'll be certain shows that will be direct for All Access
So there will be – it's something, obviously, we're aware of, and it's something we'll monitor
And as we've done with All Access like with Star Trek, we could've put Star Trek on Showtime, on the CBS Television Network, or Netflix, Amazon
They all wanted it for a lot of money
We determined that Star Trek would be far better for All Access and will earn us more money
So we're pretty smart about content monetization
We figure out each property and how to best monetize it, and that will continue in the international marketplace
Joe Ianniello can't be more aggressive on anything
No, look, going into this year's upfront, I would venture to say that 75% of the deals last year were C3. I think that has shifted a great deal to C7. By the way, it's a positive for advertisers, it's a positive for us as well that more of the people are counted
So I think going in, we had to get the top advertising agencies on board with the C7 metric, and they did
And by and large, every single one of them is there and it is the standard of the day
What is interesting, as we've talked about the total content ratings, when you get up to the C35, which is going to become even more important going forward, you see ratings going up in certain cases literally over 50%
We used The Big Bang Theory from day 2 to day 35. It was up over 50%
It went from something like 17 million viewers to 24 million viewers
So that is substantial, and that's going to mean a lot of money going forward
Yes
We would love to take all of our profits and put it back into content
We'd be very good at that
Look, obviously, CNN was doing very well, Fox News was doing very well
To begin a brand-new Cable News Network would not be smart and it also wasn't the new modern form of distribution
So it seemed logical for us to go into streaming having the infrastructure we already did in terms of news
Seeing the success we had with news, we say, all right, there's an opportunity there and sports as well
Not that other people aren't there, but our sports networks are doing extremely well online
And once again, it's a great opportunity to be all things to all people and I think we can do it successfully
Look, we've been competitive because of our ratings, our programming, et cetera, and every place that we can sell, we can't sell, one of the reasons we restructured our sales division was because we wanted to look at every possible way of selling to achieve maximum revenue
Programmatic is one of those ways
So we're there as well, and as we've done in every other form of advertising, we've competed very successfully
So we think that we're in very good shape with our new construction of our sales division
Obviously, we have five games
NBC has five games
We expect the NFL to continue and we expect to continue to be a part of it
We love the NFL and we want to continue as we do on Sundays
