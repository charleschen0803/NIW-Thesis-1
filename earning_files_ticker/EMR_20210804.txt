EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the Emerson Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to
Pete Lilly, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Pete Lilly
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us for Emerson's Third
Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal
Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan.

I'd also like to introduce and welcome the new leader of Emerson Investor Relations and certainly an
upgrade for the role, Colleen Mettler. Colleen joins us from the Automation Solutions finance organization
and will be your main point of contact going forward as I transition to a new role in the operating business
units. Many thanks to you all for your support and friendship over the past couple of years. It's been fun. I
certainly wish you health and success.

As always, I encourage everyone to follow along with the accompanying slide presentation, which is
available on our website. Please join me on Slide 2. As always, this presentation may include forward-
looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty.

Please turn to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to Colleen to introduce herself and cover some exciting
developments within Emerson.

Colleen Mettler

Thanks, Pete. I certainly have big shoes to fill. As Pete mentioned, I'm coming into this role from
our Automation Solutions finance organization, and I've been with Emerson for over 13 years. I'm
certainly excited and humbled to be joining the Investor Relations team during this dynamic time for our
organization. I look forward to speaking with all our investors and partners very soon.

Now I would like to take a moment to highlight 2 areas of real ESG impact within Emerson. First, on Slide
3, in keeping with environmental sustainability framework of greening of, by and with Emerson that we
introduced in February, our first topic is about greening by Emerson. It is a great example of how Emerson
solutions are relevant in enabling our customers' sustainability initiatives.

Emerson recently signed a multiyear agreement with PureCycle Technologies, which has a novel
technology and process for fully recycling plastic #5 polypropylene back to a clear pellet. As some of you
may know, polypropylene is a common form of plastic that has not had great recycling options. Emerson
is serving as their born digital automation partner going forward with initial plant projects in Ohio, Georgia
and a remote operation center in Florida.

Now please join me on Slide #4. Our second topic is the greening with Emerson example. Leveraging
our Helix Innovation Center in Dayton, Ohio, Emerson has collaborated with the Department of Energy
and their Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance next-generation HVACR technology. Expanding the
applicability of heat pump technologies, redesigning refrigeration architectures to maximize efficiency in
food retail and working to minimize energy use and leaks in commercial HVAC applications are just a few
of the exciting areas of cooperation. We have a number of collaborations with the Department of Energy
and their labs.

We look forward to continuing to build these relationships and support the development of novel solutions
and real sustainability road maps going forward. Now please turn to Slide 5, and I will turn the call over to
our CEO, Lal Karsanbhai.

EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Colleen. Just a few words before I turn it over to Frank to go through the financial data.

First, Pete, thank you very much. God speed and have a good luck in your new opportunity. We're all very
excited for you and thanks for all the hard work. Welcome, Colleen. Great to have you here. Colleen and I
had the opportunity to spend couple of years together in Automation Solutions, and we're very blessed to
have her join our Investor Relations team. So welcome. Thank you.

I'd like to express my thanks to the leadership teams and the management and our employees globally for
what has been a very, very well-executed quarter. And we have a lot of energy and momentum behind us,
which was very exciting to see as we executed through the last 3 months.

I'd also like to express my thank you to our shareholders. I had the opportunity over the last 6 months to
meet many of you, and I look forward to meeting more of you as I go through the next part of the year.
But I appreciate your continued confidence, your challenges and of course, your investment.

A few things just that are not financially related that I want to mention to the team here. First of all, our
cultural work is well underway. We will be announcing our new Chief People Officer later this month. We're
all very excited about the selection process. It will be an outside hire and somebody who fundamentally
will have the opportunity to come in here and really help us as we navigate some of the challenges and
create many of the pathways that we have as we evolve the culture of Emerson into the future.

Secondly, our portfolio work is complete. We have -- we are now getting ready to review it with the
Board, which will occur at the October Board meeting. We discussed briefly with the Board yesterday.
And essentially, what we have defined is multiple paths for our business to drive higher underlying sales
growth and diversification of the portfolio.

We're all very excited about the process that we underwent. It was very exhaustive, and we have turned
over a lot of different stones, defining broad markets with high growth and lots of optionality in terms of
M&A and organic activity. Very exciting there.

I'll mention on the M&A side that industrial software continues to be critical as we think about share of
wallet, as we think about the potential for underlying growth acceleration and our many pathways there.
Our SI acquisition is performing incredibly well and ahead of our internal synergy board plans. So that's
been very, very well done.

But what stands out to me most above all is the execution by the team. Yes, there were market tailwinds,
and we'll talk about those, particularly as they accelerated in Automation Solutions and continued
across our Commercial & Residential businesses and they are relevant, but the execution was absolutely
phenomenal.

There were a lot of hurdles to overcome through the quarter, material inflation, material availability. We
did a lot of expediting. We had to get very creative in qualifying suppliers, logistics and management of
cargo around the world and of course, labor availability in the United States. But the team just did a great
job.

And lastly, before I turn it over to Frank, the cost reset work is well underway, and we're now in the tail
ends of the spend. And we're seeing, despite these operational headwinds, the value of that work being
reflected in the incrementals of the company.

The operating leverage -- profit leverage at 34% was very strong and now most importantly, has given us
the room to accelerate investment in differentiating technologies and further -- that will further, I think,
drive relevance -- increased relevance at our customer base. So very exciting headroom that's created,
and we started those investments. And I'll share a number of those with you, and we'll talk about that
more as we go through the year.

So with that, I'll turn it over to Frank, and I'll speak towards the end of the call.

Frank J. Dellaquila
Senior EVP & CFO

All right. Thank you, Lal. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. We're especially pleased
with the results in the quarter, especially in light of the operations challenges that Lal just described and
Ram will talk about a little later in the call.

If you please go to Slide 6. So a continued recovery in our end markets, combined with the benefits of the
cost reset actions, and it drove strong operating performance and financial results in the third quarter.

Adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 36% from the prior year. Demand continues to strengthen with sales coming
in ahead of our expectations with underlying growth of 15%, and June trailing 3-month orders were at
26%. Automation Solutions notably turned positive this quarter in both sales and orders, up 9% in sales
and 17% on an underlying basis.

Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across the business and
geographies with 29% sales growth and 43% orders growth on an underlying basis. The cost reset
benefits continued to be realized as planned reading through to the margins. And along with the additional
volume and leverage, they drove adjusted segment EBIT growth of 40%, 280 basis points of increased
margin to 19.6%.

Cash flow continues to be very strong with operating and free cash flow up approximately 30% year-over-
year and free cash flow conversion exceeding 150% of net earnings. We're continuing to implement the
remaining elements of the cost reset program. In this quarter, we initiated $32 million of restructuring
actions. The program is on schedule and delivering the projected savings as we've planned.

Please turn to Slide 7. This is a bridge of the earnings per share increase from the prior year. The
operational performance was very strong. So the noteworthy thing on this chart is the green bar.
Operations added 33% to adjusted EPS, and it was balanced between the platforms. They both delivered
strong profit leverage on the strength of volume increases and cost reduction benefits, as Lal mentioned.
Leverage was 34% across the enterprise.

Tax, currency, pension, stock comp netted to a $0.05 headwind, and there was a minor favorable impact
from share repurchase. Again, in total, adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 36%.

Please go to the next chart, Chart #8. So as I mentioned, underlying sales is up 15%. Gross profit
increased 90 basis points to 42.4%, driven mainly by the benefits of the cost reduction actions and then
the leverage on the volume across the enterprise. We did offset the impact of price/cost headwinds, which
we are beginning to see intensify and which we will see in the next couple of quarters and we will talk
about a little later in the call.

Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%, up 310 basis points. Effective tax rate was 19.2% versus 11% in
the prior year. Last year, we had several favorable discrete items, mostly around R&D credits that we
described at the time. This was a $0.10 headwind year-over-year that we overcame. Adjusted EPS, as
mentioned, was $1.09 versus $0.80 last year.

If you go to Slide 9, please, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow. Adjusted segment EBIT again
increased 40%, margin up 280 basis points. The leverage on volume and cost reset benefits offset
material cost headwinds in the Climate Technologies business.

Adjusted pretax earnings increased 350 basis points to 17.6%. Operating cash flow was very strong, up
31% at $1.1 billion. Free cash flow was $977 million, also up a little over 30%, driven by strong earnings
growth and effective working capital management. Lastly, the trade working capital ratio improved to
15.4% of sales.

Turning to Slide 10, we'll look at Automation Solutions. Underlying sales turned positive this quarter
at 8%. Trailing 3-month orders accelerated to 17%. The improvement in the Americas is particularly
encouraging and notable with continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and medical

markets and a return to growth more broadly across the traditional process automation markets and
sustainability-related business.

We're seeing increasing KOB 3 activity across our process automation customer base mainly driven by
shutdown turnaround and outage activity and OpEx spend. MRO spend is returning to pre-pandemic
levels from pent-up demand and delayed STOs. CapEx spending is recovering at a slower rate with
tailwinds from site-based emissions and optimization projects. The platform continues to implement the
comprehensive restructuring actions that have been ongoing, and the benefits are flowing through to the
financial results.

Adjusted EBIT margin increased 320 basis points and 310 basis points at adjusted EBITDA, driven
mainly by the flow-through of the cost reset savings and by the volume leverage. The integration of OSI
continues to go very well. We're very pleased with the acquisition and the results to date, and we have
increasing confidence in the synergy plan that we have.

Backlog increased to $5.5 billion. It is up 17% year-to-date. We'll talk a bit about the project funnel and
other opportunities later in the call.

Turning to Slide 11, we'll review Commercial & Residential Solutions. Sales were up on an underlying
basis 29% versus the prior year. Orders continue to be strong and very broad-based in their strength.
The June trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 43%, and it was very balanced across both Climate
Technologies and Tools & Home products. All our businesses and geographies showed strong double-
digit growth. Residential markets continue to be strong and growth has accelerated in Cold Chain and
Professional Tools.

The Americas were up 29% with continued strength across all end markets. Europe was up 37%, driven
by continued heat pump demand and increasing sales of professional tools. Asia, Middle East and Africa
was up 25%, driven by Cold Chain and various heating technologies. Margins improved by 170 basis
points of adjusted EBIT and 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA driven by the strong volume leverage
and the cost reset savings, which more than offset the price/cost headwinds that we are seeing in the
business.

Please turn to Slide 12. I'm going to pass this over to Ram, and he's going to talk a bit about operations,
what we've done in the quarter to deliver the results and some of the challenges that we face.

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

Thanks, Frank. Clearly, as you can see, our operating environment remains very challenging as commodity
inflation, electronic supply and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Steel prices are
at record highs with 11 months of consecutive increases and in our estimation, have not peaked yet.

Plastic resin prices remain elevated as our global teams have maneuvered expeditiously defined
alternatives to maintain supply. And while copper pricing has receded off record highs, it is still up over
$1.40 a pound year-over-year. Our hedge positions lessened the impact to 2021, but the inflation impact
in terms of copper will carry over into most of 2022.

Electronics shortages are proliferating in most of our businesses, impacting both platforms, and supply
is expected to remain constrained well into 2022. Very little component inventory on microprocessors,
controllers, linear integrated circuits are available in the open market, and the number of shortages faced
by our EMS suppliers is growing, severely impacting lead times.

And finally, labor availability continues to be an issue across many industries in the U.S., and our
businesses are impacted as well. Our V-shaped demand recovery in many of our Commercial & Residential
Solutions businesses, local competition driven by tight labor markets in many cities and rolling labor
constraints as waves of COVID disruptions impact our sites has added a new level of complexity to our
operational plans.

EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

It is important to note that price/cost remains at an unfavorable $75 million as we estimated last quarter.
No change, but we expect the maximum impact of the commodity inflation to be felt in the next 2
quarters.

Now despite these challenges, turning to Slide 13, I'd like to highlight some of the outstanding work by
our global supply chain and operations teams to combat these challenges and help deliver phenomenal
operational results to date as they remain flexible, creative and nimble in a dynamic environment to serve
the needs of our customers.

Our supply chain teams have worked tirelessly in this environment to ensure continuity of material supply
to our global plants. As you can see on the chart, many creative solutions are being implemented on a
real-time basis quickly and effectively. Our regional footprint, both on the manufacturing side as well
as supply chain that we spent many years developing, has certainly been an advantage for us in these
challenging times.

Many of our global plants are producing at record levels while ramping up capacity to meet surge demand
and in many cases, in-sourcing critical elements of the supply chain to address sudden disruptions. I do
want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our global teams for delivering an outstanding operational
quarter.

With that, I'll turn it over to Lal to walk through our full year guidance and outlook.

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Ram. Let's turn now to Slide 15. We are improving our sales outlook for the year based on
the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance. We
now expect underlying sales growth to be near the top of our May guidance of approximately 5% to 6%,
Commercial Residential above their range in May at 15% to 16% and Automation Solutions closer to the
top of that range at 0% to 1%.

The strong volume and improved cost base will flow through to margins. Our estimates are now 50 basis
points above the previous guidance, increasing adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EBITDA by 0.5% to
approximately 18% and 23%, respectively. There's no change to the restructuring, tax rate, capital spend
or dividend.

Strong profitability and working capital performance enabled an increase in our operating cash flow and
free cash flow estimates, both of which increased by $300 million. We are also raising our adjusted EPS
guidance to $4.07, plus or minus $0.01.

Our price/cost headwind for 2021 currently remains as estimated in Q2 and Ram covered at $75 million
despite the current challenges that were highlighted. We continue to manage this through containment,
selective price actions, but the recent market developments that Ram described will be challenged through
the next 2 quarters as we navigate them. Stock compensation impact increases to $125 million.

So now we'll go over to Chart 16, and I'll just frame the order environment that we've experienced
through the last 3 months. Emerson's trailing 3-month orders continue to be very strong and have
momentum from the last update we gave you in the second quarter, with Commercial & Residential
Solutions continuing to climb higher in their order run rates and Automation Solutions turned sharply
positive to the high teens in June. Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to see strength in
Residential, Cold Chain and the Professional Tools business, and all 3 very near to that average band of
43%.

Discrete and hybrid end markets in Automation Solutions continue to be very strong, while we see
recovery in later cycle process automation markets, especially in North America. KOB 3 and KOB 2 are
driving most of the recovery, but we are beginning to see some KOB 1 activity materialize, particularly in
chemicals, power and biofuels.

EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

The Americas really strengthened, up 29% as deferred maintenance demand and site access drove
momentum. Finally, as we have commented in the past quarters, life sciences momentum continues to be
extremely strong.

Let's now turn to Chart 17, and I'll review the underlying sales growth outlook. Q3 underlying sales were
up 15% versus prior year, exceeding our management expectations, driven by the strength in Commercial
& Residential Solutions as well as the North America recovery just discussed. Full year expectations on
underlying sales are between 5% and 6%, at the top end of our prior guidance of 3% to 6% and sales of
approximately $18.4 billion.

The fourth quarter is expected to land in the high single digits to low double-digit range. For the remainder
of the year, we expect to see the North America business continue to recover in Automation Solutions as
well as continued broad strength in commercial residential solutions. However, the impact of supply chain
and labor issues will be a challenge.

Let's now turn to Slide 18, and I'll review our outlook by geography. As Frank mentioned, for the full year,
we are expecting Automation Solutions sales to be flat to 1% and Commercial & Residential Solutions to
be between 15% and 16%, driving us to our overall 5% to 6% underlying sales expectations.

So starting off in the Americas. Quarter 4 is expected to be strong in Automation Solutions at
approximately 20% growth, broad-based recovery across all industries, led by continued strength in
discrete and increasing strength in hybrid. Process is showing some recovery, although uneven with some
strength from returning domestic oil demand, offset by reduced midstream investment and continued
fiscal restraint in upstream. For KOB 3, we expect to see continued spend for deferred maintenance and
increasing spend for site access that has been pent-up from the pandemic with an expectation that we will
see a strong fall shutdown turnaround season.

In Latin America, strength in mining industries particularly are expected to continue. On the Commercial
& Residential side of the business, ongoing momentum in the residential markets, driven by do-it-yourself
trends, home starts and HVAC seasonality as well as strength in Professional Tools and Cold Chain are
expected to continue.

Europe will continue to see demand in life sciences and biofuels on the automation side. Project wins
in power, midstream, downstream and sustainability will drive low to mid-single-digit growth in Q4.
Commercial & Residential will see robust demand for heat pumps and professional tools as well as the
continuation of the refrigeration market recovery in Q4.

Turning to Asia, Middle East and Africa. Our Asia automation business is seeing healthy project activity in
marine, nuclear, life sciences and semiconductors and a positive trend for site-level spending in the Middle
East. On the Commercial & Residential side, we are seeing the commercial recovery across the region,
specifically with commercial AC and cold chain solutions. Ongoing COVID restrictions continue to be a
challenge across the organization, particularly in this part of the world.

Let's now turn to Chart 19, and we'll review the business funnel for Automation Solutions. So back in
February, we commented that our traditional large project funnel was $6.4 billion, and this should be
something that is very familiar to those of you who watch this carefully.

Since February, we have booked approximately $80 million of projects, some LNG and one most notably
in Mexico. New projects added include clean fuels, hydrogen, renewable diesels, lithium mining and LNG
projects, while projects removed from the funnel since February were mostly oil and gas and downstream
refining projects. The August 2021 funnel is now valued at $6.3 billion in approximately 180 projects. And
below in the donut pies, you can see the industry mix of our traditional funnel.

We have identified new decarbonization opportunities. And though generally smaller than our traditional
definition of projects for our funnel classifications, these projects are increasingly relevant to our business.
They're being added into this view because they have the potential to grow in nature over time. Today, as
depicted on the chart, these opportunities are worth $400 million in approximately 120 projects.

EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

The combination of our traditional project funnel and the new sustainability funnel is now valued at $6.7
billion. And below is the combined industry mix where we are working to diversify our funnel.

On the right side of the chart, we are introducing the business opportunities with our recent OSI
acquisition, which gave us an important foothold into the transmission and distribution automation space.
These opportunities have slightly different characteristics from our traditional project funnel definition, and
therefore, we are keeping it separate for our discussion purposes today.

Generally, these opportunities are smaller and more numerous compared to our large traditional project
funnel, but they are clearly strategically important. The value of these opportunities is $1.5 billion and
are made up of 530 projects. To give you some perspective on the scale and how differentiated it is,
approximately 15% of that $1.5 billion has a value of greater than $5 million, and 50% of it is between $1
million and $5 million.

The funnel is global, although approximately $1 billion of it is in North America and Europe. Overall, we
have strong opportunities ahead, and I'm bullish on overall project outlook as we diversify and expand into
new spaces.

Now let's turn to Chart 20. This is a very important chart. And as Frank mentioned in our financial
results showcase, our robust cost reset plan is being incredibly well executed across the enterprise. As a
reminder, this comprehensive plan began in late 2019 and will be fully realized by 2023. It involves over
$600 million in spend and approximately $650 million in savings.

In February, we also introduced our midrange targets of 24% adjusted EBITDA margins and $4.75 to $5
in adjusted EPS. We are very much on track to reach those targets by 2023. Importantly, however, the
recent outperformance and momentum through the end of 2021 is creating some headroom for critical
investments. And I'm particularly excited about this, particularly as I think about key technologies that will
enable our business to outperform over the long term.

As you can see, revenues, margins and cash flow are all better than February expectations and are
enabling this acceleration in technology investments. I've outlined 4 examples below and will come out
over the next months and in depth in February as to how we're managing and thinking about these very
significant investments.

Examples outlined are the Copeland K7 scroll, which is the largest new product investment in the history
of our air conditioning business. This thing drives obviously increased performance and meets the 2023
efficiency regulations and is optimized for 2025 refrigerants.

The Greenlee remote cutters, an award-winning tool on the right-hand side of the chart, which
enhances safety for cutting underground cables. The Gemini, which is our next-generation pressure
and temperature device being developed in our Measurement Solutions business, which will have next-
generation electronics, unmatched safety and process insight. And lastly, our Plantweb Optics, our
integrated operational performance platform, which unifies data, people and systems to drive operational
performance.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator, and we'll begin the Q&A. Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Look forward to working with you, Colleen. In terms of, I suppose, Lal, the Automation Solutions sort of
revenue outlook, so a lot of very good color in the slides. It looks like the guidance is embedding sort of
mid-single-digit type growth in the fourth quarter in Auto Sol organically. When we take your comments
together in terms of a sort of stable funnel since February and maybe an ongoing sort of subdued oil and
gas CapEx backdrop, should we take that as a good sort of medium term or into next 12 months sort of
placeholder, that mid-single-digit type Auto Sol growth rate?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Thank you. Thanks for the question. I think that's fair. Look, the recovery has been largely fueled by
modernizations and MRO spend across facilities. There has been, as I indicated, some KOB 1, but that's
not what's going to drive us going forward. So what I would expect is, I think, that conversion in -- of
those 2 segments of the business into -- from orders into sales would continue. And I think the guidance is
-- I think that's a fair assumption.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then maybe switching to the margin aspect. Maybe clarify how much of that $75 million price/cost
headwind sort of falls into the fourth quarter. And when we look at Com Res margins in that context, can
that business sustain a sort of 20-plus percent incremental margin the next 6 months? Or does it get sort
of pushed below that by the price/cost headwinds?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Great question as well, Julian. Clearly, that's where the challenge is going to be is on incrementals in
Commercial Residential for the next 6 months. The team is working both sides of the equation, Julian,
price and cost.

We're getting very creative in terms of the contract structures and the negotiations with our major
customers. But we also have opportunities to continue to work availability of materials, sourcing from
different world areas, moving a few things around. But that's where the biggest challenge is, and I would
suggest that your assertion is correct that the incrementals in that business are going to be the most
challenged as we go over the next 6 months.

The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

A couple of questions. I guess first on some of the kind of extra funnel additions, particularly on
decarbonization. Nice to see that tick up. I guess can we have some more context there, if you wouldn't
mind? I mean on one hand, your customers have -- some of your legacy customers are pretty big
emitters. Is there more a push on those folks to sort of diagnose, measure and improve? Or is more of the
funnel that you're tracking sort of on more green technologies, like you mentioned hydrogen? Like which

one of those is showing up more and which one do you think could be kind of the bigger needle mover
here in the medium term?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Yes, great question. I think there's a little bit of both in the funnel. I think if you look at the traditional
$6.3 billion funnel, there was already embedded in that a lot of the biofuel conversions, emissions
monitoring work that's being done downstream, particularly in refining and other parts.

What's in the green bar, what's in the new opportunities, I think, are significantly incremental investments.
And those are partially driven by things like green diesels, which is basically the manufacturing of diesel
but using a feedstock that is a sustainable feedstock, or the investments in hydrogen.

If you recall, back in February, we talked about a $1 billion opportunity for hydrogen that was framed
around 2030. However, as we now bring these projects into our -- and this is a very defined pursuit
process that we run within the business. We now bring those into that pursuit, and we are pursuing those
to 2023, and that's the view of the $400 million.

I expect that to increase over time and the number, not just the number, but the scale of those projects
to become more and more meaningful, which is why we're talking about it today. But you're absolutely
right. I think our core integrated oil customers, upstream through the midstream and downstream, they're
all spending dollars, incremental dollars on emissions, sustainability, reliability, productivity, all around
those automations to drive to their ESG commitments. And that can come in the frame of conversions or
of optimizing current processes.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And just on the price/cost side, I know some of what you guys have out there,
particularly in Com Res, has kind of pricing contracts that we set periodically, maybe annually. I would
imagine that, that puts you a bit more behind the curve this year.

Can you maybe talk about what's just slipping the calendar, flipping the fiscal year sort of sets up in terms
of price/cost? I know Ram talked about some of the hedges, postponing things like copper inflation. But I
think there's probably a little pent-up pricing opportunity as well. Could you maybe kind of match up how
those things work together?

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

Yes. So I'll take that. From a pricing perspective, as Lal mentioned, our Commercial & Residential teams
are working that diligently. Many of the pricing, particularly with the large OEMs, some will happen in
October, but many of it will happen in the Jan time frame. So you'll expect the pricing to kick in, in a big
way into our second quarter. And that's all well underway.

In terms of the steel and copper pricing, certainly, the copper hedges will flow through, through the year.
We've modeled that out. On the steel side, we do expect the next 3 to 6 months to be pretty tough. But
outside of that, going into the second quarter, we'll start seeing the better pricing on steel come through
as well. So I would say, from a pricing perspective, a lot of the pricing from our perspective is modeled in
the Jan time frame.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. So after that 6-month time frame, it is a bigger step-up. Understood.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just was wondering if you can talk about sort of internal bottlenecks and specifically, I'm thinking Com
Res. It seems resi HVACs is doing very well. You're talking about V-shaped recovery in tools. Do you need
to add capacity at Copeland and tools to deal with demand? And how are you thinking about it?

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

Yes. We are clearly in a position where we are adding capacity and will add more capacity as we go
through this plan. Certainly, at this point, we're fighting labor challenges in terms of short-term capacity in
many of our current U.S. locations, but we are adding capacity, both in the U.S. as well as Mexico for both
the Climate Technologies business as well as the tools business. So the answer is yes.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Excellent. But it's not a constraint, right? How much of a constraint is it to growth, I guess?

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

It is not a constraint at current levels, I mean, outside of the labor challenges we see. But as we model
out the long-term growth dynamics of the business and certainly, the regulation changes that are coming
down the pipe, it's important for our longer-term plans.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got you. And just a follow-up question. I think you disclosed systems and software now. Can you just
break down how much -- what is organic growth? And I mean, clearly, the balance would be M&A and also
specifically hone in on growth trends that you're seeing in OSI Power. The funnel is very impressive there.

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

So as we -- Frank and I mentioned in the comments, Andrew, we're very pleased with the performance
of OSI Power. We were actually up there for a growth planning session just earlier -- late July. So the
teams are performing incredibly well. Management, we've retained management, and they're executing
the plans.

And what we're seeing is actually higher-than-expected ability to leverage existing relationships that
PWS and Ovation have across the large power companies in North America. But more importantly, the
opportunity to greatly geographically expand this business at a far rate -- a far higher rate than we
expected at the time of the acquisition.

So validating the technology, validating the applicability and the customer relevance has been very
important for us. So we're excited.

There is an opportunity to build around this business, and there is a vision to continue to transform
this into more of a pure software play in terms of evolution from perpetual into subscription, in terms
of outsourcing services and focusing on software and looking around measures that are relevant for
software businesses such as annual recurring revenues and things of that sort. So we're working that very
aggressively within the business.

In terms of growth rates, I would suggest high single digits on the Systems & Solutions business. And I
would say, Jeff, that the data management layer grew slightly above that, but on average. But I don't have
that number in front of me, but that would be based on what I have seen and heard, my understanding,
Andrew.

The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Thanks for all the transparency on your thought process here about a strategic review and everything. But
it is interesting, I guess. You say that you've concluded it, and you will review it with the Board in October.

So I suppose that suggests any idea of any large-scale strategic change or something like that is not
on the Board or you wouldn't be sitting on that until October. And instead, we should think about you're
cultivating a investment pipeline and kind of an M&A pipeline and as you said, kind of looking at ways to
create new growth vectors and potentially diversify a bit. Is that the right read on what you said in your
opening remarks?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

It's an interesting read, Jeff. I'll tell you this. The M&A pipeline is ever green. We're working a number of
opportunities as we speak, which are related to and aligned with the strategic portfolio study that we've
done. So we're very excited about those. And we've been speaking to the Board about those opportunities
through the summer and will continue to do so through this month because some may come sooner rather
than later. That's okay.

Now in terms of the overall study, look, this management team believes that the path to the higher
multiple and to the total shareholder return performance is driving an increase in the underlying sales
growth of the company. And we need to fall into this bucket of 4% to 6%.

So as we look at our optionality around the makeup -- the current makeup of the portfolio and the
potential to invest in new areas, that's really what the study and the portfolio study is focused on. And
those are really where the engagements and debates with the Board will take place.

But we're walking and chewing gum at the same time. we haven't stopped pursuing opportunities as a
management team and as a Board simply because we haven't covered the details of the study with the
Board, but they're very much aware of it.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Understood. And then just thinking about the investments, right, it would seem like you're certainly on a
pretty good glide path that kind of hit or beat those 2023 targets. But it sounds like you are cautioning us
a little bit that -- the investment spending and the bias to make sure there's growth kind of beyond 2023
potentially tempers the upside of those targets. Is that kind of a correct perspective?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

No. Honestly, glide path is generous. There's a lot of hard work to hit those targets, Jeff, by everyone
engaged. And there are always obstacles in the way as we're experiencing -- we have experienced this
quarter with labor and materials, as Ram and Frank described. So it's a lot of hard work to get there, and
we're not taking our eye off the ball.

Having said that, not only do we need to work the portfolio opportunities that I just mentioned with
pluses and minuses, but we need to elevate the organic investments and the organic sales growth of the
company. And with that, we have to take -- we have to make those investments for the future.

So it's both. We have the capacity to do both. We have the opportunity to do both, like many businesses,
and we're taking full advantage of that.

The next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Lal, we're getting close to fiscal '22. So I know you're going through the TAM process. But given that
the funnel is building here and the activity levels in automation, I'm just curious, normally, early phases of
recovery, we see solid double-digit growth in automation. Is there anything that's changing in terms of the
profile of the front log or backlog or anything that suggests that, that's not going to be the case of time?
Can we expect double-digit type growth in '22 for automation?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Nigel, great to hear your voice. A very thoughtful question actually. And if you go back through the
last couple of growth cycles in automation, there was an important component, which we have to watch
very carefully in this up cycle, which is the KOB 1 element. We benefited from that in the '10 to '14 run.
We surely benefited from that in the prior run in '18. But in this one, it's been subdued to date, and that's
going to be the differentiating.

Now keep in mind, that we just underwent a significant investment in LNG that is being absorbed by
the market. We have yet one big large project to go. But it's that -- that would be the, I'd suggest, the
differentiator between the high single digits and the double-digit type of organic opportunity in Automation
Solutions, if that makes sense to you.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

It absolutely does. And then just coming on top of Jeff's question on portfolio, and the October Board
pitch, I guess, heard that loud and clear. But given the emphasis on diversification, is it fair to say that
you're focusing here more on acquisitions as opposed to disposals? I know you've done a couple of smaller
disposals, but in terms of material acquisitions or disposals...

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we announced the divestiture of the Daniel oil and gas business. And what I'm going to tell you is
it's both. We're looking at the portfolio, both in terms of opportunities to acquire and/or opportunities
to divest. And it's a very fluid conversation with an element of that with the Board yesterday. We got
their support. It's both. Because to solve whether it's the equation around diversification from oil and gas
and/or elevate the underlying sales growth of this company, we're going to have to press both of those
buttons.

The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Lal, can you talk about how you're thinking about the longevity of the Commercial & Residential Solutions
cycle at this point? Obviously, strength in res is seen relatively enduring. I think you were worried a
bit about residential comparisons toward the end of this year. So how are you thinking about enduring
residential strength as you go into '22 as well as the improvements you continue to see in commercial
construction, cold chain and tools?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Great. So I will bifurcate that into the 3 -- the 2 pieces, the climate piece and the tools, Professional
Tools piece. Obviously, the Professional Tools has a different cycle, partly some of it driven by the similar

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

set of investments that we're experiencing in climate, be it the residential growth, the do-it-yourself
investments, which impacts our home products side of the tools.

But the Professional Tools area, the Ridges and the Greenlees, they're really driven by infrastructure
spend, capital cycles, not dissimilar to what we see in our mid-cycle automation businesses. And so those,
I think, have sustained opportunity as we go well into 2022.

The one we're watching very carefully, as I look at climate, is the air conditioning residential cycle. And
we're watching those orders. We're staying very close with our OEM customers, the Tranes and Carriers of
the world in terms of communicating, understanding their demand.

But for now, I would expect a more subdued quarter as we go from an order perspective as we go into the
fall season. But we're watching it very carefully. But that would make sense in the cycle that it subdues
and comes. I know we've seen -- you've seen in our trailing already that Commercial Residential has
turned, and that's partly driven -- entirely driven by that residential AC business.

Ram, do you have any more color to give?

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

No, I would -- I think that's spot on.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then, Lal, you talked about being well into your cost-out program, which has been focused on
Automation Solutions, as you know. And incremental margins continue to be strong there. I know we
already talked about margin pressure in C&RS. But as we look at Automation Solutions margin going
forward, given your cost-out program, should it continue to drive margin tailwind, could you continue to
generate average or better-than-average incremental margin for that business in '22 and beyond?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

I think so, Andy. We printed 41% incrementals in that platform this quarter, and the team has begun their
significant investments around their technology and people there. The business is structurally different
than the business that I took on in 2018 today in the way it goes about and the way it manages and the
way it approaches customers. So there's a lot of room there.

The target I've given the business is obviously is 30% incrementals. But as we ramp up investments and
such, we may -- I think we're likely to see higher than those types of numbers as we go forward.

Pete Lilly
Director of Investor Relations

I think our next question is from Scott Davis. Scott, are you there?

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

I'm here, yes. I don't know if we messed up or whatever. But a couple of clarification issues. Just, Lal,
when you think about kind of price/cost in your backlog, do you get to a parity number kind of like
calendar 4Q? I'm just trying to think about how cadence is in or if you still are kind of fighting that
headwind well into the next fiscal year?

EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Yes, it does bleed into the next fiscal. Ram described the next 2 quarters as being the most challenging,
which is right. So that parity really arrives in our first fiscal -- excuse me, our first calendar of '22. So our
second fiscal of '22.

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

Yes.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay. Sorry if you said it before, I just didn't hear it. And then again, to clarify on the cost reduction
actions and you just had a big Board review, is that largely complete? Or are there -- and can you --
I guess, do you need to start going in the other direction, I suppose, which I think Andrew asked that
question about adding CapEx and such? But do you need to actually start spending more money just given
the size of the backlog overall?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

No. I think Ram answered that well. I think we're looking at optionality around capacity increases in
the existing footprint and in the footprint that we have initiated as part of the cost reset plan. We have
operations in construction of significant size in India, in Mexico and in Eastern Europe and all those are
underway. Some will begin production later this year, others in early 2022.

So we feel really good. The challenge for us, Scott, which is not -- it's thematical honestly and not
dissimilar from anyone out there is the labor availability in the United States. And to me, that's the biggest
single constraint and what we're fighting on a daily basis across most of our facilities.

I don't have a number to share with you, Deane, but I would tell you, I think that -- excuse me, somebody
came on the line here. That is a fair assumption.

We continue to see increased momentum in Automation Solutions. Obviously, we're watching parts of

America and China, we continue to see good order momentum driven by KOB 2 and KOB 3.

Got it. And then second question has been really good color on the call here, especially in the portion
from Ram on the focus on the cost inputs, labor, commodities, et cetera, but not as much focus on price
realization. Can you give us, for the 2 segments, more color on pricing? And I know one of the headwinds
on Commercial & Residential solutions like Copeland is locked into longer-term contracts. So just price
realization color would be helpful here.

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

Yes. So first off, I'll answer the question with -- as it relates to automation, automation has been green on
price/cost and has been very, very disciplined in getting price this year, and that dynamic will continue into
next year. So we see no issues as it relates to price or price/cost on the automation side of the business.

And on the Commercial & Residential side, particularly in the climate business, the price realization, which
is a function of our long-term OEM contracts will start unlocking in the January time frame of significance.
Now we do have pricing that will go into effect in October. But the big impact, we will start to see in the
second quarter of fiscal '22, which in turn, assuming the commodities start softening, will turn them
into the green category into the second quarter of next year. So that's how we see it. A lot rides on our
contracts, which open up in the Jan time frame.

Frank J. Dellaquila
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. I mean price/cost in the quarter, total enterprise -- Steve, this is Frank -- is roughly about negative
$50 million. So we were positive in the first half. We'll see that intensifying in the fourth and the first
quarter, as both Ram and Lal have said, and we're going to have to work through that right through the
second quarter of next fiscal year, but it was order of magnitude around $50 million in the third.

Of negative? Of negative?

Frank J. Dellaquila
Senior EVP & CFO

Negative. Negative. More than -- all of which was Commercial Residential.

Charles Stephen Tusa

Frank J. Dellaquila

Yes, we are. It's still [indiscernible] in that platform.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just kind of -- just trying to make that clear. Lal, just on the go-forward incremental margins, I mean,
you kind of throw out, we need to invest. I mean, every company needs to invest. Nobody underinvests. I
mean some companies do, but it doesn't seem like that way for you guys over time.

What is kind of the normal incremental margin on that mid-single-digit growth rate that you can expect
out of this business model over the next -- that you would expect and you would be comfortable with over
the intermediate term?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Steve, I continue to [ search ] the 30% number as we go through the long term. You'll see that flex
up and down, but that's the target. And as we executed the cost reset plan, that's the -- how we frame
that with the businesses.

There will be quarters, as we saw with automation, where we'll print higher than 40%. And there will be
quarters as we saw with Commercial Residential that we'll print forward than 30%. So it will flex, but 30%
is the way I'm thinking about it.

there's -- historically, like every few years, there's like -- I don't know if that's where the reset is or if
it's somewhere else, maybe in corporate, is $235 million kind of a run rate number for stock comp going

Frank J. Dellaquila
Senior EVP & CFO

No, Steve, definitely not. As you know, it's mark-to-market driven. It's driven almost entirely as a function
of the change in the stock price. We had the dip in the stock price last year related to COVID. We've had
good stock price performance this year and a big delta year-over-year. But no, that is not a run rate that
should be expected, the $250 million range. It's more like a $150 million to $170 million number, give or
take, from a run rate standpoint over time.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. So tailwind. And then sorry, one last one. The orders conversion, I know there was an earlier
question about mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. I mean you're coming off of a 17% orders
comp, and I know that orders don't completely equal revenue in the immediate term. But I mean with that
kind of order projection and with you guys talking about turnarounds being good in the fall, I mean why
would organic growth slow in Automation Solutions?

It's a tougher comp, but it's only a couple of hundred basis points where the orders are just obviously
inflected. So I mean why would that go from 8% to like 5% at the midpoint of that guidance? Is there
something about timing? Or is that just conservatism around the COVID or whatever?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Well, less so COVID, more so the availability of materials, particularly electronics, Steve, that are a
challenge in that business. And I think as we guided Automation Solutions within that band, I think it's --
there's momentum on the order side.

The question is, can we convert in the plants? And it is a hand-to-hand combat. I can't emphasize that
enough in terms of material arriving and our ability to have the labor to convert it. And it's -- and that is
what keeps me a little bit more guarded in terms of the order-to-sale conversion in the fourth quarter.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. And that's kind of like a couple of hundred million dollars difference, you think, in kind of your
ability to fulfill?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai

Yes. Well, I don't know. I really don't know what it is. It's probably around the $75 million to $100 million

EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the funnel -- I think the funnel has shown resiliency as we've gone through the last 6 months or
so staying at that 6% level. The makeup of it obviously is different smaller projects, different types of
projects that we've seen in our -- from our customer base.

Having said that, it's all about the movement from right to left, the ability to convert the projects to be
funded and then to be actioned. And that's what we've got to watch and could be a differentiating element
as we head into 2022 for Automation Solutions.

I have a high degree of confidence, Gautam, that the transmission distribution funnel moves forward
aggressively, that the renewables are sustainable, decarbonization part of the funnel moves forward
successfully, that the conversions, the biofuels, the green fuel investments, the propylene plastic
renewables that Colleen described move forward aggressively.

What I've got to watch very carefully is the larger, particularly LNG jobs, that one big remaining one, the
Qatar North Field expansion, how does that move and how do those folks think about the funding of that
and as it moves forward but that will be differentiating into 2022.

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

And Gautam, if you were asking about the KOB 3 mix in addition to the funnel, it's in the high 50s. And we
expect to operate at that range for the next several quarters, probably into the low 60s into 2022.

year, do you think the business grows organically just given kind of the outsized strength that we've seen
in this fiscal?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

I believe so, Gautam. And what we are going to and you've seen in the numbers today is that the backlog
situation across the business is at $1.1 billion. And that's what -- that's the impetus to drive the organic
growth despite what happens in the residential AC cycle. And that will support the organic growth in the
business for '22.

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

The longevity of our commercial businesses as well.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Last question, just your comments on M&A and portfolio. Any change to how much we should
earmark for M&A in our models over the next couple of years in terms of the dollars spent?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we'll come out with guidance as we think about things. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, Gautam, we
are -- our funnel is very fluid right now. There's a number of activities underway. And so -- but we'll give
you some kind of guidance as we go into -- as we come out in November.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Said differently, are there any large properties bigger than OSI that you guys are looking at?

EMERSON ELECTRIC CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I will -- yes, there's a range. I would suggest that we're looking more in the larger than we are in the
bolt-ons right now, Gautam.

Our final questioner today is John Walsh with Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

A lot of ground covered, but maybe thinking about OSI Power and your customers there. I mean we
picked up that there's some activity in Spain and a couple of states in the U.S. Are you seeing the
customers waiting for more clarity around stimulus before they're going ahead with projects? Or is there
just enough demand there given where renewables sit in the grid that they're moving forward these
projects and there's no kind of delay caused by who's going to pay for it?

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

No, I think it's the latter, absolutely. Aging infrastructure, advent of renewables on to the grid are causing
all kinds of challenges. There are just strong underlying drivers that I think overwhelm the need for
stimulus spend there.

So Infrastructure Bill, particularly in the United States, will help, no doubt about it, and we'll benefit. But
there's incredibly strong underlying demand as is in the traditional utilities, particularly in Western Europe
and North America.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just circling back to an earlier question around kind of supply chain and backlog.
Did you grow backlog? Your sequential backlog growth, was that kind of demand driven? Or do you think
there was some supply chain stuff that you wouldn't have been able to ship and that's why you were able
to grow backlog? Just trying to understand if there's some delayed sales or deferred sales there because
of supply chain.

Ram R. Krishnan
Former President of Refrigeration Division

I think the answer is both. Certainly, on many parts of the Automation Solutions business and some in
Com Res, the demand side was very strong. And on both platforms, we were not able to fully execute
elements of the backlog given the constraints in labor primarily on the commercial side and electronic
supply on the automation side. So the backlog growth was driven by both fronts, supply and demand.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lal
Karsanbhai for any closing remarks.

Surendralal Lanca Karsanbhai
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you very much. Thank you, everyone, for your time and confidence in us. So we're excited
about the quarter ahead, and I look forward to seeing many of you as we go through the next 3 months.
And until our next call, stay healthy and safe and stay well. Thank you.

Operator
The conference has now concluded. You may -- thank you for attending today's presentation. You may
now disconnect.
