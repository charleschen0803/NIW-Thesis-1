KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. Welcome to Kimco Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Senior VP, Investor Relations and Strategy.
Go ahead.

David F. Bujnicki
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategy

Good morning, and thank you for joining Kimco's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. The Kimco
management team participating on the call today include Conor Flynn, Kimco's CEO; Ross Cooper,
President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, our CFO; David Jamieson, Kimco's Chief Operating
Officer; as well as other members of our executive team that are also available to answer questions during
the call.

As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking. It is
important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such
forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the
company's SEC filings that address such factors.

During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that
we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP
measures can be found in the Investor Relations area of our website. Also, in the event our call was to
incur technical difficulties, we'll try to resolve as quickly as possible and if the need arises, we'll post
additional information to our IR website.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Thanks, Dave. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I will begin by giving a quick overview of
our accomplishments in 2020 and our strategic focus for 2021 and beyond, Ross will follow with updates
on transactions, and Glenn will close with our key metrics and guidance for 2021.

For all of us, 2020 was a year that will not soon be forgotten. COVID, the political landscape, social
unrests and the responses to these events all converged in a way that will forever change our way of life.
2020 was also a year that demonstrated in volatile times, the best companies are the ones that are able to
withstand economic challenges, mitigate risk and take advantage of opportunities. In the shopping center
sector, this requires a strong balance sheet, a resilient, well-located portfolio and a superior management
team. I am happy to report that while we are not immune to the volatility of 2020, Kimco's open-air,
grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets performed well, and we have stayed strong,
confident and positive about the opportunity in the coming year.

Our portfolio withstood all that the pandemic threw at us as our 2020 vision strategy to reposition our
portfolio was validated. Our grocery-anchored essential services and mixed-use assets concentrated in
the strongest markets in the U.S. proved resilient. In 2020, we saw continued improvement in both the
percentage of ABR coming from essential retailers and grocery-anchored centers. Growing the portfolio
from 77% of ABR from grocery-anchored properties to 85% plus remains a strategic focus across the
organization. We are encouraged by the progress and the increasing level of opportunities in the pipeline
we are currently evaluating. As part of these efforts, we are pleased to share today the upcoming opening
of Amazon Fresh at our marketplace at Factoria in Bellevue, Washington.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

During the fourth quarter, we executed 92 new leases, totaling 406,000 square feet, which exceeded
the amount achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019. The true test of a portfolio's quality and durability is
leasing and the ability to drive rent. To that point, new leasing spreads remained positive, rising 6.8%
during the fourth quarter. We anticipate that our range between economic and physical occupancy will
continue to widen as a precursor to future cash flow growth. With the help of our nationwide network
of relationships, tenants, brokers and our in-house team, we are experiencing robust demand from our
essential retailers who continue to take advantage of the COVID surge that allows them to boost cash
reserves, invest in the existing stores and expand their store portfolio to better serve their customers. We
are also laser-focused on keeping our existing tenants and continue to do everything we can to help them
overcome the pandemic and to be positioned to profit.

Our tenant assistance program, or TAP, helps small businesses navigate the new round of PPP funding.
After successfully helping our small shop tenants navigate the first round of PPP funding, we believe we
have aligned with best-in-class partners to continue to aid our small business tenants accessing capital at
their most critical time of need. Our strong balance sheet, well-positioned portfolio and tenant initiatives
are all the result of our best-in-class team and approach. Specifically, our leasing team was proactive in
its efforts to work with current and prospective tenants and our Finance, Planning, Technology, Investor
Relations and legal teams effectively navigated numerous obstacles and kept us focused without skipping
a beat.

So where do we go from here? First, our highest priority is leasing, leasing, leasing. The good news is
we have visible growth in the portfolio and meaningful free cash flow to fund our leasing strategy. This
has provided us the confidence to provide an outlook for 2021. We anticipate the first half of the year
to remain challenging, especially for those categories dramatically impacted by the pandemic-induced
shutdowns. It is worth highlighting that our team pushed this portfolio to all-time high occupancies
pre-pandemic, and we are determined to get back to that level and exceed it. While anticipating the
speed at which we will recover NOI is challenging, we do expect rents to hold up, especially in our well-
located boxes that are in high demand from categories that include grocery, off-price, home goods, home
improvement, furniture, health, wellness, medical and beauty. Interesting to note, we are starting to
experience a rebound in both restaurant demand and value fitness retailers.

Finally, on our long-term strategic focus, we continue to believe that streamlining the portfolio over the
past 5 years will result in meaningful long-term value creation for our shareholders. We are focused on
the highest and best use of our real estate and believe the 80/20 rule applies to our assets and gives us
tremendous flexibility and adaptability to create value in the future through our entitlement initiative.
Specifically, 80% of our real estate consists of parking lots that are not generating any revenue and 20%
is single-story building. With our focus on clustering our assets in dense areas with significant barriers
to entry, our assets are in ideal position for growth as the surrounding areas have gone vertical. Our
entitlement team is sharing our ESG accomplishments with all local municipalities as part of our efforts to
show that we will be good stewards of their neighborhoods and that we want to work together to make
sure our assets continue to evolve alongside the community. We believe it is important that our approach
to real estate evolve with changing circumstances because that is exactly what our tenants are doing.

The best-in-class tenants are looking at their real estate differently. And in many cases, their real estate
team is now integrated in the entire supply chain, distribution, fulfillment, e-commerce and store decisions
are all integrated on how to best service the customer. The store, which is optimized for distribution
and fulfillment, continues to shine as the most economic way to get goods and services into customers'
hands. Best Buy CEO, Corie Barry at the CES conference was very clear when she said, physical stores are
expected to play a massive role in the company's fulfillment effort. Target also stated that more than 95%
of sales are fulfilled by its stores. I continue to share the words from our largest tenants. The role of the
physical store is poised to become broader than ever with the locations serving as fulfillment epicenters
that quickly and easily get customers whatever they need. Put another way, the convergence of retail and
industrials accelerate, and we are positioning the Kimco portfolio to take advantage of this new utilization
by partnering with our retailers to ensure that Kimco assets are all optimized to gain market share and to
make the stores of Kimco even more valuable.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

In closing, Kimco's open-air, grocery-anchored portfolio provides consumers a safe and easily accessible
destination for goods and services. Our diverse tenant mix and targeted geographic presence in the
strongest growth markets, supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and our entrepreneurial
approach, positions us to unlock value for all stakeholders in the years to come.

With that, I turn the call over to Ross.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Thank you, Conor, and good morning. As Conor discussed, 2020 was a challenging year, but there are
signs of life in the transactions market with deal flow starting to pick back up. The overall transaction
volumes from March through year-end were down close to 85%, but there were several late 2020 deals
that showcase the general theme we have seen occurring. The majority of transactions have been with
essential-based retail anchors, notably grocery. For the most part, size is good, but too big can result
in the inability to finance the large or nonessential-based tenancy, thus requiring a much bigger equity
check for those deals. For the smaller grocery assets, the financing community has remained resilient. But
again, rent rolling cash flow uncertainty for the chunkier assets have made those a bit more challenging.
Multiple grocery-anchored deals have transacted at sub 6% cap rates in Denver, South Florida, California,
Washington, D.C., North Carolina and throughout the major primary and secondary markets in the U.S.
While we are bullish on that asset type, which represents the core product within our portfolio, there is no
shortage of capital chasing those deals.

As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, the limited supply of attractively priced, high-quality
assets versus our current cost of capital has led us to tailor our investment program. As it relates to our
structured investments program, we made 2 small investments on a pair of very high quality shopping
centers during the quarter. A $25 million mezzanine financing on a strong South Florida shopping center
and a $10 million preferred equity investment on a densely located center in Queens, New York, both of
which will generate an accretive return versus our cost of capital with a chance to possibly acquire in the
future.

Additionally, as we have done many times, recently, we were able to leverage our strong tenant
relationships, particularly with those that are real estate rich, to uncover another unique investment
that represents significant dislocation in value. To that point, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction
in which we acquired 2 Rite Aid distribution centers in California for approximately $85 million. These
distribution centers service all 540-plus stores for the pharmacy chain in the state of California. Rite Aid
is re-leasing these back on a long-term basis with annual rent bumps and 0 landlord obligation. This
investment will provide an attractive return with an IRR well excess in of our cost of capital and enhanced
NAV for the company.

We continue to evaluate new opportunities selectively and believe our tenant relationships, flexible
structuring and conviction in our product type puts us in an enviable position to capture upside in a period
of dislocation. This is an important long-term complement to our business with the one constant being our
approach of owning high-quality assets at a positive spread to our current cost of capital while mitigating
potential downside risk. Furthermore, we believe this approach will create a future pipeline of opportunistic
acquisitions with the right of first refusal or right of first offer when our cost of capital returns.

With that, I will pass it along to Glenn for the financial summary.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Ross, and good morning. With our fourth quarter operating results, we delivered further
improvement compared to the sequential third quarter with higher rent collections and improvement
in credit loss. For the fourth quarter 2020, NAREIT FFO was $133 million or $0.31 per diluted share as
compared to $151.9 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2019. The reduction was
mainly due to rent abatements and increased credit loss of $21.2 million and lower net recovery income

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

of $5.7 million. This reduction was offset by lower preferred dividends of $3.1 million and a $7.2 million
charge for the redemption of preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Now although not included in NAREIT FFO, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we did record a $150.1
million unrealized gain on the mark-to-market of our marketable securities, which was primarily driven
by the change in value of our $39.8 million shares of Albertsons stock. Our stake in Albertsons is valued
in excess of $650 million today. For the full year 2020, NAREIT FFO was $503.7 million or $1.17 per
diluted share as compared to $608.4 million or $1.44 per diluted share for the prior year. The change was
primarily due to increases in rent abatements, credit loss and straight-line reserves aggregating $105.8
million, and the NOI impact of disposition activity during 2019 and 2020 totaling $24.7 million.

In addition, during 2020, we incurred a $7.5 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt. These
reductions were offset by lower financing costs of $15.7 million and an $18.5 million charge for the
redemption of $575 million of preferred stock during 2019. Although we continue to be impacted by the
effects of the pandemic, our operating portfolio has shown signs of improvement, as Conor discussed
earlier. All our shopping centers remain open and over 97% of our tenants are open and operating.
Collections have continued to improve. We collected 92% of fourth quarter base rents and this compares
to third quarter collections of 90%. Deferrals granted during the fourth quarter were just under 2%, down
from 5% during the third quarter. At year-end 2020, 8.2% of our annual base rents were from tenants
on a cash basis of accounting and 50% of that has been collected. As of year-end, our total uncollectible
reserve was $80.1 million or 46% of our total pro rata share of outstanding accounts receivable.

Now turning to the balance sheet. We finished the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA
of 7.1x, and on a look-through basis, including pro rata share of JV debt and preferred stock outstanding,
to level of 7.9x. This represents further progress from the 7.6x and 8.5x levels reported last quarter, with
the improvement attributable to lower credit loss. On a pro forma basis, if our Albertsons investment was
converted to cash, these metrics would improve by a full turn to 6.1x and 7x, respectively, levels better
than we began last year.

We ended 2020 with a strong liquidity position comprised of over $290 million in cash and $2 billion
available on our untapped revolving credit facility. We have only $140 million of consolidated mortgage
debt maturing during 2021, and our next bond does not mature until November 2022. Our consolidated
weighted average debt maturity profile stood at 10.9 years, one of the longest in the REIT industry. In
addition, our unsecured bond credit spreads have improved significantly. By way of example, our 10-year
green bond issued in July 2020 at 210 basis points over the 10-year treasury is currently trading in the
area of 90 basis points over treasury. This spread is the lowest among all our peers.

Regarding our common dividend, we paid a fourth quarter 2020 common dividend of $0.15 per share. As
such, we expect our Board of Directors to declare the common dividend during the first quarter of 2021,
reflecting a more normalized level that at least equals our expected 2021 taxable income.

Now for guidance. While the pandemic and its effects on certain of our tenants continues, we are
comfortable establishing NAREIT FFO per share guidance for 2021. Our initial NAREIT FFO per share
guidance range is $1.18 to $1.24. This is also a wider range than we have historically provided, taking
into account the potential variability of credit loss levels due to the ongoing pandemic. Other assumptions
include flat to modestly higher corporate financing costs and G&A expenses as well as minimal net
neutral acquisition and disposition activity. This 2021 guidance range assumes no transactional income or
expense, no monetization of our Albertsons investment and no additional common equity issued.

Lastly, keep in mind that our 2021 first quarter results will be relative to a pre-COVID first quarter in
2020. Notwithstanding the expected optics of the first quarter results, our NAREIT FFO per share guidance
range of $1.18 to $1.24 reflects growth over 2020 at both the low and high end of the range.
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

David F. Bujnicki
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategy

[Operator Instructions] With that, you could take the first caller.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Conor, I just wanted to talk through the guide a little bit. My perception is that you guys have a history
of being conservative, and when I look at the guide, the high end of the range looks like it's just an
annualization of 4Q, the low end of the range looks fairly low. Can you just maybe walk through that and
how we're supposed to think about it? And again, I recognize, given the uncertainty in the world, why
you'd want to be conservative. So I'm not calling you out for it. I'm just trying to understand a little bit
better and where the risk might be to the upside or the downside.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure, Rich. Nice to hear from you. Look, we've never given guidance in a pandemic before. We think it
was important to give guidance really to showcase that we have a good handle on the portfolio and the
cash flows. Clearly, there's a lot of unknowns that still can exist in the coming year. We're not out of the
woods yet out of the pandemic. If you think about the variants that are out there, the virus, if you think
about the distribution of the vaccine, there's a lot of things that could really dramatically impact some of
the returns that we're anticipating. And we thought that it's important to showcase growth and showcase
that we believe that we are -- we have a defensive nature of portfolio that is now sort of up and running
even in the midst of the pandemic. But clearly, there's a lot of unknowns that could impact the earnings
potential for 2021.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

It's Glenn. Let me just add a couple of things that may help you also. The credit loss levels, obviously,
are pretty wide ranging, and that's a big part of what's in those guidance numbers. So we had, as I
mentioned, $106 million of credit loss between abatements and reserves and straight-line reserves. So we
are still -- we've baked into this guidance still another $80 million to $100 million for this year. So that's
a component of what's in there. The other thing that I want to bring out also is we do have less interest
capitalization because of the projects that have come online. And that interest capitalization will be $8
million to $10 million less for this year. And similarly, we're capping less construction payroll of another $4
million to $6 million. So take those into account with capitalization differences when you're looking at the
guidance as well.

Operator

Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe just in terms of the deferrals that you did grant in 2020 to the tenants that needed them, could you
go through the expected timing for receipt of those? And to the extent that any have been paid or should
have been paid by now, how that outlook for receiving the deferrals on time is going?

Glenn Gary Cohen

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So the deferrals that we've done, most of the deferrals will get -- are expected to get collected over
the next 18-month period. So a good portion during 2021 and some into 2022. Of the deferrals that we
have build in the fourth quarter, mostly in the fourth quarter, over 90% of the ones that we have built
have actually been collected. So far, it's going pretty well.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then in terms of the sectors that look like they're weighing down the rent collection or services,
which isn't surprising. But there are also collection rates under 100% for other categories, including
essential ones. So I was just wondering if you could go through, does it seem like rent collections are
plateauing? Or what's your outlook for when the essential tenants and those nonessential ones but not
directly impacted by capacity constraints could improve to 100%?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Well, Caitlin, we've never really had 100%. I think that's a starting point, right? For the most part, on a
historic basis, normally, we would collect around 95% during a given month. And then over the following
months, we would collect the other 3% to 4%, and then you have your credit loss that comes into play.
When you look at the collections, again, collections were 92% for the quarter. So definitely starting -- we
are seeing improvement. 91% collected so far for January. We don't think that we've hit the peak yet. We
still have more to do. And again, we're still being impacted on the closures that have occurred certainly
out on the West Coast hitting restaurants and a lot of the nonessentials. But collections are continuing to
improve.

Operator

Our next question is from Samir Khanal from Evercore.

Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Conor, I'm just trying to get a better feel for -- about the recovery, how the recovery plays out over the
next several quarters and sort of the pace of that recovery. If we're assuming occupancy trough, let's
say, in the second quarter or the third quarter, how quickly do you think you can get back to sort of pre-
pandemic levels, right, let's say, an occupancy of mid 90s given the amount of leasing and the robust
demand you've been talking about?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. It's a good question. I think a lot of it has to do with -- I think the demand is going to be there, first
and foremost. We're seeing it now come back on the small shop side because originally, the box demand
or the anchor demand never really subsided. So clearly, it was heavily weighted towards essential retailers
through the past few quarters, and now you're starting to see some of the nonessentials come back for
any type of well-located anchor box that's available. So I would anticipate that to come back first. But now
what's interesting is the small shops are starting to come back, and we're seeing a pretty wide spread of
demand sources. I'll have Dave Jamieson comment on some of the small shop demand that he's seeing.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. No, I appreciate it. I mean right now, we're seeing it on -- the restaurant and the service side
is actually coming back in a surprising way and in a positive way. And I think what you're seeing is
operators, entrepreneurs, restauranteurs, seeing the vacancy within high-quality portfolios in the near
term as a way in which to either expand their existing operation or get into markets that they otherwise
were challenged to do so. And so we'll start to see that pick up. And when you look at the velocity in Q4

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

2020, I thought that was a really encouraging sign from a lease-up standpoint and what we're currently
seeing as we move through Q1 is that the momentum is continuing to build. So I think the one good thing
is that the vaccine has provided some endpoint, the idea that at some point and hopefully, the not-too-
distant future, we'll see this pandemic somewhat behind us. So people are starting to prepare. Investors
are starting to prepare for what that will look like and how do they set up their business accordingly. And
again, on the nonessential side, we say nonessential, but when you think of the performance, especially
with the investment-grade retailers and how well they've done from a public standpoint through this
pandemic from a stock share price, they're really on sound footing and see this opportunity to expand
their market share and, again, enter into higher-quality portfolios, knowing that, that window will only be
open for a limited time. So we're cautiously optimistic about the future here.

Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And then I guess as a follow-up, I mean, has your view changed on NOI growth? Let's say, not for '21, not
so much focused on '21, but let's say, sort of this peak to trough end of '19 to '21/'22, I mean has your
view -- do you feel like you can do better than down 10%? I mean, how are your views today? How do
they compare to, let's say, end of 2Q last year and even into 3Q last of year?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Well, clearly, the demand side has changed since we talked about it in Q2, Q3 of last year. And I think that
there's still a number of variables there on the NOI because I think the biggest variable is on the most
impacted categories and how they're going to weather through these next few quarters, entertainment,
restaurants, fitness services. Those are really where there's a pretty wide spread of scenarios that
could play out. We feel good about pent-up demand. We do feel like there's going to be a lot of revenge
shopping and revenge spending. I can't tell you how many conversations I've had about what restaurants
people are going to go to or what fitness club they're going to go back to or what trips they're going to
take. So I think if we think that the vaccine plays out and there's not a variant of the virus that doesn't
have another sort of wave of infections, we clearly have some visibility now that there's some green
shoots on the horizon that we're cautiously optimistic about.

Operator

Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Question on redevelopment. Pipeline here about $220 million at year-end, including the new Pentagon
center, that's up pretty meaningfully from last quarter. I guess are we back in the redevelopment game
here? How do you foresee the near-term prospects for the pipeline? What type of yield? How large? And
will that be funded with disposition proceeds or perhaps some of the Albertsons stock now that the window
is open for some of that?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure. I can start, and Dave can give some more color on it. Look, we have seen in our supplemental that
we've added the entitlements that we've achieved over the past 5 years. And we believe there's a lot of
value to be created on our asset base just on the entitlement initiative. And then what we look through
is the decision tree of how to activate those entitlements. And what we've done over the past 5 years is
we've sold some entitlements, we've ground leased some entitlements, and we've joint ventured some
entitlements to unlock that value. And depending on our cost of capital, depending on the supply and
demand in that trade area, we really look at the spread to our ROI, what the exit cap would be and trying
to have a 200 basis point spread there between what we believe we can deliver the project at and what
we could sell the project at. And so Pentagon, obviously, is the one where we feel like there's a pretty

unique set of circumstances there. If you haven't seen the Amazon rendering of the Helix and what they're
doing right across the street from our Pentagon Center, it's going to be pretty dramatic.

And with the success of the Whittler and some of the cap rates that have traded in that trade area, we feel
very comfortable with adding that to the pipeline. In a joint venture, it's with CPP, we have a very solid
multifamily experts that helped us with the first tower that's also helping on the second tower. And we
feel like that's the right project to add to the pipeline. But going forward, we're going to be very selective.
We do like the initiative of ground leasing a lot of our entitlements. We feel like that's the way to not
have a significant amount of capital tied up into these larger-scale projects. But we love the smaller-scale
projects that are double-digit-type returns, where you're adding an out parcel or a pad with a drive-thru or
expanding an existing tenant. Those are ones that typically run in the range of $75 million to $100 million
a year and have that double-digit-type return. So you'll see that being consistent. But we will be mindful
of how much we add to the pipeline going forward and be very selective on that.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And then any comment on -- that you make on Albertsons, the window, I understand open door this
year for a portion of the -- potentially how you sell from those shares. So curious, have you -- can you
comment? And would that be to fund some redevelopment, debt paydown, some of the mezz investments
you're looking at? Curious what the potential use would be at.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Haendel, it's Glenn. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the guidance that we have has no Albertsons
monetizations in 2021 in it. Again, we will monitor the investment, obviously, very closely. And it's really
geared towards debt reduction more than anything else. That's what we've kind of earmarked those
proceeds over time for. Again, cash is fungible. But again, we think of it more in terms of an ability for
further debt reduction as we go forward.

Our next question is from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So omnichannel and BOPIS trends have been very encouraging, and you actually pointed them out pretty
well in the investor presentation. What's the driver besides COVID? Is it that fulfillment is easier at the
local store level? Are retailers using their store fleet now in lieu of possibly more expensive industrial or
distribution facilities? So as you talk to your retailer management teams, like what are the key drivers that
they speak to with increase in this trend?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, you're exactly right. I think when we have open dialogue with our retailers, they are looking at their
real estate differently, and they're seeing their store base as a distribution fulfillment point that can solve
for the last mile. The last mile is something that's been tried to be cracked now for a number of years.
And with BOPIS, with curbside pickup, you have to have that amenity available to your customer to offer
a suite of services. But what's being unlocked, I think, is the stores being optimized to service that last
mile in more ways than one. And you're seeing the changes being made primarily from the best-in-class
retailers as they set the blueprint for others to follow. But it is very clear when you look at who the most
successful retailers are but the store is being utilized as that last mile fulfillment point. And I wouldn't be
surprised if you start to see more incentives for customers to drive to the store because the margin is
higher there, and they can take advantage of that by incentivizing them with coupons or other offers that
really can get people to take control over when they want the good, how they want the good, and it does
drive up margin for the retailer. So they're looking at it very differently.

Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up. Clearly, a bright spot has been leasing.
Where would you say your leasing pipeline is now versus pre-COVID levels?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. No, our leasing pipeline is -- I mean, as I mentioned earlier, related to Q4 2020 performance and
when you compare it year-over-year, it basically is at that level of pre-pandemic. And when you look
into '21, '21 Q1 is usually historically a little bit lighter post holiday, and you tend to see an increase in
vacancies, which is normal. But what we've been seeing is extremely encouraging. So again, as people are
seeing this opportunity of displacement, new vacancies coming to market, they want to take advantage of
it, knowing that, that window will close shortly thereafter.

Our next question is from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

A quick question, I guess, on the Rite Aid warehouse acquisitions. So how should we think about that? And
what's on the table now to buy? How wide is the scope for what you put capital into?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Sure, Mike, I'm happy to answer that. So when you look at the Rite Aid transaction, I would just point
to sort of the history of our PLUS business. And the fact that we have taken advantage of sale-leaseback
opportunities many times in the past, most recently, obviously, the Albertsons investment, where a
smaller component of that transaction that maybe doesn't get the same level of showcases. The bigger
investment is that we were able to acquire several of their grocery stores within shopping centers that
we controlled, where we didn't have the grocer. Dating a little bit further back, we had a very successful
transaction with Winn-Dixie, where we acquired 5 of their freestanding locations and one shopping center
that they owned. And subsequently, we sold off 4 of those at pretty significant profit and held on to the
shopping center in the Florida Keys, which is a redevelopment asset, as well as a freestanding one in
Miami, which is now slated for future redevelopment and potentially density.

So when we look at the specifics of the Rite Aid transaction, we're in constant communication with our
retailers, particularly those that are real estate rich, helping them provide, I would say, solutions for
some of their liquidity needs or desires. And when this opportunity presented itself, while I can't get too
much into the economics of it because we're bound by confidentiality, I can tell you that directionally, the
cap rate that we were able to negotiate is significantly higher than the core grocery products that we're
seeing transact in this market. When we look at the cap rate here, it's substantially higher than the other
distribution centers that we're seeing trading in the state of California. And lastly, I would just say that we
are holding it in our TRS, which provides us sort of the maximum flexibility in terms of our hold period and
our exit strategy. So I'm not suggesting that this is sort of a wide-ranging opportunity, but selectively, we
do like to take advantage when those opportunities present themselves.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. So it sounds like we should be thinking about this as some sort of sale-leaseback transaction as
opposed to an industrial transaction where you're [head carping] path out now and going to the retailers
and trying to take down some of the industrial assets. Is that fair?

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

Yes, exactly. There's 0 landlord obligation here. It is a sale-leaseback that they've leased for an extended
period of time. So we don't anticipate that there will be any sort of operational involvement in those
locations. This was really just an opportunistic investment at a point in time.

Our next question is from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

So it was nice to see that the new leasing volume was up compared to last year. But it looked like the re-
leasing volume was down compared to the 2019 average. Just curious what the drivers of that were? And
how does the pace of 2021 renewals at this point compared to the historical average?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Thanks. This is Dave. It's a great question. So on the re-leasings, obviously, some of the impact
was for those tenants that vacated. So that would drive down the average a little bit as a result of
the pandemic. As we look forward into 2021, it's still early. Obviously, we're only in the beginning of
February, but we're continuing to see some good momentum both from options being exercised as well
as renewals. But more importantly, I think when you look at that sheet at the rollover schedule, the rent
per square foot for '21 is the lowest relative to the coming years. And so when we see the mark-to-market
opportunity on those, there's plenty of room to run on the spread side, so that should give us some
additional lift as we secure the renewals of the tenancy and/or they exercise options as we go forward.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And just one more for me, maybe more modeling related. But the potentially uncollectible rent
adjustment in Q4 was -- appeared to be a $3 million positive. Does this reflect primarily the cash basis
tenants paying that rent? Or how should we be interpreting that number?

Kathleen Thayer
Vice President of Corporate Accounting

Greg, it's Kathleen. I'll help you out there. So if you look at the page, you really almost need to take the
3 line items that are there together. So rent abatement, cash basis tenant adjustments and then also that
potentially full rent income adjustment together to come up with what the total P&L impact is. And the
reason for that the opposite signs or the income sign in the adjustment line is really primarily to the way
that we're presenting the rent abatements. So on tenants that are looking at the reserve and thinking
there's a potential for future rent abatement, we would take a reserve on that, a general reserve. And
then when the actual abatement does occur, you'll see it come through that rent abatement line, but that
reserve that we have put up previously is flipping in that line with the uncollectible adjustments. So really
it's, overall, the 3 lines together.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

So it's not cash basis tenants paying back rent then. It's just reflecting the timing of the abatements?

Kathleen Thayer
Vice President of Corporate Accounting

Exactly. The timing of the reserve versus when the abatement actually happens, yes.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Conor, you talked about the occupancy and lease spread likely widening before it starts to narrow again.
So can you talk a little bit about the cadence that you expect throughout the year between leased and
occupied space?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure, happy to, and Dave can comment as well. What we're seeing is the demand continuing, as Dave had
mentioned earlier. The anchor side of it never really ebbed and flowed. It was pretty consistent through
the pandemic as most of our essential retailers saw a lot of market share up for grab and improving their
portfolio by locating in high-quality assets that weren't typically available to them before. I do think that
the big change that we've experienced is on the small shop side. And that's what's really, I think, going
to continue to improve the spread between physical and economic occupancy as we go through the year.
I think historically, we were, what is it, Glenn, probably around 275 basis points wide between those 2. I
wouldn't be surprised if we eclipse that. I wouldn't be surprised if we hit 300 just because I think there's a
lot of pent-up demand, a lot of market share up for grab. And when you look at how retailers are thinking
about this, the deals they're signing today are really more like 6 to 12 months out before they open. And
so they feel like now is the time to grab market share so that when the reopening occurs, they're in the
best position possible to soak up that market share. So we feel like with the transformed portfolio, we're in
really good shape to have that spread widen out to potentially its all-time high.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

And then just to give you a little -- I was going to say, if you want just a little perspective. At the end of
the third quarter, the spread was 150 basis points. We ended the year at 190 basis points. On a historic
basis, our peak, I think, was about 330 basis points. So as we continue, obviously, this lease-up, and
you're seeing the leasing momentum, to Conor's point, I would expect that we should exceed 300 basis
points before it starts coming back down as those rents start flowing.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Right. Glenn, just sticking with you as a follow-up, and it's relating to the guidance. And I think you
acknowledged it's wider and you sort of called out some impacts on questions and I appreciate having the
bottom line number. I think just given the amount of impacts that occurred in 2010 in 4Q and likely that
there are going to be significant impacts during 2021 relative to those numbers in 2020. Can you provide
just a very detailed almost category line-by-line sort of ranges especially on the NOI side, given all the
abatements and deferrals and bad debt? And I know there's a lot of uncertainty, but you did provide a
bottom line number. I would say, for us, it's actually having all the components are the more interesting
and important variables. And then we know how many shares outstanding you have. We can divide to
figure it out, but it's sort of very opaque, just having this bottom line number. And so I don't know if you
can do it after the call or if there's more detail that you can provide now in terms of those impacts, both
on a GAAP and cash basis. And so I don't know why it wasn't provided. So maybe you can provide a little
bit more detail around that.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Again, I tried to give you a little bit of flavor on certainly what's happening in the reserve world. Again,
baked into the guidance, there is $80 million to $100 million of potential credit loss. So you have a pretty
wide gap there. You do see what's happening on the financing costs. Again, financing costs are relatively
stable, except for we're going to have less capitalization as I mentioned. So there's about $8 million
to $10 million less of capitalized interest in 2021 baked into the guidance versus 2020. G&A also was
relatively stable. We did have our voluntary early retirement program, which we do expect would create
savings of somewhere between $4 million and $5 million a year. That's being offset by lower capitalization
of construction payroll of somewhere between $4 million and $6 million. So you have those components.

14

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

Those are the major drivers of what's sitting in there. Again, the NOI itself is really dependent on, again,
further lease-up as well as just how much impact there is on the credit loss. But we'd be happy to provide
you with some further detail after the call.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. A very clear summary of going from 4Q numbers and taking the [ 31 ] and breaking it out to its
component parts and then matching that up to what the go-forward plan is because it's very opaque. And
even when you throw numbers out in the call, I think having it in a clear format, and I really appreciate
the bottom line number. It's all the components so that there's no ambiguity about how numbers are
being created.

David F. Bujnicki
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategy

Yes. Michael, it's Dave Bujnicki. Also in terms of the NOI, as Glenn mentioned, I mean, really, the high
end of our range is based on the fourth quarter annualization. And really looking at the credit loss where
it could be, obviously, the high end of the range represents a continuation of the reserves of the $20
million reserve particularly in the fourth quarter or the low end is really $100 million. And really, as Glenn
mentioned, the lease-up, the timing and the width of the spread between the lease and the occupancy just
makes it a little bit difficult from that standpoint. And the reality is we haven't provided much difference
than we have in the past in terms of the guidance where we have here. So net neutral, but we'll see what
we could do in terms of breaking it down further.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

We haven't been in a pandemic before, right? So I think in those times where things are much more
stable, there's just so many onetime impacts, and some of them are buried in different line items that just
went through, right? So I think it's just having that income state presentation that you used to have way
back when of those line items and ranges I think would be very helpful for the analysts and the investor
community.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We will make sure to do that, Michael. We are always best-in-class in terms of disclosure. And obviously,
there's a lot more variables in the pandemic, but we can walk you through how we came through with the
guidance. And we think it's important to have guidance out there just to show that we have confidence in
the growth profile of the cash flow. So we can help you through the components.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes, I totally agree. And that's -- and I want to -- it is a positive to have the bottom line. I was just trying
to get the details and who knows that there's mandated closures in your forward numbers or not at the
low end, and just trying to get some of that detail around it would be helpful.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So maybe I'll just take that just from a bigger-picture active. Conor, now that you guys are -- we're in
February, hard to believe that we're almost a year into this. You talked a lot about improvement, especially
restaurants, entrepreneurs. So as we look at it, you have 92% rent collections, you have deferrals at less
than 2% in the fourth quarter. So that's about -- always scary to do math on a public call, but it sounds

15

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2021

like about 6% remaining. How do you feel about that 6% remaining credit? Do you feel like, basically, let's
call it, half of those folks will pay and be good, the other half, so 3% will go tapioca? Or do you feel -- like
where do you feel -- because ultimately, that's the real question that we're all getting at is you're sitting
here, we know there's going to be residuals, but it would also seem like right now you have a pretty good
handle on which tenants are going to make it and which tenants you got your guys ready to go pad lock
the store.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. It's a good question, Alex. And I think it's one that changes almost weekly. I mean if you look at what
happened with AMC. That was pretty remarkable to see the stock run-up and have them take advantage
of it. And so I think that you have to go tenant by tenant, which we can do off-line. But a lot of it comes
down to the categories that were most impacted that are still closed, right, or they still have significant
capacity constraints. And how quickly can they get reopened? How quickly can they come back to full
capacity? Those are all questions that are really hard to answer because it all depends on things that are
outside of our control. And so when you look at how we've approached it, our mentality is, if a retailer
has kept their lights on through this pandemic to this point, it's our responsibility to try and help them
make it through this last phase of it. And hopefully, this is the last phase of it. And so that's the way we're
approaching it.

And we're trying to make sure we work with those tenants that have put their best foot forward to throw
everything at staying afloat. And it's luckily that Kimco is a big partner with a lot of these retailers that can
help them and navigate the PPP funding round, can structure leases to give them the breathing room to
hopefully make it through. But it is a tenant-by-tenant approach that we have done that really takes into
account the category that they're in, the capacity constraints that they're facing, potentially the product
that they're waiting to get if it's blockbuster movies. So all these things are really components that make
up the assumptions that come to our guidance range that we feel comfortable disclosing and feel like it's
our job to exceed it.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

But I mean -- so basically, Conor, the 6% outstanding, are all those people's lights on or half of their lights
are off? So just some big picture. You must have some big-picture views on that 6% remaining.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

I can add in a little bit here, Alex, this is Dave. Yes. So it does vary as Conor mentioned, but it's not to say
that in terms of uncollectible the tenants themselves are dark or they vacated. We could be working out
a deal where we cut a deferment early on in the pandemic and had their collection start date in January,
but say they're on the West Coast and they had to go through a second closing, which impacted their
business more so than originally expected. We probably work with them on extending out that deferment
start date, and that could be in process now and just not yet papered. So that's not uncommon in some
of these situations. While in others, we're working out what would make a reasonable agreement between
both parties where we get some additional flexibility within their existing lease to reposition, redevelop
parts of the center, and we're still negotiating that. So I wouldn't by any means take that 6% and assume
that they're dark or they vacated. It's not that. It is just an ongoing dialogue with the tenants there.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then just second question is, SPACs are all the rage, you guys obviously have a success on the
PLUS business. So are you -- how are your views of raising a SPAC similar to what Simon is doing? Is that
something where you would see positive because you could raise outside capital, therefore, free up Kimco
capital? Or that's not something that you're really actively pursuing?

So Alex, it's a good question. I think, obviously, there's a crazy amount of SPACs every day. If you
remember back in June, which seems like an eternity ago, we did do a press release that we were
exploring an investment vehicle. Then you can extrapolate from there. What we elected to do was really
focus on the core business. We felt like there was a lot of blocking and tackling that we needed to focus
our time and effort on. And when you look at what's going to drive earnings growth, what's going to drive
outperformance for Kimco and their shareholders, we believed it was focusing on the core business and
then continuing to look for opportunities, focusing on retailers that are real estate rich, looking to take
advantage of a dislocation in our sector because of our balance sheet strength, because of our liquidity
position and then provide that upside to our shareholders versus a separate entity.

Our next question is from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

On previous calls, you've mentioned having over 10 grocer opportunity that were currently in negotiation.
Thanks for the mention on Amazon Fresh. I wonder if you could update us where those other opportunities
stand.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Sure, Craig, it's Dave. We executed 3 over the quarter in Q4, and the balance of the opportunities are
in various forms of discussion. It could be early LOI stage to negotiating a lease. And that population
does vary as the negotiations progress, some fall out, some new opportunities come on. But I'd say this,
our regional teams are hyper-focused on exploring every opportunity with grocers at all of our locations,
either backfilling existing grocery or conversion to -- of non-grocery to grocery. And we're seeing the
demand drivers from really all of -- all sectors, whether it's the value-oriented grocers of all the Lidl to the
specialties of Sprouts, Trader Joe's and others to the more mainstream. It is really an overall effort and
also the ethnic-oriented grocers, whether it be 99 Ranch, H Mart, they're all actively expanding to increase
their market share in each of these markets. So we're encouraged by that focus and by the conversations
we've been having with each of these operators. So we see this as a -- our goal long-term is really to
convert than we currently have today at a grocery.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And then just looking at Boulevard, I see that it's 88%. Do you know what percent is open? And
what is the scheduling of those openings? And then just finally, how are retailers looking at new projects
versus existing projects regarding leasing?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Sure. The Boulevard has the Shoprite opened. They opened in I believe October of 2020, they had an
incredible opening. It was actually the biggest in their fleet's history. So that was a great first sign of what
we see as the long-term success of the Boulevard. The balance of the Junior Box tenants are scheduled
to open in the second half of this year going in summer and then into the fall of '21. And then that will be
complemented by the small shops on the first floor that will go through '21 into '22 as well. So that's what
was planned, and we're currently on track for that.

And as it relates to the demand between new projects and existing, obviously, for us, the focus is on our
existing portfolio, the core portfolio. We've been very encouraged by the activity we've seen both at Dania
and the Boulevard through -- as we're coming through the pandemic and leasing starts to accelerate.
And when you look at the quality of real estate and the quality of the projects, fortunately, they speak for
themselves and drive the demand there.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

So you guys talked about some of the cadence that we should expect in 2021. I was just curious, we're
almost done with the first quarter. What kind of impact do you think you'll see from kind of seasonal
bankruptcies?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

So far, we haven't experienced a whole lot of bankruptcies this quarter. Ray can comment on the detail.
But really the last bankruptcy that was of any sort of significance was back in, I think, it was back actually
November.

Raymond Edwards

Middle of November, middle of November.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, November [indiscernible], right?

Raymond Edwards
Executive Vice President of Retailer Services

Guitar Center filed on November 15 and actually came up by the middle of December. And we've had no
major bankruptcies for basically 3 months now. And obviously, AMC was on our radar, but with all the
creation that's happened in the market, they have gotten themselves some breathing room. So we just
keep monitoring the movie theaters and some of the gyms, but they seem to be coming out of this right
now.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I know this is not going to be a mutually exclusive situation, but I was just curious if there
was 2 competing spaces. I'm sure you have some high-quality centers with high rent and you have some
others that are maybe lower quality with lower rent. Theoretically speaking, is the retailer more inclined
to go after your higher quality, higher rent location or the lower quality ones? And I know those aren't
mutually exclusive and each retailer has a different target zone, but I was just curious, just high level.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. It's -- there are so many variables, I guess, factored into a retailer's decision to take any particular
space. Sometimes, there is a retailer that has significant demand in one of their existing locations and
so they're looking for a pressure valve to release some of that demand on one store. So they'll look at,
say, for grocery, they'll maybe take a smaller format in our center if that was available. Some people look
at bookending a trade area while others look to saturate it with multiple stores. Ross has a double-down
strategy where they will -- in their higher productive markets, they'll look to put stores almost across the
street from one another. So it really just depends on where they are in terms of their fleet strategy and
how it complements how they view trade areas and grabbing market share.

And with the pandemic, what it's really done is accelerate I think a lot of the discussion that have been
ongoing, whether it's curbside, BOPIS, distribution, last mile. And so those conversations are ongoing and
ever-changing within the retailer world. And so it's incumbent upon us to stay very, very close to them,

knowing that month-to-month, their view of a market or a site may vary and may change to our benefits.
We want to make sure that we're always out in front. So long story short, it's really hard to peg it towards
just one element. It's a number of attributes and variables that get factored in.

Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

I would say that retailers also are very focused on the curb appeal and the accessibility as well as the
convenience factor. So the four-wall EBITDA is usually very profitable for our major retailers. And so
they're really focused on making sure they get the right real estate. And right now, they have been taking
advantage of, I think, some of the market share that's up for grabs, where some of the weaker players
are not necessarily defending their flank and they're coming in and being able to upgrade their portfolio
quality.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. And I would actually -- sorry, just add one more thing to Conor's point. Retailers are also looking
at well capitalized landlords into this idea of curb appeal. I mean we've invested a tremendous amount,
making sure that our centers show extremely well and are the highest class in any given market, which
we represent. But it's really long term, making sure that the landlord themselves can continue to make
those investments to make it as appealing as possible to service their customers, which are the same as
our customers. And that does factor in as well.

Our next question is from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital.

Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just curious if you guys could give a little bit more flavor with regards to AFFO or FAD relative to your
NAREIT FFO guidance? And as part of that, how to think about taxable income given your comments on
how you're, at least, as the kind of the worst case, correct me if I'm wrong, for the dividend going forward
if it's readjusted?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Well, we're targeting the dividend, at least, to be really right at around taxable income. And for the most
part, that should bring us to a level where our AFFO would probably be in the mid-70s as a payout ratio.
So that's kind of where the target is. Again, you have the difference of the capital that's spent on TIs and
leasing commissions and CapEx, obviously, that are the reconciliation between FFO and the AFFO. But
-- that's kind of where we see it. Taxable income, we continue to look for all sorts of tax strategies to
manage it and keep it in check. But again, I think you can get a better flavor once we meet, again, with
our Board and we declare our first quarter dividend.

In terms of staying opportunistic during this time of disruption, are there specific markets where you're
seeing better opportunities, like maybe regions where lockdown restrictions were stricter? Or is it not so
black and white?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. It really hasn't been geographic in nature. I think it's very specific to individual circumstances.
So as we talked about a little bit previously, we have started to see some additional opportunity from
owners that have specific capital needs for their assets, whether it's repositionings or debt maturities. So
I wouldn't necessarily break it down in terms of a trend in terms of location, geographics or property type.
It is sort of a specific circumstance of that individual owner or investor.

Linda Tsai

And then I think earlier you guys said that you're seeing more demand for space from fitness operators. Is
this from existing ones or new entrants?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We're seeing demand from a lot of value-oriented fitness operators, The Planets, The Crunches of the
world, where I think they see the opportunity here again to enter markets or centers that otherwise
weren't previously available. And I also think the price point that they're servicing and providing is
probably appropriate coming out of the pandemic to start. That's usually where they see the quickest
expansion opportunity. With that, I'm sure we'll see variance of boutique fitness that emerge. It always
is the case. Obviously, the at-home, the online app trends that been developed through the pandemic,
I'm sure as forms of that will transfer over into brick-and-mortar and the 4 walls, and then we'll see a
combination of all those come together.

Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Van Dijkum. Conor, and you guys had some interesting comments about your land value and about,
obviously, you have indicated you're looking at doing more grocery-anchored deals, obviously, grocery-
anchored adding to your existing centers, but also maybe looking at buying grocery-anchored centers.
What is the -- how do you think about the relative value of grocery-anchored versus lifestyle centers? No
one seems to talk about lifestyle centers these days? And also maybe talk about the opportunity that you
have within your ground rent portfolio. And is that being undervalued? And how do you look at all those
components?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

It's a good question, Floris. When we see the grocery opportunity, it's, first and foremost, being led by the
demand we're seeing from all the different grocery categories that Dave outlined. It's interesting. There's
a big cap rate difference when you have a grocery anchor versus when you don't. And we have a lot of
products that lends itself to just leasing up boxes to grocery stores, which, in my opinion, is the best risk-
adjusted return we can find today. And so that's where our focus is. And we have these deep relationships
with these retailers that are looking to expand. And so we have, I think, a deep pipeline of opportunity
there that we want to take advantage of. And that may lend itself to acquisitions as well in the future,
where we can buy assets that don't necessarily have a grocery component, but we have the connections
and we have the wherewithal to sort of line up that grocer before we even close on that asset. So it does
compress the cap rate. It does start to generate some additional traffic flow, some cross-shopping that
usually leads to higher rents in the surrounding spaces, and that's the secret sauce. You want to sort of

get that lift without paying for it. So we are encouraged by what we're seeing so far. We have a lot of work
to do, but we feel like the strategy and the focus is there across the organization.

On your second question between lifestyle and grocery-anchored, like lifestyle is sort of the dynamic
that got hit hardest from the pandemic, right? If you think about lifestyle, it's usually heavily loaded with
restaurants and entertainment, and most of those leases are percentage rent driven. And so you sort of
live and breathe with the success of your retailers. And so in the best of days, you're killing it and the
worse of days, you're taking it on the chin just like they are. So it's one of those product types that I think
is very volatile. It's not very essential and defensive. But there's opportunity there if you can underwrite it
correctly. I'm not sure we're going to be playing in the pool of lifestyle centers, but we'd like to underwrite
everything just to get a sense of where we think we can add value. And maybe lifestyle -- portions of
lifestyle centers lend themselves to a repositioning to a grocery-anchored center or maybe some of them
can be unlocked for future densification through entitlement work. So that's where our platform really
comes and has value as we feel like we can look at the real estate and not necessarily just judge it on the
way it sits today, but try and envision should be there with the blank slate and then have our team go and
unlock that highest and best use and that value for our shareholders. And so that's the way we look at real
estate.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

And in terms of your ground rent portfolio, and Ross, maybe you can comment on this. I think you have
something like $100 million of ground rents. I mean the cap rates on those things are really tight these
days and probably underappreciated by the market. What about doing a larger-scale transaction to realize
some of that value?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. No, you're exactly right. I mean, I think the value is underappreciated for that product. The challenge
that we would have in terms of unlocking that is that a significant amount of that is contained within some
of our best assets. So it's one thing to have a freestanding ground lease with a high credit, investment-
grade tenancy. It's another when that ground rent is contained within the heart of some of our best
assets. So we obviously want to retain control of as much of the GLA and the acreage of our best assets
to enhance and create future opportunity. So we've certainly been approached, and we know that there's
underlying value in a lot of those leases. But our objective is to retain that and to continue to turn that
into future value because those, in many cases, are the lowest rent, large parcels that one day could be
something significantly greater.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. The other initiative we have, as I mentioned, is on the entitlement side. I think we've done a number
of apartment complexes on ground leases. And I think that bodes well for our future to do more of that to
help unlock the value, also control the real estate and start to continue to expand that percentage of ABR
coming from ground leases, which I think is now over 11%.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Is there any sort of -- can you quantify what the future potential of something like ground rents under
apartment complexes could be?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We did start to disclose the entitlements on the supplemental, and you can start to extrapolate valuations
there on a per unit basis, and we can help you on some of the ground lease deals that we've done so far
that we feel like is a good barometer for the future.

Our next question is from Chris Lucas from Capital One.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to go back to the dividend policy, if I could. Normally, at this point, you guys would have
declared a first quarter dividend. Just kind of curious as to whether you're going to be paying quarterly
dividends. Should we interpret much in sort of the first dividend announcement as it relates to future
run rate? Or is the focus going to really be on getting to sort of year-end and just paying out the taxable
minimum? So it could be a little lumpy.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Chris, no, we're planning to do quarterly dividends as we always have, and we did even -- we did quarterly
dividends even during 2020. So we temporarily suspended it, and we shifted the timing. So we'll meet
with our Board later this month and declare the dividend for the first quarter and it will be paid in the first
quarter. And we do plan to have, as I mentioned, a more normalized dividend level that will reflect closer
to taxable income. So I think you'll see a normalized level and something that, over time, we should be
able to grow from.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, Chris, the dialogue with the Board was focused on really, since we're in the midst of the pandemic
still, why don't we see what we collect, why don't we see what the rent is that's coming through the door
for the first quarter before we announce the dividend. And I think that's just logical. I think that's the way
we -- in terms of understanding what we really have before we elect a dividend amount.

Our next question is from Paulina Rojas from Greenstreet.

Paulina A. Rojas Schmidt

Could you please provide an update on the performance of your tenant assistance program, particularly
as it relates to the last round of PPP loans? Are your tenants taking advantage of these resources in a
meaningful way, in your opinion? Also, more broadly speaking, what is your assessment of the health of
your local small tenants? Are you worried? Not so much?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We have seen good engagement on the tenant assistance program. Really, the partners that we align
with are best-in-class in terms of navigating the PPP funding round. The details are, we have a couple of
hundred already engaged with that program. I think it was -- Dave, correct me if I'm wrong, was it 300 or
400?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

I think it's around 300.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

300. So it's been so far so good, but we're waiting to see, obviously, how much funding they're able to
process. And again, I think at this point in time in the cycle, there's people that need the access to capital,
and it was our mission to make sure that we give them the fastest path possible to get access to that
capital. And then, Dave, do you want to comment a little bit about our small shops?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. With our small shops, we're actively speaking to each of them on a regular basis. Some have done
fairly well through this, while others have continued to struggle. That's no surprise, I think, to anyone, but
the small shops are the lifeblood that we want to continue to hold close to ourselves to make sure that we
provide all the resources and the tools that they need to get through the pandemic and that they're in the
best position -- on the best footing to really thrive on the back end of the pandemic. So we continue to
work very closely with them and TAP is a great example of one of those tools that we deployed early on
and we redeployed when the second round of assistance came. And we'll continue to modify and provide
additional resources as needed to help build their business back.

Paulina A. Rojas Schmidt

And then a second question. Do you think there are tenant categories that will emerge from this pandemic
more permanently damaged? And do you see any structural changes? I'm trying to think beyond the
temporary impact of social distancing measures and such and know your opinion about tenant categories
that this thing will take longer to heal.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Well, I think in terms of structural changes, again, I think COVID and the pandemic were catalyst to trends
that were already emerging, whether it's BOPIS, curbside, et cetera. These are conversations that we've
had for several years prior to the pandemic. It just pulled all those efforts forward. And essentially, over
night, we are required to deploy and build out the infrastructure to support that. So I'd expect just the
efficiency of how consumers and retailers engage with each other will continue to improve and that will
create new opportunities, whether it's wholesale modifications or changes to business strategy, it's hard
to tell. It really is case by case, but I think it just does give retailers more opportunities to create touch
points with their end customer. And for us, it's important that, as a landlord, we invest the time and the
resources necessary to make sure that we're the desired location for those retailers and get built into the
social fabric and behavior of the customers to make sure that they always return back to our centers. And
that's where the engagement both to the shopper as well as the retailer is really important for us is to
best understand how these trends are emerging.
