Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. At the request of the company,
this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-
answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved.
Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of
Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.

Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go
ahead, please.

Shawn C. Bevec
Vice President of Investor Relation

Thank you, and good morning. I'm on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.

During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We
provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our
earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties,
including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include,
but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently
filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe
that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial
condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, the pandemic's impact on the
U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state
and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge
and control.

For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and
references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to
base testing volumes or base business refer to base testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 molecular
and serology testing volumes. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections,
including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted
earnings growth are compounded annual growth rates.

Now here is Steve Rusckowski.

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, in one of the most challenging periods of
our history, Quest Diagnostics stepped up and expanded COVID-19 testing for the country and delivered
stronger-than-expected performance in the second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by
COVID-19 testing and a rapid recovery of our base testing volumes. I'm very proud of Quest employees
that are on the front lines of health care answering the call and fighting with COVID-19 pandemic.

So this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter. Our role in the COVID-19 pandemic and
update you on our non-COVID base business and then Mark will provide more detail on the second quarter
results and our financial position. We have reinstated our financial outlook for the remainder of the year
with a broad range, which reflects uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Mark will talk about our outlook
and underlying assumptions just in a few minutes.

Our financial performance in the second quarter was stronger than anticipated, also lower than the same
period of 2019. For the quarter, total revenue declined approximately 6% to $1.83 billion. Earnings per
share decreased by approximately 10% on a reported basis to $1.36 and approximately 18% on net

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

adjusted basis to $1.42. These results were driven by a strong bounce back in our base testing volumes
for March and April, as the health care system began to resume non-urgent care and elective surgery
sooner than we had anticipated. Heavy demand for COVID-19 molecular testing helped partially offset
base volume decline as well.

Demand came in from a number of areas: there's a continuing spread of the virus throughout much of the
country, a pent-up need to test done for COVID-19 pre-surgical patients, people with high-risk populations
like nursing homes and prisons, the proliferation of retail testing sites and finally, employer interest in
testing employees before they return to work.

Quest Diagnostics has continued to play a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation.
We performed roughly 8.5 million COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests and more than 2.5 million antibody
or serology test. We now have the capacity to perform up to 130,000 molecular diagnostic test a day,
doubled the capacity since mid-May. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to
perform approximately 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Tentatively, Quest has delivered
nearly 20% of all the testing fleet. Working together with large national retailers like Walmart and CVS,
we've built a new model for consumers to access testing. We're also supporting HHS and state drive-
through testing initiatives across the country. I'm very proud of the progress we have made in rapidly
scaling up capacity since the pandemic began. However, demand for testing has surged in recent weeks.
And we are providing testing results in about 2 days for the highest priority patients. And the average
turnaround time for nonpriority patients is at least 7 days. So we're doing everything we can to bring more
COVID-19 molecular testing to patients and speed the delivery of test results. We continue to add testing
platforms and work with our suppliers to ensure access to testing equipment, reagents and professional
and personal protective equipment.

We're exploring a range of new technology options, like last week, the FDA granted Quest, the nation's
first emergency use for -- virtually use authorization to use specimen pooling for COVID-19 molecular
testing. This technique which is currently used with blood banking will help expand capacity, especially
among populations with low instruments. Through our lab referral program, we're partnering with other
quality laboratories to expand our available capacity. And in recognition of the magnitude of the current
demand for testing, we have asked customers to help the prior day's patients we test for COVID-19 at this
time.

Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways over the last few months to fight COVID-19 pandemic.
Our company has been central to the crisis response and I'm proud of our employees on front lines who
are serving patients, customers and communities every day. In June, we offered financial systems to
about 23,000 of our frontline colleagues and their supervisors incurred increased expenses during the
pandemic. In April, we took a series of temporary workforce actions to manage our costs. These included
as furloughs, reduced hours and pay cuts for salaried employees. And then today, I am very pleased
to report the vast majority of these actions were reversed a month earlier to enable us to continue to
respond to our customers' increased demand for testing.

Since March, we've been fighting COVID-19, but we've also been focused on accelerating growth in today's
system. And as a reminder, the wide elements of our strategy to accelerate the growth are to grow more
than 2% per year through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions, to expand relationships with health
plans and hospital health systems, to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation, being recognized
as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services. And then finally, support population
health and data analytics and extended care services.

Now let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. During the
pandemic, the M&A environment understandably slowed. But despite that, we were able to complete the
acquisition of Memorial Hermann outreach business in April and are pleased with early progress. We also
recently announced our plan to acquire all of mid-America clinical laboratories or Mako once we complete
this transaction expected this quarter. Quest will wholly own Mako Laboratory in Minneapolis and about
50 patient service centers across Indiana. Also we'll provide professional lab services under a long-term
agreement for 30 hospital labs owned and operated by Mako Technology in hospitals [indiscernible] and
Community Health Network.

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many
more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their last strategy. At the same
time, we know that smaller regional laboratories have had their own challenges. This could also produce
more opportunity for tuck-in acquisitions. If anything, the pandemic could be in an additional catalyst to
help drive inventory consolidation. Some transactions in the pipeline that were paused because of the
pandemic are being revisited based on the new realities that this health care system is experiencing at this
time. We also continue to make progress on our health plan strategy. We entered our second year being
a member of UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network, and we are pleased with the results to date. We
have met or exceeded key quality metrics such as electronic ordering and resulting and patient service
center appointment rate. We've also secured business for more than 180 out-of-network UHC labs, saving
money for patients and lowering the overall cost of care. We look forward to making continued progress
with the preferred lab network in the second year. Over the last few months, we've seen a remarkable
surge in the sign-ups of our MyQuest patient portal. Today, more than 11 million patients have a MyQuest
account to make appointment and receive the results through their smartphone or computer.

Since late April, we've seen a more than threefold increase in weekly registrations was accelerated at the
end of the second quarter. We believe that our patients see and appreciate the ease and convenience of
our consumer experience.

Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark who will take you through the results. Mark?

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.83 billion, down 6.4% versus
the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 5.7% compared to the prior
year. Although revenue declined year-over-year, our second quarter results were stronger than we
communicated back in June. Reflecting a stronger-than-expected recovery in base testing volumes as
well as growing demand for COVID-19 testing services. Volumes, measured by the number of requisitions
decreased 17.7% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 50 basis points.
Testing volumes in the company's base business declined approximately 34% versus the prior year.
In April, base volumes declined in excess of 50% compared to last year as care home measures were
implemented across the U.S. Hospitals began to limit elective procedures and many physician offices
were temporarily closed for business. Base volume trends began to improve in May, down more than
30% as state-at-home measures. Many hospitals reintroduced elective procedures, and some physician
offices reopened. The base volume recovery continued in June, down less than 15% as the trends in
May gain momentum. Throughout the quarter, the strongest recoveries were observed in the states that
opened more quickly than others, such as Texas and Florida. As we exited June, base volume declines
had moderated to approximately high single digits. However, due to the recent spike with COVID-19
cases across the country and the rollback of several state reopening plans, we have seen a slight
softening of our base business in early July. While base testing volumes remained down year-over-year,
COVID-19 testing was a meaningful offset in the second quarter. We exited the second quarter averaging
approximately 110,000 and 26,000 COVID-19 molecular and serology tests, respectively, each day. Over
the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests a
day. Revenue per requisition increased 15.3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by reimbursement for
COVID-19 molecular testing. Unit price headwinds were slightly less than 2% in the second quarter, in line
with our prior expectations. This includes the ongoing impact of PAMA.

Reported operating income was $283 million or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $307 million or 15.7% of
revenues last year. Reported operating income from the second quarter includes $65 million of proceeds
from the [indiscernible] basis. Operating income was $294 million or 16.1% of revenues compared to
$352 million or 18% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was due to
the significant decline in revenue associated with our base testing volumes, partially offset by COVID-19
testing and our cost reduction actions. Adjusted operating income does not include proceeds from the
Cares Act. Reported EPS was $1.36 in the quarter compared to $1.51 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.42
compared to $1.73 last year. Cash provided by operations was $602 million year-to-date through June 30,

versus $596 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the second quarter included the
$65 million of provider disbursements under the Cares Act I just mentioned.

Our financial position remains very strong. During the second quarter, we amended our revolving credit
facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility. We completed a $550 million debt offering in May which
may be used to redeem or repay our senior notes due in 2021. Given the better-than-expected second
quarter results, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was only slightly above where we ended Q1. We ended the
quarter with nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet.

Finally, our Board of Directors remains committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time.
This morning, we reissued our full year 2020 outlook as follows: revenue is expected to be between $8
million and $8.6 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 11.3% versus the prior year. Reported
EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.66 and $7.66 -- EPS to be in the range of $6.60 and $8.60 per
share. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.25 billion and capital expenditures are
expected to be between $375 million and $400 million. We continue to operate under extremely uncertain
conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is evidenced in wider-than-usual outlook ranges we
shared in our quarterly press release today.

As you consider our new 2020 outlook, I'd like to share the following considerations and assumptions.
First, regarding base testing volumes, we expect base testing volumes to remain below prior year levels
for the remainder of the year. While the magnitude of the year-over-year decline is likely to fluctuate
geographically as state's throttle reopening phases, our current outlook does not contemplate the
magnitude of base volume declines observed in April and May. And the low end of the outlook assumes an
average 20% decline in base testing volumes through the remainder of the year.

Regarding molecular COVID-19 testing demand and capacity, we continue to drive towards molecular
cost 150,000 tests per day over the next couple of weeks. Keep in mind, this represents peak capacity
operating under optimize factor such as routine maintenance and planned downtime. We generally operate
at somewhat under peak capacity. We expect demand for molecular COVID-19 testing to remain high at
least through the third quarter. Please note that the low end of our outlook assumes recent molecular
COVID-19 testing volume trends continue at a similar level throughout the third quarter and then step
down in the fourth quarter.

Regarding Medicare reimbursement for molecular COVID-19 testing, the existing $100 Medicare
reimbursement for molecular COVID-19 testing is tied to the public health emergency declared by HHS.
HHS officials have recently indicated the plan to extend the public health emergency for an additional 90
days beyond the current expiration of July 25. Our outlook assumes this level of reimbursement continues
through late October. To be clear, we believe HHS should continue the public health emergency while the
crisis continues, and we are not aware of any plans for it to end.

Regarding COVID-19 serology testing, COVID-19 serology testing also continues to help offset declines
in base testing volumes. We continue to believe there is meaningful potential in serology testing but
rise in customer demand remains in front of us. Regarding the cost actions we've undertaken, as Steve
mentioned, we've rolled back many of these cost actions we took in April, with most remaining [ actions ]
expected at the end of July.

Finally, as we develop this outlook, we contemplated a range of potential outcomes in the second half
of 2020. The low end assumes the variability and uncertainty I just described. We have greater degree
of visibility into the third quarter, and there are far more unknowns in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we
currently expect third quarter results to be stronger than the fourth quarter.

I will now turn it back to Steve.

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize in the second quarter, Quest Diagnostics stepped up and rapidly
expanded COVID-19 testing for the country and delivered stronger-than-expected performance. Looking
forward to the rest of the year, we will continue to expand COVID-19 testing capacity while also serving

the unmet needs of health care community and drive our strategy to accelerate growth. We reinstated our
financial outlook for the full year of 2020 with a broad range, which reflects the [Audio Gap]. And finally,
I'm very proud of our Quest employees who have been on the front lines of health care, answering the call
and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ann Hynes from
Mizuho Securities.

Ann Kathleen Hynes
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. Thank you. And again, I want to thank everyone at Quest for what they're doing. I have 2
questions regarding testing. Could you clarify the comments you made on the guidance, I think you used
the word it's in front of us. So does that mean you do not have a meaningful contribution for serology
testing in 2020? And if so, do you think it's more of a 2021 contribution when the vaccine comes out? And
then my second question would be around just the molecular testing, the pooling that you announced
Monday. Should we think about that as just the ability to turn around faster? Or do you ultimately think
it's going to increase the capacity over the 100 or 2,000 per day?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Sounds good. Well, on serology end, we are doing serology as we speak. We brought that up in April.
We have in our outlook for the year. Some serology volume what I will say is there is growing evidence
of the value of serology. There's been some debate of the evidence that would suggest if you have the
antibodies that, in fact, it provides immunity for a period of time. It is clear that people are starting to
weigh in that, in fact, those antibodies do provide confidence that there will not be a reinfection. And as
that confidence builds and as we get into the fall and into next year, I do believe there will be a pickup in
serology, particularly as we start to think about who should get the vaccine and who should not get the
vaccine. So I think some of that is in front of us, but we do have some of that in our outlook.

And as far as molecular testing and pooling in the numbers that I provided, particularly getting to 150,000
per day in a couple of weeks. Some portion of that will be driven by the opportunities we see with pooling.
Some portion of that is also driven by adding new systems and new resources to increase our capacity.
And what I'll say is we're not stopping there. There's opportunities in front of us beyond that 150,000.

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I just would like to add, and, certainly, serology testing is meaningful. And we showed in Steve's
prepared remarks, we've done $2.5 million. That's certainly meaningful. It's just different than molecular,
where the demand is exceeding our capacity. We have shared earlier that we had capacity of 200,000
serology tests a day with an expectation that demand could possibly be at that level. For various reasons,
it's nowhere near that. But certainly, the amount of serology testing we're doing is very meaningful to
Quest and is one of the offsets to the base business decline right now.

Operator

Next, we have Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wolfe Research, LLC

I also wanted to ask about the molecular testing. Can you talk a little bit about how your referral patterns
have looked throughout the quarter? And what percentage of that testing volume is now coming from
return to work? My thought process was that if you're currently utilizing close to full capacity on the
molecular side, and the return to work opportunity is still largely in front of you. You potentially have
pretty high visibility even going out into Q4, one way or another as there's sort of a natural hedge built in
there? And then just as my follow-up, it looks like DSOs increased fairly meaningfully during the quarter. I

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

was hoping you could discuss that a little bit and whether you're seeing any collection challenges or delays
with the COVID testing?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Sure, sure. First, as far as demand, where is it coming from. In our prepared remarks, we talked
about the different elements of demand. And what I'll share with you is that we have demand right now
that is exceeding our capacity and we're doing what we can to obviously bring up the capacity. And
also what we said in prepared remarks is working with our customers and clients on prioritizing those
specimens that we're getting in to make sure we're testing the most urgent need in the country. And we're
making progress. And as we bring up the capacity and we manage our demand over the next several
weeks and get into August, we believe, as we get through August and into September, we'll have a higher
level of capacity, but also higher level of demand, and we'll be able to get the turnaround times that are in
the acceptable levels that we've had in the past. So it's in front of us. We're working hard of getting there.
And I think all elements that I describe will allow us to be successful through the next several weeks.

As far as demand, Steve, you talked about return-to-work programs that started to come into our
demand. We're managing it with employers. We also see in front of us the demand for return to
universities and colleges. There'll be a lot of testing required in the month of August around that. We
also see physicians bringing up their offices and more physicians are actually sending us specimens
that they've collected. So we see that adding to the demand. And then there's been broader access
and broader availability of testing where people have now had access to asymptomatic testing in very
convenient locations. And then I mentioned in our remarks, the access we've provided with CVS stores
and also with Walmart has increased the demand. So I would say across the board, it's growing in all
areas. And we do believe, though, as we get into the September months, when we hope there's still a
number of employers that are bringing employees back to the office or to work that we are going to be in
a place where our capacity will meet the demand that we see in our funnels.

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

So Stephen, did you ask about patient concessions? I didn't quite pick up your last question.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. It just looks to me that the DSOs were up a bit, maybe like...

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Oh, DSOs.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes, 5 days, maybe sequentially something like that. I doesn't know whether it's COVID testing or other
collection things that you guys might want to talk about a little bit.

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. That's really a formulaic approach. Cash collections are strong or as expected. We did have some
delayed billing around COVID testing because the payers needed to update their systems, and many of
them needed 30 days or more to do that. So we were holding on some billings at this point in terms of our
cash collections and everything, we're very, very comfortable with where we're at on our balance sheet.
And as you can see, the operating cash flow that was benefited from the Cares Act looks pretty strong
year-over-year despite the depressed volumes, revenues and earnings in the second quarter.

Our next question is from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.

Jack Meehan

So first of all, congrats on the trajectory. I wanted to get your thoughts on 1 of the top questions I've
been getting to the labs, which is how can you convert the short-term opportunity from testing and
make your long-term growth rate more durably higher? So I was curious to get your take on that. And
then, Mark, what does the guidance assume for incremental margins on testing in the second half versus
reinvestment? And are there any things that you can accelerate to try and improve the longer-term
trajectory of the business?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Let me start with -- we're going into second half. And clearly, our base business is going to continue
to be down. We are hopeful that we'll start to continue to see some recovery in the back half of the year,
but we're not necessarily contemplating any of that in our outlook for 2020. As we get into '21, it goes
back to us continue to work our strategy for accelerated growth, and we do believe we have the right
strategies, and we wanted to share with you in our prepared remarks that we're working those hard. And
I actually believe that the strategies are actually more appropriate given the pandemic than they were
before. So if you think through those, 1 is we do believe there could be more acquisitions in front of us
for growth through acquisitions. We announced the 2 deals recently that will prepare us nicely in the back
half of the year for growth through acquisitions and sets us up for '21 too with that carryover on that.
And the funnel that we're seeing and we're going to push on that funnel will give us some nice growth for
acquisitions as we keep on working those in the back half to help us in '21.

Second is, as far as organic growth in our base business, we continue to work our relationships with the
health plans. I would say that our work in the preferred lab network with United is going well. We're going
to continue to gain share with them, and we're pushing that same type of approach in concept with many
peers throughout our contracts, and we believe there is an opportunity for us to pick up share as we've
said in our strategy. We also continue to work with hospitals. We talked about the Mako deal includes a
professional systems deal, professional lab services deal. We have a number that are being finalized as
we speak that we feel good about, and those will give us continued organic growth next year. And then
also as we think about our advanced diagnostics and the capabilities we're bringing to the marketplace
with gene sequencing and consumer genetic offerings, we believe those strategies will give us some nice
opportunities for continued growth next year. So we're continuing to push on the base business growth
platform. At the same time, we'll have some natural recovery in our base businesses. The economy and as
health care recovers and also through acquisitions. We think we'll be in a good place as we get into '21 to
deliver on that objective that we have of 2% growth through acquisitions. So Mark, anything you'd like to
add to that?

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So to answer your specific question about margin drop down, Jack. As we've shared in the past, in a
short window, we're a highly fixed cost business on our base business. So generally, any plus or minuses
will be 80% or so drop through. It's really supplies and reagents that are the variable costs. So most of it,
everything from their logistics infrastructure to phlebotomy to even largely the labor and the laboratory in
a window is fixed. So variation, good or bad, around the base business has a very high drop through. And
although we certainly have good margins on our COVID testing, there's more variable cost in the COVID
testing. So it's not quite as high a variable margin on any sort of plus or minuses from our base case, but
still very attractive.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So my question is on the guidance. Mark, you obviously highlighted the assumptions on the low end of
the range. Just trying to understand better what you're assuming at the high end, and especially when we
think about molecular testing, I think you're expecting that at the low end, that there is going to be a step
down in the fourth quarter. So just trying to understand kind of like the rationale for that. What type of
environment do you see? Where we're going to see a step down in molecular? What are you assuming at
the high end? And then when we think about just the future of COVID-19 addressable market, in relation
to vaccine administration. Are you in any kind of conversation with the vaccine manufacturers? And how
do you think -- what do you think the role of testing will be in relation to the vaccine?

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

So I'll let Steve handle the vaccine question, but I'll just talk about the assumptions. So Ricky, appreciate
the question. If there's one thing that's been demonstrated over the last several months is we don't have
the ability to predict some of these things. So I don't think any of us here envision a 50% decline in our
business in April, even when the pandemic first started. And then on the other side, we didn't expect the
fast recovery that we saw throughout May and June, given what it happened in April. And so we want
to recognize that some of these things are out of our control, and we want to talk about some ranges of
potential outcomes and how they might impact our financial results to take away little bit, and hopefully a
large degree of the uncertainty we've been living with over the last couple of months where people were
wondering what might be happening at Quest.

So when we talk about PCR molecular volumes falling off in Q4, it's not because we have a vision of that
happening, but we want -- we had to make some assumptions in the guidance and since that's several
months away, we've shown that even a month or 2 in the future, it's hard to predict it. And we didn't
expect this surge in June that happens and therefore, we're just being, I think, appropriately cautious
and explaining what those assumptions are. So we don't have any sense that it will fall up. I think all of
us for society are hoping it will fall up as maybe the infection rate dampens. But also note that some of
the nonclinical work, the work we're doing for return to work for employers and students should be heavy
in Q3 and some of that, we might expect to step down in Q4. So that is 1 driver that might lead you to
believe that demand would dampen a little bit in Q4. But it's not as if we know how the virus is going to
proceed and the infection rate. And certainly, some people would say that we get to -- we don't know, but
we wanted to be very clear around those assumptions.

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Ricky, on your question about next year and specifically the vaccine. So first of all, we believe there will be
COVID-19 testing next year in '21. And second is, if you assume we'll have a vaccine next year sometime,
and you go back to what I said earlier about the role of serology and evaluating and prioritizing who
should get the vaccine. We do believe there will be a role of testing in '21 for us. And then finally, in terms
of working with those that are developing the vaccine, we are actively in conversations of using our data
in a productive way to recruit patients and some of this is around the vaccine development. But also using
your data to help with the donation of plasma for the country. So good use of our data, which is part of
our strategy again for growth, to use our data, the smart way is a diagnostic information services provider
to help with the pandemic.

Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Sorry to harp on this, but I do want to go back to the guidance. Because when you first updated in early
June, you expected breakeven is slightly positive for the quarter, you obviously ended up at a $42 that

12

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

essentially implies all of the 2Q earnings came in June. So if I just run rate that number for 6 months, I'm
already at in earnings before I even contemplate the over $2 you put up in the first half. So -- and again,
my guess is COVID testing trajectory moves higher. And assuming some continued core recovery, so I'm
still struggling a little bit to understand the offsets or the headwinds what appears a pretty extremely
conservative range, particularly at the lower end. But I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything
else.

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we laid out for you in a pretty detailed fashion, the low end. So you can take a look at those
assumptions, and you can have your own point of view, and that's why we wanted to be very, very clear
about that assumption. So your notion that Q2 earnings were all pretty much in June is spot on. And the
issue with multiplying that x6 with the back half would be a couple of things. One is our base business was
down, exiting the month high single digits at average 15 in June. And the question is, is that sustainable?
Will it take a step back? Will it get worse? We don't know. So certainly, if it were to improve or were to
hold for the whole 6 months, let's say, down 10% versus that 20% assumption on our floor that would
make a material difference for the business. And as I just described, at an 80% drop down, you can do
some of the math, but our COVID -- business was about $2 billion a quarter before COVID, 1,000 basis
points is a pretty difference on revenue and OM.

On the PCR, we share that we're assuming the volumes dropped down in Q4, not because we have any
foreknowledge but because as I said, return to work and back to school will largely be behind us and
because we don't know. So we want to be cautious about putting on a guidance accounts on a level of PCR
testing at this point is unpredictable. Obviously, we go through Q3 and we get better knowledge towards
Q4 and see a need to update that, we would do so. But given how things have moved, Ralph, you want
to be really careful. The other thing is, as I said, we fully expect if we continue to have high levels of
COVID and need this testing that's unpredictable, it could actually be revoked at any time. We want to
be very careful about assumptions on reimbursement for our molecular test. And so at this point, we're
only building in that reimbursement through a 90-day extension since that's been voiced by HHS. And
while we would hope and expect if COVID continues, that, that reimbursement will continue into Q4. That
would make a very significant difference as well, but that is not in either the bottom or the high end of our
current guidance.

Our next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Two questions for you. Back to the pooling option, like I would have assumed a larger multiplier effect for
geographic areas with a low positive testing rates. As you progress into the 3rd quarter, is there a reason
why that can't scale to provide a much large larger multiplier effect? And what would hold it back from
being that, that large of an impact. And the second questions is as you welcome the 2021 and if there's a
decline in COVID testing, both molecular and serology in the U.S., is there any discussions about providing
testing capabilities for other countries that don't have the testing infrastructure?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we start with pooling. So what you mentioned is true that is it's more beneficial areas that have
low prevalence. We've started to ramp up our capacity that will be driven for it and getting some nice
boost in our capacity, which we're planning for, as I mentioned, to get to that 150,000 in a couple of
weeks. So we're going to apply those concepts in our laboratory developed test locations and try to steer
it towards bang for the buck. So we'll push that in. The multiplier is considerable when you have low
prevalence. So that would be very helpful to bringing up our capacity. We'll keep up pushing on it. As far
as testing for non-U.S. geographies, frankly, we are focused entirely for intents and purposes on the U.S.

about it as we said you're dealing with the pandemic in the U.S.

Next, we have Kevin Caliendo from UBS.

Kevin Caliendo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I kind of want to get to the assumption around the vaccine and how to think about this? So if we were
to assume a vaccine becomes available January 1, and there's 1 billion doses or whatever the number
might be. How do you anticipate the vaccine being distributed and administered along with testing? Are
you suggesting that first people would get serology testing to figure out who would need the vaccine? Or
we can imagine that this vaccine is going to be administered quickly to the entire population? So take me
through how you would expect to model out the administration the vaccine along with testing?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, obviously, this is beyond Quest Diagnostics and rationing or prioritizing who should get it and what's
the progression and how you distribute it through -- throughout the United States. But like with other
vaccines, you'd likely give it to the higher risk groups. And the higher-risk groups are those groups
that we actually tested initially higher on the priority list for COVID testing. And so those were with
preexisting condition, they're all be age of 65. And obviously, people that have been compromised with
other respiratory illnesses in the past. So independent of serology and antibody testing, my assumption
would be those at risk groups would be high in the priority list. And then the second priority list would
be everyone else. And if, in fact, you were to test positive for the antibodies, then my sense is there will
be evidence at that point that will suggest that, in fact, you have immunity for a period of time. And the
question will be how much of this would be public policy versus independent choice of whether you want
to have the vaccine or not. That's all speculative on my part, a lot to be determined. First of all, where the
vaccine will come from, when it's going to be available, how much will the U.S. get. And also, this is going
to be, I'm sure, debated throughout the United States as we get into it.

Next, we have Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.

Lisa Christine Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Steve, I just wanted to follow back up on reimbursement. So you've talked about Medicare. Can you talk
about the commercial market? So is the anticipation that the commercial market will just follow Medicare
through the emergency pricing? And what's your anticipation post emergency pricing, should it be rolled
back, number one? And number two, we've heard in the market that some of the health plans are pushing
back on multiple tests done on individuals. What's been your experience so far?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, sure. So first of all, we do have an assumption that commercial rates are aligned with Medicare
rates. And Mark, why don't you just remind everyone what we have in the outlook going forward as far as
our assumptions for reimbursement.

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we -- the emergency use -- the federal emergency expires on July 25, HHS has expressed a view
that they're going to extend that 90 days so we've built that $100 price, which is not our AWR. We don't
fully get $100, but that $100 price into our -- pretty much our full book. And so the commercial -- as we

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

shared previously, the commercial payers pretty much fell in line with the Medicare reimbursement rate.
There's a couple of traditional state Medicaid plans that didn't quite get there. But for the most part, we
get that price from everybody regardless of who they are. And -- so therefore, we would expect that to
continue. So as long as the Medicare rate stays up, it doesn't mean there might be -- it wouldn't be some
pressure, but we would expect the commercial payers to stay in line with that, because, obviously, if it
stays, there's a federal emergency, and it'd be hard to argue then. They should be cutting the rate for a
test that's quite so important. And nonetheless, we will get some pressure. Once we get through that,
where the commercial rates end up, obviously, we will take a position that says it shouldn't be less than
Medicare. We'll be very transparent with what our costs are and the continued importance of that test
even post emergency, and we'll do our best to keep it at the Medicare rate and not something less than
that. But that's still -- Lisa, obviously, still in front of us.

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. As far as policy, payment policy, reimbursement policy, it is evolving. What I'll share is that frequency
policies. First of all, as we all know, you can test negative 1 week and the next week it would be positive.
So therefore, it's quite important that people feel that they should get tested if they've been exposed.
And if, in fact, they believe that they might have some early symptoms. So we're continuing to take that
as the position and I think, by and large, people support that notion. But you have seen physicians taken
opportunity to work programs that employers are moving with. And in many cases, these employees are
self-insured, so sort of a mood issue, what pocket it comes from. But for those fully insured employers,
there is positions by some of the insurers that, that's not included in their health care reimbursement
policies. So therefore it should be paid for by the employers. And then equally with universities and
colleges, students, free on-campus testing is excluded in the reimbursement like a physical would be if
they're going back-to-school or playing sports or going to camp. There's some debate around that.

So I would say, I characterize it, Lisa, is people are debating some of this. We're seeing kind of a growing
trend with some of this. And then also as we evolve, we are trying to understand who should get tested
and who should not get tested. There is even some question of whether after you've been tested positive
for 14 days right now, most people are operating on the protocol that you get retested again. But there
are some views that maybe that second test to verify you're negative is not of great value. And therefore,
this might help reduce the demand that we have on the system right now. So that's been debated as well.
So it's evolving, a lot of discussion. And Mark, anything you'd like to add to reimbursement in general on
COVID?

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

I would just add that we have not had a significant amount, and it would be very few, if any, of denials for
frequency limitation. So while things might evolve, Lisa, to this point, we've not run into issues with the
payers around frequency for the molecular test. And for the return-to-work and back-to-school programs,
we are not taking the risk on those. So we are either arranging client bill where we get paid directly
contractually by a customer or in some cases where they think they have coverage from the payer. We
have a fallback to where we do get a denial, then we have a right to bill the client directly. So we think
we're protecting ourselves from a financial standpoint, and we have not run into headwinds thus far from
the payers on frequency denials.

play versus rapid testing and perhaps there's an opportunity for Quest to play a role, not only in testing,
but managing the testing strategies for employers, cities or companies?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Mark do you want to take the first part of this around payment? I think that was the question.

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'm sorry, Matt, what's your specific question, can you repeat it?

Matthew Richard Larew
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Just -- sure. Just payer mix, how that trended through the quarter in the base business?

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Payer mix did not change materially. The one thing we did see was an increase in uninsured. So
beyond that, I don't think that there was any -- and we rarely see, given our size, we rarely see material
changes of payer mix, and this was no exception. So certainly, the drop in utilization did not impact people
with certain payers more than others. The one thing we did see was more uninsured.

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Matt, on return-to-work programs in University, role of, let's just say, point-of-care devices. We
are looking at all those devices and where they can help us, particularly around surveillance. And what
we're finding for the initial testing, if you will, the gold standard is the PCR test for molecular diagnostic
workup. And then secondly is for serology, our blood-based test is the gold standard. So the sensitivity
and specificity of both those are the best, still to this day. And there are a few devices that are coming
to the marketplace that are offering, we think, an opportunity for us to include that in our services that
we provide to both employers and to university, specifically some of the antigen devices that are coming
to the marketplace. We're looking at those devices and some of the sensitivity is around 85%, which
is lower than our sensitivity. But for surveillance and in combination with possibly serology and just
overall biometric screening of some form, it could be a helpful set of tools for us to manage a population
over time. So we are thinking about how we will include those in our services to employers and also to
universities as they have surveillance for their populations going forward.

Much better, much better, yes.

Brian Gil Tanquilut
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Yes. So how do you think about the strategy in terms of balancing, increasing capacity beyond that
150,000 tests per day versus the uncertainty of not knowing how big this opportunity really could be? And
what are the limiting factors right now that can -- that prevents you from pushing that up to say, 200,000
or 250,000 a day?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Well, first of all, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we are going to push it beyond 150,000. And
we do see capacity -- excuse me, we do see demand going forward that's going to be beyond 150,000.
And we do believe we'll get to a point where our capacity will meet that demand. And so we will get there.
We'll go beyond the 150,000. And the limiting factors are combination of machines. So getting the IVD
test systems and laboratory test equipment. And particularly for a laboratory developed test, it's not
just the platforms -- the PCR platforms but in our setup, there's actually 2 other pieces that you need
to consider it's the extraction. And then second is the liquid handling and it's has been some machine
constraints on us for getting those systems to be able to bring up more and more capacity. But we're
working with all our suppliers to get as much as we can get to bring our capacity and take it beyond the
150,000. The second is just manpower. We're running 24/7. And as I mentioned in my remarks, doing
8.5 million tests over the last 4 months, our teams are working nonstop and remember this is in our
microbiology department that has gone from the back quarter of the laboratory to front and center. And
we have capacity limits around the people and those that are trained adequately to deliver on this. And
then third is just physically, we need to get these systems in place. We need to have the adequate controls
and training in place, and that just takes some time. And then fourth is the reagents. We are rate limited
by how much juice we get to run all our different platforms. And we're working with our suppliers and
getting more. We have had some shortages with some of the suppliers, and that has not helped our ability
to deliver results. And so we're working actively to get them to, first of all, give us more and then secondly
be reliable what they committed delivering against us. I'll also say that everyone is working incredibly
well together, the IVD manufacturers working with the task force, White House working at future ideas
of where we can get more capacity. We're all pushing hard to get more and more capacity. But to answer
your question, those are the rate-limiting factors around what we need to do to get it beyond 150,000,
but we will get it beyond 150,000, and that's where we want to be able to meet the demand we see
particularly as we get into the late August, early September time frame.

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Brian, to be clear, you didn't ask it this directly, but we are not being conservative. We are doing
everything we can. The challenges are not financial, but willingness to spend more capital or for that
matter, operational expense to get things up and running. They're all operational and our ability to get
more equipment and as Steve said, multiple pieces of equipment and to get them operating and to get
the people who are trained to do it, and we are moving as quickly as possible. As we said, we doubled our
capacity from mid-May. We're expecting another 20,000 per day increase from where we are today over
the next several weeks. And then as Steve said, we're going to go beyond that. So there's no hesitancy to
add capacity because of uncertainty of demand. We're doing everything we can to increase our capacity
and certainly to reduce turnaround times.

Maybe just a couple of quick housekeeping first. I know you said that your guidance assumed PCR
volumes decline in 4Q versus 3Q. I'm just curious, can you give us a sense on how much, what you're
expecting for average daily volume in PCR in 4Q? That's implicit in your guidance assumption?

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Eric, I'm sure you can appreciate that. It's not as if we have a point estimate forecast for every
number within that range or even the high-end range because we've got multiple factors that can move
things material. Certainly, as you mentioned, the base volume decline or improvement relative to our
assumptions is very material to the outcome and then that PCR volume is very, very material as well. And
then finally, the reimbursement rate beyond the 90-day extension is very, very important. So there's multi
variables. So I really can't answer directly on specific number because we're running scenario planning
-- but I would tell you that at this point, we have a significant reduction in Q4 demand to get to these
guidance numbers. So it's not small. It's fairly significant. And again, not because we know that's what's
going to happen, but just given the uncertainty of the volumes and the knowledge that the return-to-work
and back-to-school volumes would largely be go on by Q4.

Next, we have Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

2 questions. So the first one being, can you give a little bit of color on some of the rebounds in the
different categories? And then you noted some softening in July. So can you talk about what you sort of
see in oncology versus Quinchem versus pathology, just to give us a flavor on how you're seeing sort of
the pickups?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So let me characterize it this way. Primary care, I'll put OBGYNs in that as well. We've seen a nice
rebound as physicians have opened back up their offices and called back some of their patients. In some
cases, they have extended hours. So we've seen a nice bounce back on that piece so far our demand.
Secondly is we are seeing some nice recovery in some of those procedures that might have been pent-up
and our pathology tissues have actually rebounded in a good way. We're not sure it's entirely sustainable
because there might be -- some of this is reacted to the pent-up demand that is coming back to us that
we lost in April and May and certainly see the June that will come into the summer. And that's why when
we talk about outlook, we are cautious to make sure that we're not taking the June run rate as a run rate
forever in the summer. We actually might see some slowdown related to that being absorbed if you will
through the system, and then we'll get to the run rate that we should expect for a reasonable period of
time in Q3.

And then some of our other businesses, we have our life insurance business. Frankly, that's down
considerably. We haven't seen a big recovery there or preemployment drug testing business is starting
to come back as employers start to hire people, but it's down conservatively versus '19. Our employer
population health business, where we do wellness programs for employers is down considerably. Many of
those events have been canceled. So I would say it's really a wide variation with the best being primary
care and the worst being those that are tied to the economy and in general, constraints around normal
programs like for life insurance and wellness and hiring people. So Mark anything you'd like to add to that?

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would just add that most of our base business has come back proportionately, as Steve said,
oncology has really picked up recently over the last couple of weeks. We'll see how much of that was
deferred pent up demand. But the 1 category, it's not just in preemployment, but prescription drug

monitoring. So the whole drug testing area that's lagged a little bit some of the other franchises within the
base business, not just in our employer business.

Operator

And our last question comes from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI.

Michael Anthony Newshel
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And maybe just a follow-up on pooling. Is there a specific positivity rate threshold you have in mind where
pooling makes sense in a particular state and region? And I know you get full reimbursement for each
specimen, but how much does pooling change your cost structure? Is there a big incremental margin
difference versus testing single specimens?

Stephen H. Rusckowski
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So think about the best is obviously the lowest and where we pool and we could put 4 specimens in
a well, quadruples throughput per batch, if you will. And if there's 0 positives then you get it all. Where
you have positives within that run, you have to test those that whole well and that obviously starts to
eat into the productivity gain. So the best is lower than 2%. We actually have a number of states and
geographies that are in that range. Actually, right now, the Northeast is doing quite well. We hope that is
sustained. And then as you start to go up to high single digits, it starts to lose its effectiveness because of
all the retesting you need to do. So clearly, less than 5% is in the sweet spot and greater than 5% starts
to get marginally worth it. But we have fluent -- we feel like it pooling. Again, the pooling is applied to our
laboratory developed tests. It's a piece of our capacity. It's going to give us more capacity to get us to that
150,000 and also we believe beyond. But we're not just doing pooling to get more capacity. We're adding
new systems, and processes and people everything we talked about earlier. So it'll give us some of the
capacity, but there's other things we're doing as well.

Mark J. Guinan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Just a reminder that pooling is only currently possible on our LDT. And so therefore, it's not as if it's
going to be an expander across our whole network and we can prioritize low prevalence areas for that
LDT to a certain extent or to a large extent. And to the Steve's point, we're going to target the areas that
currently have low positivity rates. But the biggest benefit is while we do get cost -- some cost savings
on reagents when you can do 4 samples at once instead of a single one. Even despite some retesting,
it's really the benefit of the capacity. So being able to serve more people with the same equipment, more
patients is really the benefit, much larger, although there is a -- certainly a cost of sales savings that
comes with pooling.
