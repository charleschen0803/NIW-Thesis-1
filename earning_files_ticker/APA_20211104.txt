Presentation

Operator

Good day. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the APA Corporation's Third Quarter 2021 Results
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of
Investor Relations. The floor is yours.

Gary Thomas Clark
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Third Quarter 2021 Financial and
Operational Results Conference Call.

We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive
Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and 2021 outlook. Also on the
call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development;
Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of
Operations.

Our prepared remarks will be approximately 18 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted
for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our
third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website
at investor.apacorp.com.

Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences
between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures
can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting
practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest
in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.

Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and
assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the
supplemental information on our website.

And with that, I will turn the call over to John.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Good morning and thank you for joining us.

Our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt
reduction. With the significant recent strides in that regard and a favorable outlook for continued free cash
flow generation, we are in a position today to announce some material changes in our capital investment
plans and use of free cash flow.

First, we are moving toward a capital budget that will sustain or slightly grow global production volumes.
This is being accomplished through a gradual ramp in activity over the next few quarters, primarily in
Egypt where we are anticipating PSC modernization terms will be approved by year-end, but also in the
onshore U.S.

Second, we are committing to a significant increase in cash return to shareholders. While a stronger
commodity price environment has accelerated progress on the balance sheet, it's the quality and cash flow
generating capacity of our core operating areas through a range of commodity price environments that are
enabling our new capital return framework.

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

We have a substantial inventory of quality drilling opportunities throughout our portfolio. In addition to
Egypt, which now has the deepest inventory in more than a decade, we also have significant potential
in our onshore U.S. portfolio, primarily in the Southern Midland Basin, Alpine High and Austin Chalk. In
this price environment, there are many compelling drilling opportunities that should be funded, and we
anticipate adding a fourth onshore U.S. rig in 2022.

With regard to our new capital return framework, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of
our free cash flow to shareholders. This begins with our base dividend, which in September we announced
would increase to an annualized rate of $0.25 per share. Yesterday, we announced a doubling of that rate
to $0.50 per share.

In early October, we took the more significant step of initiating a share repurchase program. Through
October 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares and expect to continue returning capital in this
manner through the fourth quarter and into 2022. Our commitment is to return at least 60% of free cash
flow to shareholders and we will exceed this amount in the current quarter. We believe that APA currently
offers one of the highest free cash flow yields in our peer group, and that this framework delivers an
attractive and highly competitive return to our shareholders.

Turning now to the third quarter results and highlights. Through a combination of strong commodity
prices, capital and cost discipline and good well performance, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted
EBITDA, making it our strongest quarter of the year thus far. We anticipate fourth quarter will be even
stronger. U.S. production exceeded guidance in the third quarter as we continue to see good performance
in the Permian oil plays, Alpine High and the Austin Chalk.

Internationally, production was a bit below guidance as we experienced some extended maintenance
turnarounds and compressor outages in the North Sea and lower volumes in Egypt associated with the
impact of strengthening oil prices on our production-sharing contracts. We expect gross production in both
the U.K. and Egypt will increase in the fourth quarter.

In the U.S., we placed a total of 10 wells online during the quarter. This included 9 wells in the Southern
Midland Basin, 3 of which were 3 miles in length. At Alpine High, no new wells were placed on production
during the quarter, but performance from this year's DUC completions as well as the underlying base
production volumes continue to exceed expectations.

In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled 4 operated wells earlier this year, 2 of which are on production.
We recently added a third rig in the U.S., which will be used to continue the delineation of our Austin Chalk
acreage position. We have now gathered a substantial amount of data in this play that indicates returns
will compete with other quality portfolio opportunities. Dave Pursell can provide more details around the
Austin Chalk during the Q&A.

Turning to international operations. In Egypt, gross production has begun to turn higher, putting us on a
good trajectory as we enter 2022. In anticipation of modernized PSC terms, we recently increased our rig
count to 11. We will likely add more rigs in 2022 as modernized terms would return Egypt to being the
most attractive investment opportunity within our portfolio.

In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig and 1 platform crew. As expected, production was
up modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as we continued to work through both
planned and unplanned maintenance downtime.

On the drilling front, we recently TD-ed Storr-2 development well, which we plan to place online in
January. While one of the primary objectives in this well was wet, we encountered more than 300 feet of
net pay in other targets, which we are projecting will IP around 20 million cubic feet per day of gas and
2,500 barrels per day of condensate. Our 59% working interest in this well provides good leverage to what
should be robust North Sea natural gas and condensate prices over the coming months.

In Block 58 offshore Suriname, our partner, Total, is currently running 2 rigs, one of which is conducting a
flow test at Sapakara South and the other is drilling the Bonboni exploration well in the northern portion of
the block. These operations are still ongoing and the data we collect will help inform the next steps in the
Block 58 appraisal and exploration programs.

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

On Block 53, we are finalizing plans for our next exploration well location with partners PETRONAS and
CEPSA. The Noble Gerry de Souza drillship is scheduled to commence drilling this well in the first quarter.
The plan is to drill 1 well in Block 53 in 2022, but we have an option on the drillship for 2 additional wells if
warranted.

Before closing, I want to comment on the charge we took this quarter related to the Gulf of Mexico
properties we sold to Fieldwood in 2013. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have
independently assessed the situation and have elected to book the contingent liability that you saw in our
press release. Steve will walk you through some of the details.

In closing, I'd like to make a few remarks about the progress we are making on the ESG front. We recently
announced that we have eliminated all routine flaring in U.S. operations. This was an ambitious goal that
we set at the beginning of the year and achieved 3 months ahead of schedule. Additionally, through the
end of the third quarter, flaring intensity in the U.S. was only 0.38%, significantly below our target of less
than 1%. Our global safety performance has also been strong. We have delivered a 35% improvement in
our total recordable incident rate compared to this time last year.

We have also progressed a number of important initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion within the
organization and that enhance the health and well-being of our employees. In October, we published our
2021 Sustainability Report, which I hope you will review for a more in-depth look at our ESG philosophy,
performance, initiatives and success stories. Finally, we are in the process of establishing some very
rigorous short-, medium- and long-term ESG goals, which will include further efforts on GHG and methane
emissions, and we look forward to discussing these in the near future.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our third
quarter results and outlook.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, John.

In my prepared remarks this morning, I'll make some additional comments on our third quarter
performance, provide a bit more color on the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, review aspects of Altus
Midstream's recently announced combination with EagleClaw, and provide some more context around our
free cash flow outlook and capital framework.

As noted in our news release yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation
reported a third quarter 2021 consolidated loss of $113 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. These
results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding the impact of the Fieldwood-
related contingent liability, a loss on extinguishment of debt, a charge for tax-related valuation allowance,
and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $372 million or $0.98 per
share.

Most of our financial results were in line with or better than guidance this quarter. Upstream capital
investment was considerably below guidance, primarily due to the timing of infrastructure spending in
Egypt and lower exploration costs in Suriname. Our teams have done a good job holding the line on
capital and LOE despite service cost inflation, and we expect these will finish the year at or below our
original 2021 guidance. G&A was also below guidance this quarter, mostly due to the timing of some costs,
which we now expect to be incurred in the fourth quarter.

I'd like to provide a bit more color now on the Fieldwood ARO situation. Through Fieldwood's most recent
bankruptcy process, we had to rely on third-party estimates of the remaining net abandonment obligations
related to our legacy properties. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have conducted
our own evaluations.

Based on that work, it appears the combination of the various financial security packages and the
anticipated future net cash flows from the properties will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining
abandonment obligations. Accounting rules require that the entire undiscounted contingent obligation

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

and the offsetting undiscounted value of the financial security will be brought onto our books. These are
recorded independently as a liability and an asset without netting them against one another.

Accordingly, in the third quarter, we brought on to our books the anticipated net ARO obligation of $1.2
billion. We also recorded the offsetting value of the financial security in the amount of $740 million.

As a reminder, the financial security includes a funded abandonment trust, letters of credit and surety
bonds. As abandonment activity occurs, it will be funded first by the free cash flows currently being
generated by the legacy properties. To the extent these cash flows are insufficient, Apache Corporation
will be required to fund the activity and will be reimbursed through the financial security. Only after
the operating cash flows and financial security packages are fully depleted will Apache Corporation be
obligated to fund the activity without a source of reimbursement. The undiscounted net liability is $446
million, and we anticipate it will be at least 2026 before Apache incurs costs in excess of the available
financial security.

A few weeks ago, our majority owned midstream company, Altus, announced that it will combine with
the parent company of EagleClaw Midstream to form the largest integrated midstream company in the
Delaware Basin. We considered a wide range of strategic options for Altus for more than a year. Ultimately,
we determined that this transaction would allow all Altus shareholders to reposition equity holdings into
a pro forma company with the best combination of scale, synergies, asset quality and attractive growth
opportunities. The transaction would also preserve the $6 per share annual cash dividend for the public
shareholders and provide near-term optionality for APA to monetize a meaningful portion of our current
position.

Such a secondary sale would benefit the combined company by improving the public float. It would also
provide APA with cash flow, a portion of which would be deployed in the Alpine High activity, thereby
enhancing dedicated sources of revenue for the company.

Reducing our ownership interest in Altus to a minority position provides a number of benefits for APA as
well, including simplification of our financial reporting, increased comparability with our upstream-only
peers, and improved leverage metrics upon deconsolidation of $1.3 billion of debt and preferred equity
as of September 30. As we proceed toward closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2022, we
will provide further detail around the accounting treatment and the financial statement impacts of this
transaction.

With respect to portfolio management more generally, as we build the capital investment program to a
level capable of sustaining or slightly growing production, you will see increasing activity in our core asset
areas, primarily in the U.S. onshore and in Egypt. This will demonstrate both the quality and running
room in our core assets as well as the need for a more accelerated pace of noncore asset divestments.
As part of that, in 2022, we anticipate a minimum of $500 million of further noncore U.S. onshore asset
divestments.

I'd like to close by reiterating some of John's comments regarding APA's free cash flow generation capacity
and its anticipated uses. As always, there can be some confusion around a term like free cash flow, so we
want to be clear what it means at APA. You will find our definition of free cash flow in our financial and
operational supplement, which we publish with every quarterly earnings report.

In the fourth quarter of this year at current strip pricing, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess
of $600 million, which would result in full year 2021 free cash flow of around $2 billion. Under our new
capital return framework, a minimum of 60% of this free cash flow would go to ordinary dividends and
share repurchases. And as John indicated, we expect to exceed the 60% framework in the current quarter.

Looking ahead to next year, we currently contemplate a capital budget of around $1.5 billion. This would
consist of roughly $1.3 billion for development and $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities,
mostly in Suriname. As we've indicated, we believe the planned level of activity would put our global
total BOE production on a sustaining to slightly growing long-term trajectory. This excludes any future
production contribution from Suriname.

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

The near-term allocation of capital would likely be biased to increasing oil production, which would
offset declining gas and NGL production. That said, the commodity price environment is very active,
and we have considerable flexibility within our portfolio to redirect capital as appropriate. Based on this
investment level, we anticipate free cash flow in 2022 would again be in the neighborhood of $2 billion
prior to any benefits of Egypt PSC modernization. Finally, I would like to caveat all of this with, as is
customary, the final plan for 2022 will be reviewed in the fourth quarter call in February.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] You have your first question coming from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of
America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just checking, John. Can you hear me okay?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Phone company has been giving me some problems. John, I'm going to start with Egypt, if I may. I'm sure
you saw the report we put out a month or so ago. One of your smaller peers has been a little bit more
transparent on the potential changes in terms from the PSC modernization. So I wonder if conceptually
you could walk us through how you see the moving parts as it relates to increased profit oil and in
particular, the potential for legacy stranded capital cost recovery? If you could put some, maybe a range of
potential impacts on you assuming similar terms applied.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, Doug, it's a great question. And you know from our perspective, we're the largest onshore producer
in Egypt. You've hit on some of the key points. We've made the decision not to give more color on that
until it's finalized. I will tell you that the modernized PSC has recently been approved by the cabinet and
it has moved on to parliament. So we're getting close and we expect that, everything is on track for a
year-end approval. But in terms of any more color, you've done a good piece of work out there. And I'll let
Steve comment on a couple of things.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Doug, the thing I would add to that, based on your work, you've demonstrated you understand how
the PSCs work. The backlog, while we haven't indicated exactly how much that is, the mechanism to
recover that is that it is, the backlog would be, and we've shared this publicly already. The backlog would
be recovered over a 5-year period on a quarterly basis. And that backlog would roll into the other costs
for cost recovery. So it is all subject, the sum of all of that is subject to the 40% limit on cost recovery
barrels.

The benefit, the real benefit as you've noted in your write-up, is that by aggregating all of these into
a single bucket for cost recovery purposes, you don't end up with stranded costs in any of the smaller
buckets. And that will allow us to get this backlog of costs recovered as well, especially in this price
environment.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Steve, I know you don't want to give specifics. But in my note, I did suggest the potential that the impact
could be several hundred million dollars plus. Would you push back on that or give some affirmation that
we're in the ballpark?

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Doug, I think I need to be really careful about that. So I think we won't comment on it at this point in
time.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. I understand. Let me move on very quickly to my second question, which is understandably
Suriname. You've got a well test. I guess you drilled out the plugs about 3.5 weeks ago, John. I guess
I'm a little surprised that you're not ready to give us some updates there or on Bonboni, where our guys
on the ground are suggesting that you're already in the formation there. So I'm just wondering if you
can offer any color around those 2 pieces of potential news flow that we expect, I guess, in the coming
months. And I'll leave it there.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Great question, Doug, and I'll address Sapakara South first. Number one, you can appreciate that there's
multiple phases of a flow test that you go through. And sometimes even more important than the flow
period is the buildup and the pressure response and all of those things. So it's early. I'll just tell you, save
your question. I'm not in a position to reveal anything on it today. But hold your question and we'll be able
to respond in the near future.

So as we turn to Bonboni, yes, Total's got 2 rigs. The Developer is at Sapakara South. The Valiant is at
Bonboni. I'll remind everybody, it's a 45-kilometer step-out to the north. It is a key well. And I think the
prospectivity up there will inform the northern portion of the block as well as have some implications on
Block 53. So once again, I'm not in a position to provide any update, but I'd just say, stay tuned, right?
And we'll be in a position to update you when we can.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Awesome.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

John, nice update on the shareholder return. I was going to ask one thing around that. Just your thoughts,
I don't know, either you or the company's sort of personal thoughts on something about doing more of a
variable versus a buyback. I mean, obviously, your stock appears to me on many levels quite cheap here.
So I'm just wondering how you think about the 2 alternatives.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Neal, I mean, I guess I'll start out and just on the framework. I'll just give a few comments here. It
really should not come as a surprise that anybody that's engaged with us over the last several years when
we've been on the road and in our meetings, Steve and I have been really clear that a quality E&P needs
to have a strong balance sheet. You need to have a sustaining to low-growth profile, multiple years of
inventory but not too many years of inventory. And we should be throwing off the majority of our free cash
flow to shareholders.

We've had a lot of work to do that the volatile pricing environment has at times impacted. But we're in a
position where we're finally here. If you look at the framework, we believe you want to do a nice mix. You
need a competitive dividend.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

We're not big fans of the variable dividend, I mean, in terms of how that works. And I think with where
our share price is, especially today is, as cheap as it is, that, that would be the primary means of how
we'd look at it. Steve, any more specifics you want to provide?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sorry about that. Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context
around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the
history of where we've been.

I think if you just step back and think about the industry, it wasn't too long ago that the industry was all
about growth and really little or no returns to shareholders. And more recently, we've finally gotten to
where it's about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks. And
I think the big step right now is to figure out, well, what's the right return framework? And I'd say, it's
kind of early days for the industry in general, and we're all kind of figuring that out now.

The returns frameworks right now are migrating towards a percent of free cash flow. And I think that's
probably good. The ranges out there are pretty broad. I see ranges from 25% all the way up to 75%. And
we're probably going to find a sweet spot in there, and I think it's starting to migrate towards somewhere
around 50% as an industry.

For APA specifically, I mean, we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the
company with the debt tender this fall. And that was 100% focused on debt reduction. We know there's
more to do on the balance sheet, and we'll get to that.

And to be clear, we still want to get to investment grade. But that can take some time, and that's okay.
We do have to just recognize that shareholders are pretty important, too. And we need to find a balance in
returns to shareholders, while at the same time continuing to improve the balance sheet.

And the industry has chosen 50% because they're kind of migrating toward that. We chose 60%. We think
this is the right balance for APA. We have a quality diversified portfolio. It's exposed to a good range of
commodity price and geographic mix. It's capable of sustaining free cash flow for many, many years. And
remember, free cash flow, the basis for the returns calculation, is after capital spending.

So we've been improving the balance sheet. We can still continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Up to
40% still available for other uses, including debt reduction. But I'd say in the near term, we certainly have
a bias for dividends and buybacks.

And remember also, we did talk about, in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're going
to probably pick up the pace on noncore asset sales. And that's also a source of funds for continuing to
strengthen the balance sheet, but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well. So we feel
pretty good about that balance in the 60% level.

As John indicated, we're not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time. We'll continue to
look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those. I think the variable dividend needs
to be in general a smaller piece.

And just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks, for now, we're just happy to lean into buybacks.
We believe our share price is too low. We've been discounting for several months now greater than
25% free cash flow yield. It's one of the highest in the peer group. We don't believe our base cash flow
generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market. And we need to continue to work on that.
We know that.

But for now, the share price is just too low, so we'll continue with leaning in on the buybacks. We know
we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield. And it needs to be competitive against other E&Ps
as well as the broader market. And I think that's probably higher than what we see as the typical 2%
ordinary dividend yield we see today.

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

And we'll figure that out. It's about getting to a balance around what's the right strength of balance sheet.
That certainly is trending to something stronger, but also what price are we going to base all of that on.
Because I think it's a valid question as to what we all think mid-cycle price is now.

So we'll get on with raising the dividend as well. We just need to be thoughtful about that. It was only 18
months ago that we cut the dividend by 90%, and that was a pretty painful process. We're going to make
sure we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again. Probably more
than you asked us for, but I wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns
framework.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

No. I appreciate it. I think what you said about the, both said about the shareholder return makes a lot
of or about the share buyback makes sense. And one just quick follow-up, John. Just thoughts on future
or I'd say near term, medium-term Alpine High activity given not only the strong natural gas prices post
the Altus deal and given that Cheniere long-term supply contract agreement seems to be getting closer to
fruition. So given all of that, maybe what you could say about Alpine High?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean, when you look at our U.S. program, Neal, we've got 2 rigs in the Southern Midland Basin.
We picked up another one that's in the Chalk now. We've indicated we will be adding another rig, probably
middle of next year, which would put us 3. That will go to Permian.

And quite frankly then, we envision those rigs kind of working those assets in tandem. We're in pad
drilling. You'll be seeing those move. And with the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a
rig, drill pads and see production, your short-term windows are kind of, we're benefiting from those right
now at Alpine High with the DUCs that we did earlier, right?

So I think you're going to see a very well-thought-out, efficient capital program in the U.S., where
we're moving those rigs around those plays based on the, how we've laid the inventory out and the
infrastructure so we can maximize those returns. But there is a portion of the Altus piece if we sell down
all those shares that we do put in there. But it will all fit into our framework. So it's nice to have quality
inventory and options because then we can just really plan it out and be thoughtful. But you'll see activity
across our Permian next year in a very thoughtful way.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla from Stifel.

Michael Stephen Scialla
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

See what the next steps would be at Keskesi and Kwaskwasi. Is the issue with both appraisals there just
lack of reservoir quality sands? As you stepped out, did you just step out too far on the edge, so you need
to move back toward the discoveries with the next appraisals or is it more complicated than that?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

No, Mike. It's a good question. I will tell you that at Keskesi, it was a big step-out. We knew it looked a
little different in terms of the signature, so we knew there was more risk to it. But there is work to do at
Keskesi, in closer. But I think from the priorities, it will all be kind of put into. As you're working across all
the discoveries and the appraisal program, we're kind of integrating data. We prioritize with the appraisal
things that would be, what I'll call, lower GOR, black oil that you could potentially fast track. And so we're
working those in a queue based on the learnings and kind of integrating everything in. Some of that will
come to one of the reasons why Krabdagoe is the next exploration well. It's in the neighborhood and we
like the way it looks. So I think it's all part of an integrated plan.

Michael Stephen Scialla
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay, helpful. And maybe just to follow up on Neal's question. Can you talk about that decision to put the
third rig in the Chalk versus the Midland or Alpine High? And Steve mentioned a plan to add a fourth rig
next year. Any early preview on where that might land? And I guess any possibility of going beyond 4 rigs
in the U.S. next year?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. This is Dave Pursell. It's a good question. So remember on the Chalk, we talked about drilling a
handful of wells in our Brazos County acreage position, one, because we're trying to maintain optionality.
We've had significant experience a little bit to the west in the Washington County area. And we had a
decent acreage position put together and wanted to hold it together, and we like what we've seen so far.
It's consistent with the geology we've seen in Washington County and well results. And so we really just
want to leverage that experience. We liked what we saw and felt like it was time to put a rig there and
continue to progress that position.

The thing to remember, it's near infrastructure. There's a lot of pipe and infrastructure in the area. It's less
than 100 miles from Houston Ship Channel. So we're getting Henry Hub pricing and LLS pricing for the
crude. The GORs are a little bit higher than what you typically see in the Permian. So there's a little bit of
a gas component there too, which we like in these markets. So for us, it was a pretty easy decision on the
Chalk.

The extra rig we talked about, the incremental rig in the middle of 2022, I think it's important to point out
first of all that as we think about adding another rig, it's harder to stand up a rig quickly. It's a couple of
quarters to, from the time you make that decision until the time you're turning to the right just because of
long lead items and supply chain issues and to make sure that we have everything we need to keep that
rig running.

I think John highlighted that there's a lot to do in the Permian. We have 2 rigs in the Southern Midland
Basin. We have a lot of development inventory that we're not getting to, which includes Alpine High. And
we have a lot of good opportunities for that rig, and we'll post you on those in February. But you can
imagine that Alpine would be on that list of places we'd be looking to drill next year.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

And to be clear, there will be no fifth rig in the onshore U.S. next year.

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. Yes. Thank you, Steve.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Just a question following up on the Austin Chalk and the Alpine High. How do you think longer term about
the balance of gas-directed drilling versus oil-directed drilling? Any thoughts there?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes, Bob. I think the beauty of a diverse portfolio is we have the ability to flex that. And so I'm going to
give you a nonanswer because it really depends on where commodity markets go. We're obviously, we've

got a very constructive crude market and a gas market that's becoming more constructive. We'd like to
see the back end of the gas curve strengthen a little bit from here. But again, with the diverse portfolio,
both diverse in the Permian and diverse globally, we have the ability to flex and move and take advantage
of commodity markets across the globe. So I'll leave it at that, but we're watching the forward curve on
gas, let's just leave it at that.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. Perfectly clear. If we're traveling the globe, can you talk about inflation and sort of what you're
baking in domestically where you might be seeing something a bit higher versus maybe some of the
international assets? What's baked into that sort of CapEx guide in terms of inflation?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Bob. I mean, you look today and it's the commodities, right? I mean, steel is up. Where we've got
fuel, your power cost, your people costs, I mean. But it's really steel and people is how we frame it. And
we have factored some of that into that capital number as we look at our programs. I mean, we try to get
ahead on the purchases. And so you get into the middle of '22, it is baked into our capital numbers.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Any difference domestically versus internationally? And is there a number you'd hazard to throw out?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

No. I mean, I think you can look at those numbers and easily you get into the, I mean, 15%, 20% number
easily, in some places even higher, but not a lot of difference between the 2. You just don't have, I mean,
the nice thing about a place like Egypt, there's not as much competition for rig adds and things. And so
it's probably easier to pick up rigs in Egypt than I would say in the U.S. just because, I take you back to
2014, we were running 28 rigs there. So it's not like we're going up to a level where we've got to bring
new equipment in and those sorts of things. I don't know, Dave, any more specific you want to say?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. The only thing I'd add is, if you think about the type of drilling that we do in Egypt, it's vertical wells.
It's more commodity drilling compared to what we're doing in the Permian, where a lot of the well cost is
really on the completion side. So just less, I think John hit it, there's less inflation in Egypt. And it's really
just because of the type of wells that we tend to drill kind of day in and day out.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

The other thing I would add, Bob, is some of the targeted divestments have been on our higher water cut
Central Basin Platform properties where we're burning more energy and moving more fluid. And those
types of things are helping our numbers, too, right, in terms of what we're targeting. So there's, we're
trying to be really smart about the portfolio and factoring all those in.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Great. That makes sense.

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on the stock buyback program here. I guess high level, you guys talked about
roughly, I guess, $2 billion of free cash flow. I know there's some dividend here, but 60% to the buyback.
I mean, that certainly could imply kind of north of $1 billion on the buyback. And just doing our math, that
certainly seems to be a very large percentage of your shares outstanding currently, kind of approaching
15%, upwards of that maybe in 1 year next year. Just wanted to get a sense of, do you guys think that a
number of that size is roughly correct? And is it feasible to buy back that much stock?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Well, if the share price stays roughly where it is, then that will be the outcome, yes, and if oil prices stay
where they are.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Right. Okay. And just on...

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think it is feasible. Yes.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just wanted to follow up on the Austin Chalk here. So obviously, at this point, you've
dedicated a rig. I guess in your slide deck, you kind of talked about one well result looked very strong.
Presumably, there's probably more than that in terms of results that maybe you guys have seen out there.
I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more color in terms of inventory, kind of areal extent of
where you guys have drilled. Is there kind of an acreage number you think is a sweet spot out there for
you that would kind of give you just a number of years of inventory? And maybe just more color about
what that rig is doing. Is it all development work? Is there going to be a mix of some exploration in there?
Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color about what the one rig is doing and what you've seen so
far?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. One comment from me is, not only do we have the operated rig, but we're also a non-op in some of
Magnolia's operations. So there's quite a bit of data. Dave, I'll let you jump in.

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. Leo, it's a good question. On the Brazos County side, we haven't really talked yet about the size of
this. But there's some, I wouldn't call it exploration, but there's some additional delineation work we're
doing to see kind of how big this could be. But when we look at it, there's easily over 5 rig years' worth
of development to do in this one spot so. And again, we're leveraging a lot of our knowledge on the work
we've done over in the Washington County area as operator. And as John suggested, a fairly significant
non-op position. So we'll leave it at that.

Next is from John Freeman from Raymond James.

I wanted to follow up on Alpine High, which I'm sure you would have, a couple of quarters ago, I don't
think we would have realized we'd be having multiple questions on Alpine High, but obviously a lot of
things have changed. And so I guess when I sort of look at Alpine High and what gas, NGL prices have
done and then following up on the recent Altus-EagleClaw deal with those processing, gathering where it's
gotten a lot more attractive. And then I know that you've done some stuff on sort of wider spacing than
you used to do there as well. I'm just, I'm curious as it sounds pretty likely that, that fourth rig will go to
Alpine High. If there might be some plan to get an update on sort of the economic model for Alpine High
because it has been quite a while since we've seen it.

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes, John, this is Dave. Look for that as we get into 2022 and really kind of hone in on where that
additional rig's going to focus. But you're right. I mean, it's not just gas price and cost structure. We've
done some things on performance on some of the DUCs with spacing as well as frac design. And some
of those wells are in the public domain. And the results are very, very good, certainly exceeded our
expectations. So there's a number of factors that would kind of drive us to really focus on Alpine as well as
some of the other opportunities out there.

John Christopher Freeman
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just a follow-up question on Egypt. So if I heard you right, John, it sounded like the 11
rigs was going to go higher post the modernization getting completed, if I heard that right. And obviously,
it's been a while since we've been at this sort of an activity set. So Egypt sort of until at least Suriname
gets to a point where it's at first oil, Egypt kind of becomes the growth driver for the company. And I'm
just, I guess I'm just sort of curious when we think historically have been sort of like an 8-rig program or
so and kind of keep production roughly flat. If we go 11 rigs plus, is this sort of like a double-digit-type
growing asset? Just I guess any additional color how you're thinking about Egypt.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean, clearly, we've been gradually ramping, right? We went from 5 or we started the year around
5 rigs. We went to 8. Now we're at 11. The plan would be to go up another step. I don't see us going back,
needing to go back to where we once were in the mid-20 range. But it will, it's going to turn the corner.
We've been slightly underinvesting in Egypt for quite a number of years. And it definitely will turn the
trajectory the other way, which is what Egypt wants, and quite frankly part of the overall win-win that's in
this for Egypt and APA.

John Christopher Freeman

Got it. I appreciate it.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Michael Scialla from Stifel.

Michael Stephen Scialla
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Actually, John just asked my 2 follow-up questions, but I'll ask one more. The asset retirement liability
being put back to you with those Gulf of Mexico assets. Does Fieldwood continue to operate there? And do
you have any input on what they do there?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

APA CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

No. Those assets came out of Fieldwood. So the legacy Fieldwood company is now a company called
QuarterNorth. And they don't own the old Fieldwood assets that Apache had sold to them. Those
came out and went into an entity that we now call GOM Shelf. There is a person that's kind of contract
managing those assets because there are assets that are still producing. The contract today is in place
with QuarterNorth, the old Fieldwood organization, to operate those assets for us. And we'll continue to
evaluate whether that's the best long-term situation.

Michael Stephen Scialla
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Is there any thought on just taking over or could you potentially take over operations there, would you
want? I mean, if you've got all the liability, would it make sense to operate it yourself?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Well, we'd have to ask the lawyers that of whether we can operate those assets or not. I believe there
are some issues with us being able to operate them. But I doubt that we would take over operatorship of
those assets at this point in time. The nature of the assets there, they're a large inventory of properties
that came out of Fieldwood. A number of them are in abandonment activity today. And a number of them,
a smaller number of them are operating and still generating free cash flow.

And I won't go through the details unless somebody wants me to. But we booked a net $1.2 billion
liability on our balance sheet. That's the gross abandonment obligation less the free cash flows that we
see coming out of those assets for their remaining life. And then we also booked on the asset side of
our balance sheet $740 million of various forms of financial security that we have in place to fund that
abandonment obligation. So a net liability on our part, a net obligation of about $450 million.

That obligation, we won't actually start funding anything on that obligation until 2026 at the soonest in
terms of costs that could be incurred that we wouldn't have any form of reimbursement for. And then that
would carry over for about 5 or 6 years after 2026 in terms of that situation. The present value of all of
those costs today are about $250 million because we had to book an undiscounted number of the $450
million.

The other thing I just might comment on is that, the way we went about doing the work, because we only
got access to the raw data behind all of this in August and we've been pouring through that since we got
that. We've looked hard at the abandonment costs. And we've looked, the second priority was to look at
the operating assets and the cash flow from the PDPs on those. And then the third priority was to look at
capital investment opportunities because any assets like these are going to have up-hole recompletion
opportunities and things like that. That was the third priority. And we really haven't gotten through all of
those. There are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities. We got to the ones that we thought
were the highest priorities, seemed like the best opportunities. And so those are included in the free cash
flows.

But we think there are more. We think that there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead
costs in the PDPs. And we believe there are probably more opportunities on the investment side that
we just haven't been able to get to yet. So we'll be, you should be watching for those over the coming
quarters. And that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that $450 million liability down over time. And
that would also decrease obviously the present value of that opportunity.

Michael Stephen Scialla
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Thanks for the detail on that, Steve. One more, you had mentioned, Steve, about the divestitures you plan
next year. I know you guys don't want to give detail on that. But I'm just curious, can you speak broadly
as to what assets might be put in that divestiture bucket? I'm assuming they're on the domestic side and
outside of your kind of 3 core areas or core areas and that intersection.

higher water cut, later life things. Things we've had in the portfolio for a long, long time, what I call some

You have your last question coming from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Sorry for double dipping today, but I had a couple of things I wanted some clarification on after I queued
up again. The first one is on the buyback. I think I missed the comment, and I'll ask the question like this.
When you take disposals potentially into account as well as, I guess you've already dealt with the Egyptian
thing as it relates to cash flow. Is there an upward limit on how aggressive you would expect to be with
the buybacks in absolute terms?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

No.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Simple enough. And my follow-up is just a question.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

So just to give a bit of color on that, Doug. I think, again, I think our shares are trading at a pretty
meaningful discount today. They have improved over the last month or so. And that, no doubt, is part of
the purpose of the buyback. But we believe they're still trading at a meaningful discount relative to the
price environment we find ourselves in. And we just think that's, for long-term shareholders, that's one
of the better investment opportunities we can make. And so we'll continue doing that as long as the free
cash flow holds up. So that's why we say it's a minimum of 60%.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Steve, the $500 million, does that go to the balance sheet or does that go to buybacks as well? Because
that's not technically operating cash flow.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We're just going to remain noncommittal on what the buybacks and for that matter, the other 40%
can go to. I mean, the disposal proceeds and the other 40% of free cash flow because, yes, we'll deal
with that as it occurs. It could go to balance sheet strengthening. It could go to more buybacks. It could
raise the dividend quicker. We've got a number of things on the horizon with Egypt modernization also
occurring. So we've got a lot of things still ahead of us here.

run this past them to get their opinion?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

We haven't spoken to them yet, but we will be speaking with them shortly.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. My last one...

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

We will reassure them of the same thing that we've talked about here today. We're still going to have
plenty of free cash flow to do further balance sheet improvement and cash flow from asset disposals if we
need to do that and if we feel like that's the best thing to do at the point in time.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

My follow-up, Steve, is a really quick one for clarification. Cheniere has your contract kicking in pari passu
with their third Corpus Christi development, which has not even FID-ed yet. My understanding was that,
that contract could become effective middle of next year. Can you just offer some clarification on the
timing and maybe what you would expect the ultimate all-in cost to be for you guys?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I can certainly comment on the first part of that. Our contract is, while it was in the context of FID-
ing another project, it's not contractually tied to any project. And so it's just a contract that starts in 2023
and runs for 15 years, 140 million cubic feet a day. And Cheniere has an option to bring that forward 1
year, to start it in mid-2022, July of 2022. And we're waiting to see if they will exercise that option.

Operator

That ends our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to John Christmann for closing
remarks.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. And before ending today's call, I'd like to leave you with the 3 following points.

First, we are taking prudent and appropriate steps now to increase our capital investment to a level that
will enable us to sustain production on a global basis for many years. Our portfolio offers considerable
depth and flexibility to do this efficiently. Second, we are generating substantial free cash flow in this
environment, which we currently estimate will be around $2 billion for the full year 2021 and again in
2022. And lastly, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow via dividends
and share buybacks. And we are demonstrating our commitment to this process right now in the fourth
quarter.

Thank you for participating in our call today. Operator, I'll turn it over to you.
