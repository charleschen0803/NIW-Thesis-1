Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today
Beginning on slide six, I want to cover a few highlights for the second quarter as well as some important trends in our business
Our second quarter colo revenue is below our expectations as we had higher losses in legacy revenues along with higher broadband unit losses and our growth in MPLS revenues was a litter lower than anticipated
However, our adjusted EBITDA met our target
Our employees did a great job of controlling expenses and stayed focus even with all of the Level 3 acquisition integration planning activities that are in progress
Second quarter Enterprise high-bandwidth data services revenues grew 1% year-over-year, although this growth is slower than the prior quarter adjusting for a contracted price reduction in wholesale and a favorable settlement in the year-ago period, Enterprise high-bandwidth data services revenue increased 5% year-over-year
We remain confident that the future growth opportunity for these services remains significant for a number of reasons
First, we continue to outperform MPLS market growth projections forecasted by leading industry analysts
In second quarter, we had nearly 2,000 MPLS customers
This performance was driven in particular by our SMB customers, where we are seeing improved install intervals of nearly 20%, which should help accelerate our revenue recognition as we move into the third and fourth quarters of this year
Next, we launched a number of new products and – we've launched a number of new products in the past few months including our CenturyLink Ethernet service
We've also had three simplified bundles of SD-WAN plus network packages
We rolled out a competitively priced cloud-enabled small business VoIP offering
And we rolled out a new comprehensive managed Enterprise offering that is an end-to-end solution that includes WiFi management, network management, video surveillance, security and mobility management, all from a single interface
Also we have increased focus on customer retention and we are seeing lower credits and adjustments as a result
In addition, CenturyLink continues to be one of the leaders in network virtualization through the deployment of software-defined networking and network virtualization capabilities
Based on initial results, we expect these services to create significant value in the months ahead
Also the continuous onslaught of new security threats, such as WannaCry has brought greater interest in and sales of our strong network and cyber security capabilities, as we believe CenturyLink is growing in recognition as a leading provider of security services that are so important to our Enterprise customers
And lastly, based on third-party research support, U.S
Enterprise high-bandwidth data services are forecast to grow at mid-single-digit compounded annual growth rates through 2021, and U.S
Enterprise Managed Network Services are forecast to grow at mid to upper single-digit compounded annual growth rates through 2021. Now this forecast gives even more confidence in the opportunity to continue to grow Enterprise business in the months ahead
Second, our IT services revenue, which is primarily driven by IT consulting, cyber security, IT service management and big data and analytics, is growing
And our managed hosting business also showed a solid turnaround this quarter
The team overcame the market confusion and sales disruption created by the colocation sale and grew cloud revenue, especially driven or aided by our Cloud Application Manager suite
Next as expected, we had a seasonally challenging quarter from consumer broadband subscribers approximately 65,000 residential subscriber loss was higher than anticipated
This was driven to a great degree of our stronger cable competition, particularly 1 gig offerings in some of our key markets, coupled with aggressive pricing
Over the past year, we have made a pivot towards higher-quality, more profitable consumer broadband sales by removing several low-priced promotional offers and increased credit standards
As a result, despite the unit weakness, our consumer broadband revenue was flat sequentially
Additionally, we saw the lowest second quarter churn rate since the Qwest CenturyLink combination
We anticipate that the changes we're making will drive ongoing churn benefits
We continue to see higher levels of penetration and growth
We have 40 megabits of higher speeds available
We ended the second quarter with nearly 9.4 million 40 megabits in higher addressable locations and more than 3.8 million 100 megabits in higher addressable locations, representing an increase of 240,000 and 350,000 addressable locations respectively, during the quarter
In second quarter we rolled out simplified service and price offerings that we called Price for Life, and part of our footprint, these simplified offers have improved sales trends and improved our early life churn results
We expect to further deploy these offers as well as continue to invest and improve customer and digital experiences and further speed enhancements in the months ahead
We expect these changes to improve our consumer broadband trends in the last half of the year
Consumer video revenues were down year-over-year, primarily due to the restructuring of one of our satellite TV agreements discussed last quarter
We also made a pivot on our Prism product in the middle of the first quarter to focus more on profitability and overall customer lifetime value rested on top-line revenue or unit metrics
Finally, revenues from legacy services primarily switched to voice service and low bandwidth data services have been declining for a number of years due to regulatory change, wireless' placement and technology transition to IP-enabled services
Although we believe the decline in our legacy revenues has been better than most of our peers, we have experienced higher levels of declines in recent months than we have in prior quarters
Moving on to slide seven
We're making good progress in obtaining the necessary approvals to complete the pending acquisition of Level 3. We now have clearance from 23 states and territories with two additional state approvals needed
We continue to work diligently toward receiving the remaining state and federal approvals in order to close by the end of September
Also integration planning process is going very well and we are highly confident in our ability to achieve the $975 million annual run rate operating capital cash synergies target we provided when we announced the transaction last October
The organization planning is moving along with several executive leaders naming their leadership teams
I'm looking forward to Jeff Storey joining us as COO at the time of close
Also we announced – as we announced, I'm planning to retire as CEO at the beginning of 2019. At that time, I will move to Executive Chairman and Jeff would take over as CEO, and I'm confident Jeff will do a great job
I believe we've assembled an incredibly talented and experienced leadership team that is well positioned to lead the combined company post-closing and drive growth and value in the months and years ahead
Before turning it over to David, I'd like to comment on recent litigation regarding our consumer billing practices
This series of litigation began with a former CenturyLink employee filing a wrongful termination lawsuit that alleges our company charged some of our customers for products and services they did not authorize
That claim quickly escalated and a punitive class action being filed in multiple states
As best we can tell, in the claims in the former employee – on the former employee suit and a sampling of customer complaints pulled from social media
In addition, a couple of weeks ago, the Minnesota Attorney General held a press conference announcing a lawsuit against CenturyLink, alleging that we engaged in improper sales and billing practices
We are limited in the things we can say while litigation and investigations are pending, but I do want to be very clear that the allegations contained in these lawsuits are contrary to everything I believe we stand for as a company
They do not represent our values, our principles or our commitment to always try to do the right thing in running our business
That said, we take these allegations seriously and are very diligently investigating them
In addition to management's efforts, our board of directors appointed a special committee and hired the law firm O'Melveny & Myers to conduct an independent review of these issues
This decision was made immediately after learning about the initial lawsuit, not because there was evidence of wrongdoing, but because we wanted to be sure that our board had an independent view of these issues
I and our management team fully support this decision
The special committee's process is underway, and we do not expect that it will be completed until fourth quarter
And while we are supporting those efforts, we cannot speak for the work before it's complete
Our business and the systems that support it are complex
We serve millions of consumer customers and have thousands of interactions with them every day
Sometimes we do make mistakes just like anyone else, but suggestions that we defrauded our customers go against everything we strive to be as a company
Whatever is found in the investigation of these matters we will be fair and do the right thing
We will defend ourselves where required and we will fairly address any mistakes we may have made, not because of the litigation, but because it's what we expect of ourselves
I spent more than 40 years at CenturyLink including 25 as CEO
I've seen a lot of highs and lows during my tenure, but CenturyLink has always worked hard to maintain what I believe is a genuine commitment to honesty and integrity throughout our organization
And we are maintaining that commitment as we work through these issues
With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss the results for the second quarter in more detail and review our third quarter guidance
Yeah, Amir, first of all this is Glen
There are several things we're doing here
First of all, we continue to build on infrastructure and increase the availability of speeds
Where we have 40 megabits or more speed, we're seeing good penetration in the marketplace
The other thing we're doing, which is really we're seeing a lot of success from is simplified pricing and services offered what we call Price for Life, and we're seeing significant take rates in that
We've only rolled that out in a few of our markets this past quarter
We just rolled out I guess about two weeks ago in a number of other markets, all of our legacy CenturyLink markets and we are rolling that out in the legacy Qwest markets
Our plan is by the end of August
We're seeing significant good take rates there, especially where the higher speed is available
So it's not giving up or turning back on the Consumer business
There's a lot of cash flow there
We have been successful in the past competing with cable
We believe we have opportunity to continue to grow that business, and I think we're going to see much better results
We expect to see a leveling off of the losses in the third quarter
Actually expect positive unit growth in the fourth quarter of the year
One of the primary focus of the integration work is being sure we have as little interruption with momentum and with loss of customers as possible or loss of revenue streams due to the integration work
We are working hard to – of course, we cannot – first of all, let me say, we can't about specific customers here as far as our teams are concerned because of the limits on any type of collusion here, anti-competitive work, so we're limited right now
But that is a primary focus of our company going forward is to have our sales team ready
We have a clean room that we have independent folks working through sales information and customer information that when we close the transaction, we'll be able to immediately work with those folks to try to appropriately address each customer opportunity
Obviously, where we have – our respective teams working with specific customers will rationalize those teams
We will pick the very best approach with those customers and let those customers even make some of those decision
But that is the primary focus, it's always difficult, but we believe we're very much prepared for that
It's not the first time we've gone through this
The only other item I mentioned there is that as we bring these companies together, we are seeing some delays by customers just waiting for companies to come together and see which – what network infrastructure we're going to utilize and the changes that the combination of these companies might offer, so we're seeing some delays
They're not really going to other – our competitors right now, but they are delaying their decision like we believe partially because of wanting to see the companies come together
David, I'll start with – on the sales funnel issues
We had a really good sales month of June, was one of our strongest sales months in quite a while, and we feel really good about that
We are still seeing some of those delays I just mentioned earlier in decision-making, but we feel really good about the demand for the services and products we've got out there
And the future looks bright there
I'll let Dean Douglas comment
Dean will give his view of that
Yes, Simon
The timeline for closing the last two states, we really can't predict that
We believe they're moving along well overall
So we think we'll get those approvals in the weeks ahead
We're working diligently with them to answer any remaining questions they might have and we feel confident we'll get there
Close to DOJ, we're working with the DOJ to answer the final – hopefully, the final questions we'll have there
There's no way to predict and I'm not going to try to anticipate what that – when they'll actually get through that, but we believe that will get done successfully by the end of September
I don't have the date as far as the FCC's dates, but they're working diligently with us as well
I don't expect them to seem to be the major issue here in getting approval
I think we're moving well there
So overall, we're confident
Just the main thing is any specific issues or questions that come up at the last minute that you never know about
But we believe right now we're on track to close by the end of September
I'll let Maxine address the call center policies
Yes, on the cable competition, we don't expect them to be any less
What did happen in the second quarter, we had a several key markets they rolled out their gig service and came in a very aggressive pricing
What we're doing is kind of back with our – what we're seeing success is our Price for Life product, our pricing plan and the higher speeds we've been able to roll out as we accelerated CapEx into the first half of the year and second quarter that as we just discussed
We have a lot – we more capacity to sell into, higher speeds to offer our customers as well as a pricing plan we believe is really proven to be very successful
So we're going to be more able to compete going forward than we were in the second quarter
And Maxine, you want to?
With regards to clarifying the funnel versus sales, the funnel is identified opportunities
Sales are booked backlog
So that's the way you ought to be thinking about the definition
So but sale was actually an order, a real order and the funnel is the identified opportunities we see in the marketplace
Our funnel conversion has stayed about the same
We haven't seen a significant improvement or degradation in funnel conversion
What we have seen, however, is that for the MPLS market specifically, more of our midrange and some of our smaller customers are actually signing up for the MPLS services
So our conversion – I'm sorry our actual rate of revenue conversion or getting revenue from the MPLS sales is shortening as we convert those midrange customer orders into real revenues because the provisioning time is shorter and generally on that and something that we can do much more rapidly from a revenue standpoint
So that is the difference that we've seen in the second quarter
So, we had a very strong June, as mentioned
We expect to have a very solid third quarter going forward
And so you should start to see our sales number improve as I believe was mentioned earlier
We expect that our strategic revenues also are going to improve sequentially
Do you want to start?
Repeat the question, Batya, if you will
And Batya, I'll just follow up
We have talked about the Prism customer, we lost about 21,000 Prism customers this year as we deemphasized that product, and because of the margin issue of the higher content cost
Amy, regarding the high-speed data service and managed services and with the markets – the market's in mid to high through this growth
Look at just the high-bandwidth data services excluding normalized base, they were at 5% growth rates
So we feel pretty good about that and with a few – some improvements that we have planned, the new services products that I talked about we've rolled out recently, we think we're certainly hitting that higher mid-single-digit – or mid to higher single digits in that growth rate
So obviously managed services, we turned it around this last quarter
We think it's very doable that we'll see mid to high single-digits there as well
So we feel positive about the change we made in those services
And just one example is our Cloud Application Management services is really selling well in our Enterprise base
And our Managed Security Services in SMB space especially is really growing well
So we feel good about those services that are starting to take off at a higher level than they were previously
So we think that we can hit those growth rates
And then with the Level 3 acquisition too, bringing these companies together, we got a broader range of products and services and we have the international piece that we didn't have before, a much broader international footprint, network footprint, which should give us some advantages that we have
And we also just to scale with the Level 3, we're the second largest domestic carrier, put us in a position to compete in a level we really didn't get to, and we'll be able to after we close this transaction
First of all, Mike, on the Consumer broadband, it's really about speed more than bundle
(51:55) of aggressive price points than speed's what it's about
We didn't get through your – will you repeat the second question? I'm sorry, Mike
We are trying to convert as many of those customers as we possibly can
What's happening in private line, those customers are either going away or many of them are converting to higher speeds, and we're aggressively going after those customers, trying to convert them to our high-speed products
So that's a big part of what we're doing and also our new Ethernet product is really a strong offer that we believe can drive a lot of that to our – we can migrate a lot of those customers to our Ethernet product platform
So those are the things we're really moving aggressively working toward to kind of stem some of that loss on those lower speed customers
Yes, Brett, first of all, we are in the process of rolling out our over-the-top product
We have some – we have – one key advantage we have with our product is a cloud DVR across multiple devices
That's really been a compelling part of our offer
We have flexible packaging including live and on-demand local broadcast, national channels, got some genre additions
But we are very open to looking at other options
We don't have – these other standalone or different partners we could have to provide over-the-top video, then we're open to that
Matter of fact, we continually talk with some of these other providers, look at the best ways we can bring that service and also other ways in working with them to reduce our content cost
So that will be a key objective even with our over-the-top product
So yes, we're very open to that
It does not have to be our product
That's really a lot of it, just bring that bundle together, lower the churn and also generate additional average revenue per customer
First of all, Frank, on the strength in June, it was sales is where the strength was in June
It wasn't conversion ratio
It's all that we see in this, we mentioned we're shortening of intervals and – between as far as install intervals and that's helping us convert more quickly to revenue
Especially in the SMB space, we're seeing a lot of improvement there, it's driving revenue better for us
And as far as the opportunity with the FCC, we're very pleased moving away from the Title II requirements that we've been – really cloud over for a while there
Just overall improvement in the direction of FCC, in our view, of less stringent regulation
And we believe that – and on the Internet side, we think (56:30) certainly put control and protections in for consumers for Open Internet, while at the same time allowing for you competition there
So overall, we're very pleased with where we're headed with regulation
We'll see what happens
It won't all go our way, but as far as the changes we're seeing, we're very pleased, thus far, with FCC policies
Thank you, operator
I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make in transforming CenturyLink into a leading global network service provider
We're encouraged by the continuing demand for businesses and consumers for advanced network services and related trends we're seeing and the associated opportunities to provide IP and Managed Services to enterprise customers, enable their digital transformation
We believe our continued progress in the virtualization of our network, enhancements in our broadband speeds and improving our customer experience through simplification, optimization help position us to drive future growth in our business
Additionally, we expect the pending acquisition of Level 3 to move us further toward our goal of being one of the world's leading network providers
We're excited about the benefits and implications of this acquisition
We want to thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead
