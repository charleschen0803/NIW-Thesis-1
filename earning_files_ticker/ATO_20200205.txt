Presentation

Operator

Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jennifer Hills, Vice President, Investor Relations for Atmos
Energy. Jennifer, please go ahead.

Jennifer Posey Hills
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast
live on the internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in
our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab.

As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of
our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and
the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from
actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 22 and are
more fully described in our SEC filings.

Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in
Atmos Energy. Our 2020 fiscal year is off to a solid start. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income
of $179 million or $1.47 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. We reported growth in both our
distribution and pipeline and storage businesses, driven by continued customer growth and distribution
and rate recovery in both segments. Consolidated operating income rose 7% to $253 million in the first
quarter.

Slide 4 summarizes key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Operating income for our
distribution business rose 6.4% to $180 million. Rate increases, driven by increased safety and reliability
capital spending, provided incremental $27 million, primarily in our Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi
jurisdictions.

Customer growth contributed incremental $4 million as we have continued to benefit from the strong
population growth in some of our service areas, most notably in the DFW Metroplex. For the 12 months
ended December 31, we experienced 1.4% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business
and 1.2% net customer growth across our 8-state footprint.

Consumption declined modestly due to colder weather last year before weather normalization mechanisms
went into effect, and O&M expenses increased $8.6 million associated with the distribution integrity
management work and higher employee-related costs.

Operating income for the pipeline and storage business grew 8% to $73 million primarily driven by a
$13.7 million increase due to the implementation of new rates from our 2019 GRIP filing partially offset by
a $5 million increase in O&M related to the timing of well integrity work.

Consolidated capital spending grew 27% to $529 million, with 86% of our spending directed towards
safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. We remain on track to invest between $1.85
billion and $1.95 billion this fiscal year.

We have a well-established regulatory strategy focused on reducing lag. In fiscal 2020, we expect to begin
earning a return on 90% of our spending within 6 months of the test period end. Year-to-date, we have

implemented $59 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, and currently, we have about $21 million in
progress. Slides 13 to 18 provide details for all of these filings.

Slide 19 outlines our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Our ability to attract the necessary long-term financing to fund our capital expenditure program while
maintaining the strength of our balance sheet is critical to the successful execution of our strategic plan.
During the first quarter, we received $1.1 billion in net proceeds from long-term financing activities. In
October, we issued $3 million of 10-year notes and $500 million of 30-year notes at an all-in effective rate
of 3.15%. As a result, we were able to reduce our weighted average cost of debt to 4.32%. Our customers
continue to benefit from these historically low rates. Additionally, we increased our weighted average
maturities to 22 years and do not have a material maturity until 2027.

From an equity perspective, we settled forward agreements on 2.7 million shares for approximately
$259 million in net proceeds, and we executed new forward sales arrangements under our ATM for
approximately 340,000 shares with an anticipated net proceeds of approximately $37 million.

As of December 31, we had about $240 million remaining under equity forward arrangements that must
be utilized by the end of our fiscal year. We continue to believe that we can satisfy our fiscal 2020 needs
through our ATM program.

As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.6% as of December 31, and we
finished the quarter with approximately $2 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward
agreements.

The strength of our balance sheet and our 5-year financial plan continues to be recognized by the credit
rating agencies. In December, Moody's upgraded our long-term debt rating to A1 with a stable outlook,
and S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be
found on Slide 7 through 10.

Our first quarter performance leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth
target. As a result, yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2020 earnings per share guidance in the range of
$4.58 to $4.73 per diluted share.

Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers for his closing remarks.

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Chris. As you can see from our fiscal first quarter results, we are off to a good start to the
year as we remain on track to meet our capital spending goals and earnings growth targets. From an
operational perspective, we remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating
safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution transmission, storage systems as well.

We are continuing our investments in people, process and technologies that will enable Atmos Energy to
scale safely and efficiently while investing $10 billion to $11 billion over the next 5 years.

I would like to highlight one of our larger investments, the Bethel Salt Dome project, which we began in
fiscal 2019 and is estimated to be completed in 2025. As we've discussed previously, we plan to invest
between $100 million and $120 million to develop a third salt-dome cavern at our Bethel storage facility.
This project will enable us to safely perform regulatory compliance work on our 2 existing caverns and
meet the growing demand in the North Texas market. The construction of the power and leaching facilities
have been completed, and we began the leaching process in mid-December. The leaching process is
estimated to take between 25 and 30 months, and we anticipate finishing our required compliance work
on all 3 caverns and have them in service by late 2025.

Natural gas is an important driver of economic growth in this country, and we have seen our industrial
business grow in our Kentucky mid states and Mississippi divisions, particularly in the automotive
manufacturing sector and in the spirits industry.

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

Over the last few quarters, clean, efficient and affordable natural gas lead transport has supported the
expansion of existing facilities and fueled new industrial project development. Once these expansion
projects fully come online over the next few years, we expect to deliver an additional 2 Bcf annually to
these customers. Additionally, we continue to expand deliveries to CNG customers with the addition of a
new customer in Colorado. As a result, our customer expects to replace nearly 90,000 gallons of diesel
fuel annually.

During the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting capabilities. In December, we
launched a Corporate Responsibility section on our website to provide greater disclosure of our focus on
safety and long-term sustainability and to highlight how we are working to meet the needs of our various
stakeholders.

We also published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report as well as an updated
methane emissions report, both of which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility section under
Reports.

The continued modernization of our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems will help
ensure all residential, commercial, public authority and industrial customers continue to have access to
reliable, affordable, abundant and efficient natural gas. To support this effort, last week, we were pleased
to announce that we joined the One Future coalition, a voluntary alliance of leading companies across the
natural gas supply chain focused on technology and policy to drive continued improvement in reduction of
methane emissions. We look forward to working with One Future as we move toward achieving our target
of a 50% reduction in methane emissions by 2035.

In closing, I want to thank our 4,800 employees who are dedicated every day to safely operating our
system, providing exceptional customer service and bring back to the communities where we live and
work.
We appreciate your time this morning, and now we will take any questions you may have.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Richard Ciciarelli from Bank of America.

Richard Jude Ciciarelli
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I just had a question on the O&M profile. It seems like it was a sizable uptick this year. And I appreciate
some of that was for like the increased employees due to the faster growth, but just curious like how you
intend to shape the O&M curve through the outlook, given like the 2% to 3% growth that you're managing
towards?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Some of that -- a couple of things. We got the 2% to 3% -- 2.5% to 3.5% that's baked into our 5-
year plan through 2024. We had already -- and that's a CAGR over that 5-year period. So we had already
anticipated, as you noted, an uptick in O&M this year as a result of the additional hiring that we had,
obviously, in the first quarter. As you try to turn that out over 4 quarters, that can be a little bit difficult.
We did have some timing, particularly in our pipeline and storage segment around some well integrity
work that was kind of accelerated more into the first quarter. So when we look at the O&M guidance that
we published for fiscal 2020, we feel like we are still on track to achieve that at this point in time.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

My first question is at the pipeline segment. When you look at the year-over-year decrease in
transportation volumes, how does that magnitude compare versus your expectations? I know you've
expected some of that given the online of the Gulf Coast Express pipeline and whatnot, but how does
that magnitude, like, fare versus your expectation? And how does that place you in terms of the expected
growth of the segment for this year?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's pretty much in line with our expectations. And honestly, we saw volumes pick up just a little bit
versus what we expected, but pricing was a little bit down. So net-net, we were in line with expectations.
And as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor the market conditions. You're very well aware of the
supply and demand dynamics are ongoing in the Permian Basin, and we'll just keep an eye on that. But at
this point, we still think that our net income as well as our guidance that we have out there is still good.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Understood. And second, Kevin, I know you touched upon this in your prepared remarks, but with ESG
and electrification of the grid story having taken hold recently in our market, so could you share your
thoughts a little bit more on your view of the gas that plays a role in the future of the U.S. energy grid?
And also how do you see that potential shift creating maybe a secular decline in existing or new gas usage
on the customer base?

CEO, President & Director

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

Yes. I appreciate your question. First of all, let me say that I'm proud to be in the natural gas business,
particularly this morning, as we sit here in Dallas, the windchill is in the low 20, so our customers are
receiving safe, reliable heating for their home and have hot showers as well. So we're very, very proud of
our product and what we're able to do from a reliability and efficiency standpoint. But the way we see it,
as you look at the population in U.S. today, about 335 million or so, headed towards 360 million by 2030,
that's like adding a Texas to the population in about a 10-year period with growth at about 2.5 million
people or so a year there. That's going to require a diversified energy portfolio, and we see natural gas as
a vital part of that energy solution as we move forward.

As we said before, it's efficient, it's affordable, it's abundant, it's reliable, and it's flexible. There's not
another fuel that's flexible like it to meet this growing demand of energy that's going to be required by
2030. You can compress it, you can decompress it, you can transport it, you can liquefy it, you can store it
below ground. There's nothing like it that's reliable and abundant today that's out there. And as a natural
gas distribution utility having interstate transmission assets, we've raised our well operating responsibly
and being good stewards of our environment. As you've heard us say before, we're working to tighten
up our system with our modernization of our infrastructure, and we continue to deploy technology across
our system, both in a monitoring capability and equipment capability to make sure we are operating as
responsibly and as efficiently as possible. And we'll continue to work with our partners, both upstream, as
you saw with our joining of One Future, to measure that we're getting the best available practices that are
going on in the industry today to look at and maybe incorporate into our business as well as partner with
groups like AGA and GTI to not only tell our story but to also look at what technology is available from a
burner tip perspective or technology perspective, whether that's carbon capture or carbon storage.

So as we see it, we see a continued growth of natural gas. It plays a viable role in the energy future now
-- in the energy portfolio now and well into the future, trying to meet that energy demand by 2030.

Again, there's nothing like it that's as flexible, reliable and as efficient. So as we talked about in my script,
with industrial demand out there, we're continuing to see good expansion of industrial load, good new
growth on the industrial and commercial side as well. And then in addition, you heard Chris mention the
1.2% to 1.4 % net growth on the residential side as well in our market areas. So both residential through
the industrial markets, we continue to see good growth area.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar Research.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I just want to make sure I understand this. On the pipeline and storage, you talked last quarter about the
new pipeline coming on, competitor pipeline, impacting operating income. And obviously, we didn't see
that in the last quarter. It was pretty darn good, but then you made the statement that it's on track. I
mean do you anticipate pipeline and storage being roughly flattish this year versus last year? Or when you
say on track, if you could provide a little more color what that might be?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. Charles, this is Chris. A couple of comments around that. Last quarter, GCX came online in
the middle of the quarter. So we had some strong pricing opportunities, if you will, in the first half of the
fourth quarter last year, which contributed to that quarter's results. As we move forward, as we reiterated
this morning, we're on track with our earnings per share targets. And I'll also say that our contribution of
our business between distribution and pipeline storage is going to be roughly the same as well. So that's
roughly 2/3 distribution and 1/3 on the pipeline storage side. So as we continue to grow in that 6% to 8%
range, certainly for 2020, and as we look out through 2024, we expect the business mix between our 2
segments to be in that roughly that 2/3, 1/3 allocation, if you will. So it can ebb and flow a little bit but we
still see a lot of continued growth. And when you think about pipeline and storage, most of the earnings
drivers in that segment is the continued safety and reliability work that we are doing on our APT system.

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

Kevin talks about the Bethel storage facility. So it's driven by fundamental rate based growth as a result
of the supply or the -- what we're trying to accomplish from a safety perspective as well as meeting the
growing needs of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. So I mean, Chris, the takeaway from your answer is that since the mix of business is staying the
same and we know distribution is growing pretty well, that means pipeline and storage is really growing,
even though you're seeing this competitor pipeline.

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

That's correct. And remember, too, on this competitive pipeline, and we've been talking about this for a
couple of years, the nontariff businesses that run through the pipeline that represents a relatively small
piece of the overall puzzle for APT primarily due to the existence of a Rider REV mechanism. So whatever
we tend to pick up in terms of a commercial business activity on that pipe, 75% of the benefit flows back
to our regulated customers on the distribution side in our Mid-Tex Division in North Texas. So -- and you
heard us consistently say over the years, when they pick up a little bit here and there, but we don't view
that as a material driver of our performance. It could have a little bit of an impact in a given year given
pricing dynamics, but we don't -- certainly don't look to it as a source of fundamental growth for the long
term.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And if I could ask -- go ahead.

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Well, I was just going to add to that. Chris, is exactly right. We don't see that as a competitor pipeline.
Again, with its direction, its heading, it's mainly focused on takeaway out of the Permian down to the Gulf
Coast area there. So we don't really see it as a competitor by nature because our responsibility on the
pipeline side itself is those core markets and serving those core markets.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. Now if I can ask just one more question, on the new dome storage that's being developed,
how does that work from a regulatory standpoint? I mean I would assume a lot of that is for the benefit of
your distribution system, Mid-Tex, et cetera?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Correct. It's for our -- making sure we have the reliability to continue to meet the contractual demands of
those customers behind APT. All those costs that -- or investments into that are growth eligible, and so the
recovery through that mechanism.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. So it's under grip. Got it.

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 05, 2020

Our next question is coming from Ryan Levine from Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

What's your appetite to invest in the build-out of RNG infrastructure given your footprint and stated
objectives of both AGA and Atmos?

John Kevin Akers
CEO, President & Director

Again, we're -- we want to operate responsibly. We want to take a look at opportunities that are out
there, but we're going to take a look at it in the way that we've done everything else about our business.
And what I mean by that is if you take a look at how we set up our rate structures over time, our
annual mechanisms, our pipe mechanisms, those sort of things, we have to look at it from a regulatory
perspective on investment and recovery of that investment and what those opportunities look like as well
as what are the laws or regulations around that, that exist today or may exist in the future. So all that to
say, we're keeping an eye on it. We're looking at it. But we are working with other industry partners and
seeing what other states are doing to see how the regulatory environment plays out on those and how the
legislative environment plays out on those. And when we see something that is of interest to us or ready
to move forward, we'll, like we said, with the rest of our rate structure make sure that it is tied up with our
investment and the recovery and it benefits our customers across the enterprise.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And then another one in terms of the O&M cost increase. I was wondering what impact the new
PHMSA regulation have in your increased guidance for 2020 versus '19.

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

You see the O&M guidance that we've put out there, we have already kind of anticipated those PHMSA
rules coming into effect beginning in July of this calendar year. So it's going to be -- have a muted impact
in 2020 and will continue to roll in on a full fiscal year basis and beginning in 2021. But we've already
contemplated that in our O&M forecast through 2024.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Is there a way to quantify the magnitude of that impact versus the other items that were highlighted from
an earlier question?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

We don't have that information readily available.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And then the last question for me. Curious what your gas price assumption is in your 2020 guide.
And with the weakness in spot basis in some of your jurisdictions, curious how much regulatory headroom
you have versus your guidance in terms of customer builds.

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

Well, we've got -- you'll see it in our Analyst Day, this deck that we put out last fall, I think we're at an
all-in price anywhere from $3.20 -- $5.25 to $5.50, inclusive of storage and transportation costs. Storage
and transportation is usually between $1 and $1.50. So we assumed a high $2, low $3 range on the

commodity pricing. So to the extent that we have lower pricing that we're able to capture from our various
sources of gas then it's obviously a benefit that flows back to our customers. And we've got a very good
gas supply team in our shared services function that is working to minimize the cost of gas across the
enterprise.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from [ Mark Solicito ] from Barclays.

Unknown Analyst

Kind of following up on some of the earlier questions, can you quantify the year-over-year impact from
Waha basis differentials in fiscal 1Q?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

If you look through our MDA, it's roughly down about a $750,000 to $1 million. It's in our line item that
flows -- it's not on our Mid-Tex line, but it's our pipeline -- it's in our 3-system line item. So it's out there
in the 10-Q.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. Okay. And then in terms of your FY '20 EPS guidance, I think Waha spreads were $12 million
year-over-year tailwind in fiscal '19. Just curious what the embedded assumption was in your fiscal '20
guidance. Or maybe said differently, if you captured any benefit in fiscal '20, would that represent upside
to your budget?

Christopher T. Forsythe
Senior VP & CFO

We made a call based upon market conditions at the time that we put the plan together last summer, but
we haven't released those specific details.

Operator

We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to
management for any further or closing comments.

Jennifer Posey Hills
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. A recording
of this call is available for replay on our website through May 7, 2020. Goodbye.

Operator
Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have
a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
