Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Vornado Realty Trust Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. My name
is Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator
Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Catherine C. Creswell
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Trust fourth quarter earnings call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued
our fourth quarter earnings release and filed our annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package are
available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section. In these documents and
during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures
to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, Form 10-K and
financial supplement.

Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and
actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and
other factors. Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form
10-K for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. The call may include time-sensitive
information that may be accurate only as of today's date. The company does not undertake a duty to
update any forward-looking statements. On the call today from management for our opening comments is
Michael Franco, President. In addition, Steven Roth and our senior team are present and available for your
questions.

I will now turn the call over to Michael Franco.

Michael J. Franco
President

Thank you, Cathy, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we look back at 2019 as an important and
successful year, setting the stage for the next phase of the company's growth. In addition to keeping our
buildings full at very healthy rents, we are at 96.5% occupancy. We recapitalized our Fifth Avenue and
Times Square retail assets on a very attractive basis at a $5.5 billion transaction. We paid $1.95 per share
special dividend last month related to this transaction. Most importantly, we advanced the redevelopment
of the Penn District, positioning the company to capitalize on the enormous opportunity we have on the
west side of Manhattan. More on this in a moment.

Before giving some thoughts on the markets in our portfolio, and in particular, the Penn District, let me
review our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Fourth quarter FFO as adjusted was $0.89 per
share, flat to last year's fourth quarter. Full year 2019 FFO as adjusted was $3.49 per share compared to
$3.73 per share for 2018. These results are $0.09 ahead of the guidance we've given in the third quarter.
As we have previously indicated, our financial results for 2019 were lower than 2018, explained as follows:
Of the $0.24 reduction, $0.25 is due to over $3.2 billion of asset sales; $0.09 is due to a onetime noncash
stock-based compensation expense; and $0.04 is due to lost income from retail bankruptcies, all of which
aggregate to a $0.38 reduction, which was partially offset by growth in our core business and interest
savings. Overall, our core business continues to be strong.

For the year, across New York, Chicago and San Francisco, our office and retail leasing teams completed
215 leases, comprising 1.7 million square feet at a starting rent of $90.45 per square foot at positive
mark-to-markets of 14% GAAP and 8.8% cash. Please see Page 18 of the supplement for further detail.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Cash basis same-store NOI company-wide was up 3.6%. Company-wide, our fourth quarter cash basis
same-store NOI decreased (sic) [ increased ] by 6.6%, broken down as follows: New York Office was up
3.4%, street retail was down 2.2%, theMART was up 100%, benefiting from a onetime $12 million accrual
of real estate tax expense last year due to the triannual reassessment of the property, and 555 California
Street was up 4.1%.

Our noncomparable items in the fourth quarter included the $173.7 million after-tax net gain on unit
closings at 220 Central Park South. To date, we have closed on 65 units for net proceeds of $1.82 billion,
including 17 units for $565.9 million in the fourth quarter. We are now 91% sold in the face of a very soft
luxury condo market, a testament to the building being the best ever built in New York City, and our sales
continue strong. Since the beginning of 2019, we have executed contracts of $400 million. We expect to
receive over $1 billion from closings in 2020. And as we've said previously, all the net proceeds will be
redeveloped into the Penn District redevelopments underway, turning this capital into highly accretive
earnings and driving strong future growth.

Now turning to 2020, which will be an inflection point for us as we invest heavily in the Penn District
to create enormous future value. Given the full year effect of our substantial asset sales and our
development activity as we continue to invest in the Penn District, we thought it appropriate to provide
some greater visibility into our projection for 2020. We currently estimate that 2020 FFO as adjusted will
be lower than 2019 by between $0.23 and $0.33 per share. Of this $0.28 reduction at the midpoint, $0.16
was due to the full year impact of asset sales; $0.09 is due to taking additional assets out of service for
redevelopment, primarily in the Penn District at PENN2, the Retail at the LIRR concourse and the Kmart
space at PENN1; and $0.08 is due to lost income from the full year effect of 2019 retailer bankruptcies, all
of which aggregate to a $0.33 reduction, which is partially offset by growth in the core business.

Let me now turn to the New York market. The Manhattan office market continues to fire on all cylinders,
fueled by strong job growth and unabated tenant demand for office space, particularly for landlords with
new or redeveloped product. The city added 19,000 office-using jobs during the year, bringing office-
using employment to an all-time high of 1,470,000 jobs and the recently announced large future office
commitments for major companies in the city point to continued strong job growth. Leasing volume
citywide in 2019 totaled 43 million square feet, the highest activity in 20 years. TAMI tenants continued
their strong demand, accounting for 1/3 of all activity during the year, with the tech sector alone leasing
7.5 million square feet. This sector has become a dominant powerhouse in New York as tech companies
are attracted by the city's dynamic economy, deep and diverse talent base and leading universities. While
the big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon continue to expand their sizable presence,
the city's growth was also being driven by long-established traditional industries, hiring more and more
technology workers to support their businesses. Importantly, in 2019, venture capital investment in New
York companies surpassed $17 billion, increasing New York City's share of total VC investment in the U.S.
to an all-time high of 20%, up from 11% in 2018. These investments paved the way for continued growth
in the tech sector in the future.

The flight to quality trends and tenants for new construction and redeveloped space accelerated during
2019. According to JLL's annual trophy building report, more than 20% or 8.8 million square feet of
the citywide leasing activity in New York was signed at triple-digit starting rents, a record number.
Interestingly, 60% of this triple-digit activity was with TAMI tax, mainly concentrated on the West Side.
According to a Cushman & Wakefield year-end report, asking rents for Class A product in the Penn District
submarket, which includes Hudson Yards and Manhattan West, reached a historic $109 per square foot, a
very good sign for our 5.2 million square feet currently in redevelopment in the district.

As a company, we are heavily focused on the transformational repositioning of our Penn District holdings
as the new epicenter of New York. Our redevelopments are now in full construction mode. 2020 will mark
an important step in the district's transformation as the majestic Moynihan Train Hall in Farley and our
850,000 square feet of office and retail space in Farley will be substantially completed at year-end. As you
walk around the district today, you see the incredible amount of activity underway. The redevelopments of
Farley, PENN1 and PENN2, the grand new entrance to Penn Station on Plaza33 where work has begun and
the scaffolding in the LIRR concourse where redevelopment will shortly commence. In total, there's over

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

$5 billion currently being invested in the district and its infrastructure between Vornado's $2.2 billion, and
the government's $3 billion.

During the fourth quarter, we bought out Kmart's 141,000 square foot lease at PENN1, which had another
16 years to run for a $34 million payment, of which $10 million is expected to be reimbursed. Steve and
Eddie had been wrangling about this for years and years and we think we timed the buyout at exactly the
right time and got it at a fair price. Despite the nominal short-term FFO loss from Kmart's rent, this was
a big win for us and allows us to immediately integrate this space into our overall redevelopment plan for
PENN1, the adjacent plaza and the LIRR concourse and to populate the space with high-quality retailers.
Overall, a big uptick for the neighborhood.

During January, we executed a relocation transaction with Information Builders, which will move them
from the tower of PENN2 into 2 separate spaces at PENN11 and PENN1 totaling 78,000 square feet.
This deal is the last piece of space we needed to get back to execute the redevelopment plan at PENN2.
Moreover, the starting ramp of Information Builders at PENN1 is in the mid-90s per square foot, reflecting
the market's confidence in the district's transformation and of this extraordinary development that will
begin to take shape. In addition, as I'm sure most of you saw, the governor made a major announcement
in January, expressing the state's intention to further modernize and expand track capacity at Penn Station
through the creation of the Empire Station Complex with an expanded terminal in a block south of PENN2,
increasing train capacity by approximately 40%. This announcement represents another validation of
Penn Station/Empire Station as the key transportation hub in the region and a further commitment from
the government to invest in the area. The government expects ridership at Penn Station to double in
the next 10 to 15 years. The state intends to fund this expansion through the creation of a new district,
which encompasses our Penn District holdings and by capturing future increases in tax revenues from
new developments in this designated district. We look forward to working with the state, city and other
important stakeholders to help realize the governor's very important mission.

With the explosion of tech demand in New York City, particularly on the West Side, our Penn District assets
are very well positioned to be at the center of this activity. It's in the hottest submarket in the city. We're
going to be delivering Farley, PENN1 and PENN2 totaling 5.2 million square feet near-term with an ability
for tenants to grow with us over time on a massive campus located right on top of transportation. We're
confident as our plans become reality that office tenants will fully appreciate the unique and differentiated
product we're delivering. In this regard, we remain on track with the 2 large leases we mentioned on last
quarter's call, and there's good activity from a variety of important tenants behind us.

On the retail side, the interest in Farley has been outstanding as retailers come to understand the
significant foot traffic that will course through Farley in the district every day. We are on lease negotiations
in over 50% of the Farley concourse and are in active negotiations for the majority of the space in the
main level. More broadly, we are working on a variety of deals to curate the district with all sorts of
offerings: food and beverage, coffee, fitness, co-working, conferencing, retail and so forth to service
our tenant base. While earnings are, of course, negatively impacted in the short term, earnings will
significantly increase as we turn the 60s per square foot office rents currently in place into mid-90s and
higher as we deliver and lease of redeveloped space.

Overall, our New York Office portfolio is in great shape, 97% occupancy with a very manageable 525,000
square feet expiring during 2020 after taking the previously announced [ embroiled ] space comprising
566,000 square feet of PENN2 out of service. Our office leasing activity is extremely strong with more than
1.6 million square feet of leases in final documentation and an additional 1.8 million square feet in the
pipeline.

During 2019, we completed 102 office transactions for 987,000 square feet at starting rents of $82.17 per
square foot with positive mark-to-markets of 4.6% cash and 5.5% GAAP. Approximately 20% of our total
leasing activity in 2019 was at triple digits at average starting rents of $120 per square foot.

In terms of the fourth quarter, we leased 173,000 square feet at an average starting rent of $101 per
square foot. While we had negative 5.2% cash and 3.5% GAAP mark-to-markets for the quarter, it is
worth noting this was based on only 54,000 square feet of second-generation space and driven by the rent
reduction of one short-term renewal at 350 Park Avenue. This is the single best development site on Park

Avenue and likely Midtown, and we will be keeping renewals short-term here in order to line up this site
for possible new development.

Leasing highlights during the fourth quarter included a headquarters lease at our new 512 West 22nd
Street with NextGen Media of 41,000 square feet.

At theMART in Chicago, during 2019, we completed 62 leases comprising 286,000 square feet at average
starting rents of $49.43 per square foot. In the fourth quarter, we completed 50,000 square feet of
showroom deals at starting rents of $51 per square foot. Occupancy stood at 94.6% at year-end. We have
very good activity on our available office space here and are in numerous discussions with both new and
existing tenants throughout the building.

In San Francisco, the market remains on fire, and it is hard for tenants to find quality available space. At
our 1.8 million square foot 555 California Street campus, we remain full and are enjoying the benefits.

During the fourth quarter, we finalized the lease renewal with one of our full-floor law firm tenants in the
bottom third of the tower at a starting rent of $94 per square foot, a 72.5% positive cash mark-to-market.
We are also in renewal negotiations with 2 of our major tenants in the tower of the building with each
transaction that ramps well into the triple digits.

Turning now to our New York street retail business. Overall, while rents are down, activity is up from a
year ago and there continues to be a flight to quality for retailers, a trend that benefits our portfolio. The
best High Street retail is not dead, but rents do need to be economic for retailers to commit. In a very
difficult retail environment, we completed 39 retail leases with 238,000 square feet during the year with
GAAP and cash positive mark-to-markets of 12.9% and 9.8%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we
completed 16 leases comprising 94,000 square feet, highlighted by very important 10-year leases with 2
LVMH brands at 595 Madison Avenue, better known as The Fuller Building. Fendi and Berluti leased a total
of 16,850 square feet here, reflecting the building's bull's eye location at the corner of 57th Street and
Madison Avenue. A portion of this space was formerly occupied by Coach and a portion was vacant. Kudos
to Haim for sourcing the LVMH deal.

Our retail occupancy remains high at 94.5% as we continue to source tenants for this best-in-class
portfolio. Rents this quarter rolled up on a cash mark-to-market basis by 11.3% and were flat on a GAAP
basis. In addition, we are pleased to report that last week we signed an 8,000 square foot lease with
Sephora at 4 Union Square South, which filled most of the space vacated by Forever 21 last year. Between
the recent Whole Foods expansion and new Sephora deal, we have now surpassed the total rent Forever
21 was paying on the entire space, and we still have an additional 9,700 square foot leasing opportunity.
Taken as a whole, once fully re-leased, we project an approximate 40% mark-to-market increase and
a much better credit profile. As a testament to the uniqueness of our Union Square asset, we re-leased
the space 96 days after Forever 21's lease expired. We don't yet know what will happen with the other 2
Forever 21 leases we have, but if we get them back, these assets are in premier locations. And while it
might take longer, we're confident we'll re-lease them successfully just as we did Union Square.

Finally, a comment on sustainability. We have always prioritized reduction of our carbon footprint and
mitigation of our contribution to climate change, and we are in lockstep with our investors, tenants,
employees and communities. We have reduced by 25% our same-store energy consumption in the last
10 years and are committed to furthering our progress through continued energy retrofits, smart building
technology and meaningful engagement with our tenants. We will also include renewable energy as an
important step in our process towards carbon neutrality. We are well positioned to comply with recent
climate laws as evidenced by our being Energy Star Partner of the Year for the seventh time, a NAREIT
Leader in the Light Award recipient for the tenth year in a row and a top performer among all global real
estate sustainability benchmark respondents. In addition to the many awards for sustainability we win
each year, I'm specifically proud of our team for being cited as the industry model with our innovative
approach to furnishing our audited ESG reports to the Securities Exchange Commission.

We continue to maintain a fortressed balance sheet with measured leverage and an abundance of liquidity
to date and growing. After the $400 million special dividends paid last month, our liquidity is $3.8 billion

comprised of $1.2 billion in cash and restricted cash and $2.175 billion undrawn on our revolving credit
facility.

To conclude, we feel very good about our overall business. We own great assets in great locations in great
cities and know how to keep these properties full with best-in-class tenants and market leading rents.
Moreover, we have outstanding and unique development skills that allow us to create significant value. We
will continue to take full advantage in New York's strong [indiscernible] and climate for businesses to grow
and succeed, while they find the best talent in the country.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And from Citi, we have Manny Korchman.

Michael Bilerman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Michael, I want to just go through some of the numbers you threw
out in terms of some of the headwinds that are affecting 2020 and maybe if we can just take each of
them. You talked about the space coming out of service being the $0.09, the $19 million that's in the
supplemental on Page 31. Can you give us some color in terms of when you expect income to start flowing
back because the chart, at least in the supplemental, doesn't have the positive effect of re-leasing that
space.

And then on the retail side, that $16-or-so million at $0.08, what is the prospects of that income flowing in
at some point in 2020 versus later on? Just as we think about the ramp as we get back.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Michael Bilerman, it's Joe Macnow. I want to take the second part of that question. On the $0.16 from
asset sales, half of that, a little -- almost half of that comes from the retailer JV. The balance comes from
sales of 330 Madison, 3040 M Street, Creek, UE, LXP, that stuff is not coming back, other than being
reinvested, the cash being reinvested in the Penn District. It's not a one for one, we sold this, we're
putting this here, and we're going to get back an award.

Michael J. Franco
President

Michael, in terms of the retail bankruptcies, right, which is Topshop and Forever 21, obviously, 608 is
permanently gone. The asset in Soho, the probable plan there is to convert that upper floor -- the upper
floor is the office, and so that will undergo a redevelopment. And so best case is that won't come online
-- and it certainly won't come online in 2020. Best case, it'll be some point next year. But again, nothing
certain there. And then Forever 21, we have a deal in place today with them. The numbers we cited reflect
the reduced leases. We'll see what happens as they come out of bankruptcy now. And to the extent that
those leases are not accepted or to the extent that we proactively take that space back after the year,
again, that income is not going to come on in 2020. The best case, that's going to come on sometime in
2021. So the usual free rent period, et cetera, I think at the best case that would be towards the latter
part of 2020. But again, there's nothing that is imminent on those. We're aware that both those leases
either could come back or we'll proactively take those back when we're out of marketing space.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Michael, it's Joe Macnow again. That explanation of the possible Forever 21 2 leases coming back is what
gave rise to the range of $0.23 to the midpoint of $0.28. That $0.05 represents the exposure of those 2
leases coming back.

Michael Bilerman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And then if you think about -- I mean, you were running basically $0.89 of adjusted FFO in the third
and fourth quarter, right, so annualizing out to $356 million for the year relative to the $349 million for the
full year. Arguably, the last 2 quarters should have the dilution from the asset sales, certainly on the retail
side, some of the stock investments already baked into that number and arguably has some of the retail
loss as well. So I'm trying to reconcile those 2 things, where you had been reporting a quarterly number of

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

$0.89, $3.56 annualized, which should already take into account some of this $0.28 of added dilution that
we're talking about for 2020.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

So Michael, it's Joe Macnow again. I'm not prepared to address that question fully, but some of the items
are really one-timers. There was lease cancellation income in the fourth quarter, that was $0.02. There
was a straight line write-off that we anticipated on Penn Plaza that got deferred to 2020, that was another
$0.02. So $0.89 is up $0.02, and 2020 is going to be down $0.02. Those 2 items are a $0.06 swing from
annualizing the fourth quarter, and there has to be many, many more items like that, that Manny and our
team or you and our team can do off-line.

Michael J. Franco
President

Michael, the other thing is the out of service that we cited, right, that's all incremental, right? So that is
Kmart, it's just -- it's a number of little things, frankly, between PENN1, PENN2 that, with further evolution
of our development plans, right, is incremental out of service. Obviously, there was the sale of the free
shares. So there's a number of items that are not run rate from the fourth quarter.

Michael Bilerman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Right. No, and I think that was part of my first question, and I'll get off after this. That $19 million of
reduction for the stuff coming out of service, trying to understand when some of the income will flow back
into the company. I guess trying to understand that aspect of it, [ ever since ] you spend money in the
[ lease of ] space, what type of disclosure are you going to provide? You've provided on Slide 31 the stuff
that comes out. I guess at what point are we going to get some stuff about it coming back in?

Matthew Iocco
Executive VP & Chief Accounting Officer

Well, I think also on Page 31, Michael -- it's Matt Iocco. If you look at the top part of that page, we do
provide the incremental cash yields and the stabilization year we expect to begin to achieve those cash
yields.

Michael Bilerman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Right. But some of that will come in, in '21, '22 -- like it will be phased. And so I was just looking at that
incrementally each year. But anyways, I'll yield the floor.

Operator

From Evercore ISI, we have Steve Sakwa.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess, Michael or Steve, I know you're not going to provide a lot of details around some of the big
pending leases at Farley and PENN2, but can you just kind of help frame some of the discussions and the
timing? And I know you talked about a pretty big pipeline of LOIs and just kind of help us sort of think
through some of the timing at Farley and Two Penn on some of the leasing.

And then some of the commentary you made in the 10-K about kind of the mark-to-markets that you're
seeing on the office component. I realize it's not a lot of square footage, but it sounds like there's about a
20% mark-to-market. So can you just maybe flush out some of the bigger leasing?

Michael J. Franco

10

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Sure. I'll start and Glen can jump in as well. Look, in general, Steve, obviously, there's been press
speculation about a couple of major leases that are in the works, and we're not going to comment on
specific names. I think in my intro remarks, I said those remain on track. And on the normal course, our
expectation would be that we would start finalizing some important leases probably in the next quarter.

In terms of PENN2, we're just showcasing that product now. That's a major redevelopment. Obviously, we
referenced the one lease last quarter, again, which remains on track. And these are major headquarters
leases and going through a normal process right now. I think, again, making very good progress. And I
think next quarter, you'll start to see some real announcements.

Glen, you want to talk more broadly on the pipeline? The only thing I'd say, Steve, on the mark-to-market
is that, again, on a big basis is we are taking -- it's a function, too, of -- right, what are the in-place
rents in terms of what's expiring and where we're taking this to. And given what we're doing in the Penn
District, we've talked about taking the rents from the 60s into the 90s and $100-plus range and that's
starting to be reflected in what we're doing in those -- in that number.

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

Steve, it's Glen. We mentioned in the remarks that we have 1.6 million feet of leasing. Those are in
documentation. So leases are out, and that includes the deals you're referring to in PENN. We're certainly
on track. We feel very good about where we are and there's more activity to come.

As it relates to the overall business, if you think about it, we're 97% full in the core portfolio. We keep
filling up space with our existing tenants. I mean our buildings are in fantastic shape. I mean the core
portfolio, we've redeveloped those buildings over the last 5, 6, 7 years. During that period of time, we've
leased, on average, 2.5 million feet a year in those buildings, and the major tenants continue to expand.
So the 888 Sevenths, the 90 Parks, the 1290s, we're seeing great activity from within the buildings and
from outside. So overall, we have a lot of leases out. We have a lot of other action. So we feel great about
where we're sitting right now.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then, I guess, second question is just, look, I realize that the company is not really driven by
short-term earnings and really is doing the right thing for the real estate. But clearly, coming up with,
effectively, guidance that's well below The Street is a little bit shocking to people of the magnitude. I'm
just curious, as you sort of laid out some of the issues and I realize you can't contemplate everything, are
there any other potential wildcards that we should be thinking about that could potentially hurt earnings
this year or even into next year? Or at this point, have most of the big things been fleshed out and from
here, earnings bottom in '20 and start to rebound in '21 and beyond?

Michael J. Franco
President

I mean Joe referenced the Forever 21 situation, Steve, right? So to the extent that, that is not -- the
leases are not affirmed, then there could be a $0.05 ding on a temporary basis, right? That's the most
near-term insight. Other thing is, obviously, there's always risk of tenant bankruptcies, et cetera, but we
don't -- the numbers we gave you is what is in our purview today. And obviously, there's some positives as
well. But we clearly think that 2020 is the bottom, and we'll start to see strong growth thereafter. And as
we said, look, from a real estate standpoint, we said it ourselves, the steps we're taking in terms of taking
the assets out of service or additional assets out of service, the right thing for our redevelopment plans,
right? And so that's going to create significant value in updating the Kmart, making some modifications
on some of the things we're doing in the district, which impacts the out of service, those are the right
business decisions, right? It's going to create value notwithstanding it has a short-term impact on
earnings.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

From Bank of America, we have Jamie Feldman.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I guess, Michael, just to go back to your last comment, you said 2020 is the bottom, and we'll start to see
strong growth thereafter. Can you just talk through the drivers of the growth in '21, the strong growth in
'21?

Michael J. Franco
President

Jamie, look, you're starting to pressure us into guidance there. I mean the reality is like we'll -- I don't
know if we can take that off-line.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Certainly, Farley coming into...

Michael J. Franco
President

Starts to perform according to time line, but the reality, Jamie, is it's a -- really every part of the business,
particularly, the office business, has grown, 555, New York business, et cetera. We're not going to mention
point by point, but that is the deal. 770, Facebook is fully rent paying at that point.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

And Jamie, it's Joe. While 2019 had many depressions of earnings from asset sales, dot dot dot, we've
grown through that. We don't anticipate that reoccurring, which of course, lets the growth in the core
business not be masked by other dispositions, et cetera, et cetera.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. Yes, I was just trying to figure out the largest moving pieces. It sounds like you listed
them for '21. I guess thinking about the core, can you talk about a same-store growth rate that kind of
looks through all the noise for '20?

Michael J. Franco
President

I don't know if we're prepared to do that on this call, Jamie.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. All right. Then I guess my last question. You, in the past, have talked about a $200 million run rate
for retail NOI. It sounds like that's come down on Forever 21, maybe the Kmart space. How does that --
just for an apples-to-apples comparison, how does that look today and based on what you've outlined?

Michael J. Franco
President

I don't know that what we -- and I remember you asked me last quarter, I don't know that, that really
has changed, right? I think last quarter, we said it was going to be low a $200 million. And we said that,
that was before taking anything out of the LIRR concourse, right? That also is before the Kmart buyout.
So obviously, with those 2 that take it below that number, but those are proactive things we're doing as
opposed to impact from tenancy. So Forever 21, as we talked about, was -- could be on -- both leases are

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

-- go away temporarily. Could be a $10 million ding, but I think it was generally in the number that we
cited to you last quarter.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

So Jamie, a little more color. Last year's reported number, '19's reported number was $267.7 million. The
retail sale will adversely affect that by 25.6 in '20 that wasn't in '19. Other sales will affect that negatively
by almost $3 million. Out of service at Penn Station will affect that negatively by $6 million. Then there
are other tenant items, Forever 21, Topshop, et cetera, et cetera. But our math still is in the low $200s.

Michael J. Franco
President

Before the concourse and Kmart adjustment.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. Before the concourse.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then just to confirm the "guidance" you gave is -- that assumes the Forever 21 leases are cut in
half, but not go to 0 and there's an additional $0.05 if they go to 0, is that correct?

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

That's correct, Jamie.

Operator

From BMO, we have John Kim.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Not to belabor the point, but a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned that this would be -- 2019 will be
the trough year for earnings, and now you're coming out with negative 9.5% for '20. But looking back
2 quarters ago, you already knew about the retail joint venture, the Topshop store closing, the PENN2
redevelopment. So I'm trying to understand what was new over the last 6 months besides Forever 21 and
the Kmart early termination?

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Well, John, it's Joe Macnow. A number of moving parts affected that. We took signage out of service in
the Penn District we didn't anticipate doing when we gave that first set of guidance. We moved leasing
assumptions from '19 to '20. There are numerous, numerous things that affected that but it's over.
We're confident from what Michael told you that '20 will be the trough year, that the growth in '21 will
be substantial. And again, if you'd like to go into greater, greater detail, let's do that off-line but not
monopolize this call with that type of detail.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Sure. Okay. And then you updated your NAV. Now your stock is trading at a 32% discount to it. Wouldn't a
buyback -- I know you've talked about it in the past, but wouldn't buyback help offset some of this dilution
and it would have been a lever or it could be a lever for -- to offset the earnings dilution going forward?

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Michael J. Franco
President

John, look, we recognize we're at a meaningful discount. So the market seems to ignore the NAV we put
out and maybe even the analysts' NAVs. And look, it's something that we have evaluated. We continue to
evaluate. It's not the course of action that we're prepared to embark on today. We are, just as we've done
in the past, we consistently look at ways to try to narrow that gap, first of all, to grow NAV, which is what
we're trying to do through our Penn District redevelopments. But secondly, to close that gap. And we've
shown an ability to execute within accretive transactions, and we are continuing to look at that. Obviously,
a buyback is one way. I don't know if it's as significant in terms of maybe some of the others we've done
in the past, but it's not something that we have felt is the appropriate use of capital yet.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I guess what would be the appropriate time to use it? I mean you have free cash flow that is significant,
you're trading at a big discount, you have some earnings dilution which is near term. I mean if this is not
the right time, then when would it be?

Michael J. Franco
President

As John said, it's a matter of using that capital for that or other things, and we continue to have significant
opportunities to invest in our business. We've outlined the 3 initial redevelopments from the Penn District
that are substantially accretive. And there are opportunities behind that, where our capital, we want to
have available to continue to execute on our redevelopment in the whole district. We're attacking the first
5 million square feet today, but there's significant amounts to do beyond that. And right now, we want to
have that capital available for that or for other purposes.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

One last one from me.

Michael J. Franco
President

We think that's more accretive. We think that's more accretive in terms of NAV creation, John, than you
buy it back for that same amount of capital based on our analysis.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Your earnings decline is more than offset by [ TAMI ] sales of 220 Central Park South, which you don't
include in your normalized FFO. But did you have a $200 million increase in your estimated proceeds?
Because looking at the 10-K, it still looks like you have $1 billion in after-tax profits maintained.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

John, it's Joe again. I saw some confusion from some people on that point. We published in this NAV $1.2
billion, but we didn't say that's the profit on the job. What we described it as is the incremental value for
estimated future proceeds, net. The net is, net, of course, to complete the job, which are winding down
and net of taxes to be paid. Our estimate of profit, which is what you were talking about hasn't changed
from the $1 billion. The $1.2 billion plus $200 million of taxes for $1 billion. But this is the timing of cash
coming into Vornado. If you look at the 10-K, you'll see we've already gotten $1.8 billion from the project.
That $1.8 billion plus this $1.2 billion represents $3 billion, which is the after-tax cash coming from both
the profits of $1 billion and recouping the original investment of $2 billion and the cost to do the job. So
no, we have not increased the sales estimate by $200 million.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

From Stifel, we have John Guinee.

John William Guinee
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Wow, a lot of moving pieces. Just curious, if you look at paying $34 million for the Kmart space, about
141,000 square feet, what do you put in 141,000 square feet of ginormous floor plates? And that's about
$240 a foot, does that imply that the retail there is worth $240 a foot?

Michael J. Franco
President

John, your $240 a foot, I think, is taking the aggregate amount, which is a value, right, as opposed to
an annual rent. I think Kmart was paying us around $60 a foot, maybe a touch less. So I think that's the
more relevant comparison. But we think in terms of that space, their demand as [ they used to have ],
absolutely. I mean that is a bull's eye location right in the heart of the district. And that now having Kmart
back, which was effectively shut off to the Plaza on 33rd Street, we can integrate that and have it facing
both 34th and 33rd Street. And based on our preliminary discussions with a couple of larger-format users
that wouldn't necessarily take it all because we don't want one tenant to take it all given how we're going
to incorporate in redevelopment, there's absolutely going to be strong demand for that space at good
numbers.

John William Guinee
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then just a few quick questions. When do you think you're going to get the hit for the PENN1
ground lease? And is $0.20 a share a good number?

Second, does the train capacity that the governor is thinking, 40%, is that with or without a new tunnel,
which I'm not sure what the status is of the tunnel?

And then third, what are you guys thinking about Manhattan Mall and Hotel Pennsylvania because we're
always under the assumption that, that is pretty soon thereafter?

Michael J. Franco
President

Okay. Let me see if I can take those in order, John. PENN1 ground lease, I think you asked about the
impact there, and that's something we've talked about in the last call or 2. We're not prepared to give an
estimate as to what that can be, right? That's almost 3 years away in terms of that reset, and there's a
lot of factors that go into that reset, whether it's negotiated or arbitrated. There's still a fair amount of
time. Obviously, it's going to be up from today's number, but not something we want to prognosticate,
particularly as we don't want to negotiate in public with our ground lessor.

In terms of the track capacity, the 40%, that's not dependent on a new tunnel. And that's effectively
adding a new terminal to the south and allowing additional trains to basically dead-end coming from the
New Jersey side, but not dependent on gateway per se.

John William Guinee
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And then Manhattan Mall and Hotel Pennsylvania?

Michael J. Franco
President

Look, right now, Manhattan Mall is -- the office building's full and we've got a great tenant who continues
to love the building. So that's performing well. The retail, we're effectively keeping on shorter-term
arrangements. But that asset is cash flowing quite significantly, and that's the plan for the near future.

Hotel Penn we've talked about in the past that as we finish the redevelopments of Farley, PENN1 and
PENN2 and the district transformation becomes evident, Hotel Penn, we think, is going to be the best
development site in the city. And so obviously, we'll see what market conditions are at the time. But that's
the next logical place to build a new building. And at some point, Manhattan Mall could be expansion for
that, but that's years and years away. Not anywhere anytime soon in terms of altering what that asset is.

Operator

From Piper Sandler, we have Alexander Goldfarb.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just a few quick questions here. Just on -- first, on the guidance -- or we'll put guidance in quotes. You
guys talked about for the impact to 2020, that includes the benefit of stopping the -- we're presumably
stopping the ground rent payment on the Topshop Fifth Avenue store?

Michael J. Franco
President

Correct.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then as you guys have laid out the road map for the Penn Station...

Michael J. Franco
President

Alex, just to clarify. Net-net, right, there's diminution from that.

Joseph Macnow
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

But Alex, that's not incomparable FFO. 608 Fifth Avenue is not incomparable FFO. And when that lease
is rejected at some months from today, there'll be a $70 million income item, noncash income item, but
that's not incomparable FFO. So that's not what Michael referred to in his discussion.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Joe, that's helpful. And as far as the road map that you guys provided on the Penn Station and
PENN2 impact, is that consistent with what you guys had originally penciled? Or have -- has that impact
grown as you guys have gotten more involved and have seen what you could do there?

Michael J. Franco
President

That -- the numbers are a bit accelerated, Alex, as we've seen -- as we begin to execute on the plan. So
it's a little more front ended.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then finally...

David R. Greenbaum
Vice Chairman

Alex, it's David. I guess the only thing I'd add to that is our objective is to turn this building into a mid-
to high 90s building on average, if not higher. So to the extent we can get tenants out of this building,

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

our objective effectively is to do so. So that's something that Glen and team have been working on to
accelerate over the last number of months.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

David, that's helpful. And then the final question is you guys clearly are not an earnings story. You're
an NAV story. On the last call, Michael, you talked about Hotel Penn, that it's not time yet. You guys are
sitting on 350 Park. And I hear comments on the brokers community, I was just talking to a guy over the
weekend who was saying that they can't find space under $120 a foot in Plaza District. At what point do
rents on Park Avenue make sense where you can redevelop on Park Avenue? Or is the construction cost
delta just that far that for those of us thinking about value creation for you guys at 350, it's going to be
years out because the math simply doesn't work now or in the foreseeable future? When does the math
work?

Michael J. Franco
President

Alex, look, as I said in my opening comments, we are beginning to take the steps in order to line that site
up for a new development. Now we'll make that decision as we get closer to that time based on market
conditions and so forth. But the feedback from the brokerage community is that, that is the best site in
town and would be -- would command the highest rents. And so I think we may have even referenced
in the past, we have been approached by significant users for either all or a meaningful portion of a new
building on the site. So that is, in terms of the economics, I think it's not a matter of it working today, it's
a matter of can you actually begin to develop. And so if you just think about the timing, we have leases
that run through -- really, beginning 2024, Glen?

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

End of '23.

Michael J. Franco
President

End of '23. And so that's the earliest that we could begin to take the building down. So new delivery
wouldn't be until '27 or '28. And so it's a significant opportunity, but it's going to take some time in order
to bring it to fruition, both in terms of lining up the tenancies and then execute. So I think if we had a
building today, could we command the rents to achieve the yield necessary to develop? The answer is we
think quite possibly. To build a brand new building that's perfect in that location, we think today would
command rents that would make that work.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And that would be the JV with Rudin?

Michael J. Franco
President

The answer is it could go either way, Alex. We can build on our own, we don't need Rudin to build there.
We can build a -- probably the best boutique building that's 1 million square foot boutique building on that
site on our own or we can combine with Rudin who's behind us and build close to a 2 million square foot
building. So the answer is as we continue to move down the tracks here in terms of timing on our leases
and whatnot, this building -- BlackRock's moving around -- out in 2023 as well. So they line up for that.
So we can put them together, but we'll evaluate based on tenant discussions, and obviously, a tenant with
a whole combined building would require getting a significant pre-lease, which there's interest in. So the
answer is it's too early to tell which direction it can go but either is possible.

From Morgan Stanley, we have Vikram Malhotra.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

On the -- just on expirations in -- on the office and retail side, we obviously have the big move out in
PENN, but you've also kind of alluded to a 20% mark-to-market in your 10-K. Can you kind of outline
what's driving that view? And any other major leases that are expiring in 2020 that we should be aware
about on the office side? And on the retail side, I think it's more flattish mark-to-market. But there's a big
expiration in 4Q of '20. Can you remind us what that is?

David R. Greenbaum
Vice Chairman

In 2020, our expiration totaled approximately 525,000 feet, that's after you take McGraw-Hill out of
service, which is a 560,000 sole lease which expires at the end of March. On the mark-to-market, we're
coming off $70 rents. We think that goes 20% to, let's call it, mid-80s number. Remember, quarter-to-
quarter, these numbers fluctuate. There's no rule of thumb, obviously. But as we look out on our leasing
projections, the spaces that are coming up for expiration plus all the activity that we've been talking about
this morning, we feel the mid-80s number coming off a $70 rent is in the ballpark of what we're going to
hit.

Michael J. Franco
President

And again, Vikram, that's not to speak necessarily to timing, right? In other words, the timing on those
new leases may not necessarily occur in 2020. But that's our expectation in terms of where, on average,
they will get marked to, right? As retailers...

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So that includes the 500 that you highlighted, but potentially other leases and you're just -- that's sort
of a broad statement saying, in general, coming off of $70 rents and we think, overall, we can get a 20%
mark-to-market, including, kind of, new leases?

David R. Greenbaum
Vice Chairman

Correct.

Michael J. Franco
President

And then on the retail, which as you said, is more flattish, that's, again, no big leases. Probably half of
that is in the Penn District, which given everything we're doing there, we feel good about. And that may
-- some of that may be take -- we frankly, intentionally, take a little longer there to get the right mix of
tenants. But again, that's a fairly -- no big leases, fairly diversified set of expiries.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. So not even in 4Q? It just seemed like there was a large chunk in 4Q 2020.

But maybe just building off of that. In Fifth Avenue, over the last, call it, 12 or 18 months, there have
been a number of vacancies over there. I'm just sort of wondering, what does this mean for -- in your
view, what does this mean for sort of Upper Fifth rent per foot in sustainability and specifically, the ability
to lease-up your vacancy there?

Haim Chera
Executive VP & Head of Retail

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

This is Haim. On Fifth Avenue, we have one vacancy on Upper Fifth Avenue. We love our corner. We have
a great property. It sits on the 50-yard line on the luxury side of Fifth Avenue. And while it's too early to
call a rebound in luxury leasing, we do have a lot of confidence in the quality of our assets and the positive
momentum that we feel is going on today in luxury retail among the strong brands with a strong balance
sheet who have profitable business lines. So early to call a rebound, but still confident in the quality of
what we have. We happen to dominate the best-in-class retail assets, and we have confidence in that.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And Haim, if I can just ask you, just on the -- if I remember correctly, in your vacancy rents, they were
well below market. But just given the broader vacancies on Fifth Avenue, it seems like asking is still kind
of above $2,500 or $2,800 a foot. But like what is the true sustainable per foot rate if you would just take
sort of a longer term view? I'm not looking for your specific mark-to-market, but just that -- the Upper
Fifth area, what's a more sustainable level?

Haim Chera
Executive VP & Head of Retail

I believe the sustainable rents are not where peak rents have hit on Fifth Avenue. There were leases
signed in the $4,000 to $5,000 a square foot range at peak. I do believe it's down significantly from there
in terms of affordability. But there are brands with significant margins and huge balance sheets that can
do a lot of business in the market. There are still well over half a dozen brands that have more than $100
million in sales on Fifth Avenue. And those are the customers that will look for sustainable rents in the
range of what you're talking about.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just last clarification. The stabilization that you've outlined for Farley, '22, I know you
said that you're pretty confident of lease-up. We'll hear more news. But just from a modeling perspective
to kind of get to that '22 stabilization, like what sort of -- when do you have to get the leases done? Or
what's sort of in the model that we have to get leasing done to achieve that stabilization before maybe it
gets pushed out into '23?

Michael J. Franco
President

It's going to be...

Haim Chera
Executive VP & Head of Retail

[ Probably now ].

Michael J. Franco
President

Yes, I was going to say, the next 3 months or so.

Vikram Malhotra

Okay. So you would need to get a lease done in the next 3 months before you lease the [ property ] out.

Michael J. Franco
President

Yes, Vikram, as we've talked about, the office -- as I said, the office lease is on track and the retail
leasing, which I described in the opening remarks, and we are in active negotiation on the leases on the

reason. I mean we're sitting on an awful lot of cash, there's no reason really to increase leverage.

And then maybe just for the New York Office portfolio outside of Penn Plaza. Can you frame how you guys
are seeing that effect of rent growth in '20? Should we -- are you guys expecting something more in line
with inflation or something above that?

David R. Greenbaum
Vice Chairman

We're seeing rents still strong. Rents in Midtown are at all-time highs, right now hovering at $80 a foot.
We feel good about the portfolio, the strength of the buildings with which we're leasing right now. So we
feel that rents are still going up in most submarkets, including in many of our buildings. But again, it's
case-by-case as we lease-up. I mean, again, we don't have a lot of space to come in that core portfolio as
I talked about earlier.

And if you have a ballpark where in-place rents sits outside of your Penn District office portfolio in
Manhattan, can you frame how far below market those rents would be?

Michael J. Franco
President

Dan, I don't want to give you a number on the phone here, it'd be a guess as opposed to a precision.
But I'm comfortable saying there, the in-place rents are below the market rents. But again, don't want to
quantify how much that would be, that'd be a little off the cuff. I think going back to your first question,
we're seeing -- and I think I talked about it in the opening remarks is if you have redeveloped your
building -- you have new buildings, we are seeing real rental growth there, right? In the Penn District,
we are seeing significant rental growth given the transformation of not only the area but the assets. And
then the sort of normal course traditional Midtown assets, I think that's probably a little bit more 3%,

4% type growth. Again, just -- I would say all the way on the West Side with Chelsea and Meatpacking,
you're continuing to see above that. So I think the trends have remained fairly consistent, although I think
Midtown has been a little stronger in the last 4 to 5 months than it was in the middle part of last year.
