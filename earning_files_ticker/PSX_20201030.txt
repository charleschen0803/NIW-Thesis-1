Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Phillips 66 Earnings Conference Call. My name is David, and I will be
your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jeff, you may begin.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to the Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. Participants on
today's call will include Greg Garland, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, EVP and CFO; Bob Herman, EVP,
Refining; Brian Mandell, EVP, Marketing and Commercial; and Tim Roberts, EVP of Midstream. Today's
presentation material can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with
supplemental financial and operating information.

Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during the
presentation and our Q&A session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors
that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for opening remarks.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

Our diversified integrated portfolio, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation enable us to
navigate through this challenging market environment. In the third quarter, we delivered improved results
in our Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing businesses. We had an adjusted loss of $1 million or $0.01 per
share and generated $795 million of operating cash flow, excluding working capital.

We're proud of our employees and how they continue to step up to the challenges of 2020, including
the pandemic, the West Coast fires, Gulf Coast hurricanes. Most recently, our people responded to the
storms by helping their families, their neighbors and safeguarding our assets. Through our employees'
commitment to operating excellence, our facilities were secured and sustain minimal damage. Our
company has provided $7 million in assistance to our employees and contributions to communities across
the Gulf Coast to help those affected by the storms.

Our employees continue to execute our strategy with an unwavering focus on operating excellence in what
has been a very uncertain and challenging environment. Our year-to-date safety results are exceeding last
year's industry-leading performance despite the current challenges. Every day, we strive toward a zero
incident, zero accident workplace and to keep our people healthy and safe.

In the third quarter, we returned $393 million to our shareholders through dividends. We remain
committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Since we formed the company, we returned
over $27 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and exchanges.

In the near term, our focus is on ensuring the financial and operational strength of our company and
overcoming this period of market weakness. We expect to exceed the $500 million in cost reductions and
the $700 million in consolidated capital spending reductions announced earlier this year.

We will continue to maintain disciplined capital allocation with a focus on long-term value creation for our
shareholders. We're executing our growth strategy and achieved a major milestone with the completion
of the Sweeny Hub Phase 2 expansion. We completed the 2 new 150,000 barrel a day fractionators at the
Sweeny Hub, bringing the site's total fractionation capacity to 400,000 barrels per day. Frac 2 reached full

rates in September, and Frac 3 started operations in October. Both fractionators have operated at rates
exceeding design capacity. The fractionators are supported by long-term customer commitments.

Phillips 66 Partners continued construction on the C2G pipeline, connecting its Clemens Storage Caverns to
petrochemical facilities in the Corpus Christi area. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is
expected to be completed in mid-2021.

At the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the first stock and 5.1 million barrels of storage capacity have been
commissioned. Terminal operations are expected to ramp up through the end of this year as additional
phases of construction are finished. We expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2021
with a total storage capacity of 8.6 million barrels and up to 800,000 barrels per day of export capacity.
Phillips 66 partners owns 25% interest in the terminal.

As we wrap up our major projects in execution this year, we expect that total capital spending for 2021
will be $2 billion or less. We look forward to sharing the details of our 2021 capital program with you in
December, plying the approval of our Board.

Phillips 66 recognizes the climate challenge and is making investments to competitively position the
company for a more carbon future. Recently, we announced plans to reconfigure our San Francisco
Refinery in Rodeo, California, into the world's largest renewable fuels facility to meet the growing demand
for renewable energy. The plant will no longer produce fuels from crude oil, but instead, will have the
flexibility to run used cooking oil, fats, greases and other feedstocks. Upon completion in early 2024, the
facility will have over 50,000 barrels per day or 800 million gallons per year of renewable fuel production
capacity.

This capital-efficient investment is expected to deliver strong returns. The conversion is expected to
reduce the plant's greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and help California meet its low carbon objectives.

Earlier this month, CPChem announced its first commercial scale production of polyethylene from recycled
mixed waste plastics. This development is an important milestone, further demonstrating CPChem's
commitment to proactively help the world find sustainable solutions, including elimination of plastics waste
in the environment.

We have a dual challenge of providing affordable, abundant, reliable energy to the world and also
addressing the global climate challenge. Our company is committed to both, while continuing to deliver
shareholder returns.

So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financials.

Kevin J. Mitchell
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial
results. We reported a third quarter loss of $799 million. We had special items amounting to an after-tax
loss of $798 million including impairments related to the planned conversion of the San Francisco refinery
to a renewable fuels facility as well as the cancellation of the Red Oak pipeline project.

Excluding special items, we had an adjusted loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share. Operating cash flow
was $795 million, excluding working capital. Adjusted capital spending for the quarter was $549 million,
including $347 million for growth projects. We returned $393 million to shareholders through dividends.

Moving to Slide 5. This slide shows the change in adjusted results from the second quarter to the third
quarter, an improvement of $323 million. Adjusted pretax results across all segments were improved,
except refining. The income tax benefit was mainly driven by bonus depreciation on assets recently
completed and the ability under the CARES Act to carry back net operating losses to previous periods.

Slide 6 shows our midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $354 million, an increase
of $109 million from the previous quarter. Transportation-adjusted pretax income was $202 million, up
$72 million from the previous quarter. The increase was due to higher pipeline and terminal volumes

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

supported by recovering demand. Third quarter results reflect a ramp-up of volumes on the Gray Oak
pipeline and the start-up of South Texas Gateway Terminal.

NGL and other delivered adjusted pretax income of $102 million. The $19 million increase from the prior
quarter was due to higher Sweeny Hub volumes and inventory impacts.

At the Sweeny Hub, the Freeport LPG Export Facility averaged 12 cargoes per month, and Frac 1 averaged
120,000 barrels per day. DCP Midstream adjusted pretax income of $50 million was up $18 million from
the previous quarter, reflecting hedging impacts.

Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Third quarter adjusted pretax income was $132 million, up $43 million
from the second quarter. Olefins and polyolefins' adjusted pretax income was $148 million. The $42 million
increase from the previous quarter is due to higher polyethylene margins driven by improved sales prices,
partially offset by lower polyethylene volumes and higher operating costs.

Global O&P utilization was 94%, reflecting downtime at U.S. Gulf Coast facilities. CPChem proactively shut
down facilities in preparation for the storms that made landfall in the third quarter. The facility sustained
minimal damage and have returned to normal operations. Adjusted pretax income for SA&S decreased $6
million, primarily due to lower margins, partially offset by higher volumes. During the third quarter, we
received $112 million in cash distributions from CPChem.

Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining third quarter adjusted pretax loss was $970 million, down from
an adjusted pretax loss of $867 million last quarter. The decrease was due to lower realized margins
partially offset by higher volumes. Realized margins for the quarter decreased by 32% to $1.78 per barrel.
The decrease reflects tightening crude spreads and the absence of the steep contango market structure
experienced in the second quarter. In addition, secondary product margins were lower due to rising crude
prices.

Crude utilization was 77% compared with 75% last quarter. Improved utilization reflects increased
refining runs in the Central Corridor and West Coast regions, partially offset by downtime at Gulf Coast
refineries. We shut the Lake Charles Refinery in late August and the Alliance Refinery in mid-September in
preparation for Hurricanes Laura and Sally. Lake Charles' downtime was extended due to third-party power
supply issues following Hurricane Laura, and restart was further delayed by Hurricane Delta.

The Lake Charles Refinery has safely resumed operations, and Alliance remains down for planned
turnaround activity. Pretax turnaround costs were $41 million, in line with the prior quarter. The third
quarter clean product yield was 85%.

Slide 9 covers market capture. The 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $8.17 per barrel
compared to $7.47 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $1.78 per barrel and resulted in
an overall market capture of 22%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 35%.

Market capture is impacted by refinery configuration. We make less gasoline and more distillate than
premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. During the quarter, the distillate crack decreased $2.46 per barrel,
and the gasoline crack improved $2.27 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $1.80 per barrel
increased $0.85 per barrel from the previous quarter due to rising crude prices.

Losses from feedstock were $0.35 per barrel compared with $0.67 per barrel last quarter. The other
category reduced realized margins by $2.77 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean
product realizations and inventory impacts.

Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pretax income was $417 million,
$124 million higher than the second quarter. Marketing and other increased $107 million due to higher
margins and volumes. The marketing business captured strong margins during the quarter and benefited
from recovering demand. Specialties increased $17 million due to higher finished lubricants volumes.

We reimaged 284 domestic branded sites during the third quarter, bringing the total to approximately
5,000 since the start of the program. In our international marketing business, we reimaged 31 European

6

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

sites, bringing the total to 143 since the program's inception. Refined product exports in the third quarter
were 139,000 barrels per day, a decrease from the prior quarter.

On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pretax costs of $213 million, a decrease of
$11 million from the prior quarter. The improvement is primarily due to lower employee-related expenses,
partially offset by higher net interest expense.

Slide 12 shows the change in cash for the quarter. We started the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash on our
balance sheet. Cash from operations was $795 million, excluding working capital. There was a working
capital use of $304 million driven by an increase in tax receivables. Our net debt issuances were $70
million. Adjusted capital spending was $549 million.

We expect full year 2020 adjusted capital to be approximately $2.9 billion. We returned $393 million
to shareholders through dividends. Our ending cash balance was $1.5 billion. We remain focused on
conserving cash and maintaining strong liquidity in the current environment. At September 30, we had $7
billion of committed liquidity, reflecting $1.5 billion of cash plus available capacity on our credit facilities of
$5 billion at Phillips 66 and $0.5 billion of Phillips 66 Partners.

This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items.

In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining,
crude utilization will be adjusted according to market conditions. In October, utilization has been in the
mid-60% range, impacted by downtime at the Lake Charles and Alliance refineries. We expect fourth
quarter pretax turnaround expenses to be between $80 million and $100 million. We anticipate fourth
quarter Corporate and Other costs come in between $220 million and $230 million pretax.
With that, we'll now open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My opening question is around the balance sheet. Can you -- and the dividend outlook from here. I think
the message today is that you guys view the dividend as sustainable. But can you just talk to that? And
then can you also just give us some flavor, maybe this is for Kevin, about conversations with the ratings
agencies about credit? And how do you feel about where your balance sheet position is right now?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Let me take the first part and Kevin take the second. I think -- I mean, Neil, first of all, one of the things
I've learned is you never say never, right, in this business. But all the actions that we've taken to date,
cutting our costs, cutting our CapEx, increasing our liquidity have been around defending the dividend.

And as you look at Q3, essentially, we covered our CapEx and our dividend through cash. Certainly, we
feel comfortable as we -- if things don't get any better and we stay kind of where we're at, then we feel
really comfortable that our first dollar is going to go stay in capital at $1 billion, our second dollar is going
to go to the dividend, $1.6 billion that we can cover sustaining CapEx and our dividend from our cash.

I think that's one of the great strengths of the PSX portfolio and the diversified nature of our portfolio. So
I'll let Kevin talk a little bit about the balance sheet and expectations there.

Kevin J. Mitchell
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. So we've consistently expressed our objective to maintain a strong balance sheet, keep that financial
flexibility, and that's reflected in our credit ratings, Aaa at Moody's and BBB+ at S&P. As you would
expect, this year with a couple of debt issuances that we've done, we've had plenty of opportunity to have
conversations with the rating agencies.

Those have gone well. Our ratings have stayed where they are. We've had no actions, and we still have a
stable outlook on the current rating. So we feel good about that.

In the event that we need to go to the balance sheet, we feel pretty comfortable that we still have decent
capacity without having a detrimental impact on the overall health of the balance sheet. So you think from
a long-term standpoint, our objective is to have a solid investment-grade credit rating, and we're clearly
there at this point.

We've added some debt. We've also talked about a 30% debt-to-capital ratio. We're above that right
now. I think as we come through this current situation, then we were able to get debt back down, we'd
anticipate that over time, we'd like to see ourselves back in around about that range. But we've always
said that's not an absolute target. The real objective is to maintain the solid investment-grade credit
ratings, and we're comfortably there, and we feel good that we can stay there.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And a follow-up is just around marketing. It was a strong quarter there. Just any flavor in terms of
what drove the outperformance? And real time, what are you seeing for demand in the markets that you
serve?

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Neil. Yes, we're very happy with the marketing earnings in Q3. Versus Q2, we were up 40% on
margins in the U.S. and 16% on volume. Overseas, we were up 23% on margins and volumes as well. I
think a number of things. If you look at Q2, underlying commodity flat price came off hard in April, and it
was up May and June. And as you know, flat price is inversely correlated to marketing margins. So that
helped our margins a good bit. Also, the volumes, of course, were up in Q3 versus Q2 when COVID was
more fierce during the Q2 time period.

Currently, we're seeing gasoline off about 10% in the U.S. And when we talked to our large truck stop
customers, they say that, until recently, diesel demand was back up to pre-COVID levels, but they've
started to see it come off a bit, 3%, 4% type levels. Overseas, we were back up to 100% of demand pre-
COVID levels. Currently, with lockdowns tightening just a bit, we're seeing those levels come off just a few
percentage points, but kind of happy with where we've gotten to from the lows in early Q2.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

One thing I might add, we've seen strength on the West Coast. The Port of LA port is up 13% year-on-
year. And we're actually seeing PADD 5 diesel demand up year-on-year. So some strength, especially on
the West Coast.

Operator

Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just want to start with the question on refining here. Some of your peers are acknowledging that the U.S.
industry needs to close 1 million barrels a day of capacity in order to balance the market. You guys have
obviously taken some action here with Rodeo.

I'm curious how you think about the U.S. refining industry, the amount of capacity that needs to close?
And with respect to the existing system as it stands and where utilization is, how do you think about your
individual refineries and whether it makes sense to have a temporary idling or permanent idling at some
point for another refinery?

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

Neil (sic) [ Phil ], it's Bob. I think we would agree there needs to continue to be some rationalization
between the U.S. and the European refining system. But specifically in the U.S., right, the refineries
kind of run the gamut between really strong and there's some -- maybe some weaker assets out there.
But fundamentally, the U.S. refining system is the most complex, lowest cost refining system with the
exception of maybe a couple of big assets in the Middle East.

So I think as demand rationalizes over time, the U.S. is really positioned to be a strong player. You'll see
some export activity that will rise over time into Latin America and South America into West Africa, but the
U.S. really does stand to take up that mantle as we go forward.

Having said that, there will be assets that will continue to rationalize out of this, and you've seen it on
both the East Coast and the West Coast. And no doubt, some of the maybe landlock players as time goes
on here will have difficulties as crude diffs remain squeezed in the U.S.

And Jeff, you've got some numbers on closure so far.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Yes. We've been tracking announced refinery closures. And in fact, we've had to revise it 3 times this
week. I think we're up to almost 2 million barrels a day of announced closures globally. There's another
700,000 barrels a day of temporary closures and then another 700,000 barrels a day of refineries that
have talked about potential of converting into terminals or other activities. So 3 million to 3.5 million
barrels a day globally.

It's kind of split regionally with equal parts of U.S., Europe, and Asia. We've even seen an Australia
refinery that's been announced closure earlier today. And as you listen to many of the integrated oil
companies, they've made comments on planning to further reduce their exposure in the downstream. So
we're moving rapidly through rationalization.

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

I think as we watched diesel inventories come off really hard over the last few weeks here, I think that's
a little bit of light at the end of this tunnel for margins to improve. And with margins improving, utilization
will come back as the market dictates. But until that kind of happens, I don't think we'll see it.

The growth in GDP numbers this last week, I think, are a really good bellwether that says diesel demand
should continue to strengthen into the winter and the normal cold season and the burning of heating oil in
the North is going to be a help.

So I think we might be in a position to tread a little water here for a couple of months. But I think it's
setting ourselves up that as we get to spring and look forward into next year's gasoline season, that we do
have a real chance of returning to a lot more normalcy in the margin structure and then utilization.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. Just a follow-up on your own refining performance here in the quarter and the pace of
margin normalization. How do you think about, I guess, the capture rates that you've been seeing this
quarter and last quarter?

Obviously, hurricane effects. Kevin, you called out a number of factors in the other bucket that were
headwinds here in the quarter. So how do you think about the sensitivity of capture rates to the overall
margin profile? And as we move forward, if margins get better, captures get better and things like that
versus maybe some one-off items that may have happened in the quarter?

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes. I think the way I look at the capture rate is when you've got cracks that are down in the $6 to $8
range, right, those are -- that part is kind of covering your cost. And then crude diffs are really, as a
refining system, where we make our money. And when we haven't -- we've seen very tight crude dips on
just about every flavor of crude across our system. So it's hard to get much crack expansion there.

The other thing that plays into it, too, when you're at low utilization and low cracks, kind of the fixed part
of the barrel, which is the 11% or 12% that we don't turn into clean product. That kind of $2 offset that
you see on those margins is a lot bigger deal at an $8 margin than it was at a $15 margin.

So that -- those 2 factors for me really come in and kind of camp down that margin capture ability.

Operator

Roger Read from Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess I'd maybe like change the direction a little bit from refining to the midstream. Greg, probably a
question for you. But one of the pushbacks we get is with E&Ps changing behavior, maybe a little less

10

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

production growth in coming years. You've built out a lot in the midstream. Can you kind of characterize
for us how midstream should perform in a maybe more static production growth market? And what your
exposure would be to any sort of, let's say, reprice on tariffs or export fees and so forth?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Tim, I'll let you take that.

Timothy D. Roberts
VP & Director of Operations

Yes, Roger, on that, a couple of things when you look at our portfolio, specifically, is that we've been
in earnest trying to develop MDCs and make sure we get commitments. And so those have been very
important for us with regard to long-term commitments, MDCs with good counterparties, investment
grade. So that's been very helpful for our portfolio, especially on the third parties.

But then also as a sponsored MLP, we have quite a bit of exposure with regard to PSX. So that helps to
also shore up some of our earnings volatility, you see. But also, just on a fundamental basis, we do see
that there will be basin growth. Yes, granted everyone's at a state of uncertainty and what's going on out
there and they're retrenching a bit. But we still think there's going to be a call on managed shale with
regard to global demand to support growth in that area over the next couple of years.

And the other part I would say just when you look at our portfolio specifically, it's just really that we
really participate in the crude side. But we're also got a good weighting with regard to the NGL space as
well, which actually, during this time, has been rather resilient and supporting about chemicals, global
chemicals demand, growth, res com and then subsequently also going into the motor fuel pool as well.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

I think the average term across our portfolio is probably 8-ish years. And so we've got some time to
ride through this. I do agree that the next 1- to 3-year period, there's going to be fewer investable
opportunities in midstream, and it's going to become more of a run well and optimized business for many
people. I think you'll see some consolidation of midstream over the next couple of years. And so I think
that the model going forward the next couple of years is it's going to be a little bit different than the model
we've executed the last 5 years.

And the other thing I would say is somewhere around 80% probably across the portfolio is under MDCs.
And so we think we're really set up well to ride through this next couple of years of our Midstream
business and still deliver great performance in our midstream business.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And just a follow-up. Kevin, for you. With the working capital related to a tax adjustment, can you
kind of walk us through working capital expectations into the end of the year?

Typically, I think Phillips gets a pretty big pull on working capital. And then part on the tax, when would
you expect to recover the actual tax receivable there?

Kevin J. Mitchell
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. Okay. So on the tax component, as you see on the financial statement, a significant tax benefit on
the income statement, but that's not turning into cash in the current year. That's flowing through the
receivable. And on a year-to-date basis, we've increased our tax receivable by $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion
year-to-date and that, we would anticipate collecting next year post completion of our 2020 tax return.
And so we would expect that to turn into cash sometime in the second quarter of next year.

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

From a broader working capital expectation going into the third quarter, you're going to see 2 dynamics
going on. One is, to the extent that the current operating environment stays as it's been, which it appears
to be, then from a tax standpoint, you'd still expect to be generating losses. And so you'll have that
negative effect on working capital.

But we typically have an inventory draw in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate that happening again this
year. And so that will generate some positive cash from a working capital perspective.

Operator

Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Greg, I wonder if I could just pick up on the comment you made there about a slightly different business
model for the midstream than we've seen in the last 5 years. I wonder if I could ask you to elaborate on
that with specific focus on your ownership structure of PSXP?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think that -- I mean, first of all, I think that the upstream and the pace of drilling upstream will
determine the pace of opportunities in midstream for any future growth. So we talked about that a lot,
and so we'll see. I suspect we're in a period of stronger capital discipline from the upstream players in
a mode of returning more capital to shareholders, which will, by definition, probably slow the growth of
upstream. And conversely, that will limit the investable opportunities in midstream. So we recognize that.
We're supportive of that. We think that's the right thing for the energy space long term in our country.

For PSXP, it still highlights the value of our midstream business, and we like that. I think that it's a model
that we'll continue to move forward. We evaluate alternative scenarios for PSXP, just like we do for any
other asset in our portfolio as we move forward. But at this point in time, we still like the MLP structure. I
think we would all acknowledge that the life cycle of an MLP has probably been shortened versus what it
was maybe 5 years ago or 6 years ago.

Kevin, I don't know -- or Tim, if you want to add anything to that?

Kevin J. Mitchell
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

No, I think you covered it.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. I don't want to elaborate too much on that. But when you see it trading with a 15% yield, Greg,
would it make sense to buy that in at some point?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

I think -- well, for PSXP, certainly, I would say we're not happy with where the units are trading, and we
look at that 15% yield and scratch your head a little bit, Doug. But I also think that PSXP has that DAPL
overhang. And I think that if you look at where the units are trading today, I think most people are priced
in a complete shutdown of DAPL. And so we're not there. But that's in the hands of someone else and a
Judge that, hopefully, I guess, year-end or early next year, we'll get a determination on that.

So I don't know, Tim or Jeff, you want to add anything to that. But the overhang is what we're looking at
right now.

Executive VP of Finance & CFO

That's right.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

My follow-up is kind of a broad question. I don't know which one of you guys wants to answer this, but we
got an election in 3 or 4 days in case you weren't aware.

But what do you see as the principal risks to your business? Whether it be tax, whether it be regulation,
whether it be something like DAPL, just give us a quick summary as to how you're preparing for a
potential change in administration?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Well, first of all, for clarity, none of us want to answer that question. So I guess this falls to me to answer
it. So I think in a DDD scenario, there's no question that from a regulatory standpoint, it's going to be
a tougher environment for all kinds of infrastructure. But energy, in particular, our base case view is
probably going to look something more like we saw 8 years under the Obama, Biden administration than
what we've seen for the last 4 years.

I do think that infrastructure is going to be harder to permit. I think pipelines in particular will be harder
to permit. So you can make a case that the existing pipes probably worth more in the ground under that
kind of scenario. I think without question, corporate taxes are going to go up in that scenario, which, by
the way, should help the MLP structure just in terms of relative cost of capital versus a C-corp. So we're
looking at that.

And then we'll see where we end up on climate and climate solutions. But I think that the odds are
probably higher that you have some sort of cost of carbon that emerges with time in a DDD scenario
versus the status quo.

So that's kind of how we're thinking about it holistically and kind of the impacts to our business. Jeff, I
don't know if you want to add anything?

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

It's well then.

Operator

Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Greg, if I can follow-up on that but string it to Europe. With the new climate law going to -- get voted
on and most likely get passed very soon, how that -- you're looking at your asset in Europe and how --
what's the game plan? Do you need to fundamentally change how you operate the refining and also the
retail operation?

And the second question...

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Paul, I'm sorry, I missed the first part of that question.

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

The first part is that with the European, the EU going to vote on the climate law, how that is going to
change your operation? And what is the game plan for your European assets, whether that you need to
fundamentally change the way how you operate? Or that -- I mean, do you have any view that under the
new climate law, how those assets should be? So that's the first question.

The second question is that somewhat related. In your larger customers in Europe, they're all coming up
with a formal energy transition plan. And we assume that at a Biden administration, as Doug has asked
the question. So does Phillips 66 need to formulate a formal energy transition plan? And is that -- does
that involve in some form of diversifying into other business? I.e. your larger customers, they're all getting
into the renewable or low carbon electricity power business.

So is that something you guys will be interested or that you're saying, you know what, this is different,
and it's not for us.

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

So I'll take a stab at that, Paul. I mean first of all, there's aspirational goals out there. And there's
probably reality and what can actually be accomplished during that time frame. And so I think our view
is that fossil fuels on both in transportation and, like, power generation are going to be around for quite
a long time, multiple decades. That doesn't mean there's not more that we can do in terms of energy
transition.

Obviously, for us, the things that are nearest to us like renewable diesel, those kind of opportunities
where you see us starting to move in those areas. By the way, including in Rodeo, we're looking at carbon
capture, we're looking at solar in conjunction with that project. So I think you'll see us move in those
areas.

We're starting to add hydrogen fueling stations in Europe with our partner, Coop in Switzerland. We're part
of the Gigastack consortium in the United Kingdom, which is essentially green hydrogen. We have offshore
wind [ trellises ] producing hydrogen to be consumed in the industrial base in the Humber side area. And
so I think we continue to study and look at that.

We think hydrogen is really multiple decades away from -- a big step forward in terms of transportation
fuel. A lot of it, it's technology, it's cost. The green hydrogen is probably 5 to 7x more than the steam
reforming of methane. And so I think that there's some opportunities there.

We continue to work our battery technology. We're working on next-generation batteries in our research
and development, solid oxide fuel cell development also in our research and development areas. And so
we've got quite a bit going on in terms of energy transition within the portfolio.

But the nearest easiest steps for us to take are really to move towards lower carbon intensity fuels like the
projects at Rodeo, like Rise. Also, we're -- Humber, we're making about 1,000 barrels a day of renewable
diesel, going about 4,000 to 5,000 barrels a day here shortly. We've got a project -- San Francisco actually
comes on, I think, first quarter next year?

Yes. Why don't you talk about that? What we've got going on?

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes. So we've announced the big project at Rodeo. But before that comes on, while we're still running
a fuels refinery there, we're converting one of our hydro figures to be able to run soybean-based oils
to make our renewable diesel. And that unit will produce about 9,000 barrels a day at a very attractive
capital efficiency on that project. And that sets us up to begin the -- setting up our supply chains into
Rodeo and our marketing chains on the other side of that for the renewable diesel out of Rodeo.

The next step we'll take then is the commercial agreement we have with [ Rise ], who is building 2
renewable diesel facilities, one in Reno, one in Las Vegas, where we will supply the feedstocks and take all

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

of the renewable diesel offtake, be able to put that into the California market. That's our next step forward
in kind of late '20 and '21.

And then we would expect to have the permitting done sometime in '22 and begin the conversion of the
Rodeo refinery to eventually have the largest renewable diesel facility in the world and make about 50,000
barrels a day of renewable diesel. Feedstocks for that, our premise to be about 80% of the harder-to-
process feedstock. So that's used cooking oil, fats, oils, greases, tallows, from a variety of sources around
the world.

And Rodeo is really uniquely positioned because, a, we sit in the California market where there's a high
demand for lower carbon intensity fuels. And secondly, we have water access to the Far East to bring in all
of these difficult-to-process renewable feedstocks.

So the second piece is that it's a hydrocracking facility. We have 2 high-pressure hydrocrackers there that
will be converted to both process renewable feedstocks and very capital efficient. At the end of the day, we
will convert the facility and build the pretreatment facilities for a total capital cost of about $1 per gallon
per year of capacity.

That's 50% cheaper than anything else we've seen announced and then sometimes 3x cheaper than some
of the competing projects we've seen in that. So we feel really good that by 2024, we will be a major
player in the renewable fuels in California and other places in the United States.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

I think, just to highlight, the $750 million to $800 million, that's one of the biggest projects we have in the
portfolio at this time. So we're making a substantial investment there.

Operator

Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

You mentioned about 80% lower CI feedstock and 20%, most likely soya bean and canola. Generally,
in the current market, what kind of discounts are these lower CI, harder-to-process feedstock carrying
versus the soya bean oil? So soya bean oil is trading at $0.33 per pound. Like, where are these harder-to-
process feedstocks trading at a discount to soya bean oil?

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

I think, Manav, there's a fair amount of variance from region to region on the feedstocks and the
transportation cost to get them from point A to point B. So I think the important thing is, is that we
have the flexibility as we operate to pick the lowest cost feedstock in the market. And it's similar to high
complexity refining, where you've got a lot of flexibility on what feedstocks and what yields you have.

We're building in with the pretreating capability that flexibility to take advantage of the lowest cost, most
optimal feedstock in order to produce the renewable diesel. So we're, I think, well positioned in that
regard.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. A quick follow-up is you initially mentioned the multiple storms that hit you both in chemicals as
well as the refining part. Is there any kind of opportunity cost you lost out because of all these hurricanes?
Or can you just give us a sequence of like which are the facilities that did get impacted by subsequent
hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast?

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes, I'll take a shot at that. On the -- with the first one, if you recall, it seems like a long time ago now,
but on August 25, we shut down the Lake Charles facility for Hurricane Laura and ended up being down
all the whole month of September because of the power infrastructure in the General Lake Charles region
that was essentially completely destroyed. We did not start restarting that facility until early October. And
in fact, we didn't have full power back into the refinery to be able to operate as anything that we wanted
to until October 5.

Unfortunately then on October 9, Hurricane Delta came essentially right back up the same path. And
while it was a lower intensity storm, we still had to shut back down and essentially start over. Power
infrastructure held up a little better in that time frame. So about the middle of October, we started
restarting the Lake Charles facility.

So today, we're back up and running there. We've still got a few units left to start, but we will be market
dictating the rate. But we'll be -- everything that we want to be up will be up and running here within the
next week or 10 days at Lake Charles.

In Alliance, we shut down September 13 for Hurricane Sally, which was originally pointed right at Alliance.
We got lucky with that one and that, of course, moved off a little bit, and we did not take a direct hit. We
chose to keep Alliance down because we had some maintenance planned for October anyway. And rather
than restart and shut back down for that, we just moved the maintenance back up.

Maybe fortuitous, maybe only in 2020, can you say being down is fortuitous, but Hurricane Zeta came
right through that area 2 nights ago. And so we were already down, obviously, and didn't have to shut
back down for that one. Power was out again in the area. We expect to get power back today or tomorrow
to Alliance. But we had pulled forward some work that we wanted to get done there that was difficult
to do in future turnarounds, and we anticipate continuing to execute that work sort of through mid-
December and then position ourselves to be ready to restart Alliance in the new year, assuming the
market conditions are there and giving us the signal that we need to bring on more capacity.

We have enough rate finding capacity in the Gulf Coast, obviously, to cover all of our marketing needs
right now and any commitments that we have to our customers. And we'll -- as we gave guidance earlier,
we'll let the market tell us what utilization ought to be in the first quarter.

Kevin J. Mitchell
Executive VP of Finance & CFO

And Manav, just to follow-up on chemicals. So CPChem took down several of their facilities on the Gulf
Coast in anticipation of those storm events. They were probably more fortunate than that. They really
were not impacted. So everything is back up and running normal now.

Operator

Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.

Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Greg, do you have an update on whether that potential $0.05 PE increase for October is going through?
And do you expect to see the normal seasonal impact in PE later in the quarter? Or do you think that low
inventories could provide some support on pricing?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Okay. I'll let Tim answer that.

Timothy D. Roberts
VP & Director of Operations

16

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Yes. It looks like at this point in time that, that increase is going to get pushed. There's been a really a
nice run-up up to this point in time, and demand has been good. But we think it's more due to seasonality
than it is anything else, which usually, at this time of year, you see a seasonal effect in demand in the
chems business.

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes. I think if you think about margins, so we were kind of $0.18 full chain margins in Q1, $0.10 in Q2,
$0.19 in Q3 on an IHS marker margin basis. And today, they're $0.28, $0.29. So they're above mid-cycle.
And I think it's been driven by a combination of things. One is demand has been fundamentally good
across the globe. But we see it in Asia, Europe, we see it in North America, strong demand. And then
there's been some impact in terms of the hurricane. So at some point -- at one point, it was about 20%
of the U.S. ethylene capacity was off-line because of Hurricane Laura. And so that's had some impact.
Inventories have come down on the ethylene side. So that's really always positive for margins.

And so I think our view is, coming into the fourth quarter, we have kind of this seasonal weakness or
pause, if you will, in terms of the petrochemical space. But we're relatively optimistic about petrochemicals
for next year.

Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Sounds good. And then just turning to renewable diesel. So thanks for the update on the feedstocks. I
wanted to ask about the permitting in California. Normally, that's kind of a challenge. Do you anticipate an
easier route this time because of the nature of the facility. Could you just address that?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I think so. You're correct. It is always difficult to permit anything in California. And it is a very rote
process at the end of the day, and there are many steps that we have to go through. The biggest permit
that we have to get is a land use permit in Contra Costa County, and that will require an environmental
impact statement and go through all that work. We took a very different approach as a company on
this particular project in that we made sort of full-court press with many stakeholders in the state of
California the day before we announced. So we had multiple conversations in Sacramento, everywhere
from Governor Newsom's office, to CalEPA, to CARB, to local legislators, to the local Contra Costa County
Board of Supervisors. And I would say that we were met with great enthusiasm for this property across
the board from those that are going to be responsible at the end of the day for actually permitting it.

And in the meantime, the permit is in. It's been deemed complete by Contra Costa county, which really
starts the process for them. So they will hire independent third party to do the environmental assessment
of that, and that is all beginning.

So we're there and ready to help support them through that. We haven't seen, really, any opposition at
this point to the project. And I think as people are understanding more and more the benefits of us doing
this project, as we mentioned, the environmental benefits and NOCs, SOCs and greenhouse gas reductions
we think the permitting process will flow through on it's kind of normal time line and look forward to
getting that permit in early 2022.

Theresa Chen from Barclays.

Theresa Chen

Going back to some of the earlier comments on supply rationalization in the market and just thinking
about the overall demand-supply balance for refining capacity, how do you view the probability weighted
quantity of supply -- that is new supply that's coming into the market in the Middle East and Asia?

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. So there's about 1 million barrels a day scheduled for 2020. Highly likely that some of that gets
pushed out into 2021. We're seeing a slowdown in activity from a COVID perspective and its impact on
labor as well as capital cost reductions in the industry.

So I think those barrels are going to get pushed out as we look today, there's not a real reason to rush
any of these projects into service.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And turning back to the West Coast. Thank you for all the color on the renewable diesel projects
and your thoughts around that. I was curious to hear how you view the whole electrification theme. Given
the recently ordered ICE ban from Newsom's office and the 9 other states in the U.S. considering similar
orders as well as the legislation introduced to Congress to mandate it on a federal level. Can you talk
about your views on these aspirations maybe meeting a wall of reality?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

So yes, I'll take a stab, and then Bob can help me because he's pretty active in this area. But I think these
are aspirational goals. And I think that -- I think the sign post we're going to watch for is when billions, if
not trillions of dollars start flowing in infrastructure investments around distribution, power generation, et
cetera, that you could truly electrify the fleets. So I'm probably more bullish on low carbon fuel standard
as we think about it moving from California, to Oregon, to Washington state, to maybe to the East Coast.

And so I think the more near term, easier things to do in terms of renewables that can lower carbon
intensity. Those make sense that you can earn good returns doing those projects. And I think the
electrification is going to take a long time to get there.

Robert A. Herman
Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes. And I think we would agree with the -- AFPM has got a statement out there that we would stand
behind solid with you, and that Governor Newsom doesn't actually have the authority to do what his
aspirational executive order played out. And you just think about the logistics of banning ICE in California,
but there's these states around it, call it Arizona, Nevada and Oregon that have car dealerships too.

So it's hard to understand how this actually becomes a reality when there really isn't enough electricity in
California today for base demand.

Operator

Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley.

Benny Wong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

First one is around Alberta production limits being lifted in December. I wanted to get your sense, what
you think that might have an impact on Canadian crude differentials? And how it might cause you to shift
your feedstock sourcing strategy, given you guys are one of the largest importers of the Canadian crude?

Brian M. Mandell
Executive Vice President of Marketing & Commercial

Benny, this is Brian. On Canadian crude, until just a few weeks ago, it was -- it's 4.2 million barrels of
pipeline capacity out of Canada, and there wasn't 4.2 million barrels of production with some core issues
and Polaris pipeline issues. Now we're starting to see the production come back. We're starting to see
more production than pipeline capacity.

PHILLIPS 66 FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

So our view is, over time, and it will take some time, we think that the differentials will start to widen out
to variable rail rates, which we see about [ 13 50 ] off of WTI. So that's good for us. Every dollar is about
$100 million for Phillips 66. So we continue to watch that.

Actually, you've seen the past few weeks, the differentials were under $10. And now, as of yesterday,
$10.60, so they're already starting to expand.

Benny Wong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. My follow-up is maybe for Greg. Greg, you and your team has always had a longer perspective
of the world, and that often translates into how you run the business. And I think in the past, you have
guided us to think about Phillips 66 generating a mid-cycle EBITDA of about $9 billion. Recognizing it's
uncertain times, but just wanted to get your thoughts and maybe a degree of confidence if that mid-
cycle level EBITDA generation is still reasonable? And if it is, how do we get back there? Is it refining
rationalization alone? Can it get back to us there?

Greg C. Garland
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think shorter term, we still got a little bit of inventory overhang we've got to work through. I mean,
directionally, inventories have been moving the right way, so we feel relatively good about that. But I think
that we won't clean it up in 4Q. We may get a shot at it in 1Q. But certainly, we think as we approach the
summer driving season in 2Q that we'll have an opportunity to see margins more normalized end for us.

So we're talking about CPChem. Essentially, the market margin is above mid-cycle today. Our Midstream
business is going to continue to perform well. Our Marketing and Specialty businesses has been a very
consistent $1.4 billion, $1.6 billion kind of EBITDA business.

So the real question mark on the PSX portfolio is, when does refining get back to mid-cycle conditions?
And so we probably got a shot at doing that kind of midyear next year.

So Jeff or Bob, do you want to add anything to that?

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes, I would just add that at CPChem, the addition of U.S. Gulf Coast 1 came at a time when margins
were declining. And so the earnings power of that facility has really not been shown in a mid-cycle margin
environment. So I think that will be supportive of higher contributions from CPChem.

We have reached the end of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.

Jeffrey Alan Dietert
