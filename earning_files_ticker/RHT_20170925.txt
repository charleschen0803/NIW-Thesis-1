Let me first thank the global team of Red Hat associates who delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, maintaining the momentum that began during Q4 of last year
Strong execution from our sales and services teams, combined with global demand for Red Hat technologies, drove financial results that were well above our guidance
For the second quarter, we delivered year-over-year growth of 21% for revenue, 40% for non-GAAP operating income and 48% for operating cash flow
It was a great performance overall
For the first half of fiscal 2018, we delivered a powerful combination of 20% total revenue growth, 26% non-GAAP operating income growth and 22% operating cash flow growth
Let me provide you with some additional financial highlights of our second quarter performance
In general, currency rate volatility was fairly stable year-over-year in Q2. The major foreign currencies that we transact business in have improved modestly from the outlook we provided on the June earnings call, but the overall impact was minimal to our results
So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on reported USD results and where appropriate, add constant currency details
In addition, you will find a table of constant currency results in our press release
Also, for a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our press release
Starting with total revenue, we delivered $723 million of revenue, which was above the high-end of our guidance and represented growth of 21% in USD or 20% in constant currency
We exceeded the high-end of our guidance by $21 million, with approximately $5 million due to an improvement in foreign exchange rates
The remaining $21 -- the remaining $16 million of upside was comprised of approximately $12 million driven by stronger performance and execution from our global sales team, and approximately $4 million driven by additional services mainly supporting our emerging technologies
Turning to subscription revenue, it constituted 88% of total revenue in Q2 and it was the largest driver of our growth at $638 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 20% year-over-year
We also continued to drive strong growth across our product portfolio
Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $487 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year
Subscription revenue for our application development-related and other emerging technology offerings was $150 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year
This part of our subscription business has achieved a $600 million annualized revenue run rate while growing in excess of 40% year-over-year, which further reinforces our focused investment strategy that drives our differentiation and the value being realized by our customers
Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 21% of total revenue, up 340 basis points from the year ago quarter
And lastly, our services revenue of $86 million, which also exceeded our expectations came in at 25% year-over-year growth
Although, we forecasted strong growth for Q2 services, the actual growth was even faster than expected due to additional demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $191 million grew 40% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin came in at 26.4%
This quarterly result was higher than the operating margin guidance that I provided on our last call, due primarily to the higher revenue results, as well as some additional sales productivity and delayed investment on our emerging technologies, which we plan to utilize in the second half of the fiscal year
As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations
Using our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28.4% after the impact of certain discrete tax items and debt discount expense, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.77, which is $0.10 higher than our June guidance and up 40% year-over-year
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.3 billion, while returning $75 million to our shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of nearly 800,000 shares of stock
Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.1 billion, an increase of $372 million or up 22% the same quarter a year ago
Our operating cash flow results were also strong
Operating cash flow of $143 million for the quarter increased from the operating cash flow of $97 million in Q2 last year
This result was due to a mix of higher profitability and stronger billings and collections
The FX adjusted day sales outstanding was 56 days, a one day improvement from last year
On a rolling four quarters basis, the billings proxy was $745 million, up 20% year-over-year
As a reminder, the rolling four quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last four quarters
I will now review the bookings metrics related to our business momentum, top renewals and million dollar deals in the quarter
We drove balanced bookings growth across our major geographies
This quarter, 57% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 19% from Asia-Pacific, which is consistent with the second quarter last year
The second quarter route-to-market mix was 79% from the channel and 21% from our direct sales force, this result was relatively in line with the second quarter prior year’s split of 81% and 19%
Our proxy for bookings duration was nearly 21 months and as expected is lower than the 22 months that we reported in Q2 last year
Looking at the second half of this year, we continue to believe the bookings duration metric will be closer to the 21-month historic level rather than the elevated duration levels we experienced in Q3 and Q4 of last year
25 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal all renewed and did so in aggregate at approximately 115% of their previous value
Our large deal growth in the quarter was strong, with a total of 66 deals over $1 million, up 20% year-over-year
Within these deals, four were greater than $5 million
Cross selling was strong, with over 60% of the top deals greater than $1 million, including one or more components from our group of application development-related and emerging technology offerings
Our top industry verticals within the deals greater than $1 million were government, financial services and other mainstream sectors such as retail, energy and transportation
Now I’d like to turn to guidance
Our outlook assumes the current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which have generally improved against the dollar since our June guidance
We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.880 billion to $2.895 billion, up approximately 20% in USD and 19% in constant currency at the high-end of the range
Compared with our original March guidance for FY18 and the high end of our current outlook, approximately 60% of the $135 million increase in our outlook is being driven by our stronger performance, with the remaining amount coming from an improvement in foreign currency exchange rates
Given the strong performance so far this year, along with our outlook for additional growth and investment, we are modestly raising our non-GAAP operating margin by 20 basis points to 23.8% for the full year
We are also raising our full year non-GAAP earnings per share outlook to be approximately $2.77 per share to $2.79 per share, assuming approximately $2 million per quarter forecast for net other income, an annual effective tax rate of approximately 28% and approximately 180 million diluted shares
At the top end of the guidance, this would be a 23% year-over-year growth in earnings per share
On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expenses of approximately $200 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $30 million
GAAP fully diluted EPS guidance includes non-cash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount of approximately $20 million
We are increasing our full year operating cash flow to grow in a range from $880 million to $900 million
For Q3 specifically, we offer the following outlook
We expect revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $737 million, which is up 20% in USD at the high end of the range and 18% in constant currency
We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.7% non-GAAP -- and non-GAAP earnings per share to be per share of $0.70. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or receipts
In Q2 we continued to seize the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing
This momentum drove strong results for the quarter and year-to-date
We’re also pleased with the rate at which customers are embracing our multiple cloud enabling technologies
We believe this trust from customers and from partners for Red Hat as a strategic advisor will help drive additional value for our shareholders
With that, Elise, we’ll now like to open the call for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Mark, I appreciate the question and certainly understand the continued interest in billings
We -- obviously we’re not going to guide on it
But the ones -- what I would offer up though as we look at the second half of the year, we do expect the shorter duration, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to get back down much more towards our historic levels and we also do expect a higher mix of services and CCSP, which is also going to have an impact to it
So I would just expect those items to kind of help tamp down some of the billing expectations
So we have not broken that out
What I would say, Walter, is when you look at the overall, it’s split pretty much half between operational and the other half on FX
So I would expect that to be pretty comparable as you look at the second half as well
Yeah
We literally, that product [ph] GAed (27:32) today
We’re very excited about it
It’s a fully supported high quality database that sits at substantially lower cost than Oracle or DB2. So we think there’s going to be quite a lot of interest in it
When it starts driving revenue? We’re not experts in the database business
I think it helps our ecosystem overall with additional capability and a really compelling economic value proposition, but too early to have a sense of when that might drive incremental revenue
I mean, Michael, I guess, I would just say that, look, I mean, we do expect continued duration to go down and with higher mix of services in CCSP, it’s certainly going to have an impact
So, we’re just trying to make sure that the expectations are properly set
Yes
So it’s actually, Michael, it’s a good question
So we mentioned it last quarter and this quarter, we’ve seen some improvements in the linearity
What I would say is we look at the second half, I mean, it’s -- we’re still only a couple quarters into it
So with some of the actions that we’re taking and really restructuring the way that the management -- the sales management teams are managing the cadences and the sales cycle, we need to probably see a couple more quarters before we think some of these actions are sustained
So, right now, what we’ve assumed into our guidance is pretty much of a natural -- net neutral from business linearity
We haven’t assumed it to be a headwind nor a tailwind at this point
But we certainly did see and which is reflected into the strong cash flow that we had this quarter, we did see some improvement in business linearity, especially in months one and two
So we’re going to continue to focus in on that, but right now, it’s still little bit early for us to say that a lot of the things we’re doing are sustainable
Sure, Keith
So as we look at and you are absolutely answered piece of the question in terms of we did have summit in Q1 versus Q2 of this year when you look at it year-over-year
But we also have been driving some programs around productivity in sales, so we’re seeing some benefit from that
We also had a couple of marketing programs that we were planning on initiating this quarter that we had not, those will slide to the second half of the year
But you will also see too is it is our expectation to ramp up the hiring in the sales team as we get into the back half of the year, so I would not expect the trend to continue downwards, in fact if anything, I would expect it to taper off to maybe go up a little bit as we start to make the investments needed for the FY19 planning that we’re working on right now
No
I mean, and again, that’s -- on those, I mean, the way that we have been managing those with the team is really keeping those as neutral as possible
So we have funded a lot of through other efficiencies within the company
And Karl to your -- second part for your question, so we would look once we hit a $300 million annual run rate, that would be the next time the major milestone that we would announce
Yeah
Well, so, I’ll answer the first part
So, what I would tell you, Matt, we -- when we look at the margins and the improvements that we’ve seen
I mean, certainly, these solutions that we are selling a lot more complex, a lot more specialists that are involved, and we are looking at and we’ve mentioned -- as we mentioned at Analyst Day, it is a longer sales cycle
It is certainly more expensive
But as we’ve also said there’s -- the opportunity is also significantly more as well
So I think some of those are going to kind of offset themselves over time
So, we’re just going to -- obviously, we’re looking to see how we can certainly scale these and where we -- where it makes sense to use partners, we absolutely will
As we look at the longer term framework for margins, we’re working on the long-term forecast now and we would be looking to make any updates on that at our next Analyst Day in May of next year
And I would just encourage, as Jim said, as you look at the margin profile, the materials that we provided at the last Analyst Day this year
There is a chart in there that really has where the emerging products are and obviously there’s still very early on, and it certainly does take some time to kind of move up that curve and then as you get to where RHEL is at
So that’s the piece that we’re certainly still working on trying to determine how quickly we can move them up that slope and certainly into the profitable levels where we want to see
