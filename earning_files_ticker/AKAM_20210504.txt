Presentation

Operator

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Akamai Technologies First Quarter 2021
Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded.
[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. Tom Barth, Head
of Investor Relations.

Tom Barth
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's First Quarter 2021
Earnings Conference Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed
McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.

Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including
statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed or implied in such statements. The factors include uncertainty stemming from
COVID-19 pandemic and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information
concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form
10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 4, 2021.
Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed
reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor
Relations section of akamai.com.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.

F. Thomson Leighton
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today.

I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. Q1 revenue was $843
million, up 10% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency. This strong result was driven by the
continued rapid growth of our security business, accelerated growth in our edge applications business
and continued high-traffic levels on our intelligent edge platform. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was
31% and Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $1.38 per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year and up 11% in constant
currency. With a strong start to 2021, we're proud that Akamai has continued to enable and to protect
remote work, home schooling, e-commerce and online entertainment for billions of people around the
world amidst very challenging circumstances.

Our security solutions portfolio performed especially well in Q1, generating revenue of $310 million, up
29% year-over-year and up 27% in constant currency. The very strong growth was experienced across
most of our security products, including our new Page Integrity Manager solution. Page Integrity Manager
helps enterprises defend against malware and third-party software and applications. Customers that
adopted Page Integrity Manager in Q1 included Maersk, the world's largest container shipping operator;
and Groupon, the global e-commerce marketplace.

Maersk uses more than 4,000 scripts, half of which are third-party scripts to drive millions of dollars of
online business every hour. Managing this complex and dynamic environment had become an increasingly
difficult security challenge for Maersk and so they now use Page Integrity Manager to improve visibility
into security threats and to prevent the loss of critical data.

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Our Bot Manager solution also continued to perform very well in Q1. Bot Manager is designed to mitigate
a wide variety of automated attacks, including account stuffing attacks where credentials stolen from
one website are checked for validity at thousands of other websites. When valid credentials are found, a
manual attack is then often used to extract value from the compromised accounts. Losses from account
takeovers and new account fraud are estimated at over $10 billion annually in the U.S. In order to
forge such manual attacks, we launched the beta for our new account protector solution in Q1. Account
protector shields organizations from account takeover and other kinds of fraudulent human activity
without increasing friction for legitimate customers. Account protector works by detecting in real-time
whether a user logging into an application is the legitimate account owner or an impostor in possession of
stolen credentials.

One of our beta customers for this new solution is a well-known restaurant franchise. It was under
attacked by cyber criminals who were compromising the loyalty accounts of their diners. The criminals
were stealing loyalty reward points and then reselling them on the dark web. The digital theft outraged
the diners whose points were stolen and angered restaurant owners who unknowingly provided meals
to fraudsters. With help from Akamai, the franchise can now identify the situations where humans are
impersonating valid diners and take action to stop the illicit transfer of loyalty points, thereby stopping the
fraud and enabling the franchise to focus on accelerating sales.

We're also excited about the success of Akamai's fastest-growing security segment, Access Control,
which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $100 million in Q1, up more than 170% over Q1 of
2020 and up over 60% organically. Our Access Control segment provides secure connectivity for users,
applications, workloads and IoT systems, regardless of their location. Products in this area include
Enterprise Application Access, Enterprise Threat Protector and our new secure mobile and secure IoT
solutions that we acquired from Asavie in October. Our secure mobile and secure IoT products provide
security, visibility and control for mobile devices at the edge. These services deter malicious activity and
support acceptable use policies without needing to install a client on the device. The solutions are sold
to our carrier partners such as AT&T, where it forms the basis for their AccessMyLAN solution. These
capabilities have been especially important in helping school districts secure student devices during the
pandemic, so that students can learn from home safely.

Our security solutions also continued to gain recognition from the leading analyst firms in Q1. Our market-
leading web application firewall capabilities earned Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice distinction.
And Forrester named Akamai as a leader in DDoS protection for the third time, saying large enterprise
clients that want an experienced trusted vendor to make their DDoS problem go away should look to
Akamai.

Turning to our CDN portfolio. Q1 marked another quarter of very strong traffic growth for Akamai, led by
OTT video services and downloads of e-gaming software. On March 16, traffic on the Akamai platform
reached an all-time high of 200 terabits per second. This is 19% higher than the peak in Q1 of last year
and 2.5x the traffic peak in Q1 of 2019. Daily peaks were also high in Q1, averaging 143 terabits per
second. In fact, traffic on our platform exceeded 110 terabits per second, pretty much around the clock in
Q1. Overall, our CDN products and services generated revenue of $532 million in Q1, up 2% year-over-
year and flat in constant currency.

The Edge Application segment generated $45 million in revenue last quarter, up more than 30% over Q1
of 2020. As you may recall from the discussion at our Investor Summit in February, this revenue amount
includes edge computing solutions, such as EdgeWorkers, that we build discreetly, but does not include the
wide array of services that use our computing capabilities at the edge. As we discussed during our recent
Investor Summit, we believe that there is the potential for substantial future growth in the area of edge
computing, as we anticipate more enterprises moving their compute workloads to our edge platform for
offload, improved performance, security and global scale.

A timely example of such a shift is manifested in our new Vaccine Edge solution, which is enabling over 2
dozen public health agencies and pharmacy chains around the world to deliver and secure COVID vaccine
registration sites in the face of extraordinary flash crowds. In multiple instances, Akamai was called in to
rescue government agencies whose websites had crashed under load, resulting in frustrated citizens who

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

waited for long times before getting kicked out without a reservation. In some cases, these websites have
been using solutions provided by competitors that were not able to handle the load.

We're pleased to partner on Vaccine Edge with salesforce.com, and we're proud that our EdgeWorkers
solution has made a real difference to the many millions of citizens trying to get the vaccine as quickly as
possible.

Our customers are now using EdgeWorkers for a wide range of applications. For example, a leading theme
park operator is using EdgeWorkers to help manage demand as they plan to reopen parks. A publicly
traded sports and entertainment company has implemented geofencing using our EdgeKV data store,
together with EdgeWorkers, to ensure that users access only relevant broadcast content for their location.
A nationwide home improvement retailer and a global credit card company are using A/B testing logic
at the edge to deliver fast and personalized user experiences. We're enabling DevOps workflows for our
global sportswear brand by managing canary releases, where only a targeted group of users can see a
new experience. And we're enabling a leading global manufacturer of devices to authenticate their users at
the edge, which improves performance and reduces their cloud costs.

We're also proud of the progress that we're making with our sustainability efforts. In the past year, we
doubled our platform capacity with no increase at all in our platform's carbon footprint. And just 2 weeks
ago, on Earth Day, we announced that by 2030, Akamai intends to power 100% of our global operations
with renewable energy, improve the energy efficiency of our platform by an additional 50%, mitigate
100% of our platform emissions and continue to recycle 100% of our electronic waste. These goals reflect
Akamai's commitment to be a responsible, efficient and forward-looking company.

In summary, we're very excited about the innovative technology that we're developing, the strong demand
from customers for our security and edge computing solutions and our Q1 financial performance on both
the top and bottom lines. The growth strategy and goals that we outlined to you in our Investor Summit
on February 25, set our direction for the future, and we believe that our strong Q1 results show that we've
been executing according to plan.

Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to provide further details on our Q1 results and the outlook for next
quarter and 2021. Ed?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Tom. Before I provide additional details on our Q1 performance, I'd like to remind everyone
that as a result of the reorganization we announced last quarter, we've refocused the company from a
vertical-aligned divisional structure to a product-oriented lens. I will therefore be focusing my discussion
today on our Security Technology Group and our Edge Technology Group. The Security Group, as you
might imagine, encompasses all of our security solution. The Edge Group includes our media delivery and
web performance CDN business, along with our edge compute solutions. We plan to provide additional
revenue detail for the different product lines within our Security Technology Group and Edge Technology
Group on an annual basis.

However, we might highlight specific subgroup details from time to time on our quarterly earnings calls
if we feel it will help provide greater context on our results. Finally, as I mentioned on our last call, we
will continue to report both Web Division and Media and Carrier division results, along with our Internet
platform customer results on our website for the balance of 2021 to assist with this reporting transition.

So with all that said, as Tom outlined, Akamai delivered another excellent quarter in Q1. We were very
pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on both revenue and earnings. Q1 revenue was
$843 million, up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency, driven by continued strength across
most major product areas in our security business, better-than-expected traffic from OTT video and
gaming customers and very strong performance in our edge applications business.

Revenue from our Security Technology Group was $310 million, up 29% year-over-year or 27% in
constant currency, driven by broad-based strength across most of our security products. Revenue from
our Edge Technology Group was $532 million, up 2% year-over-year or flat in constant currency. We

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

benefited from strong traffic growth driven by OTT video and gaming as well as strong growth in our edge
applications business, as Tom mentioned earlier. As expected, foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive
impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis and positive $16 million on a year-over-year basis.

International revenue was $380 million, up 13% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Sales in our
international markets represented 45% of total revenue in Q1, up 1 point from Q1 2020 and consistent
with Q4 levels. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $463 million, up 8% year-over-year.

Moving now to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin,
which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%. Non-GAAP cash operating
expenses were $267 million, in line with our expectations.

Now moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $375 million, up $49 million or 15% from the same
period in 2020. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45%, up 2 points from Q1 2020. Non-GAAP operating
income was $264 million, up $34 million or 15% from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating
margin came in at 31%, up 1 point from Q1 last year and above our guidance range due to leverage from
our revenue outperformance.

Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $150
million, consistent with our guidance range. We continue to expect Q1 CapEx to represent the high
watermark for quarterly CapEx spending in 2021. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $156 million
or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. Our Q1 GAAP results include a $7 million restructuring charge
related to the company realignment we announced last quarter, which was in line with our expectations.
Non-GAAP net income was $228 million or $1.38 of earnings per diluted share, up 15% year-over-year,
up 11% in constant currency and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range due to our revenue
outperformance. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $38 million, based on a Q1 effective tax
rate of approximately 14%.

Now I will discuss some balance sheet items. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion. After accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal
amounts of our 2 convertible notes, net cash was approximately $154 million as of March 31.

Now I will review our use of capital. During the first quarter, we spent $58 million to repurchase shares,
buying back approximately 600,000 shares. We ended Q1 with approximately $514 million remaining
on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. Our plan remains to leverage our share
buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. As a result, based on
current market conditions, we expect to spend at least $350 million for the full year 2021.

Moving on to Q2 guidance. We are projecting Q2 revenue in the range of $839 million to $853 million or
up 6% to 7% as reported or 3% to 5% in constant currency over Q2 2020. There are 2 factors to consider
as you think about year-over-year comparisons for Q2. First, in 2020, we saw a significant uptick in traffic
on our network starting at the end of March and continuing through the remainder of the year as a result
of global lockdowns. As our excellent Q1 results demonstrate, traffic has continued to grow on our network
this year, but we don't expect to see the same traffic growth rates from a year ago going forward. This
creates more challenging year-over-year comparisons for our edge delivery business starting in Q2 and
continuing for the remainder of 2021.

Second, the Q2 year-over-year growth comparison also reflects the continuing ban of some Chinese-based
apps in India. As a reminder, these apps, which were banned in Q3 of last year, contributed revenue of
approximately $15 million in Q2 2020.

Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on Q2 revenue compared
to Q1 levels and a positive $18 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash
gross margins of approximately 76%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $261 million
to $266 million. We anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 45%.

Moving now to depreciation. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $116 million to
$117 million. Factoring in this guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31% for
Q2.

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $133 million to $138 million, excluding equity
compensation in the second quarter. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined,
we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $37
million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately $0.14 --
excuse me, 14%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares.

Looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and EPS. We now expect
revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.435 billion, which is up 6% to 7% year-over-year as reported or up 5% to
6% in constant currency. We now expect security growth to be in the low 20s for the full year 2021. We
are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% to 31% and non-GAAP earnings per
diluted share of $5.45 to $5.52. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective
tax rate of approximately 14% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.

Moving on to CapEx. Full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue, unchanged from
our prior outlook.
We are very pleased to have delivered such strong results in Q1 and to be able to increase our outlook for
the full year. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen.

Michael Elias
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Michael on for Colby. Two questions, if I may. First, could you give us an update on your M&A
pipeline for security and how the number of opportunities you're seeing compares to this time last year?
And secondly, one of your CDN peers flagged that they saw a loss of market share due to performance.
Is there anything that you can flag related to market share gains or potentially losses during the quarter?
That would be helpful.

F. Thomson Leighton
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Sure. I would say the M&A pipeline is comparable to last year. There's a lot of companies for sale. And
the pricing for typical companies in the security area remains very high. And I think, in many cases,
unrealistic. So I think overall, the dynamics there are pretty comparable to where they were last year. As
you know, Akamai is always looking for opportunities. We're also very disciplined in terms of actually --
what we end up buying.

In terms of CDN market share, the very large media companies do compare the CDN vendors in terms of
their traffic share. And if a vendor is doing better than others, they tend to get more share. And that's why
Akamai has such a large share when it comes to delivery of media traffic. And if a vendor has outages or
is performing poorly, which we see a fair amount out there among our competition, they can lose share.
And so that's a very typical dynamic. Nothing new there. It's been that way for several years. And that's
why Akamai put such an effort to have the world's best performance. And it's why we have so much of the
traffic.

Operator

Our next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler.

James Edward Fish
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. First, can you just give us more color behind the media CDN business in terms
of, especially the gaming vertical specifically, just really trying to understand how fast either revenue or
traffic from gaming itself is growing and what the exposure to gaming overall, given what we're seeing
with the console cycle as well. And then normally, Ed, you don't typically raise in -- following Q1. I guess
what gives you the confidence at this point of this -- at this point of the year versus normal?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Jim, so first, I'll take the first question, which was around the media -- it's the gaming growth in particular.
So we don't break out specific growth rates, but I can say that gaming, in particular, was one of the
stronger verticals in terms of growth, very pleased with what we saw. The other thing is, I'd say, the
names of the number of customers that we saw growing. It wasn't just your normal handful of gaming
customers. So we saw some benefit from the continuation of the gaming console releases we saw in Q4.
But we also saw a lot of publishers have some pretty significant releases during the quarter. So in general,
it was a really good gaming quarter. We're off to a pretty good start here in Q2. And as you know, this --
the gaming release can be a bit seasonal, but so far, it's been a pretty good start to the year. And like I
said, I'm pretty happy with the performance across many different customers.

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

In terms of guidance, yes, we just start off having a great year. Traffic has been very strong. You saw the
security performance. It's a little bit -- we got a lot of exposure on the FX side. So having one quarter
down and having the first month of the second quarter down gives you a little bit more confidence going
into the year. So we felt that we had enough visibility at this point to raise guidance. As you know,
the second half of the year is always little bit more challenging, where Q3, you tend to see summer
seasonality. We didn't see that last year because of the pandemic. We'll probably see a little bit of that
on the media side. And then Q4, obviously, tends to be our strongest seasonal quarter where you have
strong e-commerce and strong media. So we're feeling pretty confident at this point, so we thought it was
appropriate to take the guidance up a touch.

Operator

Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And a very nice quarter. On that last question, and this kind of increased confidence in the year. Is it more
on the, like, CDN side or more on the security side? Because it does sound like you feel good about some
of those new products ramping pretty nicely on the security portfolio, and you're talking about the low
20s growth for the year. So I was hoping you could clarify that. And then I have a follow-up question on
margins, if we have time.

F. Thomson Leighton
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. We had a very strong start to the year. It's great to see the security business growing at 29%. And
as we talked about, it's really across the board. It's not a single product doing well, but just strength
everywhere in security. And when you see that kind of performance and we look ahead to the back part of
the year, we are confident that we're going to do better than we had thought coming into the year, the --
just great performance.

There's also a good performance on the CDN side. Happy to see that up 2%. As Ed talked about, you do
worry about FX there and what can happen. But on balance, business, very strong and off to a great start.
Ed, do you want to add any color to that?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

No, I think you covered it, Tom. I think, seeing the strength in security and being able to take that up a
touch. And last quarter, we were in the 18% to 20% range. Now we're in the low 20s. And then on the
CDN side, we do have some tougher compares, but we're seeing really strong traffic and not seeing any
decrease from what we've seen over the last year. So we're feeling pretty good about that.

Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That sounds great. And then on the margin side of the equation. We're past the peak in terms of
CapEx, sort of spending -- or CapEx intensity, but it's going to take some time for that to flow through to
gross margin. So that's probably more of like a calendar '22 impact. But you did come in a little bit ahead
on operating margins this quarter. And next quarter, we're looking for 31%. The expectation that you're
going to try to sort of kick that up with increased investment in the business? Or is there potential for kind
of more flow through of upside into better margins for the year?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Okay, 2 things to think about there. The first one is, we have our -- biggest expense line is our
payroll. And we have our annual, what we call, our merit increase cycle that kicks in July 1. So you'll see
a little bit of an increase in our operating expense just for carrying our current employees, but we will be

10

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

investing in security. So we've got some planned investments in the back half of the year. But we took the
guidance range up from what we said approximately 30 last time, to 31. So running at 31 here, might be
a touch under in Q3 as we go through our merit cycle. And then Q4 is always a little bit of a wildcard in
terms of how strong the revenue performance is. But we want to make sure we're investing back in the
business. We see really good growth in security, but also in our edge applications business as well.

Keith Weiss
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And is there a potential for gross margins to start to become a little bit of a tailwind into the back
half of the year?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, you got to keep in mind the mix there, Keith. Over time, I think as you get into, as we talked
about in the Investor Relations Day, where you saw our security margins, gross margins are higher. You've
got your -- media margins are lower. So it really is a mix. And while we're exceeding our plan so far on
security, it's going to take a bit for that to really manifest itself in higher gross margins. You just need to
get a bigger percentage of the business coming from security. And if you look at the part of the business
and media that's growing, it's primarily the high volume, video, high-volume media. That tends to be
where you have probably the most competition and pricing pressure. So you kind of balance those 2 out
and you kind of keep the margin -- gross margins flattish year for the year. And then I'd say over time,
there's a chance that we could see some expansion there, but we're not going to call that out right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.

Sanjit Kumar Singh
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Sanjit on for Sterling Auty. Can you give color on the organic growth in the security for the quarter?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. This is Ed. We had about $10 million of contribution from Asavie, which would be about 4
percentage points. I would say though that when we acquired Asavie, our plan was to do roughly $30
million in revenue in the first year, and we're obviously exceeding that. So we -- we've been able to take
that asset and really start to scale it. So while it's technically inorganic, I'd say we deserve some credit for
being able to significantly accelerate that growth rate. So if you back out the 4%, you'd be -- I said 29%,
it'd be 25% and 22% on a constant currency basis.

Sanjit Kumar Singh
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just to follow-up on that. Like the gross margins and sales and marketing are down
seasonally. So can you give colors on that as well?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So on the sales and marketing, what you'll find is, Q4 tends to be our highest quarter for sales and
marketing expenses where you have, especially last year when we were exceeding our plan, we get into
accelerators. So you get a reset on the compensation, and then you'll see it spike up again in Q4 of this
year.

Good. And on gross margins?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So gross margins were flat quarter-over-quarter. That's in line with what we expected. So really,
there's nothing to call out there.

Our next question comes from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.

Timothy Kelly Horan
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great security quarter. Was there any onetime items, any license deals or anything else that would
suggest why the growth would slow down so much after an acceleration like this? And can you comment
on how enterprise security is doing? Is it meeting your expectations at this point?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure, Tim. I'll take the first one and, Tom, if you want to talk about enterprise afterwards. So yes,
there was really nothing to call out in terms of license revenue, but I'm glad you reminded me, because
when you guys are building your model, if you remember last year in Q2, we did have an unusually strong
license quarter. So as you kind of build your models and look at your compares, just remember, last year,
we had $7 million of license revenue in Q2. We don't expect that again in Q2 of this year. And in Q1, there
was really nothing unusual. As Tom said, it was really strength across many different products in security.
It'd be easy for us to just call out one thing, but the good news for us is we see strength everywhere. And
Tom, I don't know if you want to talk a bit about enterprise.

F. Thomson Leighton
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. The Access segment performed very well. As we noted, we're now at $100 million revenue run
rate. So it's great to start the year in Q1 there. Very strong growth, over 170% over last year. Now of
course, that includes Asavie. If you take that out, organic growth, still over 60% in that segment. So
very pleased. And as Ed noted, we're pretty excited about the Asavie acquisition, especially as you get
the emergence of 5G and you get IoT applications, but the ability to secure enterprise devices across the
board, I think it's very exciting for the future. And we're really in a unique position to do that, and we
have great relationships with the carriers. So we think we'll really be able to scale that business to a global
basis.

Timothy Kelly Horan
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

And just following up on the M&A question. With new security products, do you think you can shift more to
internal development from your own R&D as opposed to acquisitions? Or how has that been trending the
last few years?

F. Thomson Leighton
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

I think it's a good, healthy mix. As you know, we've made several acquisitions, mostly tech tuck-
ins, occasionally something a little bit larger. And we do a lot of organic investment in research and
development, very active. They're very innovative. Maybe a good example is Page Integrity Manager,
which we launched last year and doing really well in the marketplace. And we did -- that was a blend of a
tech tuck-in about 7 to 10 employees in the company we acquired and a lot of organic development at the
same time, to make a very successful product quickly, bring it to market and very strong adoption in early
days.

Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.

Michael Joseph Cikos
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

You have Mike Cikos on the line here for Alex Henderson. Could you comment on the security growth
you're experiencing? I'm just trying to, I guess, think about this demand and the increased expectations
you guys have now. Is any of this at all related to, I guess, budget finally coming to market following the
headlines that we saw earlier in the year around SolarWinds and the Microsoft [ fixed unit service acts ]?
And then the second comment on that would be the improved outlook that you have for security. Is it also
expected to be broad-based on a go-forward basis?

F. Thomson Leighton
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me take the first question there. And that's a, yes, really good question. The attack landscape
is just breathtaking. You think you've seen it all. And then next week, you read the next headline. The --
and the attackers are very powerful. You have nation states, large-scale organized crime, just -- and what
they're doing is, well, pretty scary. Now the great news for Akamai and our customers is that we have
solutions that can protect enterprises for a large majority of those attacks.

A great example is the recent exchange server hack, where many thousands of enterprises got hacked,
lost their e-mails, which is really bad. Akamai, our IT department was running an exchange server, just
like all those other companies. And the difference is, we didn't get hacked because we use our own
enterprise security solutions. And we had enterprise application access sitting in front of our exchange
server. And that meant that the vulnerability couldn't be exploited, because the employee doesn't just
get to go contact the exchange server. If they did, then somebody can come in. And before you're
authenticated by the exchange server, you can exploit the vulnerability.

Instead, they got to get to -- they come to Akamai's Enterprise Application Access product, we
authenticate them, and if it's a bad guy outside trying to do something, no way they get in. And not only
that, they don't get directly to the exchange server, because they have to pass through our security. So if
they're trying to do bad things, we'll stop it. And it's all about our approach to Zero Trust. And yes, we can
protect enterprises from these sorts of things.

And even in zero-day attacks, we didn't know about the exchange hack before other enterprises or
Microsoft did, and yet we were protected at zero day because of our solutions. So I think as the attacks
increase, that does increase awareness, and that does help drive our security business. And I see no
end to the attacks coming. There's more on the way. And we're in a great position to be able to help the
leading enterprises stay safe against those attacks.

Michael Joseph Cikos
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just following up that broad-based strength that we're talking to in Q1. Is that -- that's
expected on a go-forward basis with the updated outlook we have today?

F. Thomson Leighton
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. It was strong across the board, and we're anticipating that through the rest of this year. And of
course, at our Investor Day, we talked about the 3- to 5-year CAGR goals. And as you go back to that
material, you'll see it's pretty strong across the board there in terms of our anticipated growth over the
longer term.

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

James Dennis Breen
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Just wondering if you can give some color on the U.S. versus the international mix. It seemed like U.S.
had a pretty good acceleration on a year-over-year basis this quarter. Is this pandemic-driven? Or is it
more around the products that's getting sold? And then just secondly, on the margins thread. EBITDA
margin is 45%. You've guided to that for the next quarter. Given the business mix now, is that sort of the
starting point in terms of margin structure, given CapEx coming down and investments, et cetera?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Hey, Jim. So on the [indiscernible] EBITDA margin question first. Yes. So 45's a good spot for this
quarter. Obviously, we get a little bit of expense coming in Q3. So 44, 45-ish, but I think you're thinking
about it in the right range. On the U.S. versus international, yes, U.S. was pretty strong. We've been
having pretty decent U.S. growth. If you remember, go back in a year or so, a little over a year ago, we
were kind of flattish and we started to turn things around there. A lot of it has to do with the strength
that we're seeing in media, a lot of the companies are in the U.S. In terms of international, still having
very strong growth internationally. We do come up against some tougher compares. There's pretty strong
media business outside the U.S. So you'll see some tougher compares on the media delivery side. And as
I called out, from an international perspective, there's -- we're still lapping that $15 million of lost revenue
associated with the bank apps in India.

James Dennis Breen
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

And then just one other question. Are there any sectors that you're seeing that were particularly hit hard
by the pandemic that are maybe starting to come back a little bit more as the vaccines' gotten rolled out?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes, good question, Jim. So I would say the hotel and travel is probably stabilizing a little bit. I
wouldn't say we're in the growth phase yet. You're starting to see some early signs. It's probably still a
few quarters before we start to see that business return to a growth engine for us. On retail, it's still a
mixed bag. You've got some that are doing well, some that aren't doing well. And just keep in mind that,
that's 20% of our -- your total business, 40% of your old legacy web business. But it's -- I'd say we're
optimistic, but still a ways to go before we declare victory there.

Our next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc.

Brandon Lee Nispel
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

2 questions for Ed, one for Tom. Ed, could you just outline how we should be thinking about working
capital for the year? And then for the full year '21, what's embedded in your outlook for FX versus your
prior expectations? Then for Tom, how should we think about the growth in edge applications sequentially
as we move throughout the year? I think you mentioned it was about $45 million this quarter.

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Hey, Brandon, yes, I'll take the second one first. In terms of FX, so the FX rates, what we do is at the
beginning of the quarter, we sort of take a look at where the FX rates are, assume that's going to stay
for the balance of the year. In terms of how it was relative to the beginning of the last quarter, we gave
guidance, some currencies are up, some are down, but it's roughly somewhat in line. I talk about in the
prepared remarks that FX sort of came in as expected. We got a little bit of a headwind here quarter-over-
quarter, mostly weakness in the yen. But I would say just keep an eye on it though. You just -- if you kind

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

of just step back and do the math, we get a little over $1 billion worth of non-U.S.-denominated revenue.
So to the extent that you get a 1% swing, that can swing you $10 million on an annual basis. The major
currencies for us are euro, yen, pound, and then it kind of drops off from there. And other currencies
aren't as impactful, but those are the 3 to keep an eye on.

And then working capital, I'd say, like any other year, you'll see nothing unusual in terms of working
capital. This year, in Q1, you see us from a cash flow perspective, we pay out our bonuses early in Q1. You
see cash flow, the working capital pick up a touch. To call out in terms of collections, they've actually been
fantastic. Nothing on the payable side. It's unusual. And as we talked about, CapEx is already hit its high
point. So nothing really unusual to call on working capital.

F. Thomson Leighton
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. And in terms of the edge applications question, you're right, about $45 million in Q1. We don't guide
separately on an annual basis for that. You just saw over 30% growth in Q1. And at IR Day, we did talk
about the 3- to 5-year CAGR. Goal there is over 30%. And so I -- at a high level, I'd expect to see us
continue with very strong growth through the rest of the year in edge applications.

Operator

Our next question comes from Robert Majek with Raymond James.

Robert S. Majek
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Just 2 questions for me. One, good to see the guide up on the security business to a low 20s rate. But you
did just report security growth of 29%. So just, how should we read into that? Why should we expect that
growth rate to decelerate materially? And then two, just what are you seeing on CDN per unit pricing? Is
the level of price decline getting more steeper than usual as larger customers renegotiate their now larger
CDN contracts in a clearly boosted traffic environment?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I'll take both of those. So on the low 20s, the way to think about it is, I just called out when Tim
asked the question about license revenue, you've got a tougher compare in Q2 with $7 million of license
revenue, we don't anticipate repeating in Q2. You also have the Asavie acquisition that will anniversary in
Q4. So when you take those 2 factors into consideration, you'll see the growth rate come down a touch as
those sort of work themselves out.

On the CDN pricing environment, nothing really to call out there. I've been in this business for a little
over 20 years and have sort of gotten numb to pricing at this point. And I don't see anything that is
unusual. And also, if there was anything in our top -- in our earnings -- Analyst Day, we called out our
top 8 customers, anyone who's over 1% as a metric. And if there's anything in that group of customers
worth calling out, I'd certainly do that and there's really nothing at this point to call out. And as far
as renewals are going, we do a pretty good job of anticipating, what to expect, and there hasn't been
negative surprises so far.

Rudy Grayson Kessinger
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

This is Rudy on for Jeff. I know in security, you've said that there's broad-based strength in the quarter
and you expect that to continue. Were there any products in there, maybe 1 or 2 that were just a little bit
weaker or saw some challenges or slowdowns, just anything you'd call out?

very pleased with how the security business is doing.

Rudy Grayson Kessinger
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then with the sustainability goals by 2030, is there any balance you can put around maybe
how much expense for those investments there you're factoring in for '21? Or just what the expected
impact of margins might be from investments there, maybe on the longer term?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I tell with the team that went through this, and there's really not any significant expenses that we
anticipate for several years. And even then, the cost that the team has rolled up is not all that significant.
We've actually been able to do some pretty creative deals, with certain projects on renewable energy that
have worked out to be, from a pricing perspective and overall net economics, have been neutral to even
favorable in some cases. So nothing really there to note. Team's doing a fabulous job on it. And as time
goes on, if there's anything we need to call out we'll certainly let you know.

Your next question comes from Charlie Erlikh with Baird.

Charles Joseph Erlikh
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

It's Chuck Erlikh on for Will Power. I was hoping to dig in a little bit more into the legacy Web Division.
Could you maybe talk a little bit more about maybe the puts and takes in that segment and the declines
we're seeing there? And then what it might take to stabilize that segment?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I would say, similar to what we've talked about in the past, right? You've got obviously strong
security growth. You've got -- from a verticals perspective, you have 2 verticals, retail and travel, which
make up 40% of the legacy Web Division vertical -- or division, excuse me. And we're still, like I said on a,
a few questions ago, we're not quite out of the woods there yet. We're starting to see some stability, but
we're not seeing the type of growth yet there. So it's going to take a bit for that to recover.

We're doing a nice job of dealing with certain pricing pressure in those verticals with opening up other
shares of the wallet, whether it's additional security products or really starting to see a lot of interest in
our edge computing and edge applications business as well. So we'll see dollars potentially shift delivery
into to that category as we go through pricing negotiations, but that's pretty normal. And once we start
to see, probably a couple of quarters hopefully, the travel and retail business get back to normal, if these
vaccines hold and life returns to normal, hopefully, start to see that segment of the business growing
again.

Charles Joseph Erlikh
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then on the Internet platform customers, continuing to see some growth there, which is great.
Is there anything specifically that's driving that growth? And what should we expect for the rest of the
year from that cohort?

16

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Yes. So it's becoming less impactful. So that's why we're kind of going away from that metric, you didn't
hear me talk about in our prepared remarks. I think years ago, people were concerned that, that may go
to 0. And we talked a couple of years ago about stabilizing that and getting it back to growth. And the
team has just done a phenomenal job. So I'd first tip my hat to the team that's managing those accounts.
They've done a nice job of finding areas for us to add value to incredibly innovative technology companies
that have their own CDNs, and we found a nice spot to pick up business, whether it's adding security or
delivering graphics for video and gaming, for big scale events or for live video or even on-demand video.
We're just finding a nice niche there. And that continues to grow. It's up about $1 million quarter-over-
quarter. Very impressive growth rate.

I'd say stability is probably a good way to think about that going through the year. There's always upside
with these accounts. Teams identifying new areas of opportunity all the time. So very pleased with where
we are with those customers and expect to see probably similar numbers, what you're seeing now, down a
little bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on certain things that are going on in those accounts.

Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.

Michael Joseph Cikos
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Mike Cikos here again. I did just want to follow-up. Just looking at my model versus where you guys came
in, the sales and marketing expense this quarter was much lower than what we had anticipated. Even
if I'm removing the accelerators from 4Q and even just looking at Q1 '21 versus Q1 '20, the amount of
leverage in the model. Can you talk to how we should expect the sales and marketing to play out over the
course of the year? Are there savings being realized from that realigned division or the reorganization you
guys have talked to earlier this year?

Edward J. McGowan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. That's a good point, Mike. So as part of the reorganization here, some shift between sales and
marketing, research and development, a few million bucks, if I remember correctly. And then there was
some savings as we moved from the divisional model to one sales force. There was some synergy, mostly
at the management level. So you'll see some of those costs go away as well.

Tom Barth
Head of Investor Relations

Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. In closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and
