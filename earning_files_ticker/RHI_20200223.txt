ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to the Robert Half First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Our hosts for today's call are
Mr. Keith Waddell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Robert Half; and Mr. Keith -- sorry, Mr. Michael
Buckley, Chief Financial Officer.

Mr. Waddell, you may begin.

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Hello, everyone. We appreciate your time today. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that the
comments made on today's call contain forward-looking statements, including predictions and estimates
about our future performance. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future
holds. However, they're subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in today's
press release and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to
update the statements made on today's call.

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures and reference these figures
as adjusted. Reconciliations and explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule
to our earnings press release. For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in
the investor center of our website at roberthalf.com.

Before we review our first quarter financial results, I'd like to take a moment to talk about Robert Half's
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We've been working for many weeks now to ensure the health and
welfare of our employees, while also maintaining our service commitments to customers. The safety of our
employees remains our first priority. Early on, we gave all staff the unconditional right to work from home,
and this will remain so. We also agreed that time taken off due to illness or the care of loved ones who are
sick would not be charged to employees.

As we navigate through this crisis, preserving the long-term intrinsic value of Robert half is our guiding
principle. The key focus is retaining our best people, who've proven time and again their ability to grow
and sustain the organization. They are critical to maintaining the culture that's been an essential part of
our success. Given the magnitude of the COVID-19 impact on our business, we fully understand that we
must also adjust our cost structure in all other areas. To reinforce that we're all in this together, I've cut
my base pay by 100% until the end of the year and the other executive officers across the enterprise have
also taken substantial pay cuts.

Our previous cloud and other infrastructure investments positioned us extremely well to seamlessly
transition our employees to work-from-home status with access to all essential technology tools and
communication options. Virtually all employees across the globe are currently working remotely.

We've weathered many downturns over Robert Half's 70-plus year history, owing to our strong balance
sheet and cash flow, unparalleled brands, professionally focused business model and what we believe is
the most driven and tenured workforce in the industry. We are confident that we will emerge from this too
with the ability to compete effectively and win in the post-COVID-19 world, maintaining and enhancing our
industry-leading brand.

Now let's take a look at first quarter 2020 financial results. Company-wide revenues were $1.507 billion,
up 3% from last year's first quarter on a reported basis, and up 2% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income
per share for the quarter was $0.79 compared to $0.93 in the first quarter 1 year ago. Cash flow from
operations during the quarter was $125 million and capital expenditures were $14 million. In February, we
raised our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders from $0.31 to $0.34 per share. We paid the dividend
in March for a total cash outlay of $40 million. We also repurchased approximately 1 million Robert Half

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

shares during the quarter for $51 million. We have 1.5 million shares available for repurchase under our
Board-approved stock repurchase plan.

While results through the first half of March were strong and above plan, the second half of March began
to reflect the COVID-19 impact on our business, particularly our staffing operations. Our Robert Half
Technology and Robert Half Management Resources divisions turned in solid results, notwithstanding this.

Protiviti had another very strong quarter, posting double-digit, year-on-year revenue gains for the eighth
consecutive quarter. It saw broad strength across its diversified service offerings, including internal audit,
technology consulting and regulatory compliance consulting as well as services provided jointly with
staffing. Return on invested capital for the company was 32% in the first quarter.

Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley.

Michael C. Buckley
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Keith, and hello, everyone. Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were
$1.507 billion in the first quarter. This is an increase of 3% from the first quarter 1 year ago on a reported
basis and an increase of 2% on an as-adjusted basis. Also on an as-adjusted basis, first quarter staffing
revenues were down 1% year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $944 million, down 0.2% from the
prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $269 million, down 4% year-over-year on an as-adjusted
basis. We have 327 staffing locations worldwide, including 88 locations in 17 countries outside the United
States.

In the first quarter, there were 63.1 billing days compared to 62.2 billing days in the same quarter 1 year
ago. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days, unchanged from the second quarter 1 year ago.

Currency exchange rate movements during the first quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-
over-year staffing revenues by $9 million. This decreased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue
growth rate by 0.7 percentage points.

Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the first quarter were $294 million,
$233 million of that is from business within the United States and $61 million is from operations outside
the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global first quarter Protiviti revenues were up 15% versus the
year ago period. The U.S. -- with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 20%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 2% on an
as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2
million and decreasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.6 percentage points. Protiviti and its
independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries.

Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, first quarter gross
margin was 37.8% of applicable revenues compared to 38.0% of applicable revenues in the first quarter
1 year ago. Our permanent placement revenues in the first quarter were 9.9% of consolidated staffing
revenues versus 10.8% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined
with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin decreased 70 basis points
compared to the year ago first quarter, to 44%. For Protiviti, gross margin was $78 million in the first
quarter or 26.3% of Protiviti revenues. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $64 million or 25.3%
of Protiviti revenues.

Company-wide SG&A costs were 31.8% of global revenues in the first quarter compared to 31.4% in
the same quarter 1 year ago. Staffing SG&A costs were 35.3% of staffing revenues in the first quarter
versus 34.2% in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in staffing SG&A as a percentage of revenue was
significantly impacted by negative leverage as revenues decreased in response to the pandemic. First
quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.3% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.9% of revenues in the
year ago period.

Moving on to operating income. Company-wide operating income was $131 million in the first quarter.
Operating margin was 8.7%. First quarter operating income for our staffing divisions was $105 million with

5

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

an operating margin of 8.6%. Operating income for Protiviti in the first quarter was $26 million, with an
operating margin of 9%.

Our first quarter tax rate was very high at 32% compared to 26% a year ago. The primary driver was the
lower-than-expected tax deduction for the annual vesting of stock compensation, which was valued after
recent stock price declines.

At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable was $854 million, and implied day sales outstanding,
DSO, was 51 days.

Given the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on global economies, we are not
offering overall guidance this quarter. We will, however, review with you some of the monthly revenue
trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency and billing days.

Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues down 6%
versus the prior year compared to being flat for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 3 weeks of April
were down 25% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent placement revenues in March were
down 33.3% versus March of 2019. This compares to a 9% decrease for the full quarter. For the first 3
weeks of April, permanent placement revenues were down 63% compared to the same period in 2019.

Protiviti's pipeline remains strong, particularly for technology and regulatory compliance engagements.
Protiviti expects second quarter revenues to be in the range of flat to down 10% versus the prior year. As
a result of these staffing trends and the continuing social distancing lockdowns across the globe, we took
actions in March and early April to reduce our operating costs by approximately 20% compared to the first
quarter of 2020. Also, we are currently taking further action to reduce SG&A costs by an additional 10%.
These actions have been focused on eliminating all nonessential costs, such as travel and events as well
as laying off our less-experienced and lower-performing staff. Impacted corporate staff were furloughed
with paid benefits, awaiting a return to higher activity levels. Given the timing of these reductions and
certain severance costs, reported results in the second quarter will only reflect savings of approximately
25% versus the first quarter of 2020.

We entered this period with a very strong balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $250 million
in cash and $854 million in receivables, both of which will be a significant source of ongoing liquidity and
financial resilience.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith.

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Mike. As noted earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on global
economies as a result of stay-at-home orders and business closures to stop the spread of the virus. Our
staffing clients, most of which are small and midsized businesses, are feeling the crisis most acutely,
and the downstream effect is a much tougher business climate for Robert Half. I'm extremely proud
of how our teams have been responding to this pandemic. Even in the current environment, we see
opportunity. We're aggressively pursuing significant opportunities in financial services, government and
public education and outsourced reshoring many times jointly with Protiviti. We're already seeing many
successes in these areas.

Protiviti has also successfully transitioned its existing and new client work to a remote delivery model,
which makes it even more possible to bring the most relevant deep-subject-matter experts to the table for
its client.

We believe the factors that drive typical recovery patterns are still very much in place. Companies get lean
and defer projects during downturns, particularly nimble, small and midsized businesses, Because they
start lean, employers need help as business picks up and they resume projects that were put on hold.
Variable cost labor models are ideal in the early stages of a recovery until the business stabilizes. As the
recovery accelerates, there is typically pent-up demand, especially for specialized skills. The quality of
the available labor pool is never better than in the early part of a recovery. Many people who lost their

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

jobs during the downturn did so because of business conditions, not performance. Some companies will
tap into this talent pool by hiring full-time as their business picks up. Others will upgrade existing staff,
and some will tap into the high-quality temporary and contractor pool because they're reluctant to hire
full-time. Either way, Robert Half gets a lift in permanent placement and temporary and contact (sic)
[ contract ] revenues. What's particularly good news this time is that employers have seen that remote
work can be effective. With fewer geographical constraints, we can find an even better fit on the candidate
side, which effectively raises the quality of the candidate pool that much further. We're already seeing
examples of this. In short, as business picks up, demand for our services also picks up because clients
start with lean staffs. Likewise, the quality of the candidate supply benefits from high unemployment and
fewer geographic limitations, which provides further incentive for our clients.

During early periods of recovery, clients particularly need our help to avoid becoming overwhelmed with
the massive volume of candidate responses to their open positions. They're ill equipped to handle the
interviewing, vetting, follow-up and consummation of their employment requirements. They also need
our help persuading fully employed candidates to make a job change at a time when they value the
security of their existing jobs and to get access to candidates who are only known to us confidentially.
In the past 2 downturns, once the trough was reached, our revenue growth was very robust for the
next 3 to 5 years, with permanent placement outpacing temporary and consulting. Much of the current
unprecedented monetary and physical policy response to this crisis, including this week's $484 billion
extension, is targeted at our client base. This gives us cause for optimism. We're confident that Robert
Half will participate fully in any recovery as business conditions improve.
Now Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just 1 question and a single follow-
up, as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Keith and Mike, I hope you guys are both well and as well as your families. I'm wondering, can you talk
a little bit about the weekly trends that you ended up seeing in terms of going through late March and
through April, just in terms of whether you've seen any signs that perhaps what we're seeing in April is
kind of close to a bottom? Or are things continuing to deteriorate? And could you discuss that with a little
bit of granularity between the different subsegments, if you could? And then I have a follow-up.

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Happy to. And yes, Mike and I are well, as are our families. So trends, as we said, through mid-
March, we were strong and above plan, now we're talking temp. The last 2 weeks of March showed the
biggest drops as the shutdown spread. After that, the rate of decline has progressively slowed to a small
single-digit percentage. To be clear, that means April week 3 was only a small single-digit percentage
less than April week 2. Also, the number of new assignments that we're getting on the temp side has
actually flattened out, which we're encouraged by. Office team is the most impacted, as admin support is
more discretionary and they took longer to transition to work from home. Management Resources, Robert
Half Technology were the least impacted, they're higher level, longer duration projects, and they move
to remote work more easily. Most of our temps and contractors are working remotely, either using client
laptops, Robert Half-provided laptops. We have thousands in inventory that we send to them, plus we
have a cloud solution that quickly converts a candidate's personal device to a virtual secure desktop, and
we can do that in a matter of minutes.

Before I talk about perm, I'll also talk that on the temp side, our conversations with clients are getting
more positive. We're seeing significant traction and wins many times jointly with Protiviti. Hot areas
include mortgage refinancing and forbearance; credit and collections, particularly in consumer lending;
loan processors, particularly as it relates to the stimulus loans; we've got assignments with some states,
helping them to process their unemployment claims; we have tech support assignments for organizations
that are new to working remotely; some companies found that had outsourced certain of their processes,
particularly to India, learned that those outsourcers were not well set up for work from home or remote
work, and are now reshoring those back to the United States. Those are perfect assignments for a joint
Protiviti staffing, managed business solution, managed technology solution.

As it relates to perm placement, perm placement was also solid through mid-March, and frankly, through
mid-March, we were probably on pace to have the best first quarter we've had in quite a while. However,
the last 2 weeks of March for perm, interestingly, flattened out, didn't go down, but that's a time period in
years past where there's a significant jump or lift, which didn't happen this year. Then the first 2 weeks of
April, there was a significant drop in perm. The good news is, our job orders, the new job orders in perm,
the last 3 weeks are flat. So we're cautiously optimistic based on everything I've just said that we're close
to, if not at the bottom, because it certainly appears that the trends are flattening out.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's terrific. And I'm wondering, you gave some guidance for Protiviti, which seems fantastic. I'm
wondering if you can talk to how sustainable you think that is, particularly in light of some of the things
that you mentioned in terms of the opportunities that you're seeing in financial services, government
reshoring and some of the projects that they're doing there.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

Protiviti had a fantastic first quarter. Our operating income was up 42% year-on-year. We couldn't be
happier. It was broad-based, as we've talked in the past, led by technology consulting, which was cyber,
which is privacy, which was cloud; FSI regulatory, which is anti-money laundering, which was consumer
lending; as well as the joint engagements with staffing. The pipeline in tech, the pipeline in FSI regulatory
remains very strong, they remain very bullish on that. Internal audit is seeing some impact, fewer pre-
IPO engagements. Certain portions of their internal audit -- their clients' internal audit budgets are
discretionary, which are being reduced. Protiviti has some, but not an outsized, some exposure to energy,
to transportation and to hospitality, and all those clients have cut back their internal audit budgets. But
by and large, particularly for tech and FSI, Protiviti has a very strong pipeline and feel very good at least
through the second quarter, and frankly, beyond as it relates to those two. Internal audit, some softness
for reasons I just explained. I think importantly, many of you are now looking at us today versus the
last downturn, and I think the differences in Protiviti are the most striking going into the last downturn,
over 70% of Protiviti's revenues were Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. So during the downturn, they had
not only to deal with downturn discretionary spending reductions, but they also had to deal with clients
rationalizing their Sarbanes-Oxley, the initial Sarbanes-Oxley compliance cost. Now Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance is less than 15% of revenue. They've diversified very nicely. So I think you're going to see a
very different Protiviti performance this time than last, and that's already being demonstrated by what
you're seeing so far.

Operator

Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Keith, one of the big segments are really the focus of your clients in small and medium-sized businesses. I
know it's also small order sizes, but I just wanted to get a sense of small- and medium-sized businesses,
like is the PPP helping them? And when you guys say small- and medium-sized businesses, is that like
companies of 500 employees or less? Just give us a sense of how you think of small- and medium-sized
businesses.

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So let's profile our client base a bit on the staffing side. So about 80% of our revenue we would
describe as small- and middle-sized businesses, SMBs. The other 20%, we call strategic accounts, and
strategic accounts, you would probably call mid-cap companies. And so our SMBs, the median would
be between 50 and 100 employees with accountants and office team tending more toward the 50, and
Robert Half Management Resources, Robert Half Technology tending toward the 100. Again, that's 80%
of our staffing business. The balance is strategic accounts. Now strategic accounts, while their margins
are modestly lower than what we get from SMBs, they are light years higher than what the large general
staffing firms get from those types of clients. The median size of our strategic account clients would be in
the $4 billion to $6 billion in revenue, which I would call a mid-cap company.

As to PPE, it was interesting. NFIB released a couple of days ago that 75% of its constituents had
applied for a PPP loan, but that only 20% had received any money to date. I can tell you we have many
engagements where we're helping our clients prepare for the application related to PPE as well as the
employee retention credit that they can qualify for. So I'd say there's a lot of activity there. I'm not sure a
lot of actual cash has yet flowed to our client base in that way.

There's another point I would make that I found of interest. There was a study by one of the larger Wall
Street firms that studied the performance of SMBs during downturns, and I had some notes I'm trying to
find. They compared the recovery after the 1982 recession to the recovery after the 2008 recession, and
they believe the recessions were similar in size and in nature, and they concluded that the SMB recovery
post-'82 was much stronger than the SMB recovery post-2008 because of the policy focus was principally

on SMB. So we're very encouraged that much of the current policy focus, including hopefully today's
extension, is focused on those SMBs.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Keith, you talked about a little bit about how Protiviti is different this downturn. I'm just wondering if you
could give us some color on the rest of your businesses and maybe what you learned coming out of last
downturn that you might have changed or you might think you'd be different positioned in temporary and
consulting staffing and perm.

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, I guess, without talking about what's different, let me first talk generally. I first would observe
that we have a very experienced management team at both corporate and in the field. Most of us have
managed through the downturn of the early 2000s as well as '08, '09. The declines we've seen so far,
we've seen before, it's just that they're happening much quicker. We've learned over those years that
once it's clear, there's going to be a sharp downturn that we act quickly to reduce inexperienced and
underperforming staff as well as reduce discretionary costs. To the extent these staffs struggled during
good times, it's unlikely they'd perform any better during a tougher market. This benefits our best
performers as the ongoing revenues are spread over fewer people. We believe in targeted reductions
rather than across-the-board ones. Every office, every market, every person is different. We have very
detailed performance data that drives these decisions. As Mike mentioned, we've already taken the actions
to reduce our SG&A cost by 30%. However, given our intent to protect our best people, we have to have
their back. They have to know we've got their back. It will be much harder to get significant additional
savings because they got to primarily come from nonpayroll areas. The playbook is not about just cutting
costs, it's also about mobilizing quickly to pursue those pockets of demand where labor resources are
needed. I've talked about those earlier. We're confident that this strategy, which has worked before, will
work again, which is what we're executing on.

Now from the standpoint of how is staffing different, forget Protiviti, I'd say it isn't dramatically different.
The fact that staffing has Protiviti to go-to-market with, give staffing more opportunities than it would
have on its own or which it had in the last downturn/recovery. So many of the opportunities I described
earlier were -- are at companies that are larger than staffing's traditional client base, more akin to the
strategic account base that I talked about, but there's no question in my mind that staffing, whether it
gets reported as Protiviti or reported as staffing doesn't matter. There's no question. Staffing will do better.
Staffing is already doing better because it has Protiviti to go-to-market with that it didn't have in the last
downturn. And that's significant.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. My second question was to focus on perm. There's probably not
a lot of full-time hiring these days, yet you're still getting some business. Who are the type of clients or
what are the type of positions that are using your perm recruiters to hire full-time?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, remember now that in our perm business, our clients typically will only pay a fee for us to find for
them someone who's fully employed. And so the ranks of those who are currently unemployed don't
really impact the pool of people that are -- or if anything, they shrink the pool of people that are currently
employed. So to some degree, it makes it even harder for our recruiters, given that, but there are many
there were many searches in place when this happened, clients understand how tough it was to get great

people, you don't forget that in 4 weeks. I know even ourselves internally, we've had certain positions,
particularly in IT, that we've struggled to get really good people. And I can assure you, we're now looking
to hire full-time in those areas because we may now have that opportunity. But in accounting and finance,
many of those types of positions are considered essential. Cash flow, budgeting, liquidity, all of those
things are top of mind for companies of every size. And we have people right in that sweet spot for which
there's continuing demand for. As I said, as we look at our new job orders in perm, the last 3 weeks,
they've been flat. I mean flat at a low level, I'll give you that, but they're not continuing to decline.

Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Crédit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Keith, there's been a couple of downturns. The severity and kind of the quickness of this is really
unprecedented, and you talked a lot about kind of the bottoming. Any sense of what you look for in terms
of the bottoming to come back out, appreciating that the duration of the downturn could be a lot quicker.
Just I guess anything you're kind of looking to key in on as things stabilize and start to recover.

Well, we're -- we primarily are looking very closely at all our internal metrics, our starts and ends on the
temp side, the job orders, to client visits, there's all type of activity metrics we look at. And then we have
weekly hours build, weekly number of people on assignment, weekly dollars build. So we have many types
of data that we look at, but it's principally week-by-week. The nature of the business is such that you
never have a huge amount of visibility forward. And so instead, you've got to be very attentive to weekly
trends. And as I described earlier, the good news is the rate of decline week versus week has slowed
significantly to a very small single-digit amount.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just how are you thinking about capital allocation in terms of dividend versus
buyback in the near term?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

So for this quarter, kind of given the severity of the impact, we're going to take a pause on buybacks.
However, it is our plan to continue the dividend, because the cash flow that we'll generate plus that which
gets generated from the receivables as your revenues decline, we think we believe will be more than
adequate to continue to pay the dividend. If you look at what we've distributed to shareholders over time,
it's been about 2/3 buybacks, 1/3 dividends. So by pausing this quarter on the buybacks, you've cut 2/3,
if you will, which in part justifies paying the other 1/3, which is dividends. I would also hasten to add that,
over the last 15 years, we bought in about 1/3 of our outstanding and the average price paid was in the
mid-30s. So even by today's standards, that's not bad.

Well, it's kind of interesting. For the first quarter, we actually had positive growth in Germany, which I
found to be incredible, and it stood out positively in that way. But if you look at the post-quarter periods,
it's interesting as well that the year-on-year declines across our major countries outside the U.S. are very
similar to what we're seeing in the United States. So it's all mid-20-ish. I guess France probably stands
out as being the worst, but the rest of them cluster pretty close to mid-20s, which is similar to what we're
seeing in the United States.

Jasper James Bibb
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

And then I was wondering how much of an impact social costs have on gross margin in the last recession
and whether you're expecting a difference there this time around.

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, in the last downturn, I think we lost 300 basis points in gross margin peak-to-trough. About
half of that was conversions, which are related to perm placement. They're just converting temp to
perm. So we would certainly expect to see an impact from that. Some of that, you get some margin
compression as some clients demand lower pricing, which we, for the most part, avoid. But there's some
of that. Some of that's higher unemployment cost. What's interesting about what's going on now is that
the unemployment benefits being paid out by the states currently can't be charged back to individual
companies like they have been in times past, if they're taking the additional federal amount for the benefit
of their constituencies. And I think virtually every state is doing so. So it will be interesting to see, coming
out in a recovery, what happens to individual company unemployment rates given that, unlike in the past,
these claims aren't going to be charged back to us individually as a company.

Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So you referenced a lot of the temp business is not just Protiviti having transitioned to workers working
remotely. Can you provide a little more color on that? How broad-based is that? Has that been broadly
received well and adopted by clients? And is there any change in sort of contract structure or how it works
in terms of billing -- what you're billing, what you're paying, and any of that as you have those people
working from home?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

So I think your question is on the temp side, not Protiviti, some more color on our temporary and
contractors and their working remotely. And the facts are, most of those that we have on assignment
today, as we speak, are working remotely. And they're either using client-provided laptops with VPN
connections back to the client. Robert Half provided laptops, which have been imaged by us to provide a
secure environment that can be connected to our clients. Or as I said earlier, we have this cloud solution
where we can virtually stand up a secure desktop for our candidates, and we can do that in a matter of
minutes. And all of that positions us very well to have our candidate pool remote-ready pretty much at a
moment's notice.

Gary Elftman Bisbee

And you've seen clients broadly adopting that and...

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Absolutely. As I said, the business we have today, now given it's down 20%, but that 75% that we still
have is still largely working remotely. And I'm talking about temporaries and contractors. Our internal staff
are 100% remote. Protiviti staff is 100% remote. But I'm talking our temporaries and contractors, they're
largely working remote.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then the follow-up, I just wanted to clarify the cost reduction efforts that you're
undertaking. You said 20% of operating costs and another 10% of SG&A. Was that operating costs also
focused in SG&A, so roughly 30% of the Q1 SG&A? Or are there costs within...

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

That's precisely correct. So if you take Q1 SG&A dollars, which is about $480 million, I believe. So because
we acted quickly, the first 20% reduction, you're going to get a full quarter's benefit of, and that next
10%, bringing the total to 30%, you're going to get about half of that benefit in the second quarter.

Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is Mario Cortellacci filling in to Hamzah. I know you guys pointed to working capital as a source of
cash. And I just -- I believe you've done that in the past and other downturns. I just kind of want to see
if you can give us a sense of how much of a benefit that could be. And then given the fact that your client
base, obviously, is the small- and medium-sized businesses and they're under stress, in other sectors,
we're seeing customers asking for deferral of payment or delayed payment. Or are you seeing anything
like that in staffing as well?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

And so the answer to how much a benefit is a direct function of your revenue assumption. So clearly, the
more severe the drop in revenue, the more severe the drop in receivables, which is actually cash positive.
Interestingly, in the last downturn, our DSO didn't go up by a single day. Now in the last downturn, there
weren't shutdowns either like they are this time. So do we expect that DSO won't change by a single day?
No. But as of yesterday, the cash collections are pretty normal relative to what we would expect given
revenues. And while we expect there will be some DSO impact during this particular downturn, we still
believe receivable reductions will be a significant source of cash.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then, obviously, I know you're an economist, and I was not expecting you to predict the future. But I
just want to get a sense for what you're hearing from some customers and clients about what their temp
hiring plans are, how much visibility you have. I think kind of the assumption is maybe we started seeing
some kind of return to normalcy, maybe in June-ish, July. And I just didn't know, I guess, what's the time
frame that you think your customers are expecting for the economy to kind of open back up and things
get to a little more normal? Not saying that we'll be operating like we were last year in July, but I guess,
what's kind of the cadence of reopening and your customer expectations?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, we have very little visibility. But as we said earlier, our clients are very nimble and get very lean,
and given initial unemployment claims the last 4 weeks, I think it's safe to assume they've gotten very

lean very quickly. And so at the first moment that things pick up, they're going to need help, which is
very consistent with past cycles, which is the point we tried to make earlier. We don't know the time
frame. We don't know whether this is V-shaped, U-shaped, what the shape is. As we've said, we've ran
the playbook that has stood us well in prior downturns. We feel good about the actions we've taken. We
feel good about the capacity we have with our best people to participate the second things get better.
And oh, by the way, we have all these particular opportunities that are focused on current circumstances,
particularly with financial services institutions, as I talked about. So time frame, I don't know. Visibility,
we don't have much of. History says, our clients get really lean, which puts them in a spot to have a lot
of requirements when things get better. We think they've acted just as I've acted in the past, if anything,
more so, and have gotten even more lean, and whether the source of cash is their PPP loan or it's because
their business picks up, we like how we're positioned.

Your next question comes from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I wanted to go back to Gary's question, just about the cost reductions. Is there any chance that through
technology or any of your corporate initiatives that some of those costs may not come back with revenue
-- once revenue comes back? Or do you think that those are -- I guess the question is, are any of those
cost cuts permanent? Or do you think they all kind of come back with volume?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

I think it's a really good question, and I think it's a really good opportunity for us to kind of stretch
the limits of what kind of benefits can we get with technology. We've made significant investments in
AI and other things that we've talked about many times on these calls. But we're actually cautiously
optimistic that the productivity of the workforce coming out of this will be better than the productivity of
the workforce we've had more recently, and there's upside there.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Right. Okay. Yes. That's what I was getting at, just with all your investments and stuff. I guess just my
quick follow-up. On the Protiviti business, with revenue kind of earmarked flat to down a little bit, do you
think that margin can still be up year-over-year in that type of revenue cadence?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

I think with flat to down revenue for Protiviti, that means they're going to be -- they're going to have
less utilization, lower chargeability, so that says that their gross margin would be down more than their
revenue, which would stress their margins a bit. So I would expect their margins to take a bigger hit
than their revenue. Now they do have this tranche of variable labor when they're using contractors and
temporaries from us, and they will swap them out for their own full-time staff. But because the cost of
their own full-time staff is higher than the cost of the contractors, that's actually margin compressing as
well. So I think you're going to see a little more margin compression, then you're going to see revenue
decline on Protiviti. That said, given the circumstances, I think their performance is outstanding.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

When you were talking about some of the April trends, particularly in temp, I think you mentioned some
onshoring. I just wasn't clear if you were talking about Protiviti temp kind of joint projects. Or specifically
have temp trends in April kind of flatlined?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

And so when I talk temp trends, I was talking pure temp staffing that had nothing to do with Protiviti.
Pure temp, where the rate of decline has slowed to a low single-digit percentage. Nothing to do with
Protiviti. When I talked about many of the opportunities we have that we're excited about, many of those
opportunities are joint opportunities with Protiviti. But that's more about from today forward rather than
the periods of time I talked about with regard to trends.

Ryan C. Leonard
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And would you say not providing guidance is more a reflection of the uncertainty today? Even
though you think things are stabilizing, you just don't want to commit to anything at this point given the
uncertainty?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

I think given the uncertainty, we don't know when everybody is going back to work. We don't know
whether it's going to be phased. We don't know whether it's county by county, city by city, state by state,
country by country. There's just too much we don't know. And while we have a nice 6-week period where
we can judge trends, who knows whether those 6 weeks are representative of the next 6 weeks. We
feel good about the trends as we see them for the reason we've talked about. But there's just too much
uncertainty about how representative that is of what we're getting ready to see.

Ryan C. Leonard
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And if I could sneak in one more, just -- this is such a unique circumstance, but part of the
government response has really been to offer these PPP loans to hold up payrolls. As things start to come
back, I mean, do you envision any trade-off there, where there's a lot of people on the sideline who may
be hired back first as a result or maybe who are able to be used quicker than temp just because of the
uniqueness of the fiscal response?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, most of those PPP loans have to be spent 75% on payroll, meaning you retained the payroll. And
therefore, to the extent what you retained isn't enough, you're going to need help. And might there be a
little bit of a pause as you catch up on those that you furloughed if you didn't seek a PPP loan or received
a PPP loan. But I think the overarching comment that our clients get lean because they're nimble, I don't
think, at a high level, that's changed because of PPP loans. And at least so far, they haven't even received
their PPP loans.

Your next question comes from David Silver from CL King.

David Cyrus Silver
CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Keith and Mike, thanks very much for all the great detail. I have kind of a small-bore question and then
a bigger question. Firstly, it would have to do with the costs associated with the 30% reduction in your
base level of SG&A. So Keith, one feature, I think, of your reported results is it's extremely rare when you
call out an item as like a restructuring cost or a onetime item that analysts like us adjust for when we're

15

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

projecting your earnings per share. So I'm interested, the costs that were involved in achieving the 20%
first phase reduction and the 10% second phase reduction in your SG&A, do you intend to call that out as
a separate line item? And then secondly, if you could just ballpark that cost, that would be very helpful.

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, orders of magnitude, the first round of reductions, we had severance of about $5 million and that
was recorded in the first quarter. For the second round of reductions, notice we said we've cut the cost
by 30%, and only 25% of that gets reflected in the second quarter. So there's a 5% there that doesn't. If
you take that 5%, you can kind of split it in half between how much relates to severance and how much
relates to timing and that you don't get a full quarter's benefit. So I think you'll find that the severance
is orders of magnitude, $10 million for the second round. And the reason it's more than the first round.
The first round was geared more toward inexperienced people. The second round was geared more toward
lower-performing people that have been here longer than the inexperienced people.

David Cyrus Silver
CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I'm assuming that won't be called out separately then?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

It's not our style that I just did, obviously.

David Cyrus Silver
CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Correct. No, no. Just for forecasting. Second question is more of a big picture item. But there's -- you've
commented on different angles of what's different this time around versus the past couple of downturns.
I'm going to just throw one out at you. But one thing that I expect and many other people expect to be
different is the role of China within the world economy, that there will be a significant reorientation or
repositioning of global supply chains away from China and back, I'm assuming, to the western economies
broadly who had been offshoring or outsourcing, I guess, a lot of their production and distribution and
service operations. I know it's extremely early days, but does that seem like a viable kind of incremental
source of growth? Is that something that maybe some of your more sophisticated clients have started to
ask you about? And do you have any thoughts on that? And what parts of your business may be the most
sensitive to kind of bringing global supply chains back into domestic markets and the economies where
your -- you have operations?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'm not sure supply chain repositioning impacts us that much directly, I think, related but different
would be to the extent our mid-cap clients have outsourced certain of their processes to India and Ireland
and other places that proved they weren't very well positioned to work remotely when they were shut
down. And so I know we are already seeing opportunities where companies are bringing those processes
back, which is an opportunity for us, either to consult, to provide labor or even to outsource to ourselves
with our joint offerings. That's clearly already having an impact and it's expected to have an impact. So
it's a similar theme, but it's not China supply chain specifically.

David Cyrus Silver
CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Yes. No. I thought it might be analogous, but I hadn't heard you mention China specifically in your
comments. So I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

You mentioned that temp declines have begun to stabilize over the past 6 weeks. Given the broad-based
nature of the shutdowns already, based on what you're seeing, what factors could potentially cause trends
to begin worsening again?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'd say, clearly, that's not the trend we're seeing. If there would be new outbreaks of significance
that would extend, worsen the shutdowns, clearly, that would have an impact. But as I said, relative to the
shutdowns that have occurred so far, we had a significant drop for a couple of weeks, the last 2 weeks of
March. But for -- but beyond that, we have seen a path towards stabilization. But I would say, what would
take it lower would start with science and health reasons more than anything else.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Makes sense. On the cost side, you're reducing operating costs by 30%, like you said, by 2Q. How much
of those cost reductions involve the elimination of recruiter headcount? And how quickly are you able to
restaff recruiters when business trends do improve?

M. Keith Waddell
President, CEO & Director

Well, we haven't and don't plan to break out the reductions by nature. But I think it's safe to say given
that payroll is roughly 2/3 of our SG&A, payroll has got to be the lion's share of the reductions. And as
far as how quickly can we restaff, we're in the recruiting business. That's our day job. And to the extent
we need to recruit for ourselves, that's something we're well positioned to do. And hopefully, because the
labor market when we go to hire those people will be less tight than the labor market when we hire the
people we just let go, potentially, we get people that can have higher productivity, which would be a good
thing.

Okay. Operator, I think that was our last question.
