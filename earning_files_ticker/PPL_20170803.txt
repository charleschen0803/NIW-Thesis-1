Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone
We're pleased that you've joined us this morning
With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Heads of our U.S
and U.K
Moving to slide 2; our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and our year-to-date 2017 earnings results
We'll provide an update to our full 2017 year earnings guidance as well as a brief operational overview, including an overview of Ofgem's RIIO-2 process
Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review
As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions
Turning to slide 3; PPL had another strong quarter with very solid results through the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2017. PPL's earnings for the quarter and year-to-date are lower compared to 2016, as expected, primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. Today, we announced second quarter of 2017 reported earnings of $0.43 per share, compared with $0.71 per share a year ago
Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.01 per share, compared to $1.41 per share through the first half of 2016. Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share, compared with $0.56 per share a year ago
Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted second quarter of 2017 earnings from ongoing operations by $0.07 per share, compared to 2016. The remaining quarterly increase in earnings from ongoing operations of $0.03 per share was due to lower operating and maintenance expenses in Kentucky and in the U.K
Through the first six months of 2017, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.14 per share, this compares with $1.23 per share through the same period a year ago
Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2017 year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations by the amount of $0.17 per share, compared with last year
The remaining increase in year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations of $0.08 per share was primarily due to the April 1, 2016 annual price increase in the U.K
, partially offset by unfavorable weather in Kentucky
Vince will go in to greater detail on second quarter results later in the call
Moving now to slide 4; today, we're reaffirming our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with the midpoint of $2.15 per share and are providing an updated segment breakdown
We've revised our Kentucky segment ongoing earnings projection for 2017 to $0.56 for the year, compared – primarily as a result of lower electricity sales volumes due to unfavorable weather
At the same time, the earnings for the U.K
Regulated segment are expected to come in stronger for the year
We're now projecting $1.20 per share in the U.K
due to lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower income taxes
Looking beyond 2017, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020 as we execute our business plans, including more than $13 billion in infrastructure investment through 2020. As we look forward, we also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020. Now, let's turn to slide 5 for an update on our Kentucky Utility operations; in June, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized a combined rate increase of $116 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric with new rates taking effect on July 1. The Commission authorized a 9.7% return on equity
Consistent with the base rate case, the Commission also lowered the ROE on our environmental cost recovery mechanisms from 10% and 9.8% to 9.7%
We've incorporated the final outcome of the Kentucky rate cases into our earnings forecast, including the lower ROE and the deferred advanced meter capital expenditures of approximately $300 million
We remain confident that we will be solidly within the 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth range that we projected through 2020. The revenue increase approved by the Commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity and natural gas service
Also in Kentucky, LG&E recently completed its 540-mile, 20-year gas-main replacement, which strengthens the safety and reliability of gas service in Louisville
The project replaced wrought-iron and bare steel natural gas pipelines with durable plastic pipelines
LG&E's project began 15 years before stringent federal regulations were adopted requiring such replacements
Many utilities only began making these types of upgrades within the last five years
Last but not least, our domestic utilities continue to lead the way in customer satisfaction in their regions according to J
Kentucky Utilities ranked the highest among midsized electric utilities in the Midwest, with Louisville Gas and Electric coming in second
Turning to slide 6, for our Pennsylvania operational update; just as we recognized – we were recognized for superior customer service in our Kentucky Utilities, PPL Electric Utilities ranked the highest among large utilities in the East
In all, PPL's U.S
Utilities have won a combined 45 J
Power awards among the Best Utility Companies in the nation
In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities continues to enhance its Smart Grid capabilities
Prior to this spring, the company already had one of the nation's most advanced distribution automation systems in the country
We've added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to prevent power outages and make our system even more resilient
Similar improvements made in 2016 prevented more than 100,000 customer interruptions last year
We expect our latest enhancements to yield additional benefits for our Pennsylvania customers as we move forward
PPL Electric Utilities also continues to make good progress on its $471 million advanced meter replacement project
This includes the replacement of all 1.4 million meters in our Pennsylvania service territory
Approximately 280,000 meters have been replaced to-date and we expect that number to rise to more than 520,000 by the end of the year
Moving to slide 7 and the U.K, our U.K
regulator Ofgem issued an open letter seeking feedback from stakeholders as it begins the process of constructing a framework for RIIO-2. This is a standard course for Ofgem
Responses to the open letter are due September 4 and will help guide the proposed RIIO-2 consultation process to begin in the first quarter of 2018. We are very early on in the process and as you know, any changes for WPD would not take effect until RIIO-ED2 begins in April 2023. We view Ofgem's action as a positive development and that we will have the opportunity to participate constructively in shaping the framework associated with RIIO-2. We've worked well with the Ofgem in the past and delivered positive results for WPD and we have no reason to believe that we would not continue to benefit from the consultation process and the final framework of RIIO-2. The purpose of this review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls in the gas transmission and distribution businesses and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K
Energy sector
To continue with slide 8; any changes to the RIIO framework are expected to focus on giving customers a stronger voice in setting outputs and assessing business plans, providing fair returns for share owners and good value for consumers, properly reflecting business risks and prevailing market conditions, while incentivizing companies to drive value, innovation and efficiency
To mention a few of the specifics, Ofgem indicated they will consider the length of the price control, which for WPD is currently 8 years, potentially aligning the price controls for gas, transmission, and distribution in terms of timing and the engagement process
And the process for how it sets cost of capital given the change in market conditions that could occur over a price-control period
As a reminder, the current price-control period for WPD RIIO-ED1 runs through March of 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultative process
Ofgem has a long history of constructive regulatory frameworks and we believe the consultation process will result in a fair outcome
We've been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and we believe there is ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2. You may recall that we were very successful at mitigating a revenue reset to obviate a sharp decline in our U.K
segment earnings at the start of RIIO-ED1 back in 2015. And in fact, we accomplished earnings growth, compared to 2014. Given how early Ofgem is starting the review process for RIIO-2, we have time to plan for potential changes to the framework
Our strategy for RIIO-2 will be to provide comments on the open letter, have a high level of engagement during the formal consultation process, which begins next year, and construct well-justified business plans that appropriately balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, including our U.K
customers, and of course, our PPL shareowners
Moving to slide 9; Ofgem also initiated the process of assessing the need for a mid-year review for RIIO-ED1. As previously determined by Ofgem, the scope of any midyear review – mid-period review would be to look at any necessary changes to WPD's expenditures due to a change in government policy or new outputs required by customers since the start of RIIO-ED1. There have been no government policy changes – or changes to outputs that was a result in changes to WPD, if a mid-period review is conducted
At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our quarterly segment earnings
Vince?
Thank you, Vince
In summary, we had another good quarter and PPL remains on track to deliver on its 2017 earnings forecast
We remain confident in our ability to deliver 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share from 2017 through 2020. As you know, we've raised the dividend 4% earlier this year and we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% through 2020. We're executing very well on our low-risk business plans
And we continue to deliver for our customers as evidenced by our industry-leading customer satisfaction awards
With that, operator, let's open the call to questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning, Greg
So that is one option, rolling forward the value into 2020 and beyond
But you are correct, if things stayed as they are today, with the forward curve being above our targeted budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound, we would be at the high-end of our earnings forecast
So you're absolutely correct on that
I would say that probably as we finalize our hedging for 2020, we'll be able to give a little bit more color around how we expect to use the value to the extent it continues to sit out in the forward years, and whether we're going to adjust our earnings forecast through 2020, or push that value forward into future years
Well, a couple of things there
One is, the tools that we've used in the past, I would say our tax planning and pension planning
So those are things that we've been effective at doing in the past
You mentioned shaping the revenue profile
That's something as we go through the consultation process, we'll look at how we develop our plan and whether that's an appropriate avenue to pursue as well
Vince, I don't know if you have any other comments around that and then, I can ask Robert as well
Great
Great, thank you, Greg
So, Michael, I think you may recall that we basically took our load assumption, which was from 0.5% to 1% in the previous business plan down to flat, based on the trends we were seeing at the time
So our current earnings per share forecast through 2020 does include flat earnings growth on a – and as you know, sometimes weather adjustments are difficult at best
So in terms of the regulatory construct, there are tools that we could look at
And in Pennsylvania, for example, it would be a true up based on volume
As you know, in the U.K
, we already have true ups based on how the weather turns out or the economies are made whole in terms of the impact to revenue
So the Pennsylvania PUC is kind of looking at a broad set of looking at the energy environment as it's pretty dynamic at the moment, what changes to their policies and practices might make sense for the utilities that they regulate
So I think there's probably more to come
I don't think in Kentucky we have a near-term concern
Vic, maybe you want to comment?
