Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the J. M. Smucker Company's Fiscal 2021 Second Quarter Earnings
Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the conference over to Aaron Broholm, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead,
sir.

Aaron Broholm
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our fiscal 2021 second quarter earnings conference call.

After this brief introduction, Mark Smucker, President and CEO, will give an overview of the quarter's
results and an update on our strategic initiatives and fiscal year priorities. Tucker Marshall, CFO, will then
provide detailed analysis of the financial results and our updated fiscal 2021 outlook.

During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current
expectations about future plans and performance. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates,
and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. I encourage you to read the full
disclosure concerning forward-looking statements in this morning's press release, which is located on our
corporate website at jmsmucker.com.

Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results to evaluate performance internally, as
detailed in the press release. We have posted a supplementary slide deck summarizing the quarterly
results. These slides can be accessed on our website and will be archived there, along with a replay of this
call. If you have additional questions after today's call, please contact me.

I will now turn the call over to Mark Smucker.

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

First, I want to acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our everyday way of life,
making the operating environment dynamic and difficult to predict. I'm incredibly proud of our employees
who have worked tirelessly to deliver exceptional operational and financial results, and I would like to
recognize our suppliers and retail partners who have supported us during this unprecedented time.

As we are entering the winter months and are experiencing a nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases, we
remain committed to prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees, supporting the communities
where we do business and providing a steady quality supply of food for consumers and their pets.

In the second quarter, net sales increased 4% versus the prior year and was slightly ahead of our
expectations. At-home consumption remains elevated as sales in our coffee, consumer and international
retail businesses collectively grew 10%. Sales in the pet food and snack segment were in line with
expectations as continued growth for cat food and dog snacks were offset by anticipated softness for dog
food. Finally, the Away From Home business continued its sequential improvement from the fourth quarter
last fiscal year when many of our customers were either closed or shut down.

Adjusted earnings per share was $2.39, an increase of 6%, benefiting from increased sales volume,
improved profit margins and reduced interest expense partially offset by increased SD&A expenses.

Due to stronger-than-anticipated results through the first half of the fiscal year and updated assumptions
for the second half of the year, we have increased our full year expectations to include net sales growth
of 1% to 2% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.55 to $8.85. This

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 24, 2020

updated guidance does not include the impact of the pending Crisco divestiture. Tucker will provide more
details regarding the inputs informing our fiscal 2021 guidance.

This fiscal year, we have been focused on 4 specific priorities: driving consistent net sales growth;
increasing our focus on financial discipline with an emphasis on maintaining or improving our strong profit
margins and cash flow generation; strengthening our commercial execution and building competitive
advantages through harnessing our full suite of capabilities; and living up to our commitment to our
company's purpose of feeding connections that help us thrive. The execution of these priorities will help us
to continue on our long-term strategy to lead in the best categories, build brands consumers love and be
everywhere.

At the halfway point of the year, I am encouraged by the progress we have made against these priorities.
We will continue to execute against these priorities in the back half of the year while furthering our focus
on the brands and categories that have the greatest growth opportunities over the long term.

We continue to benefit from strong demand due to incremental at-home consumption related to the
pandemic and achieved a third consecutive quarter of net sales growth above our expectations. Key
metrics for consumers purchasing our products improved in the quarter with household penetration,
repeat purchasing rate and dollars spent per buyer, all having increased versus the prior year and
sequentially from the first quarter, showing that many of the new consumers gained during the initial
phases of the pandemic have remained with our brands. We continue our efforts to retain these
consumers and anticipate many will remain loyal consumers of our brands beyond the pandemic.

In the second quarter, we are pleased to have increased our dollar market share in core consumer and
coffee segments as well as our cat food business, highlighting the strength of our broad brand portfolio
in these categories. In aggregate, we grew share for brands representing roughly half of our sales, and
we grew retail dollar sales for over 80% of the portfolio. This growth has been enhanced by capabilities
we have built for our e-commerce business, which continues to capture a greater portion of consumers'
grocery spend. Our total e-commerce business grew 45% compared to the prior year and accounted
for 11% of total U.S. retail sales. We anticipate e-commerce growth to remain sticky as consumers are
increasingly adopting and maintaining online grocery shopping habits.

Our sales performance across the company has been supported by the outstanding work our teams are
doing to maintain high levels of production. While we are adequately maintaining production to meet
customer demand, we are producing at or near capacity at many of our plants. We have experienced an
uptick in customer orders over the last 2 weeks with the resurgence of COVID cases, and we continue to
monitor potential supply chain limitations and are taking proactive measures to minimize any potential
disruptions that may be caused by a shortage of materials, reliable transportation or increased demand.

Turning to our segment results. In pet food, our cat food and market-leading dog snacks business
delivered another quarter of net sales growth. Sales for cat food, led by the Meow Mix and 9Lives brands,
grew 9%, representing the 13th consecutive quarter of cat food growth, and our market share improved
by over 0.5 point in the quarter. The dog snacks category continues to experience growth related to
increased treating occasions with pet parents spending more time at home with their dogs, translating to
net sales growth of 3% for our brands, led by Pup-Peroni, Rachael Ray Nutrish and Milk-Bone.

Our dog food sales declined, with the largest decreases attributed to private label and the Natural Balance
brand. Nutrish dry dog food experienced anticipated weakness. However, we are confident that our actions
will improve the trajectory of the brand. These efforts include increased marketing investments, enhanced
packaging and improved assortment through SKU optimization and unique innovation launching in the
fourth quarter. As a total brand, Nutrish sales were up low single digits in the quarter as increases for wet
dog food, dog snacks and cat food and cat snacks offset the declines in dry dog food.

Turning to our coffee business. We delivered net sales growth for all brands in our market-leading at-home
coffee portfolio as total segment net sales increased 9%. We increased our dollar share by 0.5 point and
now have over a 25-point share with 3 of the top 10 brands in the category. Growth was led by Dunkin'
and Café Bustelo, with both brands achieving 20% retail sales growth.

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 24, 2020

In the K-Cup segment, we continue to grow at over 2x the category rate and gained nearly 2 share points
in the quarter. Over 1.5 million net new households consumed at least one of our coffee brands during the
quarter. As new coffee habits have formed the pandemic, we have the opportunity to retain a substantial
portion of these new consumers for the long term. We will support continued momentum with increased
marketing investments in the back half of this fiscal year.

In our consumer foods segment, growth across all categories drove a 12% increase in sales. In snacking,
our Smucker's Uncrustables business continued to deliver exceptional growth. Second quarter net sales
increased 16%, and the brand gained nearly 1 full retail share point. We remain on track to add capacity
at our Longmont facility in early calendar year 2021, and we have accelerated future capacity plans. We
are confident we will be able to continue this strong growth moving forward.

In peanut butter, the Jif brand returned to market share growth and has now gained 6 share points since
mid-May due to replenished product assortment being back on shelf. Growth in the quarter occurred
across both volume and dollars inclusive of a list price increase in August to reflect higher peanut costs
related to reduced crop yields. With our full assortment back on shelf, upcoming distribution expansion
and innovation and promotional and marketing programs returning, we anticipate further peanut butter
share growth in the back half of the year.

Underpinning the improvement in net sales and market share has been strong commercial execution and
a continued commitment to financial discipline. Retailer inventories have improved, and we are resuming
some investments in marketing and promotions that were delayed as consumer takeaway outpaced
available production in certain categories. We plan to increase marketing investments in the second half
of the year, inclusive of mass media, targeted digital consumer engagement, e-commerce and click-and-
collect programs. We continue to balance return with reinvestment to support our brands and to benefit
from structural changes in consumer behavior.

I want to highlight one additional critical area of our continued execution improvement during the quarter.
While growth through acquisitions has and will continue to play in a role in our strategy, we continually
evaluate our portfolio and have been willing to divest businesses that are no longer consistent with our
strategic focus. We did this with the divestiture of our U.S. canned milk and U.S. baking businesses the
past few years. Furthering our plans to exit the U.S. baking category, a few weeks ago, we announced
the signing of a definitive agreement to divest the Crisco oils and shortening business. These divestitures
underscore a commitment to further focus our resources on brands and categories with the greatest
growth opportunities. As we move ahead, we will continue to evaluate all elements or the portfolio and
make changes when necessary to align our portfolio for growth.

In summary, I would like reinforce a few key points. One, our business continues to perform well,
and the actions we are taking to deliver our fiscal 2021 priorities are leading to improvement in key
metrics, including market share that position us well for the remainder of the year and beyond. Two, we
continue to make progress against our consumer-centric growth strategy, including increased marketing
investments to position us for sustained growth even with the future moderation of COVID-19-related
demand. And three, I am incredibly proud and thankful to all our employees for their dedication and
perseverance through this extraordinary time.

I'll now turn the call over to Tucker.

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by providing an overview of the second quarter
results before giving an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021.

Net sales increased 4%, driven by favorable volume mix in the U.S. Retail Coffee and Consumer
segments, driven by elevated at-home consumer demand, partially offset by a decline in the Away From
Home business. Adjusted gross profit increased to $34 million or 4% from the prior year, mostly driven by
the positive contribution from volume mix. The net impact of price and cost was also favorable, primarily

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

6

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 24, 2020

due to manufacturing operating leverage from the increased volume and net pricing benefit partially offset
by higher input costs and freight expense.

Adjusted operating income grew $18 million or 5%, reflecting the increased gross profit, partially offset by
higher SD&A expenses. Within SD&A, general and administrative expense increased $23 million, primarily
reflecting higher incentive compensation and the reinstatement of salary increases.

Below operating income, interest expense decreased $4 million and the adjusted effective income tax rate
was 24% compared to 24.3% in the prior year. Factoring all this in, second quarter adjusted earnings per
share was $2.39 compared to $2.26 in the prior year, an increase of 6%.

Let me now turn to segment results, beginning with pet foods. Net sales were comparable to the prior
year with cat food growth of 9% and dog snacks growth of 3% offset by our dog food decline of 8%. Pet
food segment profit declined 9% compared to the prior year driven by lower net pricing and increased
marketing expense reflecting investment for the Nutrish brand.

Turning to the coffee segment. Net sales increased 9%, led by the Dunkin' and Café Bustelo brands which
continued their strong trends, growing 24% and 19%, respectively. The Folgers brand grew 2%, driven by
gains for both Roast & Ground and K-Cup formats. Total K-Cup sales in the segment were up 15%. Coffee
segment profit increased 11%, driven by the favorable volume mix and reduced SD&A expenses partially
offset by an unfavorable net impact of pricing and costs.

In consumer foods, net sales increased 12% with growth for all major brands in the segment. Sales for
the Smucker's brand grew 11% led by 16% growth for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches, which marked the
sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The Jif brand grew 12%, reflecting a list price increase,
reduced promotional activity and increased volume for peanut butter. The discontinuation of Jif Power
Ups was a $6 million headwind in the quarter. Consumer Foods segment profit increased 48% due to the
favorable net price and cost efficiencies related to the higher throughput in our plants, increased volume
mix and lower SD&A expenses.

Lastly, in International & Away From Home, net sales declined 10%. The Away From Home business
contracted 24%, primarily driven by declines in coffee and portion-controlled products due to the
continued impact of COVID-related changes in consumer behavior. International growth of 7% was
primarily driven by increases in Canada for the baking, coffee and condiments categories. International
& Away From Home segment profit decreased 22%, mostly driven by the lower volume mix in the Away
From Home business.

Second quarter free cash flow was $326 million, which represented a $166 million increase from the prior
year, reflecting a decrease in net working capital requirements, the growth in earnings and reduced capital
expenditures. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $52 million.

We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalent balances at $406 million. We paid down $216
million of debt during the quarter resulting in a total debt balance of $5.2 billion. Based on a trailing 12-
month EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion, our leverage ratio stands at 2.8x.

The combination of the improvement in earnings and debt repayments over the past 3 quarters has
resulted in our leverage ratio below our 3x stated target. We continue to prioritize the use of free cash
flow toward dividends and debt repayments while maintaining our investment-grade debt rating and
evaluating other strategic uses of cash for future growth and shareholder value creation. The expected
divestiture of the oils and shortening business creates additional strategic flexibility for reinvestment and
the ability to offset the earnings dilution with the after-tax cash proceeds over time.

Let me now provide additional color on our revised outlook for fiscal 2021. The severity and length of
the pandemic and related implications continue to create uncertainty in our financial outlook. Changes in
consumer purchasing behavior, retailer inventory levels, macroeconomic conditions and any manufacturing
or supply chain disruption could materially impact our actual results. That said, we are sharing our
expectations based on our current performance and understanding of the overall environment.

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 24, 2020

Net sales are now anticipated to be up 1% to 2% compared to the prior year, which reflects the sales
performance through the first half of the fiscal year and low to mid single-digit sales growth anticipated
in the third quarter. Fourth quarter net sales are projected to decline substantially due to the lapping of
a $185 million benefit in the prior year related to the initial consumer stock up-purchasing during the
beginning of the pandemic.

We continue to anticipate full year gross profit margin to range from 37.5% to 38%. The projected
deceleration in gross margin for the back half of the year includes incremental trade spend investments,
primarily for the pet business; timing of fixed cost expenses related to manufacturing absorption; and
increased freight and transportation costs.

SD&A expenses are projected to increase 1% to 2%, primarily reflecting increased marketing spend
and incentive compensation. Total marketing spend is expected to approximate 6.5% of net sales, with
additional back half brand reinvestments partially offset by a reduction in planned nonworking marketing
spend.

Net interest expense is now anticipated to be $180 million. We continue to anticipate an effective tax rate
of 24% and a weighted average share count of 114.1 million. Taking all of these factors into consideration,
we anticipate full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.55 and to $8.85. Due to the incremental
reinvestments and the projected reduction in gross profit margin, third quarter adjusted EPS is anticipated
to be down mid-single digits year-over-year. Full year free cash flow is anticipated to range from $975
million to $1.025 billion with capital expenditures of $315 million versus the prior guidance of $300
million.

As noted in our press release this morning, our full year outlook does not include the impact of the
divestiture of Crisco's oils and shortening business, which we expect to close in the third quarter. The
divested net sales for the remainder of the fiscal year is estimated to be $100 million, and the earnings
per share impact before any use of proceeds is estimated to be to be $0.20. The earnings per share
estimate includes $0.05 of stranded overhead not anticipated to be covered until the beginning of next
fiscal year.

In closing, let me reiterate Mark's opening comments. We are pleased with the second quarter results,
which showed the strength of our brand portfolio and the health of our categories. With continued financial
discipline, we are committed to delivering sustainable and consistent long-term value for our shareholders.
Thank you for your time. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator, please queue up the first
question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to ask, Mark, earlier this year, you laid out your 4 key priorities, and one of these was an
increased focus on financial discipline. And I think part of that was maybe partnering with your customers
on allowing you to take more pricing when appropriate, if I read that right. You did have some pretty good
pricing this quarter. This is the first increase in any quarter for the total company in almost 3 years.

And I'm just curious how much you credit some changes that you've made to your financial discipline for
that price increase versus just the ability to sort of take pricing during COVID, which I think is a little bit
easier for everybody. If you could just give us a sense on how much you -- that sort of strategic change
has helped you. I think it would help us understand how sustainable some of the -- maybe the pricing
maneuvers can be.

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Ken, for the question. First of all, I guess I would just highlight, when we talk about financial
discipline, we mean all of it, holistically, in terms of cash generation, what we do with the cash, our debt
pay down, continuing our cost reduction, continuous improvement mindset, all of that being part of that.

From a pricing perspective, I think we've been pretty consistent over time in terms of our ability to take
price. We're always very prudent when we do so. When we work with our customers, we need to ensure
that the pricing is justifiable. And in this case, and particularly in peanut butter, it was very clear that we
were experiencing cost pressures and could demonstrate that to our trading partners and so forth.

So having price discipline and making sure that we can pass along price increases and, in some cases,
decreases in categories like coffee, we will continue to do so. It's fundamental to the success of our
business and our ability to deliver our financial results and goals.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then for my follow-up, you talked about maybe resuming a little bit of marketing that was
delayed. But you've also talked about, I think, being still tight on capacity, which makes sense, and
having an uptick in orders the last couple of weeks. I'm just curious, do you have much flexibility in your
marketing spend if you feel like the return on that investment won't be as good as you anticipated, even
if it speaks for all the right reasons, right, but just mainly because demand is already there, excluding
marketing?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Yes, great question. So first of all, when -- as we have demonstrated over the last few quarters our ability
to continue to improve our share numbers, it really is important to connect with our consumers at this
particular time because as we have experienced a significant uptick in households and our brands have
been, in some cases, rediscovered by consumers, to really engage with those consumers is critical.

And given the fact that we are now seeing, obviously, a second or maybe, in some cases, a third wave, the
industry is better prepared for this wave, in many cases, even though the supply chain may be somewhat
tight, to deal with the increased demand. So it affords us the opportunity to make these investments to
support our brands and do so in a very targeted way that we ensure we get the return.

Our next question is coming from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.

Faiza Alwy
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So I guess I'm going to apologize for asking a fiscal '22 question. But I'm bringing it up only because you
mentioned the dilution impact from Crisco, and you're talking about some reinvestments. And what I'm
really trying to get at is how do you think about the post-COVID world? And if there's anything you can
say around how we should think about as you enter fiscal '22 is the idea that you'll be able to offset some
of this dilution from potential cost savings that you might outline? Just some color around how you're
thinking about the post-COVID world would be really helpful.

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

Faiza, good morning. This is Tucker. With respect to your question, we believe that we have very
strong underlying growth in our portfolio across both pet, coffee and snacks, and we believe that, that
momentum will continue into the next fiscal year on the other side of the pandemic.

And as it relates to the divestiture of the Crisco brand, we acknowledge that the contribution on a full
year basis is about $270 million at top line, and the EPS impact is about $0.45 to $0.55 as well. And we
would anticipate, over time, with a very strong balance sheet, a balanced capital deployment model and
the after-tax proceeds from the divestiture to have the opportunity to either reinvest in the business or
potentially repurchase shares to replace that dilution.

And then, lastly, is we are always committed to a continuous improvement mindset to support our
financial margins over time in order to keep them strong to deliver profitability.

Faiza Alwy
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask about the increase in CapEx for this year. I think
you mentioned -- I might have missed this, but could you give us more details around that? And then
again, how should we think about sort of next year's CapEx?

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

Faiza, for this fiscal year, at the beginning of the year, we had a $300 million target. We have increased
that to $315 million for the balance of the year. The primary driver of that increase is due to our continued
investment in Longmont to support the growth of the Uncrustables brand. And as we go into next fiscal
year, we would anticipate seeing elevated levels of CapEx as we continue to build out the next phase of
the Longmont facility, which is a new bakery and additional manufacturing lines.

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 24, 2020

Mark, I wanted to ask about coffee. You made some interesting comments today, and I want to explore
them just a bit. I think you said Dunkin' Donuts was up 24%, Bustelo up something like 19%. The
question I have is, like, who's buying this? Is it new customers to the brands? Or is it a lot more
consumption from the existing customers? And this is really leading to the thought process of what
happens going forward? Do you have some stickiness to these new sales within coffee?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

David, thanks for the question. I would start just by reiterating that, in total, our entire coffee portfolio
did grow in the quarter, which is fantastic. You're right, exact, you're dead on the numbers on Dunkin' and
Bustelo. K-Cups were well over 2x pacing -- over 2x what that segment is growing. So that's also good.

But again, this 1.5 million new households speaks to the fact that there aren't some new consumers for
sure. Bustelo, obviously, has a very strong South Florida and New York Latino base but continues to grow
with non-Latino millennials. That is a core consumer there. And then Dunkin' has -- the Dunkin' canister,
we're now selling Dunkin' in the canister. That item has been doing extremely well also.

And in the case of Dunkin', it's a little bit of both. It's just increased consumption because of at-home and
some new consumers. But just great, very proud of the results on coffee.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Maybe just a follow-up on the question around CapEx. And I guess what it's tied to is, I think, Mark,
earlier in your prepared remarks, you talked about the idea or the expectation that some of this
incremental demand would be sticky, right? So you're going to retain some of these sales and maybe
some of these customers that weren't here pre COVID. So I guess if that's the case, how do you -- how
should we think about the need to invest, right, and partly CapEx, the supply chain, manufacturing has
been tight, capacity has been tight. So if you've got a bigger customer base, is there a possibility, I guess,
that we will need to see an elevated level of CapEx beyond just what you're doing at Uncrustables?

And maybe second to that, would it require any other investments, I don't know, growth in your sales
force? Or just anything else that would need to be sized up if the business has been rebased higher?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Bryan, thanks for the question. First and foremost, we actually feel that from an organization standpoint,
we are very capable of absorbing the additional sales growth. From a CapEx perspective, clearly, our focus
is primarily on Uncrustables and increasing that. We do feel that we have been able to meet demand on
the other categories and are monitoring our supply chain on a daily basis, if not 24/7, to make sure that
all of the links in the chain continued to work well. That has been a focus.

But from a consumer standpoint, if you just step back and think about the growth that we've experienced,
our confidence in our ability to retain some of these new consumers has grown. And that is because
we have seen continued repeat purchase rates and now have the ability to target and make sure that
we're spending incremental marketing dollars to ensure that we retain some of those. So I think we feel
very good about there definitely is some stickiness. It's very difficult to quantify, but we maintain our
confidence that we can retain many of those consumers.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

All right. And then maybe just as a follow-up to Dave Driscoll's question with regard to the coffee
consumers. Any sense yet -- I mean, some of that is clearly coming from Away From Home, right, maybe

people drinking Dunkin' at home rather than going to the shops, so -- and especially if it's tied to K-Cups.
Do you have a sense yet as to how much of that consumption behavior could stick at home, meaning,
rather than stop on the way to work to buy coffee, you just you brew the K-Cup and bring it with you?

So I guess my question is, do you think that some of the coffee consumption that you're capturing now
sticks because you'll actually take away from the Away From Home consumption?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

We clearly acknowledge that there have been habits that have changed, and folks have been -- have
become more comfortable with brewing coffee at home. I think as routines go back to somewhat normal,
you're going to see folks go through the drive-thru, and obviously, we want our partners at Dunkin' to win.
But clearly, the comfort with, obviously, the growth in Keurig brewers at home also helps the trend.

So again, difficult to quantify confidence that we will retain some stickiness, but I think we feel good
where we are right now.

Our next question is coming from Chris Growe of Stifel.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I just had a quick question for you in relation to retail inventories. It sounds like those were rebuilt a bit
in the quarter. Was there an increase in your second quarter inventories? I'm just trying to understand
if you're at a point where you've been able to build inventory to a proper level, both around the baking
season, in particular? And I guess, any potential second wave or whatever, as you said, any third wave
that we're on right now for the virus?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think my earlier comment of the industry being better prepared for this wave relates to not just
inventory, but all of the links in the supply chain, communicating better, collaborating with our trading
partners to make sure that we can deliver. There has been some rebuilding of inventory, but I would also
acknowledge that it's reasonably tight, and so that's why we continue to manage on a -- literally a daily
basis to make sure that all those links are working well together, and it has to do with communication and
just staying on top of it.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Are you able to produce to your demand today, for example? Are you able to build inventories in your
production? Or are you just at a point where you're keeping up with demand?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

In some areas, we're building a little bit, but we're generally keeping up.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. I had just a quick question as a follow-up on the gross margin. You had a very strong first half
performance. You did indicate a lower gross margin overall on a year-to-date basis. I'm just trying to
figure how much of that is the fourth quarter comparison, which is a tough one, and then how much of it
is this incremental or kind of restarting the investment back in the business? Do we see that start in Q3?
Or is it more about the Q4 comp that affects the gross margin for the -- on a full year basis?

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 24, 2020

Chief Financial Officer

Chris, so as we stated, we did guide to a 37.5% to 38% gross profit margin for the full fiscal year. The
back half is going to be a little bit softer. That's largely driven to the volume comp that you talked about in
the fourth quarter, but it also has some incremental pet trade investments included in there.

Additionally, it has some lost manufacturing absorption. And then it has some incremental freight or
transportation expenses as well that are impacting the back half.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Rob Dickerson of Jefferies.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. I just want to spend another minute or so, just on the margin side, Tucker, so excuse me. Just --
I guess, in terms of the pet trade spend that you're speaking to, is that -- do you view that as essentially
more temporary in nature, just given some one-offs? Or is this a situation such that kind of it works in
tandem with the rebranding of Nutrish and solidifying shelf, right, just kind of working on that indoor, on
that in-store display piece? And I'm just trying to right size kind of how that margin or the implied op
margin, so to speak, vis-à-vis your guidance kind of falls through per segment. Because it seems like the
freight and the transportation is kind of across the segments. But it sounds like pet might be a little bit
lower year-over-year relative to the other segments and then potentially lower even as we go into next
year. And that's all I have.

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

Rob, when you think about the investments and trade within the pet business, there's sort of 2 elements
there to consider. One is as we think about supporting innovation and how we bring innovation to our
retailer partners. The second component is as we continue to advance our placement and positioning
within e-commerce as well. And then on the other costs, I think you've considered those correctly across
either manufacturing absorption and also across the freight and transportation as well.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

This is more for modeling. Your G&A is a lot higher in the quarter. You said a lot of it has to do with
incentive comp. Is that just kind of like a one quarter impact and then it tracks down for the next 2? Or
do you -- assuming that you're beating numbers, you're going to have an elevated spend for the next --
for the back half as well versus a year ago on G&A? Maybe you can help us on the corporate expense line,
too, if that's the right place to put it.

And then I was going to ask about the trade investment in Nutrish. I mean, how significant is it? What's it
going to go towards? Do you have to increase your space? Or is it really just you have to swap out a lot of
old SKUs and put in new ones and you're paying the slotting fee for that?

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

Rob, thank you. I'm going to cover the SD&A question and then hand it to Mark to talk a little bit about
the Nutrish tactics.

As it relates to the quarter, you are correct. Incentive comp was up year-over-year. That's largely driven
by the performance of the company as compared to what we initially anticipated. So there was a true-up

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 24, 2020

in the quarter, and then there will be incremental cost in the back half of the fiscal year, which is included
in our guidance range.

And then as it relates to overall SD&A expenses, we are anticipating those to be up kind of 1% to 2%
year-over-year. Part of that is the incentive compensation, inclusive of the reinstatement of merit costs as
well and then also our desire to reinvest marketing dollars in support of our brands.

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Rob, it's Mark. If I can try to answer your question around Nutrish a little more holistically. As you know,
particularly recently, we've really been trying to ensure that everyone understands that the success of our
pet business really rests on the 3 pillars: so cat, snacks and dog. And clearly, in those first 2, we had great
performance in the quarter. And there's still a little bit of softness in dog. What's great about Nutrish right
now is as we focus on the total brand, we grew it. So whether that's contributions from wet dog, from
some snacks and some cat performance there, in aggregate, the brand grew, which is great.

We knew that we were going to continue to have a little bit of softness in dog. It was more or less as we
planned it. And as we've spoken in the past, we've made some very specific and targeted actions on that,
but we are not done. So we are -- we remain very committed to that brand and ensuring that the dog
portfolio gets healthy.

Several of the actions that we are taking don't really begin to come to fruition until more like the fourth
quarter. So yes, there has been some trade to support the brand in the interim. Our marketing was up
30% in the quarter on Nutrish. And then as we get into the back half, you will see some of the things that
we talked about, optimizing the portfolio in terms of getting the right SKUs, refreshing and making the
packaging more consistent and then, obviously, some new innovation coming in the fourth quarter. So
it is a journey. We recognize that it is not -- we're not going to flip the switch overnight, but we remain
committed to the actions that we are taking and have confidence in the brand in its totality.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I understand, Mark, but I asked about what's the trade investment in third quarter, specifically? So is it
price adjustments? Or is it slotting fees to kind of optimize the merchandising in third quarter?

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

No, Rob, why don't we do this. Why don't we take that off-line?

Operator

Our next question is coming from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Two quick ones for you. First, are you still targeting 2x -- 2 turns of net debt-to-EBITDA by fiscal '23? And
if so, should we just assume that you'll use the Crisco proceeds to pay down debt?

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

So as we think about our desired leverage profile, we continue to focus on being at or below 3x leverage,
which we are there now. We did pay off an additional $200 million of debt in the second quarter and the
term debt, specifically. And so we remain committed to a healthy leverage profile also to the payment of
dividends.

THE J. M. SMUCKER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 24, 2020

But now we have begun to open up strategic capacity with either our free cash flow generation or with the
proceeds from the divestiture of the Crisco business, which then enables us to continue to either enhance
our debt position or potentially to buy back shares to replace the lost earnings over time.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And you just said strategic capacity, but you referenced to sort of buybacks and debt. Should I -- it seems
like I should not interpret that term strategic capacity to mean M&A.

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think in the near term, large M&A is probably not what we're focused on. I think we're focused on
the execution of our business and the delivery of that while, at the same time, having a balanced capital
deployment model and returning cash effectively to shareholders to drive value.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And one more quick one on Jif. It sounds like a great quarter for Jif, and congrats on that. But in looking
at the Nielsen data, your price gap to private label sort of right back where it was before you went through
that period of investment to try to get it down. Do you think you can hold at this level? Or should we
expect you to have to once again get back a lot of this price to reclose that price gap?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Jason, it's Mark. The short answer is no. I don't think we're going to have to give that back. I think the
dynamics that caused us to take the price increase are real, and they impact the broader industry. We
have, in our case, a very solid supply and relationships with our suppliers on peanuts. I think it's possible
that there, we could continue to see some supply disruption in the market. And so the dynamics, whether
it be just higher cost peanuts, quality issues with peanuts, those are going to probably persist for some
time. And so I think we've demonstrated over the last several months that the actions we have taken have
worked, and we will expect to stick to those.

Our next question is coming from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.

John Joseph Baumgartner
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Mark, I wanted to touch on single-serve coffee. Just given the return to share growth for Folgers, and
I guess really the sudden sustained drop in market share for private label during COVID. What's your
sense as to why private label has been so pressured? Is it just a category where consumers are flocking
to brands right now? Are you seeing different category management by retailers? Just how do we think
about any more permanent changes in category dynamics that favor brands going forward as COVID sort
of normalizes?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

I think it's -- John, I think it's a little of all of what you said. I think there is some -- we have a very
consistent supply. We have a very robust and scaled supply chain. There's no question -- from a consumer
standpoint, a brand standpoint, consumers are definitely feeling comfortable with brands that they know
and trust. The primary players in the coffee category tend to hedge and use financial instruments to buy
coffee. We have seen that private label suppliers don't tend to hedge as much. And I think that might
have had an impact on some of the private brands. But we remain committed to our strategy of producing
and maintaining a steady quality supply of food, and that includes coffee, and working with our trading

Our next question is coming from Alexia Howard of Bernstein.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So a couple of questions. First of all, you've mentioned the freight cost inflation quite a few times so far
this morning. What percentage of COGS does that represent? And can you talk about what proportion
of your freight costs are already -- are contracted out versus where you're having to tap into the spot
markets? And then I have a follow-up.

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Alexia, as it relates to the transportation costs, they're probably in the low single digits, sort of mid-
-- probably mid-single digits in terms of freight costs as a percentage of our COGS, as I think what we've
shared before. And we are experiencing an increase in those transportation costs year-over-year, primarily
driven by the environment that we've talked about.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. And just a broader question. Back in March, at the start of the pandemic, you hired a new COO. I
think that was the first Chief Operating Officer you've had in the company. I'm just wondering whether
there are any priorities that have emerged as opportunities and whether -- and what we might expect
from the upcoming Investor Day in terms of what you're going to be sharing with us next month. And I'll
pass it on.

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Alexia. You're right. It's the first COO under my tenure. John would be the first, not in our
company history. But I would highlight that -- rather than maybe answer that specifically, I really look
forward to having you all have some interaction with my broader leadership team including John and
others at Investor Day. And part of what we hope to demonstrate to you during our Investor Day is just
the strength and expertise of this team and how each of them truly do complement each other. I have to
say I'm proud that I have never worked with a team this fantastic in my career and really hope that we
can get you all to interact with John and the rest of the team on December 10.

Our next question is coming from Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.

Laurent Daniel Grandet
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Some follow-up question, actually. I'd like to come back to the question about the stickiness of some of
your segments here. So could you please let us know, I mean, if the stickiness, in your view, should be
more coming from retaining the new consumers that came into your franchise or retaining the elevated
consumption of existing consumers?

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

It's actually been both, Laurent. It's been -- clearly, as at-home consumption has increased, we definitely
have seen higher consumption. Clearly, there's been a shift to e-commerce, which does, in many cases,
help repeat purchase. And then again, having seen repeat purchase, both in brick-and-mortar and e-

commerce on many of our brands over the last quarter gives us -- that's what gives us the increased
confidence of these consumers remaining in our brands.

Laurent Daniel Grandet
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And my second one is about the guidance. You raised the guidance on -- really just on the top line.
And with all the uncertainty about COVID, and why did you decide to increase guidance now? I'd like to
understand your thought process here as -- remember when I spoke to you about long ago, I mean, I
think it's all about reinstating confidence with investor community, so being in a place where you should
be able to beat guidance rather than -- or get to the guidance rather than being challenged like for more
in the past few years. So why did you -- I mean, did you decide to up the guidance now? And I'd like to
understand, yes, better your thought process here.

Mark T. Smucker
CEO, President & Director

Laurent, it's Mark. And I may ask Tucker to chime in here. But clearly, one of my fundamental
responsibilities as CEO is to make sure that we are providing our investors with as much visibility into our
current thinking as possible and setting targets that we can meet or exceed. And I'm very pleased over
the last 3 quarters that we've been able to do that. I would -- I guess, I would just highlight that these are
very uncertain times. We do feel that we have a responsibility to our investors to tell you what we know
when we know it. And so the current revision reflects a change in what we believe we can deliver. We
clearly had an over-delivery in the second quarter, which caused us to think a little bit differently about the
remainder of the year. So it's really about making sure that we're communicating with our shareholders
and giving you the best information that we can based on what we know today.

Tucker H. Marshall
Chief Financial Officer

Mark, that's well said. I don't have anything else to add.

At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management to conclude today's call.
