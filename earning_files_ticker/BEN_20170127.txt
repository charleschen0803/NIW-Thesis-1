Good morning and thank you for joining Ken Lewis and me as we discuss this quarter’s results
I hope you had a chance to read our commentary this morning that you find our written transcript approach providing commentary useful
Most importantly, investment performance against peers and benchmarks improved significantly this quarter
Although we continue to experience outflows, I believe we are much better positioned to outperform in this environment and we're seeing some early signs of flow improvement
Once again, we demonstrated effective cost management and extended our track record of annual dividend increases and share repurchases that more than offset compensation related equity issuance in the first quarter
We'd now like to take any questions that you have
Question-and-Answer Session
I mean, I think like everyone we are still preparing for the rule in its current form, but I think like everyone, we expect to see the delay, but haven't heard anything formally
But I think the consensus view right now is that you're looking at least a 6 month to 12 month delay of implementation and I think that that's just something that a lot of the broker dealers and advisors are really digesting right now
So we do expect a delay
We expect you know, potentially a complete replacement or repeal of the rule
And I think how it affects you know the advisory models over time that remains to be seen
But like everyone we still have to prepare for the existing one
I mean, I think first of all, I mean, the larger drivers global bonds and obviously that's been the biggest headwinds in terms of flows, and the rebound in performance and you know, just how that fund is managed against or not managed against the benchmarks that you do see significant swings and you know still a tough quarter for global bond flows, actually had higher outflows, despite you know, you could say while you had very good relative performance, but that relative performance all came right at the very end of the quarter
So a lot of it just takes time to kind of work its way into the broker dealer, I think you know, network and advisors and in kind of understanding performance
And our big message has been for the last month that here you know, here is bond fund in a quarter where the index down was 7% or 3% depending which aggregate index you are looking at in the bond market and here is the fund that that was up, that provides income
So that I think puts its - put that - puts that fund in a very unique category that again you know we think when advisors are looking for protection in a deflationary environment that it should do very well
So we would expect to see an improvement there and are seeing an improvement in the short run
You said well, some of that performance 1300 basis points we got in a very short period, but that's a significant number against the benchmark, given a little bit back on rates declining, but not you maybe 90 basis points of that you know, really in January
So nothing significant/ I think we are very hopeful that that fund will be viewed very differently in the market, but it does take a little bit of time and that's been a real focus of ours to get - to get that message and get that case study of the quarter of what this fund did in a rising rate environment versus other funds
They did position themselves as flexible, total return, absolute return kind of bond funds
It didn't do well in that environment and you know, I think again that just expands the audience potentially for the global bond fund
So performance is always a key indicator, I look at the - looking at our six largest funds, every one of them was in the top quartile for the 12 month period and 15 of our 20 largest funds were in the top quartile and that's about as good as we've ever seen for a short period
I don't think there's one consistent view
I mean, I think you have a trend that was already in place pre-fiduciary rule of going to you know, more of a planning model, you know, against the advisor pickings individual funds, that's going to continue
I think the fiduciary rule accelerated that
I think some large firm's favor that rule because it helps them move towards that platform even faster
And that's where you get a little bit of I think some mixed opinions on what to do next
I think your common around this market, it’s being a more normal market in terms of winners, losers and less correlation and less kind of central bank risk on risk off, it will favor active managers that appeared to happen out last year and that we think will continue to happen and that's why we still remain very optimistic on active investing
But I think to give one simple answer around fiduciary, I think you get some firms moving ahead like there's no change some that have stopped you kind of us stopping that implementation right now
But at the end of the day, I look at it from somewhat from an outside view that says you know, anything that took thousand pages to layout a rule that then took months of consultants and the accounts try to figure out what it means
And then I've seen all these different broker dealers interpret things differently to me that’s not a good rule and one that is very open to trial lawyers to defining what really is the right rule
And that's not the - I think a good design of a rule and I think that's where you know the industry has to kind of take a step back and front five figure out what problem we're solving and then work from there
But there really is no one general answer on how the advisor side right now is moving, I think, we get different answers from different groups, almost on a daily basis
Absolutely, business I think also the intended or unintended consequence of a rule of affecting just retirement is that it tends to affect everything you know, as many again go back and interpret, it’s very difficult to have one segment of your business different from the rest of it
So it does, I think lend itself to that discussion of you know, is it - is the SEC the appropriate place to provide a rule, but I'd also start with the, do we need a rule you know, as part of that discussion, as well
And I think that's really where the industry now has to meet with a lot of different groups and kind of determine what is the appropriate next step, but I certainly think that if you decide you really do need a rule that the SEC now is an appropriate place for that to be done
Thanks
Yes, I mean, I think it's a little different with this category and just based on what's happening in the amount of assets that think about it, I mean the amounts that has duration risk, you know, in a unique environment and still very low rates, that likes to have income where can you go and that question is being asked right now and you've seen it in floating rate flows and you know, tips and things that tend to do better in a rising rate environment
So if you do have a kind of non-correlated alternative asset in that category, I think you can turn pretty quickly
I think equities are a little different, it takes a little bit longer because of the consultant driven side of that equation in returns and if you recommended redemptions on its hard, you just put it back in based on what happens in 6 months or 12 months
But you know, I think this is a different category and the question we hear it everywhere on how do I protect assets in a rising rate environment and here is a case study you can show pretty cleanly that you know, did that in the first real move in rates
So I think it can move you know, little bit faster than say your traditional equity turnaround
Patrick Davitt’ Great, that's helpful
And then as the probability of a repatriation holiday increases, has your thinking around the size that you could do and what you could do with it changed, any more specificity there, and to what extent M&A is still on the table?
I don’t think it’s changed our philosophy, as we've we talked about on previous calls
We've been optimistic for a while that something’s going to happen
I think probability of that's increased now, as result of the elections, perhaps the size of the dollars that we can bring back increases, but you know, to tell us in the detail when they come out with this law
And so we have to wait to see what the law says and then evaluate that and what's in the best interest of the shareholders
But it hasn't philosophically changed our point of view
Patrick Davitt’ And M&A is still something you're looking at or…
Of course, yes, absolutely
Well, I think, first of all we have increased our ED exposure over the last six months and we'll probably continue to do that
And I think you know the efforts in distribution that have been well underway on continuing to build out a digital strategy and combine the - we've had outbound sales groups that are now being combined with the traditional wholesaler you know, those efforts will continue and ultimately the goal is to reach more advisors in a cost-efficient manner and use technology to do that and that's something that we've been pushing hard for a while
But I like it is you know, it's a fair question just around advertising and building out also the consultant side of our business on the retail and continue to invest there, especially as the advisors are narrowing the funnel of funds they're going to deal with that we need to make sure that we're providing the best level of institutional service there
So those are the areas that we're going to continue to I think invest in, but I think that's a discussion we'll have as well - upping the strategic kind of spend near-term on the advertising from where it is
Yes, I hope that's a problem we have, but reality I mean, I think if you look at the conditions that led to that that kind of flow, I think it’s going to be very difficult
If you look at when the global bond really took off, that was a period where it had an average annual return of 10% a year against the lost decade of equities
So it was in a position that that - and it was also the top-performing fund - that of any type of fund for that decade as well
So those are you know, pretty unique set of circumstances to have from a marketing side that I'm not sure you're going to have
Again, I also think the - that the volatility of the fund that you always talk about it and want to make sure investors understand the risks that they're getting for that return, but the reality is you don't control all of the sales and I'm sure some of the sales were done like a more traditional low volatility type investment when it probably is more like a global macro and now that we've gone through a cycle you know, where investors have held and seen the volatility, that may or may not be attractive to certain investors
So they have that experience now in a new asset category
So I don't think you're going to see the kind of explosive growth because of that volatility, but I do think that you'll see steadier growth and hopefully the kind of investors that can withstand those kind of moves up and down that you could have
Repeat the question one more time please
Right, okay
So the FX part, so leaving that aside, I would just generally talk about the effect of fee rate, because I don't - I think there are some positive signs in the traditional business in terms of sales, the global equity sales were good this quarter
So you know, we do see pressure on effective fee rate, gradual pressure, though, I don't think there's going to be anything significant, but over the years, forward, we do expect to see our effective fee rates to come down a little bit and we've seen that in the last year or two
Some of that has to do with just the product mix, so whether its fixed income, more fixed income, you know, more fixed income at the expense of say in emerging markets mix that will drive us down
Some of it would have to do with the mix of retail and institutional, institutional tends to have lower rates, supplemented by performance fees
So you know, it’s all of those things put together, but generally I think that's a fair statement to that we're seeing the effective fee rate decline gradually
Yes, that's right
And I think it’s right around 44, right now
So after this next quarter around 40.
And we'll keep you posted as - as we see the - if there's any probable redemptions, we'll keep you posted on that…
Yes, I think there are some - there were some other things in G&A this quarter that were seasonally depressed the number or reduce the number, one of them was advertising and we do expect that to ramp up, that was probably about $8 million, less than last quarter
And that is an annual seasonal thing that we see, where it ramps up in the fourth quarter
So that would continue - we would expect that to continue this year, professional fees was little bit down
We expect that to come back this year
But as I mentioned in my comments, when you look at all the expenses, we're looking, we're expecting expenses to be down around 2% year-over-year
That’s correct
Yes
I mean, I think it’s - part of it is that you have firms that have exited the business, that are in a wind down mode
So it's really how do I manage this liability that the insurance carrier has, so you’ve seen a lot of lower volatility or more transparent products that they can hedge, the risk out on those are really versus a traditional active fund, it’s harder to hedge
So you know, we have developed some lower volatility funds
We have actually gotten some wins in that and hope we can continue to grow that
But you know, I think to expect - and I think our guys are fairly optimistic on the potential there on this change to get some new assets from others as well
I just don't have a sense for what the probability of that is and can that that offset a potential a decline of another $20 billion, who knows, I don't know
But I think whenever there's change like that there's opportunity and we have developed products there
We are getting some wins in the 100 million, 200 million range, but we need some bigger ones to offset the other numbers
Yes, and there was some affects in the numbers this quarter, related to you know, assets under management in non-US dollar price funds and that almost $5 billion in the quarter
Yes, and distributions are not in that number where there were before, that you're looking at quarter-to-quarter, because of changed
Morning
Yes
I think one of the things that's happening is the mix of the earnings, US and non-US is increasing, so our US cash flow is increasing
I mean, that’s a function of the increase in assets under management for funds managed in the US
That's something that you might not see, right away, but you'll see over time in the disclosures
And so we feel pretty comfortable that we could continue our share repurchase activity for you know, at least the short-term one year period, with no problems
I mean, I don't - we don't have that in front of us on the breakdown
I think in terms of the commitment, I mean, we think that's going to continue to be an important part of our growth strategy, especially as you know the industry battles the traditional active passive and wherever we can you know add less correlated type assets to that fold and that's going to important that are also less - that are harder to replicate
So we have a lot of investments made in a lot of different areas and a lot of funds, but I just don't have the rolled up number here, I mean, we're in private equity and real estate and a lot of - what some would call traditional alternatives, but I just don't know what that number would look like…
Well, thank you everyone for attending the call today
And again, we look forward to speaking next quarter
