Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Jack Henry & Associates First Quarter
FY 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ] Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's
call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Williams.
Sir, you may begin.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates' First Quarter Fiscal 2021
Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer; and on the call with me this morning is David Foss,
President and CEO.

In a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business,
the performance for the quarter and some comments relating to the impacts of COVID-19 and other key
initiatives that we have in place. Then after that, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments
regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and also provide some comments
regarding our guidance for our fiscal year '21 provided in the release, and then we will open the lines up
for Q&A.

First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks
or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or
results. Likely any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause
actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and
uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary
of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections
in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.

On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-
GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for these historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found
in yesterday's press release.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue
and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard
work and commitment that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter, particularly in light
of the challenges posed by conducting business in the midst of a global pandemic. Now that we are all
many months into life with the pandemic, we remain extremely thankful for the fact that very few of our
almost 7,000 employees or their family members have been directly affected by the COVID-19 virus.

Our HR team is working closely with all the groups around our company to be sure anyone who is affected
is receiving the care and accommodations they require. We continue to operate with well over 90% of our
employees working full-time remote and with the current return to office date of January 4. Because of
the success we've had with our remote work initiatives and because of the ongoing concerns about the
pandemic, I fully expect we will extend our return to office date further into 2021, but that decision hasn't
yet been made.

Most of our customers now have at least a few members of their staff working in their offices full time. As
we moved into the fall, several of them have requested that we come on site to work with them on sales
engagements and system implementations, and we are normally able to accommodate those requests
with no trouble. With that said, our sales teams are now routinely doing sales presentations and executing

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

contracts with no on-site presence at the customer location. We have also completed many 100% remote
implementations with great success, including several full core conversions. And our customer service
teams continue to deliver outstanding service through remote channels while keeping our customer
satisfaction ratings very high. Our teams continue to execute in this new environment with the success of
the customer always foremost in their mind.

With that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in September.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 3% for the quarter and increased 5% on a non-
GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $9 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts
the current quarter negatively, but is very good news if you take a long-term view.

Turning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue
increased by 2% for the quarter and increased by 5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment again
performed well, posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.
We also had another strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions businesses, with a 6% increase in
revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

Traditionally, our first quarter has been our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter
tends to be extremely strong, and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. This year was no exception to
that trend. With that said, however, the sales teams had several notable successes in Q1. In the quarter,
we again booked 7 competitive core takeaways with 2 of them in the multibillion-dollar asset space. We
also booked 3 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. We continue
to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing 6 new debit processing clients this
quarter and 3 new credit clients. All of the deals I just mentioned represent new customers and new
revenue to our company. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno Digital Suite,
with 29 new contracts in Q1.

Speaking of our digital suite, we have now settled into a comfortable pace of implementing more than
30 new financial institution clients every month on the Banno platform. We recently surpassed 3 million
active monthly users but that number continues to grow rapidly. At the same time, our Banno platform
has been recognized by FI Navigator as having the highest consumer rating in the App Store with 4.79
out of 5 stars. Our Banno Digital Suite is well on its way to becoming an industry-leading digital banking
solution.

The extraordinary success we've seen with sales and adoption of our digital suite is consistent with the
expectations coming out of the Bank Director Technology Survey published in August. As they do every
year, Bank Director surveyed hundreds of their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of
technology prioritization and spending topics. Almost 60% of the responses they received were from
bank's CEOs and/or board members, with a large majority of the responded banks greater than $500
million in assets. The survey show that as a result of the pandemic, most banks had moved 2 items to
the top of their priority list, with the first being an improved customer experience and the other being an
improved set of digital offerings.

The survey also indicated that 64% of the respondents had increased their technology spending
expectations between 5% and 15% as compared to their pre-pandemic budgets. All of this bodes well for
the future of our digital suite as well as the other solutions offered by Jack Henry, which helped facilitate
an improved customer experience and an opportunity to enhance efficiency in the financial institution.

Regarding our new card processing platform. As of the end of September, we have successfully completed
the migration of our approximately 800 core clients in accordance with the plan we have highlighted on
these calls for the past 3 years. We still have the small group of approximately 80 noncore clients left
to migrate, but we fully expect to hit our fiscal Q3 target with that group as previously announced. I
am very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such
a successful outcome. Although it didn't impact our Q1 numbers in any way, you undoubtedly saw the
announcement of our recent divestiture of our CruiseNet business.

The Cruise core solution was used by approximately 140 very small credit unions to perform core
processing functions. Jack Henry acquired the business about 20 years ago, but we haven't actively

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

marketed this solution for many years. We had committed to the client base that we would keep the
solution compliant but not that we would add features or actively sell the solution. The acquirer is active
in the very small financial institution market, so the sale was a good fit for them, and the Cruise clients
seem very happy with the outcome. The acquirer has rebranded Cruise as Aurora Advantage, and we
have partnered with them to allow us to continue to sell and support several of our ProfitStars solutions
into their customer base going forward. More information on this transaction will be provided with our Q2
disclosures, but the overall impact is relatively immaterial.

As many of you know, we normally conduct our 2 largest client conferences in the fall each year. Although
we chose not to hold in-person conferences this year, we conducted a virtual Symitar conference at the
end of August and our Banking and ProfitStars conference in October as previously scheduled. As you
might expect, attendance was much larger than our in-person conferences because nobody had to incur
any travel expense, and we were able to interact virtually with many of our existing clients and prospects.
In a couple of weeks, we will be hosting our Annual Shareholder Meeting and as we disclosed in our proxy,
we have decided to conduct it as a virtual meeting as well.

Despite the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic, the key fundamentals of our business remain
consistent with the profile I outlined on this call 6 months ago. We carry almost no debt and operate with
a solid cash position. Our revenue is more than 85% recurring in nature, and our workforce is highly
engaged as evidenced by our engagement survey scores and regular announcements of best places to
work awards. As we move forward, we will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company,
and we expect that approach to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees,
customers and shareholders.

With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Dave. Our service and support revenue increased 1% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared
to the same quarter a year ago. Adjusting service and support revenues for the deconversion fee revenue
for each period, which is $5.8 million in the current fiscal year compared to $14.9 million in the prior fiscal
year or a little over $9 million decrease, this revenue line would have grown 4% for the quarter compared
to the previous year. Our service support revenue growth was primarily driven by our data processing and
hosting fees in our private cloud and also software usage fees, which reflects our customers' preference
for our term license model partially offset by a decrease to product delivery and services revenue due to
decreased license, hardware and implementation, pass-through and other revenue, but particularly the
deconversion fee revenue quarter-over-quarter.

Our processing line of revenue increased 7% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter
last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed
last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers and the Jack Henry digital revenue
experience. The highest percentage growth of all revenue lines due also to new customers installed last
year and the increased volumes from existing customers Q1 of this year compared to the same quarter
last year.

Our total revenue was up 3% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis and up a little over
5% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the deconversion fees. Our cost of revenue was up 7%
compared to last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our
card processing platform, and higher personnel costs related to increased headcount at September 30,
2020, compared to a year ago due to primarily organic growth within our product lines.

The increase in cost was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result of COVID-19 travel
limitations. Research and development expense increased 6% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 over the
prior fiscal year first quarter, whereas this increase was also primarily due to higher personnel costs
related to increased headcount compared to a year ago. Our SG&A expense decreased 9% in the first
quarter of fiscal '21 over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year, and this decrease was mainly due
to travel expense savings as a result of COVID-19 travel limitations but there was also a decrease in

6

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

revenue tied to the savings expense due to our user group being in a virtual nature this year. Our reported
consolidated operating margins decreased from 27% last year to 26%, which is primarily due to the
various revenue headwinds already discussed in the increased costs.

On a non-GAAP basis, however, our operating margins increased from 24.7% last year to 25.2% this year,
primarily due to the items already mentioned. Our payments segment continues to be impacted by the
additional costs related to our card processing platform migration, as Dave discussed in his comments,
and our core segment operating margin decreased slightly during the quarter compared to last year, just
primarily due to revenue mix, while complementary segment margins actually improved compared to last
year quarter, heavily driven by our digital sales.

The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 22.4% this year compared to 24.6% last year. The
decrease in effective tax rate compared with the prior fiscal year quarter was primarily due to the
difference in the impact of share-based compensation under the long-term incentive plan that vested
during each of the periods, which created a larger permanent tax deduction this year compared to the
prior year quarter. Net income, $91.2 million for the first quarter compared to $89.4 million last year, with
earnings per share of $1.19 compared to $1.16.

Through cash flow, total amortization increased 3% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized
projects being placed into service. Included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles
related to acquisitions, which decreased to $4.4 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $5.5
million last year. Depreciation expenses up 5% for the year, primarily due to CapEx in the previous year
and those assets being placed into service.

We also purchased 400,000 shares for the treasury in the quarter for $65.9 million. Our operating cash
flow was $114.5 million for the first quarter, which is down from $123.1 million or 7% compared to
last fiscal year. We invested $37.3 million back into our company through CapEx and cap software for
developing our products, which the total amount capitalized is down 15% from $44 million compared to a
year ago quarter. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then
adding back net proceeds from pending sale of assets, was $83.3 million for the quarter.

Couple of highlights on our balance sheet, cash position of $195.3 million, down slightly from $213.3
million at June 30. There is nothing drawn on our revolver, which has, again, has a maximum capacity
of $700 million, and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases, which is
primarily due to the new lease accounting rules adopted in the previous year.

Some updates on guidance. As you noticed, we updated both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance
in the press release yesterday. Just to be clear, this guidance continues to be based on the assumption
that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. Obviously, if the country
is forced to shut down again due to the pandemic and the economy stalls or actually reverses, then this
guidance will be revised. We'll also note that our GAAP guidance that we continue to forecast revenue from
deconversions to be down $33 million from what we saw in FY '20, which we saw $53.9 million in total
deconversion fees in that year.

We saw a $9 million decrease in Q1. We expect to see another decrease in deconversion fees in Q2, but
probably about half the decrease we saw in Q1. The largest anticipated decrease in deconversion fees
will be in Q3 compared to last year is, if you recall, Q3 last year was the largest deconversion fee quarter
due to a couple of large deals. We see little to no current M&A activity that would drive deconversion
revenue higher at this point, which in the short-term will hurt revenue growth. But in the long term, as
Dave mentioned, it's good for us as we've much rather keep our customers and the revenues for the long
term.

This means on a GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release, impacted by the decreased
deconversion fees, we are looking at GAAP revenue growth of 3% to 4-plus percent. The only adjustment
between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance is the decrease in deconversion fees. If we see changes
during the year and anticipate deconversion revenue, we obviously will update you on future quarterly
earnings calls.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

We expect to continue to have some headwinds on revenue in the first half of the year for several reasons,
some ongoing delayed implementations at customer requests. The continued shift of our customers
to our private cloud will continue to put additional headwinds on our license, hardware and on-prem
implementation. And our annual education conferences will be virtual events this year, which also impacts
revenue in the first half of the year. Therefore, for your models for non-GAAP revenue, I would suggest
using a 4.5% to 5% revenue growth in the first half of the year and a 7% to 8% revenue growth in the
second half to get you to our guidance of 6% to 6.5% revenue growth for the entire fiscal year, again on a
non-GAAP revenue basis.

We anticipate GAAP operating margins for all of FY '21 to be down slightly to the 20% to 21% range for all
the reasons previously mentioned and non-GAAP margins to essentially be in line to slightly up from last
year for the entire fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY '21 should still be in line with FY '20 and for the
entire fiscal year be between 22% and 23%.
This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Operator, will you please open
the call lines up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And I guess my first question, when I looked at the support and service line this year, the last couple of
years, there was kind of this seasonal pattern where you grew, I think, 11% in Q1, then higher single
digits Q2, Q3 and then kind of low to mid-single digits -- yes, low to mid-single digits in Q4. This year,
you're starting in Q1 at plus 4%. So it seems like this year is going to shape up differently. Maybe you can
talk about the progression through the year and why this Q1 wasn't like closer to that double-digit type
range?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Dave. So there's a couple of things. One, even though we had a nice increase in software
subscriptions this quarter compared to a year ago quarter, it wasn't near as larger percent. And part
of that was due to some delayed implementations in the second half of last fiscal year, which, as you
remember, under ASC 606, you recognize 100% of the revenue. So any implementations in software
subscription that would have been installed in the second half, that would have basically been a few
months last year, but we were gotten full 12 months on the renewal this year. So that was part of it. The
other part, Dave, is the continued headwind of license and hardware and implementation revenue which is
due both to the ongoing move of our in-house customers to outsourcing but also due to some delays due
to COVID because our installers couldn't go out and do some of these due to the banks and credit unions
not wanting them on site.

So again, and I'll highlight this. So there were some headwinds on revenue. And everybody -- I saw the
notes out there, everybody kind of highlighted decreased travel expenses. I mean, those 2 kind of offset.
I mean, so there was headwinds on revenue and there was a decrease in travel expenses, but those 2
somewhat offset for the impact. So that's kind of how we get to the 4% growth this quarter. I think for
the rest of the year, it's going to kind of line out and, obviously, as I guided, I think first half is going to
be a little lighter on growth. In the second half, I think we're going to see a really nice step-up in top line
revenue growth, which will be also in both lines of revenue.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got you. Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess the follow-up to that is -- the back -- obviously, the full year
is going to be good. The back half being better. Q2 though, it sounds like just a touch of deceleration. If
you're saying 4.5% to 5% growth in the first half and Q1 was like almost 5.5%, Q2 might be the lightest
quarter. Why would -- why is that happening?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Well, you're going to see -- well, part of that is because -- and you can look at the last 2 years since
we adopted ASC 606, David, there was a slowdown in Q2 from Q1 because you have all the software
subscription revenue in Q1. So that's just part of ASC 606, and there's no way to avoid that. So there's
going to be a little slowdown in Q2 compared to Q1 as far as growth. But then in Q3, if you look at a GAAP
basis, it's going to be even a little slower because of the huge decrease in deconversion fees that we are
predicting in Q3, and then you're going to see some really nice growth in Q4.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Got you. That's helpful. And one just really quick one. This is kind of immaterial. Nobody has ever asked a
question on the call about your corporate line before, I don't think. But it was down a lot. I mean, it's only
3% of revs. Is that -- is there something in that line that this quarter was kind of one-off?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

No. There's nothing really there to highlight, Dave.

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

It's just small.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Corp.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Dave, you may have highlighted [Technical Difficulty]. Could you talk a little bit about the digital sales that
you guys are seeing? How Banno is progressing? And then, both the cash management and the treasury
management businesses? How those things are selling versus core and things like that?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So you're cutting in and out just a little bit, Brett, but I think I got the question. And you're right,
I did highlight it in the opening comments. So Banno -- the digital performance has been very strong. I
highlighted in my comments that we signed 29 new customers in Q1, and I also highlighted that we're
on a pace now to install about 30 customers a month that we're bringing live. So 30 financial institutions
live per month. I also highlighted that we recently surpassed 3 million active monthly users. So that isn't
3 million subscribers. The subscriber number is a -- sorry? Subscriber number is a lot higher. So that 3
million active monthly users, which means they're using -- they're actively in the system every month. So
we've exceeded that number now.

I also highlighted that FI Navigator who reports on how consumers feel about the various applications.
They've now got us as the highest-rated digital banking application with a 4.79 out of 5 stars in the App
Store. So tremendous success with the digital suite at Jack Henry, and we only see that continuing and
getting better. As far as the other components you asked about the Treasury Management continuing to
sign new customers on treasury management in the quarter? I think we've signed 4 or 5. We have about
50 financial institutions live now in Treasury Management and continuing to enhance that product and
continue to roll that out. So good success all around when it comes to digital.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then, Kevin, I just want to make sure that I get the revenue acceleration in the back
half. I know some of it is ASC 606. Some of it, it sounds like it's just timing of delayed implementations
that maybe happened last year that maybe now will slow not into 1 half but more into second half.
Are those the 2 primary drivers? Or am I -- I want to make sure I'm not missing anything on that rev
acceleration.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

So Brett, there's a couple of things. And I mean, you hit most of them. But the other thing is the
continued growth in our card business, because we are now -- with all of our core customers now migrated
over, we were having -- we're having pretty good success in the sales. As Dave mentioned, we signed

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

several new ones, customers in Q1. So we can now focus more on bringing new customers on. So you're
going to continue to see nice growth there. Digital is just going to continue to grow very nicely.

So our processing line of revenue is going to continue to grow at this pace and actually accelerate in
Q4 based on what we're seeing. And then support and service line, we're going to lap some things. So
Q4 should be a little easier comp there. So that's -- those are the primary drivers for the accelerated
growth, primarily in Q4 is where we anticipate seeing that growth rate. Now again, as I said in my opening
comments, that's all subject to the economy continuing to percolate and get along and not have another
shutdown.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of how the decision-making is happening at banks
just generally, are they -- is it -- I assume it's still digital-focused? How is core -- how are the core
conversations going? Is it -- are those being put on the back burner at all as people focus on digital? Any
kind of change in that dialogue at all?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes, interesting. So another thing I highlighted was the fact that in the Bank Director survey here, with
64% of the respondents in the survey with most of them being over $500 million in assets. 64% of the
respondents had set their technology spending budgets or increased their technology spending budget by
5% to 15% as compared to their pre-pandemic. And that's what we're seeing now. The flow of RFPs has
picked up recently, particularly on the core side. So we have a bunch of RFPs we're working right now on
the core side, continuing to sign new customers, but the rate of interest is increasing. And I think what's
happening -- so not only having good solid success on digital and certainly with our payments platform
with customers we're signing there. But just overall, I think people are kind of settling in now to be -- to
doing business in the COVID world, and they're finding those deficiencies and what they have with the
technology they're currently operating.

And so RFPs are starting to really ramp up, so we'll see. The decision pace I would say is moving along
well, getting contracts finished is a little more challenging than it used to be because the attorneys are
working remote from their house in 1 study and the CEO is working remote from their house in a different
place. And some of that coordination is a little more challenging than it used to be, but deals are getting
signed, and there is a lot of interest in Jack Henry technology as evidenced by the RFP flow.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mr. David Togut from Evercore.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Dave, you called out a somewhat slower pace of closing core deals. Could you bracket for us what the
sales cycles are like today in the COVID environment versus pre-COVID in terms of number of months, for
example, for core signing?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's a good point. It's taking longer to get a core deal done. So we did 7 this quarter. We did 7 the
prior quarter. And so it's definitely taking a little longer to get deals done. Once the deal is done, the
actual conversion process isn't taking any longer because we're doing so much remote now. But I'd say
we've probably added another month or so to the actual signing process. But as I just mentioned in the
conversation with Brett, the RFP pipeline is very solid. We're -- it's amazing. The number of RFPs that
are coming in on the core side. So that's -- I'm not just talking about other products, I'm talking about
interest in Jack Henry core solutions. So they're a little slower right now than they have been in the past,
but we're still seeing deals, and we're still getting deals done.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. And just as a follow-up, Kevin, you called out $195 million in cash on the balance sheet.
You've clearly got a lot of potential to allocate capital now, whether it be acquisitions, dividends, buybacks,
how do you rank your capital allocation priorities given your current balance sheet. And when you look
at, let's say, the valuation of acquisition opportunities in the pipeline versus your own stock, how do you
weigh that decision?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So David, I mean, obviously, you've known this quite a long. You know that our first use would be
to find the right acquisition, to bring additional products to cross-sell to our customers and get a higher
return to our shareholders. But you're absolutely right. The valuations continue to be a little high out there
for what we're seeing. There's not a lot of really good assets that we're seeing out there right now, but we
do continue to look and we will continue to look for the right acquisition.

Having said that, with nothing out there, obviously, we have a shareholders meeting here in a couple of
weeks and our quarterly board meetings, and we'll be discussing at that the use of cash. I'm sure we'll
continue the dividend program. And we typically increase the dividend in the February time period, so I
don't see why we would change that. But again, that's up to the Board. And I'm sure that we will continue
to buy back some stock going forward as we don't see any more acquisitions on the horizon getting any
closer.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a quick final question, if I could. Dave, would appreciate your perspective on open APIs in the banking
industry. And how you're, let's say, making the core available through open APIs to the extent a best-in-
breed provider wants to connect into a customer for a point solution.

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'm glad you asked that, David. We are big believers in that concept and have been since the
founding of this company before the term API was a term. The concept of Jack Henry has always been to
be open. We've always been committed to the idea of making our platforms available to others through
easy connectivity. We don't set up artificial walls to keep people out. And a lot of people over the years
have viewed that as being very counterintuitive. But I think the philosophy at Jack Henry has always been
that we're here to make our customers successful. They're not here to make us successful. And so if we're
going to help make them successful, we should provide the tools that enable them to connect to whoever
they want to connect to.

I think the best example of this in something you can see is for people who go to our client conferences,
and this has been true forever at Jack Henry. You go to a Jack Henry Client Conference, you go into the
exhibit hall, and you will see hundreds of exhibitors in there, and almost every one of them competes
with Jack Henry. We don't allow core vendors in there. But other than that, pretty much anybody else is
allowed in. And so you've got digital vendors and you've got payments vendors and everybody under the
sun in our space has a booth in the exhibit hall, and they will all tell our customers that they love working
with Jack Henry because we are the ones that have always been truly committed to the idea of open
connectivity. So today, APIs are the preferred tool. But prior to that, we had point-to-point integration that
we supported readily and made available to our customers.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Dave, I know you've been kind of asked this question in the past, but I'm wondering I know in the short
run, there's a lot of talk about using digital technology. I'm wondering, as you have conversations with
your customers, what they think might be a permanent shift in behavior changes? And how that maybe
benefits Jack Henry or how Jack Henry might have to change to adapt to any changes that are going to
occur as a result of the current pandemic?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's a good question. The key thing, and I think it's evidenced in that survey that I cited from Bank
Director, we have all these CEOs and Board members of banks and credit unions were not included in
the survey. So I'll just talk banks for a moment. All these CEOs and directors who through that survey
have indicated that they really are shifting their focus to digital because they know that their consumers
aren't necessarily going to come into the branch for all the banking services going forward like they did in
the past. And so enabling a digital lending experience, which we have done, and I've talked about many
times on this call, our commercial lending center suite in the past. And enabling full consumer functionality
and business functionality through the digital channel is a key part of their strategy and a key part of our
strategy.

Now one of the things we talk about a lot, and I've talked about it on this call a few times, is, okay, if your
consumer is going to start interacting with you, the bank, digitally, how do you ensure, as a community
bank or credit union, how do you ensure that your experience is differentiated from the majors? And so
that's where we really put a lot of focus, and that's why we're getting -- I think we're having so much
success with the Banno platform is because we've created a differentiated experience for the consumer.
The digital experience with Banno is not the same as with all the other vendors out there because we've
tried to create an experience that comes close to the same experience the consumer would have if they
were in the branch, meaning direct personal service, which is what community banks and credit unions
have always used to differentiate themselves from their major competitors.

We've created that similar experience through the digital channel. And so it truly has differentiated us and
our platform. And I think as customers really start to understand that, whether they're Jack Henry core
customers or not as they really start to understand that and that need to differentiate themselves in the
digital environment, they will really look seriously at our platform.

Kartik Mehta
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

And then, Kevin, I know you've talked about this. Just I'm wondering on long-term margins. Obviously,
this year, you're being impacted by COVID-19, you're being impacted by the fact that you're transitioning
your credit and debit platform. But as you finish that and we go into next fiscal year, I'm wondering what
you think long-term margin prospects or medium-term margin prospects look like?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Well, I mean, like I said, Kartik, I mean we're going to see a lift in Q4 as we've been stating for the last
2.5, 3 years as we go through this payment migration. So we'll get a lift in Q4. And then from that and
just the increased sales and implementations of our card platforms, both debit and credit and digital,
we should continue to see margin improvement. The continued shift of customers from our in-house
outsourcing, which also drives margin improvement. So I mean, I haven't sat down and just try to put a
fence around it to figure out exactly what that margin is going to look like in FY '22, Kartik, but it's going
to be up nicely from FY '21. Again, depending on the pandemic and COVID and all that. But if everything
remaining equal, we'll see a nice margin uplift in '22 compared to full year '21.

Kartik Mehta
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

And then just one last question, Dave. Obviously, there's some conversation about Google partnering
with banks to have its own branded checking account and there's stories about maybe Amazon doing

something similar. Any concerns from your customers as to how that might impact them? Or is there
anything you can do to help them that could benefit Jack Henry?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Anything we could do to help our customers or help Google?

Kartik Mehta
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Help your customers or even Google if you want to?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

I just want to make sure you're -- where you're trying to take that conversation. So yes, we have talked
-- have spoken with some of our customers. Interestingly, in Google Solution, they're partnering with
a couple of credit unions and they're trying this in several different ways. So we've talked with some
of our customers, no immediate threat that they perceive with what's happening there. As also, I think
they've seen with all the other neobank experiences that are available in the United States today. But
we're keeping a close eye on that.

We're trying to make sure that we're ahead of the game to help our customers if there are opportunities.
It is -- again, I'll go back to our complete online digital lending platform that we rolled out a couple or 3
years ago. We did that because we saw what was happening with OnDeck and Kabbage and the potential
for those solutions to disintermediate the commercial borrower from our customers. So we were very
successful with that and helping those customers who needed to fend off those competitors, and we'll do
similar things here as we see those opportunities.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele from Oppenheimer.

Dominick Joseph Gabriele
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. If you -- have you talked to your bank or credit union partners about perhaps excess capital that
they may have on their balance sheets if net charge-offs don't materialize in the same magnitude for
which they've reserved and what they may do with this potentially large amount of excess capital? Have
they talked about increased tech investments with a portion of that with you?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

So I wouldn't say they've specifically said we expect to have excess capital, and we're going to use that for
technology. I think the discussion about increasing technology spending is more about their requirement,
their need to remain relevant as customers are moving away from doing business in branch and moving
more towards an online experience. So I think it's pretty premature for most of our customers to be
thinking about the idea that they may have excess capital. Most of them are ensuring that they're in a
good capital position to fend off any losses that may happen as the pandemic continues to unfold. So
I view those conversations as kind of 2 separate conversations. There's the making sure you're well
capitalized in case there are issues on the loan side. And then this need for increased spending separate
apart from that to ensure that you remain relevant to your consumer and that they want to continue to do
business with you in the digital environment.

Dominick Joseph Gabriele
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. That makes a lot of sense. And if you just think about the implementation of the core
products and then your complementary products as well and cross-sell after you won a core partner, could

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

you just go over again on what perhaps that time period is between implementation of your core and then
the kind of tail of these extra API add-ons or cross-selling opportunities? And how long do those typically
kind of last, the add-ons after a win? I really appreciate it.

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes, it's an interesting question. Normally, when somebody is choosing to do business with us on the
core side, so they're coming to Jack Henry as a new core customer. Normally, they will wrap the core with
a whole bunch of other solutions at the same time. So it's rare for somebody to say, I'm going to come
and bring my core business to Jack Henry, but nothing else. Normally, they will -- if they're going to do
that major technology upgrade on the core, they look at a lot of other solutions they have and say, we
want to upgrade our technology on all these other things at the same time and go through that integration
experience once. So that would be my first point in answering your question is, normally, they're buying
the core and maybe 20 or 30 other Jack Henry solutions at the same time.

And then once they are in place and start to experience working with our group, it's -- it may be a month
after they go live. They've realized, oh, we really should have included this, and they add something else
or it may be a year after they go live. But the good news is we have a very long history of continuing
to cross-sell products. We have such a broad suite of products that over the life of the relationship, we
just continue to sell more and more and more to those customers. If we're doing our jobs correctly, we
continue to sell more and more to those customers. So I think that's the best way to think about those
situations.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Mr. John Davis from Raymond James.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So I really just wanted to start on Q1 results, specifically on the top line. I think last quarter, you guys
guided for the full year, said first half adjusted net revenue would be 3% to 5%. It did actually just slightly
north of 5%. So what went better in the quarter, was installations -- or implementations rather, just what
kind of exceeded your expectations relative to your guide?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. JD, it's primarily card and digital were the 2 that exceeded our expectations. So it is primarily all in
the processing line. And to be quite honest, the headwinds in the support and service line were a little
stronger than we thought they were going to be. So -- but all the uplift was in the processing line of
revenue.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then other revenue was down 23% in the quarter. Just curious, was that -- is that kind of the
new run rate? How should we think about that going forward? Because that was a little bit surprising?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

So JD, that's primarily in the corporate segment, and this is to answer actually yours and David Koning's
question from earlier, the big part of that is related to our Education Conference/user group was the
biggest chunk of that. And then the other part of it is just pass-through cost from our travelers not being
out for go out for billable travel to pass-through. So those are the 2 primary drivers of other being down.
As our travelers pick back up, that will level out.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Obviously, as Dave mentioned in his opening comments, our education conferences, Symitar is normally
in the first quarter. JAC, which is Bank and ProfitStars shifted in the second quarter. So there will be some
revenue impact in the other line in Q2, just like there was in Q1, actually it will be a little larger because
JAC is typically larger than the SEC. And then Q3 and Q4 for other revenue should kind of level out with
previous year.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then the last one for me. Just on the M&A front. Just curious, obviously, we've kind of --
obviously, we're still in the middle of pandemic. But have you noticed any meaningful changes, whether
it's valuation expectations, assets for sale, just anything from a private market perspective? Are you more
encouraged, less encouraged? What do you think the pipeline looks like from an M&A perspective as we go
over the next, call it, 3 to 6 months?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

So JD, just to be clear, you're talking about M&A from us acquiring, not within the...

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Industry. Correct?

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Correct. Yes. Correct. Your acquisitions, yes.

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say -- so valuation expectations, have they changed? Yes. It's been interesting with few of the
fintech and insurtech IPOs that have happened recently. I think there's a lot of companies out there
with stars in their eyes, thinking that they're going to get those same valuations. So we are seeing that
companies that are potential that maybe in the past wouldn't have ever really thought about an IPO now
they're thinking IPO. They're thinking, "Oh, my gosh, look at that valuation" or the SPAC concept, of
course, is alive and well out there, too. So it's a little challenging as far as valuation expectations right
now. We are seeing deals.

I think on the last call, somebody asked about what we were seeing, and I was frustrated, frankly, at
the time because we had seen so little, and we assume the pandemic would drive some people to put
their companies up for sale, and we were really seeing very little. Now there's more of a normal deal flow
coming through. So we're looking at deals. But to your point, expectations of valuations have definitely
increased. And you know us well. We're a disciplined acquirer. We don't chase after the shiny object when
it comes to acquisitions. And so we haven't bid on any of them yet, but we are actively looking at deals.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] There are no follow-up question at this time, sir. Please continue.

I want to thank all of our associates for the way they have handled these challenges by taking care of
themselves and our customers and continue to work hard to improve our company on all fronts for the
