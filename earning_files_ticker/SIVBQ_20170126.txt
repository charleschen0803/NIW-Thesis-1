Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon everyone
Let me get right into the quarter
I plan to highlight the following items in my comments
First, healthy loan growth across the portfolio with continued strength in private equity and the private bank; second, strong total client funds growth; third, higher net interest income despite a slightly lower net interest margin; fourth, stable credit quality; fifth, solid core fee income growth; and sixth, higher expenses
Additionally, I will comment on our capital ratios and provide details on our 2017 outlook, which has improved somewhat from our preliminary outlook in October
Starting with loans, average loans grew by $614 million or 3.3% to $19.3 billion, driven primarily by private equity capital call lines and the private bank
Strong period-end loan growth of $788 million or 4.1% was driven primarily by private equity, early-stage and sponsored buyout and points to healthy momentum as we enter 2017. Moving to total client funds – that is, combined on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet client investment funds – we saw a return to growth in the fourth quarter due to a combination of increased funding rounds and new client acquisition
Average total client funds grew $3.7 billion or 4.5% to $84.7 billion in the fourth quarter
This reflected strong average deposit growth of $1.8 billion or 4.7% due to cash inflows from growth stage clients tied to new funding and from our private equity and venture capital clients despite some seasonal outflows related to year-end distributions
It also reflected average client investment funds growth of $1.9 billion or 4.3%, primarily as a result of higher balances from our growth stage and corporate finance clients due to capital raising activity
Turning now to net interest income and our net interest margin
Net interest income increased by $7.4 million to $296.6 million in the fourth quarter
Higher average loan balances drove this increase, along with a benefit of $1.6 million from December's Fed fund increase, which was consistent with what we would have expected from the rate increase
Additionally, we saw an increase of $2.4 million in interest income from fixed income securities
The increase was primarily due to a $4.7 million change in premium amortization expense from Q3 to Q4 as a result of changes to prepayment estimates following the increase in market interest rates in the fourth quarter
Our net interest margin decreased by 2 basis points to 2.73% due to a higher average balances of cash and short-term investment securities, our lowest yielding asset
Now, let us move to credit quality, which remained stable overall
Our allowance for loan losses was $225.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter or 1.13% of total gross loans, an overall decrease of $15.2 million or 12 basis points compared to the third quarter
We recorded a loan loss provision of $7.1 million compared to $19 million in the third quarter
Our provision primary reflects $14.3 million in specific reserves for net new non-accrual loans and $6.5 million for loan growth
These additions were partially offset by a $5.8 million net reduction in reserves for performing loans
In addition, we also made certain enhancements during the quarter to our methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses and our reserve for unfunded loan commitments
The results were a $7.9 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses, which is reflected as part of our provision for loan losses, and an $8.1 million increase in our reserve for unfunded loan commitments, which is recorded in non-interest expense
The net impact of these two enhancements had a minimal impact on overall net income for the quarter
Given that our press release has a significant amount of detail in the various components of credit quality, I will limit my comments primarily to the quarter-to-quarter change in certain components and refer you to our press release for additional details
Net charge-offs were lower at $21.3 million or 44 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to $22.5 million or 48 basis points in the third quarter
I would note that the majority of our net charge-offs were previously reserved for and, therefore, had no significant impact on the provision for the quarter
Non-performing loans increased by $12.8 million to $119 million or 59 basis points compared to $106.2 million or 55 basis points in the third quarter
Now, I would turn to non-interest income, which is primarily composed of core fee income and net gains from warrants and PE and VC-related investment securities
I will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in my comments and we encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further detail
GAAP non-interest income was $113.5 million compared to $144.1 million in the third quarter
Non-GAAP non-interest income, net of non-controlling interest, was $109.1 million compared to $139.5 million in the third quarter
The decrease was mainly related to lower net gains on investment securities and warrants relative to Q3, which was exceptional
These lower PE and VC-related gains were offset somewhat by higher core fee income
Let me review the components
First, non-GAAP net gains, net of non-controlling interests, on investment securities of $5.3 million compared to $18.4 million in the third quarter
These gains were driven primarily by distributions from our VC fund investments
Second, net gains of $4.6 million on equity warrant assets primarily related to valuation increases during the quarter
This compares to warrant gains of $21.6 million in the third quarter related to improving exit markets and Acacia’s IPO
Combined non-GAAP investment securities and warrant gains were $9.9 million
This number is net of two notable items, totaling $5.7 million, which includes a $2.8 million one-time write down on a strategic investment and a $2.9 million decline in the value of our Acacia holdings, which you will recall was the primary driver of third quarter's outstanding warrant gains
Moving on to core fee income, which includes fee from foreign exchange, credit cards, deposit service charges, lending-related activities, letters of credit and client investment funds
Core fee income increased $4.1 million or 5.1% to $84.6 million in the fourth quarter
This increase was driven primarily by higher foreign exchange and lending-related fee income
Income from foreign exchange fees increased by $1.2 million or 4.8% to $27.2 million
This increase was due to more clients actively managing their currency exposure as a result of volatility in global currency markets, something we have seen now for several quarters running
Lending-related fees increased $1.4 million or 17.7% to $9.6 million, primarily as a result of higher syndication fee income related to one particularly large deal
In general, we continue to see solid growth across most fee income lines
Moving on to expenses, non-interest expense increased by $22.8 million or 10% to $244.6 million in the fourth quarter
This increase consisted of several components
An increase in our provision for unfunded credit commitments of $8.3 million due to enhancements to our reserve for unfunded credit commitments, which I mentioned earlier, and $3.3 million in additional compensation and benefits expense
The most notable component of this increase was a $5.5 million increase related to compensation programs based on our stock price, which increased approximately 57% in the quarter
I would also like to call your attention to our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which was 35.5%, a decrease from the prior quarter and our usual rate of approximately 40%
This decrease was due to adjustments to our deferred tax balances
We expect our effective tax rate going forth to remain in the 40% range
Turning to capital
Our capital position remains healthy overall due to solid earnings
As you'll see in the press release, deposit and loan growth during the quarter drove average assets and risk-weighted assets higher
This had the effect of decreasing our bank level Tier 1 capital ratio by 7 basis points, although at 7.67% it still remains strong
We also saw a 12 basis point decline in our bank level risk-based capital ratios due to loan growth
Now, I’d like to discuss our 2017 outlook and provide some updates to the preliminary outlook we provided in October
This outlook is for the full year 2017 versus the full year 2016. Balance sheet growth rates are based on full-year averages, not quarterly averages
Additionally, our outlook reflects the impact of the 25 basis point Fed funds increase we saw in December, but assumes no further rate increases in 2017. If there are rate increases in 2017, we will adjust our outlook accordingly
As a reminder, this outlook is based on our current forecast and assumptions about market conditions and is subject to change
Starting with loans, consistent with our commentary in October, we expect average loan balances to grow at a percentage rate in the high teens, with the strongest growth expected to come from private equity and the private bank
We expect average deposit balances to grow at a percentage rate in the mid-to high single digits, which is consistent with our outlook in October
We expect net interest income to grow at a percentage rate in the low teens and increase over our preliminary outlook of low-double-digits growth
We expect our net interest margin to be between 2.8% and 3%, which has been helped with the recent increases in rates
We expect credit quality to remain stable and comparable to 2016 levels
Specifically, we expect net loan charge-offs to range between 30 and 50 basis points of average total gross loans
We expect non-performing loans to range between 50 and 70 basis points of total gross loans and we expect our allowance for loan losses for performing loans to be comparable to 2016 levels
It is important to know that although we expect continued good credit performance in 2017, we could see credit metrics trend toward the higher end of our outlook ranges if our investor-dependent clients continue to see an impact from the 2016 recalibration
We are improving our outlook for core fee income and now expect to grow at a percentage rate in the high teens
This primarily reflects the impact of December’s rate increase on our client investment fees
We expect non-interest expense to increase at a percentage rate in the high single digits, consistent with our preliminary outlook
Keep in mind that if we outperform on our financial metrics, we could see higher incentive compensation, which would drive a higher rate of expense growth
Finally, while we do not provide an outlook for warrant and investment gains, we believe venture investment levels, trends in funding rounds and the pace of M&A and IPOs in 2017 will all remain key factors to our overall earnings performance
In closing, we had a strong finish to a solid year
Our outlook for 2017 is positive and has improved somewhat since our preliminary outlook in October as a result of December’s very welcome increase in short-term rates
Our clients remain healthy overall and we are seeing higher confidence in exit market prospects for 2017. While competition, economic uncertainty and global market volatility persists, we remain focused on delivering the right kind of growth, maintaining stable credit quality and succeeding in the long-term
We see solid momentum across our business and we believe we are well-positioned for 2017. Finally, I want to comment on our announcement that I will be taking on the role of President of Silicon Valley Bank
We have a fantastic banking team and I am looking forward to working more closely with them to support our clients and grow our business
For now, I remain focused on my role as CFO, but I'm excited about the future, specifically about the opportunity to harness the power of our platform as we grow to become an even stronger partner to our clients and retain our position as the bank of choice for innovators and their investors
And now, I will ask the operator to open the line for Q&A
Question-and-Answer Session
So, Ken, we will come out with the updated sensitivity charts
But, generally, as you’ve seen over the last couple of quarters, for every one basis point increase in the rates, again across the board, what you will see is approximately a little bit more than $1 million benefit to net income
That’s after-tax
So, you can kind of gross it up a little bit to get to your net interest income number
So that’s generally the rule of thumb
And again, we will run the numbers in the model and publish it in our 10-Q here in the next couple of weeks – sorry, the 10-K
So, we have traditionally and historically been neutralizing that out of the equation for us
So, for example, in 2017 – sorry, 2018, as we go forward, if we have a lift in the interest rate, we would normalize that out and not necessarily drive a benefit from incentive compensation levels
Yeah, that’s right
So, the net interest margin outlook we gave you, it does consider the Fed funds increase here in December
So, that's why you're seeing a bit of an increase going into 2017 here
There’s a few things to think about, Steve
And we tried to highlight some of these notable items in Q4, but, clearly, you're right, we gave the outlook for our 2017. But let me just kind of remind us of some of these notable items in the expenses there
You may have heard in the remarks where we increased our provision for unfunded credit commitments and that amounted to around $8.3 million
And that in itself is like 1% of the total expenses for the entire year
So, that’s quite a sizable item
The other item we point out in expenses was $5.5 million incentive compensation increase related to our stock price increase
We do have incentive compensation for certain leaders in this organization that are tied to the stock price and you saw just the unusual, dramatic lift in stock prices, in particular our stock price here in the fourth quarter
So, when we look at those two items alone, those aren’t something that you would expect to see every single quarter, and so as you enter into 2017, we would not necessarily expect to see those in 2017. So, hence we get a little bit of – I would say, a little bit of a breather there
But those two items in itself drove a significant amount of expenses
Clearly, we are spending from the regulatory front, clearly, we’re expanding on the infrastructure front and for our clients and products
We are a rapidly growing bank
We’re expanding internationally
So, there's just a lot of things going on that you would expect from a growth company
Thank you, John
So, I think the best starting point for you is to start with the expense growth outlook that we say, which is the high single digits
And you can certainly work back into the efficiency ratio
You’ve seen here over the last couple of years – where do we finish the quarter? Something around 54%, 55%, somewhere in there
You can see that downward trend overall on our expense basis
So I think that’s probably your just best point, John, to really start with, is just the expense outlook, then work itself in
We continue to be focused on the efficiency ratio
But, again, we know we’ve got a fine balance between trying to maintain the growth
So, there’s definitely a lot of tension there and there’s certainly without a doubt pressure on expenses, but one that we’re very, very focused on
And, certainly, the things around continuing to spend on the regulatory front will just continue
It’s just a fact of life here for a while unless the government does something that kind of changes that trend
John, I haven't gone and worked out the math
I think the very simple rules – and you guys can actually work it out when you look at the disclosures in the 10-Q and 10-K
The simple rule of thumb is every basis point increase in those short-term rates will have a benefit after-tax of a little bit over $1 million
I think that’s probably the best way for you to look at that
It's been holding true for probably the last several quarters and that’s probably your best guide
As I’ve mentioned earlier, we’ll come out with kind of the updated sensitivities there, which does change quarter to quarter slightly, but for the most part it's been fairly consistent for the last several quarters
So, the guidance we’re giving is off the total expense base for the entire year 2016. That's correct
No, I think those two were, I think, notable as we characterized them as well
So, again, unless you really expect our stock price to run up another 50% here in such short a period of time, it’s just unlikely you would have any real material amount that’s going to be driving that here in 2017. So, no, it got capped out quite a bit with this nice run
Similarly, on the provision front for unfunded commitments, we just made some refinement and enhancement to the methodologies
So, again, we have no real plans necessarily to have another change like that to drive that
So, I think, at this point, I would say, I don't see those types of things being recurring in 2017. Now, the one other thing to think about as we go into 2017 is we reset our incentive compensation level targets
So, because 2016 was such a strong year, the incentive compensation pool that we pay out was much higher than the initial target as we go into the year
So, that resets back to our 1x factor, so to speak
So, when you're going into almost like Q1 of this quarter, you could expenses potentially going down versus the Q4. Again, so things just reset and recalibrate
So, that might be where some people may be struggling with kind of – you’re at that run rate in Q4. I see you building off of that, but the reality is you’re going to have some benefits and takeaways going into Q1. We’re kind of starting at a lower base in Q1. So, hopefully, that helps
So, those will be certainly seasonal expenses
I don’t know if it would be quite $10 million, but you’re somewhere, let’s say, between $5 million and $10 million
So, you will have maybe those type increase
But then, again, when we start to think about the unfunded, will you have that same $8.3 million unfunded in Q1? Probably not
Will you have that same $5.5 million increase in stock compensation in Q1? Probably not
So, that’s why you had a lot of the offsets
And again, coming back to where you reset the incentive compensation level to a 1X target versus the elevated levels that we had in 2016.
Thank you very much
For all practical purposes, the majority, if not all of it, was more or less related to that
As you’ve seen, kind of in a given quarter anyway, it's in plus or minus kind of $1 million
So, it’s usually a pretty small number overall
So, the vast majority of that number would be just this enhancement
I think the implication is we would all be ecstatic, first and foremost
Clearly, as you’ve seen, generally, for our banks, we have one of the higher effective tax rates in the industry
And part is, because we operate in some of the most expensive, high tax rate states such as California and Massachusetts
But, clearly, we would stand to benefit significantly if they lower the federal rate down to 20% or 15%, whatever the number they're talking about
And for us, we tend to get a bigger lift in other banks because we have less composition of tax advantage investment security
So, said another way, we have less municipal investment securities than other banks may have
We don't have bank owned life insurance
We don’t have a few of these other products or as many of the other things
So, we will definitely benefit a lot more for that
So, one can only hope that it will drop, but, as Greg said, it’s just too early to tell to even start to count anything
Yeah, I think that’s a fair way to look
At this point – again, there’s been talk about what’s deductible, what’s not deductible
Again, we can’t go into that because it’s just – who knows right now
But just, all things being equal, if you drop the federal tax rate, you're right, for the most part, at this point, we would see most of it drop into the bottom line and benefiting shareholders
Thank you, Chris
So, right, now all of our capital is going to continue to support our growth both here in the US and abroad as well too
You’re right, capital levels have gotten stronger
They've improved for the first time at levels where we can actually consider different options
We’re not advocating anything, whether it’s buybacks or dividends or further growth options, but at least now, in our planning, we can start to consider about whether or not – or evaluate the different options we may or may not have
So, yes, different discussions, more discussion starting to happen here in 2017 than in the past
But nothing on the agenda right now to do anything radically different than what we've done over the last several years
