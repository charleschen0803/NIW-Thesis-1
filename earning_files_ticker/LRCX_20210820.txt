this afternoon on our website.

And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Tina, and welcome, everyone. Lam delivered a solid September quarter, with revenues in line and
earnings per share above the midpoint of our guided ranges. These results represent our sixth consecutive
quarter of revenue and earnings per share growth for the company. Over this time period, we have scaled
our operations to support rapidly growing demand for our products and services. And as we look forward,
we see continued strengthening across both leading edge device segments and specialty technology
markets.

In response, we have expanded our manufacturing capacity at existing facilities in the United States,
Korea and Taiwan. In the September quarter, we celebrated the grand opening of our new Malaysia
facility which, when fully ramped, will be the largest factory in our global network. And just last month,
we announced a new factory in Oregon, primarily designed to meet increased demand for Lam tools
and foundry/logic in advanced packaging applications. With these investments, we are building a solid
foundation for delivering on our long-term growth objectives.

In the near term, however, we are not immune to the widely reported supply chain constraints and
elevated costs that continue to create new challenges for Lam and others across our industry. Our
employees and supply chain partners are working tirelessly to meet the needs of our customers, and I
would like to sincerely thank them for their efforts.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

From a wafer fab equipment spending perspective, we now see calendar 2021 ending in the mid-$80
billion range. Overall, WFE is higher in the second half versus the first half of the year, with both DRAM
and Foundry/Logic up in the second half, while NAND is more balanced. Demand remains strong. And
while it's a bit early to give a specific forecast for calendar year 2022, indications are that it will be another
year of WFE growth.

We believe sustained strength in WFE spending is due to several factors we have previously highlighted.
First, drivers of semiconductor demand continue to broaden and sectors such as automotive, health
care and security, are increasingly dependent on semiconductor content to deliver the performance
requirements of end users. As a result, we are seeing a strong uptick in trailing edge technology nodes
served by our Reliant business. Our Reliant business has now posted 11 consecutive quarters of record
revenues. And in calendar year 2021, we expect Reliant to outgrow the WFE investment in this segment.
Furthermore, high utilization rates across our installed base are driving strength in all subsegments of our
CSBG business. And in the September quarter, CSBG revenues increased year-over-year by more than
30%.

At the leading edge, semiconductor content growth, larger die and rising capital intensity are fueling
increased wafer starts and strong WFE spending. In Foundry/Logic, for instance, the next-generation
processor chip for a top smartphone maker is more than 20% larger than its prior iteration. In DRAM,
higher capital intensity is being driven by the increasing need to correct single-bit errors through the
addition of an extra on-chip bit. In 3D NAND, increasing device layer counts and the resulting higher
degree of manufacturing difficulty is requiring the addition of new deposition and etch processes to
address stress management, defect control and multi-stack integration challenges. As a result, we see the
WFE investment required to achieve the same bit growth percentage over the next 5 years to be notably
higher than the 5-year period just completed.

However, as the leading equipment supplier to the 3D NAND market, we are investing in new and
differentiated capabilities to ensure scaling remains cost-effective. As one example, Lam has developed a
new high-productivity cryo etch solution, which increases etch rates in high aspect ratio features required
for NAND devices with greater than 200 layers. We have installed this new capability at every major 3D
NAND manufacturer for qualification, with additional systems now shipping to support planned ramps to
high-volume production next year. While initially developed to meet the demanding requirements of high
aspect ratio etch in 3D NAND, we believe the technology may also have benefits for Foundry/Logic and
DRAM at the leading edge where we are presently engaged with customers on critical applications.

Looking in more detail at the Foundry/Logic segment, we see spending at record levels. Lam's Foundry/
Logic revenues are likewise set to grow significantly in 2021, and we expect this expansion to continue in
2022 as well. Foundry and logic performance in the sub-5-nanometer era is being driven by both device
architecture innovation and traditional area scaling. We are prioritizing technology development in 3 areas
where we see the fastest growth and the greatest need, namely deposition and etch processes to support
the efficient adoption of EUV patterning, new etch capabilities to enable the formation of critical transistor
features and new materials and deposition techniques to assist in RC management.

In patterning, we are using the learning we have acquired over many years of multi-patterning etch
leadership to win new applications as the industry adoption of EUV progresses. EUV requires use of special
photo-resistant materials which, given the material composition, can amplify existing challenges with
pattern roughness and defectivity. Unaddressed, these will lead to performance and yield loss, especially
at smaller device dimensions.

Lam has developed critical etch and deposition technologies to help solve these EUV implementation
issues. In etch, we introduced earlier this year a new pulse plasma etch capability that is demonstrated in
order of magnitude reduction in EUV-related pattern defectivity. This innovative etch solution is currently
shipping to leading foundry and logic customers. In deposition, hard masks and transfer films require
enhanced mechanical properties in order to maintain fidelity of extremely small features and minimize
line roughness. Utilizing a combination of proprietary hardware design and RF power technology, we
are depositing high-quality films that have replaced incumbent technologies such as PVD and spin-on
materials at multiple foundry/logic customers.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Related to the formation of critical transistor features, including gates, fins and source/drain, we saw
significant etch wins in the September quarter. These wins continue to confirm the benefit of our unique
plasma pulsing capabilities in conductor etch for gate-all-around and FinFET applications. For advanced
device architectures, we also see ultra-high selectivity isotropic etch increasingly required. Lam's growing
selective etch portfolio delivers superior results through a combination of process technologies and reactor
innovations that include new chemistries and plasma sources. This has helped us win a greater number of
applications in recent quarters.

And finally, RC management continues to be a limiter on performance scaling, and we are seeing demand
for our atomic layer deposition technologies as a result. Our Striker ALD system deposits thin low-k
films that can withstand harsh integration steps encountered later in the process flow. These films have
demonstrated the ability to reduce capacitance by 20% to 30%, and Striker is now the tool of record at
leading foundry/logic customers. This technology is also extendable to gate-all-around devices where
there is an additional requirement of conformal coverage in recess cavities, which can then be selectively
etched back.

In advanced packaging, momentum remained strong with orders received in the September quarter from
multiple foundry/logic customers for through-silicon via etch and deposition systems. Our experience
in high aspect ratio etching has allowed us to deliver a production-proven process with fast etch rates
and smooth profiles, helping to minimize the cost of integrating TSVs and the overall flow. Similarly, for
copper metallization, our SABRE 3D solution enables void-free fill by employing an innovative advanced
pretreatment and our high-throughput electroplating process reduces cost of ownership.

So to wrap up, we delivered a solid September quarter in an environment of ongoing supply chain
challenges. We are seeing robust semiconductor demand across all segments, broadening of
semiconductor applications across industries and rising capital intensity. We are excited about the
healthy outlook for WFE spending and believe our innovative product portfolio is poised to capture new
opportunities as semiconductor technology continues to advance.

Thanks again for joining. Now here's Doug to cover the quarter in more detail.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today.

Lam delivered another quarter of strong results, with revenue, operating income dollars and earnings per
share coming in at record levels in the September quarter. All financial metrics came in at or above the
midpoint of our guidance, demonstrating our continued focus on operational execution. We've achieved
this performance while also navigating significant supply chain challenges.

We're pleased with Lam's ability to scale the company in this demanding environment. September quarter
revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of 4% from the June quarter and more than 35% growth from a
year ago.

Looking at the breakout of the systems revenue. The Memory segment represented 64% of systems
revenue in the September quarter, which was up from the prior quarter level at 59%. Memory growth was
driven by investments in DRAM, primarily in the 1z and 1-alpha nodes. DRAM systems revenue nearly
doubled in dollar terms and grew from 10% in the June quarter to 19% in the September quarter.

NAND segment concentration came in at 45% of our systems revenue versus 49% in the June quarter and
was flattish in dollar terms. Our NAND customers are investing in both capacity additions and conversions
with the equipment investments focused towards 128-layer through 192-layer devices.

The Foundry segment spending represented 25% of our systems revenue compared with 35% in the
June quarter. We're seeing investments in equipment for both leading edge and mature device nodes for
multiple sources of end-use demand such as AI, IoT, cloud and 5G. Logic and analog device companies are
driving capacity additions at the foundries.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

There was notable growth in the Logic/Other segment, which hit a record level of systems revenue
for Lam in the September quarter. Logic/Other contributed 11% of systems revenue in the September
quarter, which is up from 6% in the June quarter, and it was driven by leading edge and mature nodes
ramping for microprocessors, image sensors, power management and 5G demand.

Let me turn now to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 37%
of total revenues, which was flat with the prior quarter percentage level. The revenue from China
domestic customers and multinational customers with fabs located in China was again fairly balanced
in the September quarter. Korea and Taiwan regional spending represented 21% and 15% of revenues,
respectively, in the September quarter. I do expect that the December quarter revenue will have a lower
China concentration.

The Customer Support Business Group revenue was nearly $1.4 billion, 34% higher than the September
quarter in calendar 2020 and flat with the prior quarter level. As Tim noted, the Reliant product line that
serves the specialty market delivered record results, and we also had solid results in the spares, service
and upgrade side with a focus on maximizing the productivity and value of the installed base tools while
supporting the high fab utilization levels in the industry. I continue to have confidence that CSBG will grow
revenue consistently on an annual basis.

Let me now shift to margin performance. Our September quarter gross margin was 46% right at the
midpoint of our guided range. I'd just remind you that our gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter
due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix. The supply chain constraints
discussed earlier have resulted in elevated costs broadly, with freight and logistics costs continuing to
be one of the biggest headwinds. Additionally, we currently have margin dilution from our new factory
in Malaysia, which is not yet operating at full capacity. We included these costs in our December quarter
guidance as we expect they will remain for the near future.

Operating expenses for September were $586 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter. We've
continued to manage our expenses as we scale the company with a strong focus on operational efficiencies
while prioritizing R&D spending to deliver a differentiated product portfolio that supports our customers'
technology road maps.

September operating margin exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range at 32.4% or approximately
$1.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 12.2% generally in line with our expectations.
And as we've noted in previous quarter calls, our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and you
should expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low-teens level for the 2021 calendar year. We continue to
monitor potential tax changes under consideration in the United States, but we've not reflected the impact
of any potential changes in our financial models at this point.

Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $36 million in expense. This amount is higher than
the prior quarter due to an unrealized gain we had in June for one of our private equity investments,
partially offset by lower interest expense in the September quarter as a result of the payoff of our 2021
notes last quarter. And just to note, OI&E is subject to market-related volatility that could cause a
difference from our typical run rate.

We were active in our buybacks during the September quarter, allocating over $1.2 billion towards
share repurchases. We deployed this cash in a combination of open market repurchases as well as an
accelerated share repurchase program. This ASR will continue to execute in the December quarter. In
addition, we paid $185 million in dividends in the quarter.

I'd also like to highlight that in August, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend, growing
it from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, which was paid in October. We're tracking very well to our capital return
plans with returns of over 100% of our free cash flow year-to-date in calendar year 2021.

Diluted earnings per share for the September quarter was $8.36, above the midpoint of the guidance
range. The diluted share count balance was down slightly from the June quarter level coming in at 143
million shares, generally in line with our expectations.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled
$4.9 billion, which is down from the prior quarter. The decrease in cash is attributed to the capital return
activities that I described earlier. Additionally, the timing of shipments and resulting impact on accounts
receivable as well as an increase in our inventory balance consumed cash in the quarter.

Day sales outstanding was up to 72 days from 66 days in the June quarter. Inventory turns were down
slightly from the prior quarter level, coming in at 3.2x, which was planned as we've increased inventory
levels to meet the increase in investments from our customers as well as to help mitigate the challenges
that we see in our supply chain.

Noncash expenses for the September quarter included approximately $58 million for equity compensation,
$61 million for depreciation and $19 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the September
quarter were up versus the June level, coming in at $136 million. The increase in our expenditures is
associated with capacity expansion in the network, in particular, at our critical spare parts facility in Ohio
as well as spending for our Korea technology center that will be formally opening in 2022. We expect to
see elevated levels of capital expenditures in the remainder of calendar 2021 and into 2022 as we support
the growth that we see in the business.

We ended the September quarter with approximately 15,400 regular full-time employees, which is an
increase of approximately 1,300 people to meet the increased output levels and to support customers with
their technology and production requirements.

Let's now take a look at our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2021 quarter. We're expecting revenue
of $4.4 billion, plus or minus $250 million, we continued to maintain a widened revenue range given the
supply chain uncertainties that we mentioned; gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point;
operating margins up 32%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $8.45,
plus or minus $0.50 based on a share count of approximately 142 million shares.

And just an additional note, our guidance does not include an estimated gain related to one of our private
equity investments that recently raised capital in a public offering. The gain as of today is in the $50
million range and is subject to market volatility. The amount recognized in our financials as of the end of
December '21 quarter may fluctuate, and I'll obviously give you an update at our next earnings release.

So then in closing, we're experiencing ongoing output challenges in our global supply chain that are
continuing to negatively impact both our revenue and gross margin. We're improving known items, while
new items continue to emerge that we need to further work through. Lead times remain stretched, and we
continue to have unmet demand. Despite these constraints, we're operating at record levels in terms of
revenue and earnings while delivering the technology solutions our customers require. Industry demand
remains strong as we look forward to growth in 2022.

I remain very excited about the multitude of opportunities for the company. And I'd obviously like to thank
the dedicated Lam Research employees for their tireless support in this environment.
Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Doug, I'm hoping that you're not sick. You sound a little bit sick. Hopefully, you're feeling okay. So I guess
the first thing I wanted to say was can you quantify, Doug, what the gross margin headwind is right now?
You talked about Malaysia and freight. Is that 50 bps, 75 basis points? I'm just kind of wondering if you
could quantify that for us.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Tim, and thanks for the concern about my health. I'm doing quite well, frankly. I don't know, maybe
just a little scratchy throat. I haven't quantified it, Tim. And I'm not going to now, except what I've said
in the past and I'll continue to say, it's a notable headwind, once we get through this environment, from
where we will be. I'm not going to quantify it, Tim, but it's notable.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It is. Okay. Okay. And then I guess, also, you talked about China domestic being down sequentially for
December. I assume some of that is memory-related. And I guess the question is, is that all sort of out
of the system as you go into the first half of '22? Are there still some headwinds in China related to some
particular projects that may persist into the first half of '22?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. No, Tim, I don't see anything new really relative to China or timing of anything. Maybe I'm not quite
getting at your question or maybe I don't understand the nature of the question. Do you want to try to
redirect me a little bit?

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. I guess I'm -- so there's a pretty big project in China that has had -- I mean it's been well publicized.
They've been having funding problems. They can't meet their commitments. So I'm just wondering if
maybe that was part of the NAND softness in the back half of the year that you cited last call. And I'm
wondering sort of is that sort of -- I mean has that all played out now such that there's not, like, still a
headwind into the first half of next year?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I don't really see any change from a quarter ago of any major customer plans, and I won't refer to
any one customer or another. But no real change, Tim.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Great job on the quarterly execution, guys. The market is concerned that we're heading into a multi-
quarter downturn in memory, kind of similar to the 2018, 2019 memory downturn, which is a pretty
severe 6-quarter downturn. But the one thing I clearly remember was that ahead of that downturn, your
memory customers proactively cut their CapEx very, very rapidly. Now if I look at it this time around,
there's some near-term pricing weakness in memory, but the overall memory demand environment
remains pretty strong. And I think most memory companies seem optimistic, right, on the outlook for
next year. So I guess the question is, has the Lam team seen any signs similar to the 2018 downturn of
customers either getting concerned or canceling or slight pushing out of shipments due to a concern on a
protracted memory downturn next year?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Harlan, let me take that first. I think the simple answer is no. I mean the vast majority of our
conversations with customers today is still about delivering equipment that they feel they badly need to
meet their near-term requirements. And as Doug mentioned in his prepared remarks, I would say lead
times have stretched out to the point where our visibility into demand into '22 is better than usual. And
so I don't think that the types of initial indicators that you're talking about are things we're seeing right
now. We feel much more constrained by supply chain challenges and ability to meet shipments in an
overshipping situation.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then the one area that we continue to see demand, which you alluded to, is obviously strong demand
for mature and specialty processes, analog, microcontroller, RF. You guys are all dealing with supply
issues. I know back at the Analyst Day, the team said that specialty market is growing about 2 to 3x faster
than WFE. So is your Reliant business growing faster than that 2 to 3x rate? And where is the team driving
stronger than market growth? Is it etch? Is it deposition? Or is it more based on platform performance like
throughput, uptime or other productivity metrics?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a great question. So as I said in my script, the Reliant business is growing faster than the WFE
investment in that segment. So it would imply we're picking up share there. It's, I would say, reasonably
well balanced across our product portfolio. And you're right, in that market, a lot of that is about Lam's
leadership in bringing both technology and productivity to customers. So where there are new decisions
being made about tool sets or new fabs being established for those types of specialty products, we have a
lot to offer relative to getting the cost targets that those customers are looking for.

Operator

And next, we'll go to John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Tim, I get that it's a little bit too early to get too granular on next year's WFE. And I know in your
prepared comments, you said it's going to be another growth year. I'm wondering if you can give us some
parameters of how you're viewing kind of the first half of next year versus the second half of this year.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think we're not going to give first half and second half of 2022, but what we would say is we're
exiting this year with significant unmet demand. We talked about a constrained environment, which means
we enter 2022 with a lot of tailwinds relative to business. But I tried to, in my remarks, lay out some of
the trends that we think, over a slightly longer term, maybe through 2022 on into 2023, are driving not
only demand but really, on the supply side, a rising capital intensity, larger die, different architectures,

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

new processes that need to be inserted into process flows to deal with increased manufacturing
complexity. And those will be drivers for WFE structurally for a very long time. So I think there are a lot of
things that will be positives for WFE in 2022 from an equipment perspective.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then, Tim, as a follow-up, a pretty big milestone in the logic business. I think this
quarter's revenue was about 1/3 higher than prior peak. It's the first time you've been run-rating over $1
billion ever. And I know you kind of talked about some of the things in your prepared comments that are
driving that. But to what extent do you believe that this is sustainable? To what extent is it TAM growth
in logic versus kind of your market share and SAM growth starting to kick in? And any sort of view on
sustainability from these levels.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let's say it's probably a combination of both us expanding into some new applications that I talked
about related to emerging device architectures, gate-all-around, new processes like selected etch
technologies that are expanding our market opportunity. But also share gains, I mean we've seen
the increase in spending in the foundry/logic area. And for a number of years, we've been focused on
developing products that bring real value to customers in that space. And what we always said was that
could be a little patient because changes in the foundry/logic world come a little more slowly than in the
memory world. And I would say you're starting to see the fruits of those qualification efforts starting to
play out in our actual business results.

Operator

And next, we'll go to C.J. Muse from Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess first question, hoping to go back to supply constraints, Doug, can you perhaps speak on the
revenue side? Where are you seeing the impact? Is it primarily due to perhaps a slower ramp in Malaysia?
Are you seeing it across all products or limited to a few? And then curious, as part of that, is it impacting
CSBG both for Reliant and upgrades or less so there?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. C.J., thanks for the question. Frankly, when I look at what we're doing with our own internal
manufacturing capability, that's not what the biggest constraint is, it's getting back into the supply chain. I
think we've done quite a nice job actually accelerating the ramp of the factory in Malaysia. Tim referred to
all the places that we're opening new capacity. We're adding capability pretty much everywhere internally
in the network. But as we get further and further down the road and demand continues to be quite strong,
we're beginning to see constraints in the supply chain. So we're having to work our way back up through
some of those things. And that's the biggest thing we're dealing with right now, C.J.

Tim, I don't know if you want to add anything.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

No. I guess I'd just reiterate, we build incredibly complex machines. They do amazing things on the wafer.
They require a lot of parts from a lot of different suppliers to do that, including tremendous amount of
semiconductors themselves. We've heard so much about chip shortages. Clearly, that hit some of our
machines. And it only takes a few of those critical chips to delay us being able to ship what otherwise is a
very complex system. So we're, as Doug said, just having to work down through the supply chain through
lots of suppliers to find out where those pain points are. And it's a daily activity. But so far, we're working

through this and being able to deliver growth and also meet the most urgent needs of our customers.
That's really our key focus.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Very helpful. As my follow-up, I get the sense whenever I have conversations with you both that you
feel like investors underappreciate your foundry/logic exposure. And so within your slide deck and in the
prepared comments, you talked quite a bit about kind of new quals, new design wins. And so curious, I
think over the last 3 years, your SAM as a percentage of foundry/logic is running around 8%, 9%. When
do you think we see an inflection based on these design wins? And what should we be looking for to gauge
that?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a great question. And I'm glad you noted. I spent a lot more time in these prepared remarks
talking about foundry/logic. I think our memory story and leadership there is pretty well understood. And
we want to make sure that people are understanding the progress we're making in foundry/logic and
also the new opportunities that are being created for us. And so many of those are for more advanced
technologies. It's where device architecture changes or things like a new RC management requirement. RC
requirement drives need for new films or new deposition techniques.

And so I would just say at each technology node, we're seeing an inflection. We're seeing more of our
equipment have a chance to get inserted, get qualified and become part of the process of record. And so
I don't think you're going to see like a single point in time or a single node where you see a big jump up,
but you're going to see the steady progression as we make progress on both SAM expansion and share
gains.

And next, we'll go to Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I had 2 of them. First one, I think I just want to clarify, Tim or Doug. It seems like the supply chain
constraints are impacting your revenue, even though demand is strong and it's impacting your margins.
So should we assume this $4.4 billion revenue, 46% gross margin, is where you're going to be saturated
until the supply constraints ease? Or do you think it's going to be more a gradual recovery? And then I
have a follow-on.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Let me start, and then I'll let Tim add on. Krish, I think some of the cost headwinds we're seeing are
going to be around for a while. That's basically what I intimated. We're doing our best to work through
it in an efficient and effective manner. But frankly, we're spending money to try to continue to increase
our output capability. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we're making progress on lots of different
things, but we then see other things popping up. Like I said, we're working our way back through the
supply chain, and Tim referred to the fact that actually semiconductors are constraining us a little bit.
So we're doing our best to work through it. We're mitigating problems. We're incrementally increasing
capability as we go. And I think it's going to get better bit by bit is what I would describe, Krish.

I don't know, Tim, if you want to...

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Yes. I think that's a pretty good explanation. It will continue to improve as we knock down each of
the problem as it comes up. And assuming that there aren't bigger surprises, we would see ourselves
gradually improving from this point forward just as we had supply constraints in the September quarter
and managed through those, and we will have more in the December quarter. So it's constrained, but
we're managing to knock enough off that we're showing some incremental growth, and I think that's what
you could probably expect to continue to see.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Very helpful. And then a follow-up for you, Tim. You spoke about the cryo etch product, which kind
of makes a ton of sense given the extremely long etch times today in 3D NAND, and you also said this also
improves etch rate. But isn't it negative for you since customers would [ made sure ] of your etch tools?
Or is this needed to protect and grow your market share?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think that, like all things, when you're providing the technology that's needed to not only enable
the current nodes but future technology nodes, we have an obligation to drive both technology and
productivity and make sure the scaling is cost-effective and the road map continues. And so this is our
effort to not only differentiate our technology further from any companies that may try to develop similar
technologies but also to help our customers with those transitions and accelerate in the state-of-the-art
NAND.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And Krish, I'll just remind you something Tim said in his scripted remarks that as we look at the NAND
investment required to generate the bit growth over the next 5 years as compared to the previous 5
years, it's increasing. That includes cryo rolling out and increasing etch rates as a result of that.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. I think that's a very fair explanation.

Operator

And our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Joseph Lawrence Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to ask about NAND. Tim, in your opening remarks, you had mentioned that the 5-year spending
in NAND needs to be higher than the last 5 years, I think, is what you said. Any quantification of how
much that is? And just any qualification of why layer count is that much more capital-intensive? You were
increasing layers in the last 5 years. You are increasing layers in the next 5 years. What is it that drives up
the capital intensity?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Sure. So we did say that the WFE required to achieve the same percentage of bit growth would be
higher in the next 5 years. And it's a number of things. One is as the layer count continues to increase,
certain processes scale, as we said, nonlinearly. So it takes longer to etch a stack that's twice as high. It

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

takes more than 2x longer. And that's why we need to introduce new technologies like cryo etch and other
processes to keep that escalation of process times to a reasonable level. Same thing can happen with
deposition as you're trying to control uniformities and defects as stacks become much higher and taller.

And so in addition to that, I mentioned several steps that get added. So as you start to stack higher, the
wafer stress and bow becomes a much bigger challenge. And so now you have to add extra steps like
Lam's stress management deposition tool. Those additional steps add to the WFE required to add a bit of
NAND. And so that is a combination of both new steps to deal with complexity as well as new processes
required to deal with kind of nonlinear scaling process times.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

My first one, I wanted to take a look at the foundry business. So it was down like 25% sequentially,
and it looks like it was down year-over-year in what seems to be a very, very strong foundry spending
environment. So why was that? Can you tell us a little bit what's going on in that end market? Why was it
down?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Stacy, nothing goes up every single quarter. There's ebbs and flows. It's a second half-weighted foundry/
logic spending profile. It's going to be a good quarter in December. But when you got a concentrated set of
a couple of really big customers, it's lumpy at times. I think that's the only thing I'd tell you about it.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. So I guess to follow up on that in terms of what might be implied for the trajectory into Q4, so you
said Foundry/Logic up second half versus first half, DRAM up second half versus first half, NAND kind of
more balanced. I guess given where NAND is and given where DRAM is like in order to have that Foundry
still to be up in the second half, you need to have DRAM down considerably in the December quarter in
order to get Foundry up. Is that what you have in mind? Or when you say Foundry/Logic growing in the
second half, do you mean just as a combination growing?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

It's a combination, right? We said Foundry/Logic and DRAM up in the second half and NAND more
balanced.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I guess what I'm asking is do you see Foundry and Logic both up in the second half or just the
combination because I can't really get Foundry up in the second half unless you got DRAM down a bunch
in the end of December quarter just mathematically. Like am I thinking about this right or what?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Stacy, we're combining Foundry/Logic together when I described it.

Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I have 2 as well. Just curious to a couple of prior questions on the Logic segment. You talked about really
trailing edge kind of driving that big spike. But then I think to a prior question, you kind of mentioned
some of the future wins you have at the leading edge. So just maybe kind of just revisit that when you
talked about -- I think you said that it could maybe stay at this level, to John's question. Is that just the
trailing edge? Or are you seeing that leading edge starting to come in even in the December quarter?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, maybe we didn't want to mislead here. I mean we talked about the Reliant business and trailing
edge as a notable area of strength for Lam and a sign of this broadening of demand across many, many
different use cases, including industries like our own where we're consuming a tremendous amount of that
type of chip. But we do have significant business at what we would call the current leading edge. And what
I was trying to point out is how our SAM expands with new processes and how our win rate is increasing,
we believe, as new inflections come into place. So that's all built into our numbers today. But we do think
that from our share of WFE going forward as these technology inflections at Foundry/Logic take place, we
would see that driving higher over the next several years.

Blayne Peter Curtis
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then maybe a question for Doug on gross margin. It sounded like there's still some variability in the
outlook, some questions about whether factories like Malaysia get better. Just kind of curious, I mean,
your foundry customers are raising pricing. Their customers are raising pricing. Everybody is raising
pricing. Is there a lever that you can also pull as an industry on pricing? I was just curious your thoughts.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Blayne, we're doing our best to get paid fairly for what we're delivering to customers and get paid
for the value we're delivering. So that's an ongoing activity at the company. And a lot of our pricing
arrangements are, on an annual basis, renegotiated. And clearly, we're focused on trying to get gross
margin to improve over time. So that'll be a part of it.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is on 2022. I realize it's early, you guys talked about your expectations for the market
to be up. How are you thinking about the 4 device types? If you had to rank order the 4, how would
you go about doing that? And more importantly, how should we think about Lam's ability to outperform
the market in '22? I guess the big concern is memory is flat to flattish maybe, and logic and foundry
continue to be the big drivers. All else equal, that would be a bit of a headwind for you guys just given
your customer mix. But at the same time, you've talked about all these design wins and your market
share growth in foundry and logic. So net-net, how should we think about your performance vis-a-vis
WFE?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Toshiya, it's too soon for us to give you specificity in 2022. You know what, when we look into the
year, though, 2022, I'm very confident of the growth here. I believe every segment of the business is
actually going to be pretty strong next year. But I'm not really ready to parse it one versus another quite
yet. Obviously, we'll do that for you next quarter.

And I feel really good about where we're positioned, right? Tim talked a lot about the trajectory of our
business in foundry and logic. We've always been strong in memory, and I believe we're going to continue
to do extremely well there. So too soon for me to parse it there. And by the way, I think CSBG is going to
have a good year next year, right? When I put it all together, I think we're very well positioned and going
to continue to be. Stay tuned. We'll give you a little more specificity on the December quarter call.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then a quick follow-up on your last point, Doug, on CSBG. You talked about the Reliant
business having a record quarter which, I guess, implies that your spare parts business and other parts
of your business could have been down a little bit. And I appreciate your point about there being some
lumpiness, if you will, on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But if you can speak to what you're seeing in the
non-Reliant business and CSBG near term, that would be helpful. And then I guess you sort of addressed
this in your prior answer, but how confident are you that calendar '22 could be another up year after
what's been a very strong year in CSBG?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Toshiya, you're right, there's lumpiness to different aspects of it. Tim specifically said 11 consecutive
quarters of record revenue for Reliant. Obviously, there's ebb and flow and other stuff. As inventory builds
a little bit, upgrades can be a little bit lumpy at times, depending on what's going on in the installed base.
But I'll tell you, when I think about CSBG going into next year, it's been a very strong year in terms of our
chamber shipment this year. That's the opportunity to continue to have CSBG grow into next year. And
that's why I have pretty high confidence that this business will grow every single year. It may not grow
every single quarter, right? We were flat this quarter, but we're shipping a lot of chambers this year, and I
feel pretty good about what that's going to mean for CSBG next year.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

You mentioned the supply situation could improve over the next several quarters. I'm curious, what do
you think changes to help that? Is that actions you are taking? Is that actions your suppliers are taking?
I'm just curious what's kind of behind your confidence that the supply situation can actually improve from
here.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it would be perhaps actions we're taking with our suppliers. I mean it's about helping to
prioritize our critical supply chain partners towards the things that are most important to meeting output
quarter-by-quarter. The actions we've taken ourselves, we've kind of detailed those out. If we look
back 6 months ago or more, we were talking about physical capacity needing to open factories, expand
factories. And we've really taken care of a lot of our own actions. But in a very complex supply chain,
we've got to do the same work with all of our partners. And they've been great through that. But there's
still more work to be done and we just anticipate that over the next several quarters, we'll continue to
make progress.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And for my follow-up, you sound more confident about next year, both on the tools and the CSBG
side. Is that based on the backlog of orders? Is that based more on structural drivers? And where I'm
coming from is that customers are seeing the current state of the industry and supply shortages. What
gives you the confidence they are not overordering given this environment, that these orders are for real?

So if you look at your confidence about next year, how would you kind of contrast those signals to what
you usually have at this point than prior years?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a very good question, something we watch closely. We want to make sure that demand is as real
as possible. I mentioned our lead times. Our conversations with customers, our understanding of projects,
I would say, is better at this point because our customers are planning for very big projects, mega fabs.
They're experiencing difficulties in getting equipment. And so we're having much deeper conversations
with them about how we can ensure that, that equipment will be available when they need it. And so I
would say compared to normal, we have a little bit longer visibility than we typically have.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And Vivek, obviously, we know every fab in the world, how big it is, how much equipment it can take. And
we think through that as we're talking to customers about when they want equipment in those premium
spaces. So that goes into part of the thinking as well.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Patrick Ho from Stifel.

J. Ho
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Congrats on a really nice quarter given the environment. Doug, maybe just a follow-up question on the
Customer Support Business Group. You guys have done a really, really good job growing the Reliant
business. Obviously, the TAM of that marketplace is growing, and you're capitalizing from that. Are you
getting any "share wins" because customers, especially on that front, are looking for more productivity?
There are new materials engineering that's going on in some of those, I guess, trailing edge processes.
Are you actually gaining share also and getting placements with the Reliant business for some of those
more mature nodes?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

That's a good question, Patrick. Yes, we are. I mean we go to market there through the Reliant product
line, as you know, which is refurbished equipment. And increasingly, we're selling new equipment. And
when I look at some of the new customers or customers that are taking equipment, our footprint is doing
quite well, frankly, in the specialty space. And we have some very specific things that we're very, very
strong at. So yes, I think we're doing well.

I don't know, Tim, if...

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I guess what I would just add is, as people are trying to work through supply constraints and increase
their output out of the fab, the most valuable part of our CSBG business to them is the productivity
upgrades segment. Those are upgrades that can be applied to existing equipment. Many times, not even
really changing the process, it might be software optimization to optimize the wafer handling through
the machine and thereby gain some small improvement in throughput. We definitely see, as utilizations
really hit like max levels, people looking for productivity upgrades. They can implement to squeeze more
out of the installed base. And so that part of our business always does quite well, but I would say in this
environment, doing quite well.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

My first question is going back to supply constraint. I got to give this a try. If you look at your revenue
year-to-date, how much more revenue do you think you could have shipped if there were no constraints?
If you're not answering quantitatively, are there some metrics that you can point to, to help us think about
that dynamic, deferred revenue orders? I know you don't disclose orders anymore.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. No, Sidney, we're not going to quantify it right now, but we are constrained. Our lead times are
stretched. It's a decent amount of unmet demand. I mean there's a reason that I said unmet demand,
lead time and so forth. We're working our way through it, but I'm not going to quantify it.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Maybe I'll switch over and ask about the memory side. What are your thoughts about the bit supply
growth run rate exiting this year for DRAM and NAND? It seems like some of the CapEx spending in the
early part of this year should turn into output by the end of this year. And kind of related to that, I assume
most of the memory CapEx will be for technology transition, but how should we think about what portion
of the WFE is more driven by wafer additions and hence, more variable in nature?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Sidney, when I look at both NAND and DRAM this year, it's a combination of both wafer adds. And you
always get node conversions in both NAND and DRAM, and that's very much what we see going on. More
wafer adds this year than last year, obviously. That's just the nature of where demand is in the industry.
And when I think about supply growth, when I look at the investments that are occurring this year, I think
NAND is pretty balanced in terms of supply demand growth for the year. I think DRAM is still a little bit
constrained, frankly. So that's generally what we see at Lam.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Joseph Quatrochi from Wells Fargo.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi

I want to go back to your comment around WFE investment required to achieve the same bit growth in
NAND. I was curious, how do you compare that growth and that required investment at DRAM? Is one
growing faster than the other?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I'm not sure I got the question. Try it one more time.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. So I mean you talked about the increase in investment to drive the same amount of bit growth in
NAND. I assume that that's a similar trend that we're seeing in DRAM. But I was curious of, is NAND
growing faster than DRAM that level of investment to drive bit growth? Or is DRAM investment growing
faster?

You're absolutely right that they're both growing in order to get the same amount of bit growth. I'm not
ready to compare one to the other necessarily, but they're both growing. It's getting more and more
challenging. Capital intensity is going up to get the same level of bit growth in both NAND and DRAM.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, 3D DRAM seems to be kind of this growing topic of
interest. I was just curious, what's Lam's thoughts in terms of the timing of that and then just the
opportunity for you guys looking out to that technology?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's still pretty far out from a production perspective. But clearly, what we've always said is anything
that transitions devices in the third dimension requires a lot of etch and deposition equipment to build and
create those complex 3-dimensional structures. So clearly, a great opportunity for Lam as that inflection
takes place. What I can say is, of course, we're engaged at this point in the early days of developing what
those architectures and materials will look like. And as we get closer to defining those process flows, I'm
sure there will be more discussion about that part of our business.

Operator

Our last question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Doug, I just wanted to come back to that unmet demand. I know you're not going to quantify it. But if you
just look back over the past couple of quarters, has that continued to grow even as you've been able to
increase capacity and revenue?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I'm not going to tell you how it's moved sequentially. It was there last quarter. It's there this quarter.
We're working to kind of mitigate it, work our way through, but I'm not going to compare it 1 quarter to
the next.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And the second question, just a follow-up on Malaysia. Do you have any sense or can you give
us any sense when you think that stops being a drag? Is that still a couple of quarters out? Or is that
something you'd rather not specify?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

It will get better as we ramp the factory. And I think by the time we get to the second half of '22, it'll
begin to be a benefit to gross margin as opposed to a headwind. We just need to get it ramped. There's
fixed cost there, and we're working on that.
