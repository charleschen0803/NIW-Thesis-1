CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at
ir.carrier.com.

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Samuel Joel Pearlstein
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference
Call. With me here today are Dave Gitlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim McLevish,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Except as otherwise noted, the company will
be speaking to results from operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a
nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature often referred to by management as other significant items.

The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-
looking statements provided in the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings,
including Carrier's registration statement on Form-10 and the reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, provide
details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in
the forward-looking statements. This morning, we'll review our financial results for the first quarter of
2020, share what the remainder of 2020 could look like under a few scenarios, and we'll leave time for
questions at the end. [Operator Instructions]

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Gitlin.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your families are all healthy and
safe. Our thoughts go out to everyone affected by this crisis, and our thanks go to the front line workers
who are fighting this pandemic. I would also like to recognize the incredible efforts of our entire team
at Carrier, which has continued to deliver essential products and services to our customers during these
challenging times. I have been so impressed with our 53,000 employees. They have stepped up in a truly
profound way, and I couldn't be more proud of this phenomenal team.

Clearly, a lot has changed since we last spoke to you in February. Therefore, we are going to structure our
comments as follows: first, I'll take you through the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business and
how we are addressing these dynamics head on. Tim will then run you through our first quarter financials
as well as provide more detail on our approach to managing our liquidity, cash and balance sheet. And
then I'll provide more color on the remainder of 2020.

Starting with Slide 2. In response to COVID-19, we jumped into gear early and aggressively. We started
daily leadership team meetings that continue today, and we established 4 priorities that have guided our
decision-making.

Our first priority is the safety of our employees. Our office employees are generally working remotely while
our factory personnel have largely continued in the workplace to support our customers given the critical
nature of our products and services.

In our factories, we have gone to tremendous lengths to keep our people safe by implementing an
extensive range of safety protocols, and we are now applying those best practices to our offices as we
begin to transition office employees back to the workplace.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Our second priority has been to maintain business continuity to deliver essential products and services
to our customers. Like other manufacturers, we did experience temporary closures in some of our 49
factories.

In China, where we have 9 factories and about 1,300 suppliers, all of our sites were operational within a
couple of weeks after the February 10th reopening after the Lunar New Year, and our output from our sites
-- from our local suppliers has been close to 100% for the past month. We have had short-term factory
closures in India, Malaysia, Mexico, the EU and the U.S., but our team has done a superb job of minimizing
the length of the occasional site closures and supporting our customers.

While we continue to experience episodic supplier challenges, our supply chain team has been managing
these issues as they arise. Our third priority is to effectively manage our costs and preserve cash. Tim will
cover this topic in more detail, but I'm pleased with our proactive approach and early results.

We accelerated and increased savings through Carrier 600, which is our plan to eliminate $600 million
in cost over 3 years. Between our overdrive expectations on Carrier 600 for this year, together with
other onetime cost actions, we will be driving $425 million in cost actions this year. For example, we
have implemented a 15% pay cut for our senior leadership team, including myself, reduced the Board
of Director pay, instituted a 15-day furlough, suspended merit increases. We're driving down expected
incremental public company costs by about $25 million for the year, and we are aggressively managing
our discretionary spend.

We will also be reducing our CapEx from our initial plan of $350 million to $400 million to $200 million to
$225 million. Though we are aggressively containing spend, we continue to invest in areas that are critical
to our growth agenda, including R&D, sales and digital, all critical to our core strategy to get to sustained
mid-single-digit growth levels.

On the cash side, we are comfortable with our liquidity position. We started with $1.3 billion in cash on
April 3, and we are confident in our ability to generate more than $1 billion in free cash flow this year.
We have access to a $2 billion revolver if needed. So we have a strong cash position and are carefully
managing it.

Finally, our fourth priority has been to ensure that we emerge from this pandemic stronger by accelerating
implementation of our strategic imperatives. And I'll give you more color on that on the next slide. So
turning to Slide 3.

It highlights how we're positioning Carrier for long-term success. Starting with our organization culture of
focus and values. This truly is a new Carrier with a very different feel to it, both internally and externally.
We recently launched The Carrier Way, which lays out our vision, values and behaviors. Our culture is
focused on customers, winning, growth, agility, innovation and empowerment. We are breaking down
barriers to enable our people to be more externally focused and empowering them to drive our long-term
growth agenda.

On people, we have made great progress in assembling a world-class leadership team with both external
hires and promotions of internal talent. We launched the new Carrier operating system, which is both
nimble and disciplined, and we are doubling down on our ESG commitments with a laser focus on our
commitment to the environment through not only our own factories, but also more innovative energy-
efficient products. And we've supplemented our focus on the environment with initiatives that support the
needs of our communities by playing our part in the fight against this pandemic.

For example, we designed and produced our new OptiClean negative air machines in just a few weeks, and
early feedback from the hospitals on our prototype units is very positive.

Turning to our strategy and growth pillars. These remain unchanged. We continue to deliver against our
3 strategic top line priorities funded by Carrier 600. In the first pillar, growing our core, we remain well
positioned within each of our segments building off of our #1 or 2 market positions. We are also adding
500 net sales employees, while we continue to make key strategic R&D and digital investments.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

We've had significant wins across the portfolio, including our largest order ever of 19DV chillers for data
centers in Indonesia, an exclusive long-term resi deal with Fischer Homes in the U.S., and very significant
wins across our refrigeration and F&S portfolios.

In our second pillar, extending our products and geographic coverage, as a vote of confidence in our CO2
technology that we're using to enter warehouse refrigeration, we were selected to provide the cooling for
the Beijing Olympics ice rink, and we secured a VRF win for the Sanya Olympic village apartments in China
for 3,500 heat pumps and 1,000 condensing units.

And in the third pillar, driving aftermarket and digital, we have a dedicated aftermarket team in place.
We indicated that we'd get to a 30% conversion rate in commercial HVAC by the end of next year, and
we are on track to do so this year. We're rolling out structured tiered offerings customized to customers'
needs, and we have leaned forward on digital as a differentiator through remote monitoring, diagnostics
and prognostics.

We've had some key aftermarket wins including a 4-year chiller service agreement with the Hong Kong
International Airport for 52 chillers across 17 buildings and support for Tim Hortons China operations that
is projected to scale to 1,500 stores over the next 10 years.

And on the right side of the slide, we're very proud of our essential and vital role in society. We support air
conditioning systems and hospitals and nursing homes and the delivery of food and pharmaceuticals safely
around the world. Looking ahead, as countries and regions around the world are preparing to reopen
economies in society, we intend to play a critical role in anticipating and creating the new normal. For
example, indoor air quality will be critical. We're putting the V back in HVAC, and our unique electrostatic
systems can filter microscopic-size contaminants. Carrier will be a leader in transitioning buildings around
the world from sick to healthy buildings. Adjusting food safety in the new normal will be paramount, and
we have been making tremendous progress on holistic cold chain solutions.

In our Fire & Security business, touchless and traceability will be very thematic in the future. With our
touchless BlueDiamond solution, we can eliminate 80% of typical contact points in an office building by
enabling employees to use their cellphones instead.

So with that, let me turn it over to Tim to discuss 1Q cost and cash, and I'll come back to discuss our best
sense of 2020. Tim?

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

Thank you, Dave. Good morning. Please turn to Slide 4, where I will walk you through our Q1 results.
But before I start, I want to point out that as we move from being a division of United Technologies to
becoming a fully independent public company, some of the numbers we report will not have a perfect
comparison with last year's. The Form-10 carve-out statements adjusted for that in some circumstances,
but not all. We'll try to help you understand those noncomparables with explanations, but it may be a bit
messy and will continue to be so for the remainder of the year. With that caveat, let me jump into the
results for our first quarter.

Despite significant macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the quarter, it started out about how
we had expected and reflected a solid start to the year. Sales of $3.9 billion were down 10% from last
year, 9% organically, which adjusts for a 1% FX headwind. We reported at Investor Day that we faced
difficult year-on-year comparisons in each of our 3 segments. In HVAC, our residential results last year
reflected a strong furnace season due to abnormally high shipments ahead of a new FER regulation. In
Refrigeration, our North America truck and trailer business came off a cyclical peak in Q1 last year. And in
F&S, we wound down our residential intrusion business, creating a year-on-year decline in 2020.

Additional pressure came from the warm winter this year and resulting softness in residential furnace
sales. These items accounted for about half of our Q1 decline. The remainder resulted from the impact
of COVID-19 on our business in the latter part of the quarter. It first hit China, where about 8% or $1.5
billion of our revenues are derived. This had a material detrimental effect, with domestic China sales down
approximately 40%. And in addition, a good part of our global factory production and supply chain sources

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

come from China. We did, however, manage through that disruption without a material impact on our
rest of world business. But then later in the quarter, the virus moved west into Europe and then on to
the Americas. This pandemic accounted for about $230 million of our revenue decline in the quarter. Our
teams have worked tirelessly to keep factories operational and productive to serve our customers around
the world. And they continue to do so.

Moving down the P&L. GAAP operating profit was $315 million. Adjusted operating profit of $436 million
was down 16% from last year. But this adjusted number is still not comparable. Our Q1 included about
$24 million of public company costs that were not included in the same quarter of 2019. Absent the
impact of that, the comparable year-on-year decline was 12%. And of course, it was heavily impacted by
COVID-19. While we're not happy about the negative signs here, a 12% decline for comparable adjusted
operating profits versus a 9% decline in organic revenues shows we were able to offset a lot of the typical
decrementals, largely preserving our operating margin. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.11, and adjusted EPS
was $0.35. Since we were not a public company last year, the year-over-year comparisons of EPS are not
meaningful.

I'm pleased to report that our free cash flow was favorable to last year by over $200 million. Q1 is
typically a seasonal user of cash, so bringing it in almost flat reflected a solid start to the year. The decline
in net income was more than offset by favorable working capital results and aided by some deferred tax
payments. All things considered, our performance in the first quarter was solid with good mitigation of a
very difficult environment. Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 5.

HVAC was down 9% organically. Within it, North America residential was down 11% organically, with
roughly half the decline due to last year's FER-driven accelerated gas furnace shipments, and the other
half to slow shipments this year due to the unseasonably warm winter. Overall, furnace sales were
down 30% year-over-year. The commercial business was down 8% organically, as a 5% decline in light
commercial and 20% decline in applied, driven by weakness in China and Europe that was only partially
offset by a flattish services business and strength in ALC and NORESCO. Refrigeration sales were down
14% organically, with North America truck/trailer down close to 30%, Europe truck/trailer down around
15% and container down around 7%.

A difficult truck/trailer comparison for the quarter was expected, as I mentioned earlier, but the results did
deteriorate as the quarter progressed. Commercial refrigeration was down 13% organically, with weakness
in both Europe and Asia. The Fire & Security segment was down 5% organically, with the products
business down 4% organically. This was attributable to COVID-related project delays and shutdowns in
Asia and Europe, but was partially offset by growth in our longer-cycle businesses, water mist and gas
suppression, and also growth in global access solutions.

The field business was down 5% organically due to March lockdowns across regions, with particular
weakness in Hong Kong, Australasia and France. In this world of uncertainty, we're focused on controlling
the controllables, and that includes aggressive cost containment actions.

Slide 6 provides a breakdown of our cost programs. In February, we told you that we expected to achieve
$175 million of savings from our Carrier 600 this year, and that we would invest $150 million of that
back into the business to support our growth strategies. The current environment shifted some of our
priorities to aggressively reduce cost, yet to preserve critical investment initiatives. The actions that we're
taking are expected to generate $425 million of cost improvement this year, including accelerating Carrier
600, reducing our planned investments, and implementing an aggressive cost containment program.
First, we will accelerate Carrier 600 and expect to deliver an additional $50 million in 2020 for a total of
$225 million. Second, we have scaled back our investments in the year by $75 million in a very surgical
manner. We are preserving the investments and initiatives that are most critical to our growth strategy to
ensure we are well positioned as we exit this crisis. We have also initiated a $300 million cost containment
program for 2020. Lastly, while COVID-19 affects volume and the drop-through of margins, it also disrupts
our factories and other areas of our cost base. We're anticipating a $200 million nonrecurring headwind
this year on things like factory absorption, supply chain disruption, expediting costs and inefficiencies
caused by precautions for the safety of our employees.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

The $425 million of cost actions more than offsets this impact and our net savings are $250 million, up
from the $25 million we laid out at Investor Day in February. Dave mentioned our top priorities for 2020,
one of which is to maintain ample liquidity. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll walk you through that.

I mentioned earlier that we performed well from a cash flow standpoint in a quarter that is typically a
big user of cash. Our working capital usually seasonally spikes in Q1 as we start building for the spring/
summer selling season. We managed it tightly this year and delivered better cash than planned by over
$200 million. We started the quarter with a cash position of $952 million and ended it with a balance of
$768 million. This resulted from a neutral free cash flow and a use of $184 million from other investing
and financing activities, including a small debt repayment and the effect of foreign exchange. And at
spin, UTC returned us approximately $560 million of cash, so our opening balance sheet started with
just over $1.3 billion on April 3. From this base, we will continue our efforts to preserve and enhance our
liquidity. We will intensify our focus on all the components and levers available to us. This will include
tightly managing working capital, expanding and driving the program we began in Q1. We have also done
a deep scrub of our CapEx budget for the year and cut it by 40% to 50%. It is now $200 million to $225
million, down from the $350 million to $400 million we had originally planned. In paring it back, we have
prioritized those projects targeted at our strategic priorities for growth and those projects which have
high returns and a quick payback. We will also assess the timing and amount of a dividend. Our Form-10
identified a possible dividend scenario that was appropriate at the time, but the environment we face
today is much different from what it was then.

With this foundation and these actions, we expect good free cash flow for the year, and it will add to our
available cash. In addition to our cash position, we have a $2 billion revolving credit agreement with a
strong bank group. That revolver remains undrawn and fully available to us. And finally, I will remind you
that we have no debt maturities until 2023. So we feel quite good about our liquidity and are confident we
have access to the capital we need to weather the storm and to operate and grow the business.

With that, let me turn it back over to Dave to discuss how we're thinking about the balance of the year.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Tim. So what does this mean for our expectations for the full year? For our scenario planning in
this uncertain global economy, we looked at 3 key indicators to frame our thinking: first, macroeconomic
projections like GDP; second, indicators more directly tied to our business like new housing starts;
and third, order trends. At a macro level, starting with GDP, our current guidepost for 2020 assume
U.S. GDP declines about 25% in the second quarter and 5% to 10% for the full year. Expectations for
Europe are similar. We assume China shows growth in Q2 and accelerates from there. When we look at
macro indicators specific to our segments, we assume headwinds from lower replacement volumes as
unemployment rates impact homeowner purchases, U.S. housing starts being down 10% to 20% this year
and continued softness in non-resi construction starts in North America and Europe as we see from leading
indicators like the Architectural Billings Index.

And in our Refrigeration business, the forecast declines in North America and Europe truck/trailer will be
even steeper than we had originally forecast. ACT forecasts North American truck/trailer production to
be down 45% this year and European truck/trailer is likely to be down 20% to 30%. Container drops are
likely to be far more muted. So then on Page 8, let me share some color with you on orders.

We start with our China experience. Q1 orders were down 40% year-over-year, with February being the
lowest month, down 50%. In the category of good news, the China recovery has been very positive. Our
daily order rates returned to precrisis levels in mid-April, and our April orders in China were flat overall.
The recovery has been a bit spotty and 1 month doesn't make a trend. But for us, China's decline and
then its recovery were both quite steep. Our current thinking about the U.S. and EU is that the decline will
be a bit shallower, but the recovery will be longer.

For us, orders declined earlier in the EU than in the U.S., but we also expect an early recovery. Orders in
1Q were down 10% in Europe, but were down 5% in the U.S., and that accelerated into April with Europe

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

down 30% and the U.S. down 25%. Based on a slower recovery in the EU and U.S. versus China, our
internal planning assumes recovery of orders to more typical levels as we get into later 3Q and early Q4.

So what does this all mean as we frame 2020? Turning to Slide 9. You could think of the numbers that
you see here as guideposts as we look at various scenarios playing out globally. We see sales between
$15 billion and $17 billion, adjusted op profit between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, and free cash flow over
$1 billion. Also, with respect to the scenarios behind the sales decline for the whole company, you should
think about the HVAC segment decline fairly aligned with the percentage range that you see here, with
Refrigeration facing a bit more headwind and F&S is expected to be a bit at the better end of the range.
Given that 80% of our sales are in the U.S. and Europe, we expect the steepest declines to occur in 2Q
with improvements from there. So we have done our best to analyze the rest of the year for ourselves and
for you, and we will continue to update you as this very fluid situation evolves. And though the coming
months are inherently uncertain, what I do know with great confidence is that we'll get through this crisis.
And over the long term, megatrends such as climate change, global urbanization and the shift towards
digitalization and operating in the new normal will remain tailwinds for our business. And this takes me to
our last page on Page 10.

We remain confident that the game plan that we laid out for you on February 10 will drive the results
that you see here. We are getting real traction on the 3 pillars of our top line strategy, which will propel
sustained mid-single-digit top line growth. We are tenaciously driving Carrier 600 to invest in growth
and to help drive margin expansion to enable high single-digit EPS growth on a steady state basis. And
we are laser-focused on driving working capital improvements needed to support free cash flow equal to
net income. We have a clear road map to success. We remain committed to executing on our plan with
urgency, conviction and effectiveness.
And with that, we'll open us up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just on kind of the bridge a bit. Thanks for the color on kind of the guidepost. The -- any kind of color on
price cost and what you kind of expect to run through what you're seeing out there for the year.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. On the price side, Steve, we're still looking at overall price tailwind, but it's going to be minor. It's
going to be in the range of $4 million. We actually saw $4 million in the first quarter. It's probably $20
million for the full year. Keep in mind, we're coming off a couple of years of a lot of price tailwind. It was
north of $200 million in 2018. It was closer to $175 million last year. But we do think there's going to be a
little bit more price challenges in the overall system, but we're still looking at some net tailwind from price.
And then Tim took you through the cost side, we're going to be very aggressive. You saw that we upped
our Carrier 600 for this year from $175 million to $225 million. We're being very aggressive, especially on
the supply chain side, where we got some tailwind from commodity pricing, but a lot of aggressiveness on
the negotiations and resourcing activity. And we're also certainly seeing a lot of headwind in the factory
productivity. But we are really going after G&A in this climate.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. And then just lastly on the balance sheet. A little bit better cash. I think that's an incremental
positive, but you're still going to end with some pretty high leverage. And I think there's a covenant out
there that you guys have. Can you just talk about what that covenant is and how -- kind of how much of a
hard line it may be, like how concerned should we be about that? And any actions you're willing to kind of
take in the intermediate term other than just generating cash to shore up the balance sheet.

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. This is Tim, Steve. So yes, we do have a covenant that covers both our revolving credit agreement
and our term loan. And it is -- I mean it's -- I think it's attached to the Form-10. You can see that it says
that it's first measured in our third quarter, at the end of our third quarter, and the covenant is 4x debt
to EBITDA. According to the projections that what you see in our scenario planning, we do anticipate
that we will be in compliance with the covenant at that point, and we're expecting that it only gets better
from there. We have some cushion. So we're not unduly concerned about that. But obviously, we want to
ensure that we have liquidity, and you can assume that we're taking actions to ensure that we have access
to that.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And what if you do breach it? Ultimately in the next several quarters, you're wrong in your
projections?

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

Let's just say we're going to make sure that we don't. I mean it would -- I mean obviously it would
preclude us from access to our revolving credit agreement, and it would put our term loan in some -- and
I guess in default, but we will assure that we're not going to run into that problem. We've already initiated

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

actions. You can be assured that we've already taken precautions. We're not going to put ourselves in
jeopardy.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Steve, it's Dave. First of all, it's net debt, that ForEx multiple. And also, like Tim said, behind the
scenes, we are working it. So I think we're in pretty good shape. We're managing it quite well.

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

I would point out further to what Dave just said, it's net debt. And as -- and EBITDA as adjusted. There
are some carve-out exceptions to it. So again, we're comfortably in compliance with it. But again, we want
to make sure.

Operator

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. So no big surprise that we're seeing CapEx getting cut in this environment and some of the
investment spending is pushing to the right. Can you maybe just talk about where you are down back a
little bit on the investment spending and the CapEx and whether we should think of this as more of a push
as opposed to a pull?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would say, Nigel, it's probably more of a push. We did scale back on investments like automation.
We're really focused on keeping the shops running. So to have industrial engineers in the shop, figuring
out how to implement automation is not ideal timing. So we did push some of our automation spend.
We are doing ERP consolidation. We pushed that to the right. So a lot of the discretionary actions like
that, that don't necessarily affect growth, we have pushed out. We've been pretty tenacious at preserving
investments that affect our growth agenda. So our view is that a kind of like outfielder, it's easier to run
forward than backward. We came out, we were aggressive. We saw what was happening. We've made the
right cuts to the budget. We'll see how the year progresses. If things open up a little bit. We'll pull some
of the investments we pushed out into next year, we'll pull back into this year. But we've really gone to
great lengths to preserve investments that have the highest paid -- payback that are going to protect our
growth agenda.

Great. And then you gave a number for new housing starts in the U.S., down 10% to 20%. And then you
talked about replacement demand being down. I struggle to think about how to think about replacements
in this environment given where unemployment is. What's your view right now on resi replacement?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean, look, it's probably down in the 15% range or so as we look at it. There were 3.8 million
Americans last month that did not pay their mortgages. So it's going to be a tough climate for at least a
while. But where there's demand, there's demand. And there may be a little bit of movement to a little
bit more parts buy for the next few months to replacement. We haven't actually seen that just yet. But
we do think there's going to be a little bit of a headwind on the replacement cycle. But we'll see as we get
into the summer months, if employment, of course, the numbers remain extremely challenging right now.

Timothy R. McLevish

No. The free cash flow is -- I mean it's free cash flow. It's traditionally -- it's operating cash flow, GAAP
operating cash flow plus capital expenditure -- or less of capital expenditures.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just a couple. First, just on the CapEx push, Dave. So it does sound like you're not doing anything
to damage the growth plans. But I would think this also then pushes out some of your underlying
productivity plans, right? So you're taking temporary actions to contain costs, but automation and ERP
was a big part of kind of future productivity. Can you just elaborate kind of on the interplay between those
factors?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Jeff. When you look at productivity, it was a key element, and it is a key element of Carrier 600.
But I will tell you that only a piece of that is automation. There's another piece that just comes from
really application of the Carrier operating system. So it will have a short-term impact. I actually think
what you're going to see with the new normal is you're going to see people leaning more forward on
automation as you get out into the end of this year and into future years. So look, we're going to free up
the investments on automation as we get towards the end of this year into next year because I think it's
going to be really critical to our overall story. We hadn't really baked ERP consolidations into our overall
cost savings number. So I don't see that impacting Carrier 600. It impacts overall productivity and some of
the manual nature of what we do. But we'll have to catch up to those investments next year.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And perhaps it's early to talk about a different number. But with this kind of acceleration, does -- is Carrier
600 on the path to being $700 million, $750 million, something like that?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Well, it is early. A couple of months doesn't make a trend. But look, I'm confident -- I've always been
confident in the Carrier 600 number, and I think there's room to overdrive it. But we'll see how the rest of
the year plays out, and we'll update that as we get out into the end of next -- in the end of this year.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And then just finally. So then on the dividend, we should expect that's kind of sort of on hold until you get
past this Q3 kind of covenant and make sure you've kind of cleared the decks there.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

I think that would be directionally fair, Jeff. You recall that back in our Investor Day that we said that
we would expect a $550 million dividend. We thought that was a competitive dividend in a normal
circumstance. Obviously, we're not under normal circumstances, and preservation of cash and addressing
our high leverage is high priority right now. And so we're deferring a little bit the decision and the level.
I mean, in this environment, we perhaps will or we likely will consider reducing that amount and still be
competitive from a yield standpoint, from a payout standpoint. But yes, you should anticipate to hear
something in the near future. But again, it's not likely to be at the same level that we talked about at
Investor Day.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just trying to stick to the one question rule. Perhaps focusing on margins for a second. So I think
at the midpoint of the scenario plan, you've got about maybe 25%, 30% decremental margin dialed in for
the year. Maybe just help us understand how you see the role of mix within that as transport refrigeration
probably one of the businesses that falls the fastest this year in sales terms. And then also related to that,
should we expect the decremental margins to be widest in the second quarter? Or you're assuming that
decrementals are pretty level over Q2 to Q4.

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, Julian, it's Tim. Say, as we -- as you know, we usually think of what we call it a drop-through rate
decremental. Usually, I like to think of it as incremental. But unfortunately, in this environment, we talk
about decrementals. That's about 28%. What you saw in the first quarter actually was much favorable to
that, but that was largely because we had the better part of 10 percentage points worth of benefit from
cost reduction in the quarter, about $40 million lower cost, and that contributed to a much lower drop-
through. And interestingly, our sales in China were hit during the quarter, the hardest of ours, and China
tends to carry lower general margins through, and we benefited by about 4%. So that's why you see the
14%. You actually may not see the 14%, you may see a 19%. But remember, we talked about a $24
million stand-alone cost. That's the first quarter component of the $107 million that you ultimately see for
the full year.

I will also point out that I think you may have seen from UTC's release yesterday numbers that are a little
bit different. They have about $20 million difference in profits. So if you adjust for that, there are some
unusual things where it was different from us to them, they may have -- you may have construed at 24%
from them.

As we think about the rest of the year, again, going back to the 28%. Yes, I would say second quarter is
likely to be the hardest hit quarter. And the deeper the drop in revenues, it makes it difficult. We aren't
just scaling back production. We're shutting the lines down. We're closing shifts. We're, in some cases,
closing factories and you go deeper in to the cost pool there. And I would expect that to be in the second
quarter. We will experience some mix degradation. The reverse of what you saw, I mean, some of our
higher-margin businesses, the residential HVAC and others will be hit. How I simply think about rest of
year decrementals, though, is that we have -- we'll be hit by 2 or 3 points with JV income because there's
no offsetting revenue component to the drop in earnings that we're anticipating. And then all other of the
cost, the factory disruption, et cetera, is largely covered -- that and the margin mix is covered by our cost
reduction. So we anticipate, if you look at the projections, we'll probably be about 30%, couple of points
worse than the normal 28%.

And let me also say congrats on the debut. I'm not sure anyone was expecting quite as a tough
environment as you've had to face in your debut here. But I appreciate all the color and all the actions
that you're taking.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Deane.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

If we can start, just -- we've heard the expression, this too will pass. Looking ahead, could you expand on
the comments or the examples you were giving on how the buildings of the future are going to change?
We've heard some similar comments from your competitors this earnings season about air purification,
touchless credentials and so forth. But are these just thoughts? Or are these actually starting discussions
with customers? How close are you to marketing and actually getting orders for this type of the new
normal buildings?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Well, thanks, Deane, for the question. Actually, it's absolutely underway. We've been in discussions, and
we've actually seen real progress with customers, whether it's the State of Florida or with hospitals where
we've distributed our new OptiClean negative air machines. We're coming out of the gates fast on this one
because we believe it's critical not only for our business, but it's critical for society. There are a shockingly
number -- high number of sick buildings out there. And one of the characteristics of a sick building is
the ventilation system. You look at the room I'm in right now, you would expect a certain number of air
changes per hour, say, in the 10 to 15 range. And many buildings around the world have stagnant air
and they don't have the number of changes per hour. You look at the filtration system in many buildings
as you have the return air going to through a filtration system, you'd expect it to be able to filter out
contaminants at a 0.1, 0.3 micron level, and many filtration systems don't have that. We have that with
our electric static filters for homes, UAV or HEPA filters in commercial buildings. Many buildings don't
have that. You want your ducts cleaned every 3 to 5 years, and that doesn't happen. So as we look at the
transition to healthy buildings, I think you should expect that Carrier is going to be front and center on
that. It's very real. And it's the same in our other 2 segments.

You mentioned touchless. In our Fire & Security business, we already have a BlueDiamond app that can
eliminate a lot of the touch points as, say, you go from your car to your office building, there's usually
8 to 10 touch points. And like I said in the earlier remarks, we can eliminate 80% of that as you go to
open the turnstile or you press the elevator button or you adjust the HVAC controls in your office or on
your floor. There's a number of touch points that we can eliminate that are going to be critical. And it
also is combined with the traceability element. So as employers want to be able in the workplace to trace
folks, we have an app that can co-mingle with the other parts of the app to be able to track people in the
workplace.

And the other segment that we have in our refrigeration business, the entire cold chain is going to be just
foundationally and fundamentally different. So you look at how people get their food today in a place like
China, and there's a significant number of wet markets, and we have farmers' markets here in the U.S.
and in Europe. But you're going to see a lot more home delivery of goods. The cold chain is going to be
critical for that and pharmaceuticals, and we're working on some telematics and other what we believe to
be quite cutting-edge innovative solutions to really connect the entire cold chain. So we think we can play
a real pivotal role in the new normal.

Appreciate all that color. And just a quick clarification from Tim, if I could. Just with regard to capital
allocation and cash preservation, the expectation was that Carrier was going to have investment-grade
rating with the expectation you'd be paying down debt. So what's the outlook in your discussions with the
rating agencies? Are they giving you some leeway here in terms of the path of deleveraging?

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

Well, it's still our intention to maintain investment grade. We have been in conversations with the
agencies. As I said, we're -- they recognize that short-term liquidity is critically important in this crisis
situation with the uncertainty about the economy. We've been in regular discussions with them and I think
they are supportive of our game plan. And I think we'll be just fine.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Dave, I just -- I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the portfolio. I mean these sorts of
discontinuities and changes have a tendency to make you kind of think about the business in different
ways. And I know the sort of optionality around the long-term appearance of the business is something
you thought about. You kind of mentioned tangentially at the Investor Day. I wonder how this whole crisis
may be changing that thinking, if at all.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Carter, what I'd tell you is that what we said at Investor Day remains consistent today, that our #1
priority is on execution. We really feel very strongly that we can unleash tremendous value just by doing
what we said we were going to do. As we get sales consistently in mid-single-digit range and we get EPS
at the high single-digit rate, and we get cash flow about equal to net income.

We know that, that consistent track record of performance will have a significant impact on the overall
valuation of Carrier, and then we're playing from a position of strength. So our #1 priority is focus on
execution. Our #2 priority is to really take a very dispassionate look at our current portfolio. And of
course, we've been doing that since for quite some time. And we said that we would put our current
portfolio through a very specific set of criteria. Are we the rightful owner? Does it strategically fit? Does it
meet the financial criteria that we've set out for ourselves? And if it doesn't, we'll be dispassionate and do
the right thing about divesting those parts of the portfolio. I think once you make that decision, you will,
of course, have to look at the current environment and decide if you're going to do something like that,
when would be the right time. And this is not the ideal time to do something like that. But we'll look at the
right time if there are parts of the portfolio that we decide don't meet the criteria that we've set.

And then in terms of that third category, overall, more strategic types of transactions. That is not our
priority right now. We know that our peers have made themselves more pure plays, as have we. But our
focus right now is on that first category of execution and on the second category of the real portfolio
analysis that we've been going through. And we'll deal with that second.

Carter Copeland

Yes. Carter, it's Dave. Container orders have actually been pretty steady. So we're going to see how things
play out. But when we look at overall container orders, and there's been a couple of months where it's
been positive, a couple of months where it's been negative. Overall, Q1 was down 7%, I believe. When we
got into April, it was positive. So on balance, it's probably flat to down just low single digits right now.

Our next question or comment comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I understand we've covered a lot of ground here already and appreciate the color. I guess in regards
to some of the cost actions in Carrier 600, how do we think about operating leverage on the way out?
Tim, you talked about kind of the 28% target number. Obviously, a lot of things moving around, some
temporary, some pull forward of the total. How should we think about exit rate, incrementals being above
or below that target number just as some of these temporary costs come back?

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, I would generally -- again, a lot of the recovery from a higher decremental came from the cost
actions that we identified as kind of a this year impact. Again, Carrier 600 is kind of separate from that.
We took these to offset the higher decrementals with the disruption and so forth. So I would expect that
we should be coming out of this as we increment back up at a similar rate, 28%, give or take 1% or 2%.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just related to that, I guess, supply chain was a part of Carrier 600.
Obviously, everyone's taking a harder look at their supply chain today with some of the interruptions.
Anything that changes with respect to that or needs to be reshuffled?

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

No, when you think about supply chain, we've talked about, about 55% of the savings will come from
supply chain, and we're still on that level. It's going well. Remember, David said there's probably 6,000
suppliers and we're going to consolidate and probably cut it in half. As we become more meaningful, we're
able to partner better, we get some better pricing, we get some better terms. That's a big component of it,
and that's tracking very well.

Congrats on the first quarter. I'm curious when you look at the commercial HVAC and Fire & Security
backlogs, what do you perceive to be kind of at-risk perhaps serving industries that are going to be kind of
very hard hit by the recession, so whether it's hospitality or what have you. Just could you give us some
framework on parts of the backlog that might stretch for an extended period, even when you have site
access again? Any sort of framework for that?

David L. Gitlin

Thanks, Gautam. This is Dave. The one piece of good news is that our sequential backlog in the first
quarter was up. It was up about 6% in HVAC and about 1/3 of that in resi and 2/3 in commercial HVAC.
So the backlog position did improve in the first quarter. We look at -- to the extent that there's any shift

from the left to the right, it's really -- we think it's going to be relatively minor. We're talking a month
here and there. We feel that there are some construction sites that are -- once they come back on, there's
going to be really some pent-up demand.

What we -- our experience in China was this, was that after folks came back from the Lunar New Year, that
was factories were allowed to open February 10. Basically, all of our factories, they were generally online
as you got into that February 20 time frame. And we started -- we had the backlog and we started to
ship the backlog. What followed was a lot of the construction sites that had the migrant workers in China,
they were quarantined a little bit longer. And then they started to receive the backlog. And then that was
followed by new orders ticking up as we got into April. And we think it will be a similar phenomenon is
that as the construction sites come back on-site -- back online in the U.S. and Europe, they'll start to take
delivery of the backlog. There may be some pushout a month here or there. But frankly, some of -- some
places like universities or education has been taking this opportunity with folks out to actually accelerate
some of the construction. So some is being accelerated. Some will naturally get pushed out. But where it
gets pushed out, we're talking maybe weeks or a month or 2 here. It's not going to be significant.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And just a follow-up for Tim. Could you actually disaggregate the $425 million of cost into structural
versus variable? I don't know if you said that in the opening remarks, but...

Timothy R. McLevish
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. So I just go down on the chart of the $425 million. The Carrier 600 and the $50 million incremental
will be a structural. That will be enduring. The investment, if you recall, we said that our investment this
year originally was going to be $150 million. We expected it to scale back to an incremental $100 million
next year and then $50 million before we will go back to normal. This $75 million that we pulled out will
be pushed in, likely invested next year, so we'll kind of push out that schedule a little bit. And the $300
million is really onetime actions. It was furloughing most -- all of our salaried employees. It was deferring
merit. It was cutting back on. Obviously, it wasn't hard to cut back on travel because there isn't any travel
anyway, but it's reducing services, supplies, et cetera. That will likely -- I mean it won't be caught up, but
it will be -- it's not a structural change. It will come back.

We have time for one final question. Our last question will be from the line of Vlad Bystricky from
Citigroup.

Vladimir Benjamin Bystricky
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Can you talk about -- within the Fire & Security business, just how much of the overall business is driven
by regulatory or statutory requirements and should, therefore, be more resilient? And can you also
talk about in that business, what restrictions on building access and social distancing measures could
potentially mean for productivity in the field business?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. We look at -- there's a piece of the fire portfolio you think -- fire's a much
bigger piece than the security piece. And there's a piece of the fire that's regulatory in nature. If you look
at -- we look at the Fire & Security portfolio in 2 aspects. There's the products piece and then there's
the Chubb piece. Products is about 60%, Chubb is about 40%. Within the 40% that's Chubb, you have
a monitoring and installation and a services piece. And the services piece is where you do see some
regulatory, and that has generally held up during this downturn better than the installation piece, which
got hit pretty hard in the March time frame into April, especially in Europe.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

On the product side, some of our businesses like Edwards, that's held up quite well because there is a
regulatory piece of that. And we've actually seen -- we actually saw growth increases in parts of our
Edwards business and others that, like GST, where we have a regulatory piece in China. Some of the
security portfolio is less regulatory in nature. But what's interesting there is we are starting to see a lot
more demand for some of our products that are going to be critical in this new normal. So as hotels start
to think about how they're going to gear up in the new normal, we're in discussions with a number of
them with our Onity system, where folks can bypass the front desk, go directly to their room and use
more touchless type applications. We're seeing that with real estate brokers for our Supra business. So
even though it's not regulatory, some parts of the security portfolio could be quite compelling in the new
normal. And we're in some pretty interesting discussions as folks -- as some of our key customers gear up
for the new normal.

Vladimir Benjamin Bystricky
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay . That's very helpful. And then just maybe one last one for me. I know the order information you
gave was very helpful. I guess just going forward, the U.S. and EMEA were actually pretty similar in April.
So as we go through the year, do you expect the U.S. and EMEA to continue sort of trending in similar
directions? Or are there differences in the COVID-19 responses and protocols that could push for more
divergence amongst those 2 regions?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Quite honestly, it's hard to say because it's even hard to generalize the U.S., and it's hard to generalize
Europe. When we look at Europe, Germany has been coming on back online quite well recently. We see
the automotive manufacturers coming back. We feel good about Germany. Spain and Italy have been
coming back online over the last 2 to 3 weeks in a fairly positive way. France is more delayed. 80% of the
construction sites in France are still not operational. So I think France will be lagging, and probably the
U.K. lagging behind Germany and some of the others. And you're probably going to see a bit of a mixed
bag in the United States as different states come online at different times. I think if you were to compare
the 2, our experience so far over the last few months is that the U.S. has generally been 3 to 4 weeks
behind Europe in terms of on the way down and on the way back up.
