KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder,
this conference is being recorded.

I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Chris Gorman. Please go ahead, sir.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, John, and good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference
Call. Joining me for the call today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief
Risk Officer.

Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our
presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.

This morning, Key reported record revenue and earnings. But before we get into the details of the quarter,
I want to share a couple of broader and contextual comments. I am very proud of the way our team
continues to navigate the pandemic and related economic downturn. Their dedication, combined with our
investments in talent and digital capabilities, continue to serve the company, our clients, our communities
and our shareholders well. Throughout 2020, we successfully executed what I call our dual mandate.
By that I mean responding to the pandemic, which is a real humanitarian and economic crisis, while
continuing to position Key for both growth and success.

We have taken countless steps to ensure that our teammates and our clients are both safe and well
served. Additionally, we provided billions of dollars in credit to our clients. In 2020, we originated more
than 43,000 loans amounting to $8 billion through the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. In
fact, we are currently assisting our clients through the second round of the Paycheck Protection Program
as we speak.

As part of our National Community Benefits Plan, we provided billions of dollars in support to our
communities. This included affordable housing, home lending and small business lending in low- and
moderate-income communities, transformative philanthropy and renewable energy financing. Our
commitment also includes programs to advance social justice and economic inclusion across all the
communities we serve. And finally, I want to thank our teammates for rising to every challenge in 2020 in
a way that kept our clients at the center of everything we do.

I am now turning to Slide 3. Getting back to our performance in the fourth quarter, we achieved a record
level of revenue for both the quarter and the year, the growth in net interest income and fee income. Net
interest income was up almost 4% from the prior quarter with an 8 basis point increase in our net interest
margin. Fee income, also a record, up double digits for both the prior quarter and the year ago period.
We continue to benefit from investments that we have made across our company, which drove both fee
income and balance sheet growth.

Let me touch on 3 specific areas. First, consumer mortgage. We achieved record volume in the fourth
quarter with $2.5 billion in funded loans. For the full year, our consumer mortgage originations were $8.3
billion, up 90% from the prior year. This drove both balance sheet growth as well as a 179% increase
in fee income. Approximately 1/2 of our originations last year were purchase mortgages. Our pipelines
remain strong, and we expect to continue to both grow and take share.

The second area I will highlight is investment banking. This is an area where we have invested in
talent and made targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities, including areas such as health care
and technology. In the fourth quarter, we generated $243 million in fees, which represents a record
quarter. We enjoyed broad-based growth across the platform, with particular strength in M&A and loan
syndications. 2020 was a record year for investment banking and debt placement fees. Our investment

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

banking pipelines remain strong. We believe this business will continue to be a growth engine for us in the
future.

The third area is Laurel Road and, more broadly, the investments we have made in digital across our
company. Laurel Road continues to originate high-quality loans that provide us with an opportunity
to build broader digital relationships with health care professionals. Last year, Laurel Road originated
over $2.3 billion in loans. At the end of March, we will launch our digital bank serving the health care
segment, expanding our consumer franchise nationally. This launch will broaden our offering for Laurel
Road clients to include deposits, additional lending products and other value-added services. We believe
that both Laurel Road and consumer mortgage will continue to be relationship-based growth engines for
our consumer business.

Our expenses this quarter were elevated. They were elevated due to higher production-related incentives,
severance and the funding of our philanthropic foundation. Additionally, COVID-related expenses and costs
associated with our prepaid card also remained elevated again this quarter. Don will cover the outlook in
his remarks, but we expect expenses to come down in 2021, while concurrently investing in talent and
digital capabilities.

This year, we will also be accelerating the pace of branch closures. We expect to consolidate over 70
branches, representing 7% of our network. Most of these closures taking place in the first half of the year.
Our decisions are driven by client behavior as more activity continues to move toward digital channels,
it's also informed by our robust analytics. We expect limited client attrition as a high percentage of the
impacted branches are located within 2 miles of another Key facility.

Importantly, we expect to continue to grow our retail business, while reducing operating expenses and
improving overall profitability. Credit quality remained strong this quarter, with net charge-offs of 53 basis
points, within our targeted over the cycle range. Additionally, nonperforming loans declined by almost $50
million this quarter. We will continue to support our clients, while maintaining our moderate risk profile and
concurrently positioning the company to perform well through the business cycle.

Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position, while continuing to return capital to our
shareholders. In the fourth quarter, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 30 basis points to 9.8%,
which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. The results of our recent stress tests affirmed that Key
is a different company today, with loss rates and loss-absorbing capital among the best in our peer group.

Our strategic positioning allows us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, supporting
organic growth, paying dividends and, of course, share repurchases. Last week, our Board of Directors
authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $900 million over the next 3 quarters. We also
approved our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.185 a share.

In closing, despite the challenging environment of the last year, we were able to support our clients,
invest in and grow our businesses, while maintaining our strong risk practices. Our success was driven
by our dedicated team, the strength of our business model and our relentless focus on executing our
strategy. I am confident in Key's future. We are positioned to succeed and continue to deliver on all of our
commitments.

I will now turn it over to Don, who will provide details on our quarter in addition to our outlook for the
coming year. Don?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on Slide 5. As Chris said, it was a very strong quarter for us, with record net
income from continuing operations of $0.56 per common share, up 37% from prior quarter and 24%
from the prior year ago period. Return on average tangible common equity for the quarter was over
16%, up over 400 basis points from the third quarter. I will cover the other items on this slide later in my
presentation.

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

Turning to Slide 6. Total average loans were $102 billion, up 9% from the fourth quarter of last year,
driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans reflect an increase of
over $7.5 billion from the PPP loans. Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel
Road and, as Chris mentioned, strong performance from our consumer mortgage business. Laurel Road
originated $590 million of loans this quarter and $2.3 billion for the full year, up over 20% from the full
year 2019.

We also generated another record $2.5 billion of consumer mortgage loans in the quarter, bringing the
total for the year to $8.3 billion. The investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results
and, importantly, add high-quality loans to our portfolio.

Linked quarter average loan balances were down 3%, reflecting paydowns from the heightened
commercial loan draws as well as a small reduction in PPP balances related to initial forgiveness. Line
utilization rates are at the prepandemic levels given the strong liquidity levels in the environment.
Importantly, we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and have walked away from
business that does not meet our moderate risk profile. We remain committed to performing well through
the business cycle, and we manage our credit quality with this longer-term perspective.

Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $136 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, up $23
billion or 21% compared to the year ago period and up 0.6% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter
increase reflected broad-based commercial growth as well as growth from our -- from higher consumer
balances. The growth was offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. Growth from the
prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients. Total interest-bearing deposit costs
came down 11 basis points from the third quarter of 2020, exceeding our guidance of a 6 to 9 basis point
decline. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for
over 60% of the total deposit mix.

Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.043 billion for the fourth quarter of
2020 compared to $987 million a year ago and just over $1 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest
margin was 2.70% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2.98% for the same period last year
and 2.62% from the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully
impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger
balance sheet benefited net interest income, but reduced the net interest margin due to significant
increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows.

Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $37 million, and the margin improved by 8
basis points. The increase in both net interest income and the net interest margin quarter-over-quarter
are largely due to the lower interest-bearing deposit cost and the higher loan fees from PPP forgiveness.
We saw the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declined 11 basis points from the prior quarter.
The forgiveness of the PPP loans accelerated about $28 million of additional fee recognition this quarter.
These were partially offset by continued elevated liquidity levels, which had a 5 basis point negative
impact on the margin.

Moving to Slide 9. Our fee-based businesses hit all-time highs in the fourth quarter. Noninterest income
was $802 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $651 million for the year ago period and
$681 million for the third quarter. Compared to the year ago period, noninterest income increased $151
million. The primary driver was a record quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which
reached $243 million, up $62 million from the year ago period. Stronger M&A and loan syndication fees
drove most of the increase this quarter. This business also had a record year with $661 million of total
fees.

Record mortgage originations drove consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $22 million from
the fourth quarter of '19. Cards and payments income also increased $30 million related to higher prepaid
card activity from the state government support programs. Compared to the third quarter, noninterest
income increased by $121 million. The largest driver of the quarterly increase was once again the record
quarter for investment banking, which was up $97 million. Commercial mortgage servicing fees also had a
strong quarter, up $14 million.

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

I'm now turning to Slide 11 -- excuse me, Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was
$1.128 billion compared to $980 million last year and $1.037 billion in the prior quarter. The increase
from the prior year is primarily in personnel costs driven by higher production-related incentives from
our record fee production as well as higher severance costs. Year-over-year, payments-related costs
reported and other expense were $40 million higher driven by higher prepaid activity, and we incurred
COVID-19-related expenses to ensure the health and safety of our teammates. Compared to the prior
quarter, noninterest expense increased $91 million. The increase was largely due to $40 million of higher
production-related incentives, $22 million of severance, $12 million of higher stock-based compensation
related to the share price and a $15 million additional contribution to our charitable foundation. Marketing
expense was also up $8 million from the prior quarter.

Turning to Slide 11. Overall, credit quality remains strong. For the fourth quarter, net charge-offs were
$135 million or 53 basis points of average loans, slightly below our guidance range. Our provision for
credit losses was $20 million. This was determined under the CECL methodology and based on our
continued strong credit metrics and leading indicators as well as our outlook for the overall economy,
credit migration and loan production.

Nonperforming loans were $785 million this quarter or 78 basis points of period-end loans compared to
$834 million or 81 basis points from the prior quarter. Additionally, 30- to 89-day delinquencies actually
improved quarter-over-quarter with a 9 basis point decrease, while the 90-day plus category remained
relatively flat. We've continued to monitor the level of assistance requests we receive from our customers.
Over the past quarter, the number of requests for loan forbearance have decreased dramatically. As of
December 31, loans subject to forbearance terms were less than $600 million, down from a peak of $5.2
billion, equating to about 0.5% of our outstanding balances.

One more observation this quarter, and as Chris mentioned earlier, in late December, the results of the
most recent stress test results were published. Key's results reinforce the commitments we have been
making over the past several years that we are a different company with a better risk profile than Key
showed through The Great Recession. Our stress credit losses for the -- from the test were peer leading.
We've been managing the company over the last decade to outperform during challenging times and
believe we have positioned the company to achieve this.

Turning to Slide 12. We updated our disclosure that highlights certain portfolios that are receiving greater
focus in this environment. These areas represent a small percentage of the total loan balances. Each
relationship in these focus areas continues to be subject to active reviews and enhance monitoring.
Importantly, as a group, they continue to perform consistent with our expectations.

Now on to Slide 13. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the fourth quarter with
a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, up 30 basis points from 9.5% in the third quarter. This places us
above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with a sufficient capacity to continue to support
our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, the results
of the recent stress test support and highlight our strong credit profile and loss-absorbing capital.

Last week, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $900 million for
the next 3 quarters. They also approved our first quarter 2021 common dividend of $0.185 per share.

On Slide 14, we've provided our full year 2021 outlook. This builds on our performance in 2020 and
reflects our expectation that we will deliver positive operating leverage for the year. Guidance range
definitions are provided at the bottom of the slide. Average loans are expected to be relatively stable.
Although at this point, I would expect a little downward bias to this range. This reflects participation in
the next round of PPP and continued growth in our consumer loan portfolio from both Laurel Road and
our consumer mortgage business. We expect deposits to be up low single digits, and we will continue to
benefit from our low-cost deposit base. Net interest income should be relatively stable. Our net interest
income will benefit from our higher loan fees related to PPP forgiveness and continued deployment of
some of the excess liquidity, offset by the ongoing impact of low rates.

Noninterest income should be up low single digits, reflecting growth in most of our core fee-based
businesses. As Chris mentioned, noninterest expense should be down in 2021, somewhere in the low

single-digit range. We will continue to benefit from our continuous improvement efforts and accelerate
our branch closures. We also plan to continue to invest in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital
offerings.

Moving on to credit quality. Net charge-offs to average loans should be in the 50 to 60 basis point range,
which is consistent with our through the cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points. And our guidance for our
GAAP tax rate should be around 19% for the year. Our guidance also assumes some variability over the
course of the year. First quarter will reflect normal seasonality, including a lower day count and an increase
in personnel expense driven by heightened employee benefit costs.

Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets. As Chris said, we expect to deliver
positive operating leverage for 2021. We also maintain our moderate risk profile, and over time, continue
to improve our efficiency and overall returns. I'll close with where Chris started, recognizing the effort
of our team to support our clients and to deliver strong results for both the quarter and the year despite
the challenging environment. We are well positioned as we head into 2021 and plan to deliver on our
commitments to all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just curious, I guess I can infer it from the up low single-digit guide on fees, but I was hoping you could
provide a little more thoughts on your outlook for investment banking. It ended up being just a terrific end
to the year. But maybe thoughts on how you see the year playing out just in terms of the nuance. I feel
like last year, it was kind of less traditional M&A sort of other drivers within investment banking or that
line item that drove it. Whereas this year, maybe it's more the traditional stuff that we would think of. How
do you see it planning out? And do you think you can sustain this level or grow upon this level of annual
revenues in total there?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, Scott. Well, thanks for the question. Just to step back for a second. Our integrated corporate and
investment bank is a unique in growing franchise. It's unique among all of our peers. It's really hard both
to coordinate and collaborate and get it done from a cultural perspective. And as you know, Scott, we've
been at it for a long time. And we've made a bunch of significant investments.

If you think about the investments we've made in technology and in health care, within any year,
there's always variability. But as we step back and look at that business over the past 5 years, it's had
a compound annual growth rate of about 8%. And so -- and if you look at from 2015 to present, I think
we've had 1 year, where we were down slightly. I think last year, we were down like 3%. So I'm just giving
you that as kind of a backdrop as we look forward.

There's no question that it's the transaction business, and there's a lot of variables that clearly are not
within our control. Having said that, for us, it's a relationship business, we continue to grow it. Our
pipelines today are strong. Our pipelines are in good shape. What's interesting about our business is
whereas a lot of people had a huge lift from investment-grade debt through the pandemic, that really is
not core to our business. Our business was really driven, Scott, by a big surge in M&A and syndications, in
some cases, related syndications. So we feel good about the trajectory of the business, and we'll continue
to invest in it.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Terrific. And then, I guess, more of a ticky-tack guidance question in expenses. I know you had the $22
million in severance cost in the fourth quarter. Will there be any further charges? Or did you sort of take
care of all of those in the fourth quarter? And if there are any, are those included in the full year '21
guide?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

We would typically have some severance throughout the year. We would not expect to have any of that
size going forward into the -- each of the quarters in 2021. So the normal recurring level would be
reflected in that guidance, but not assuming any significant charges on top of that.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to ask about loan yields. Although there were some quarters of relative stability in Key's loan
yields during the last ZIRP cycle, the overall trajectory of loan yields was lower until we exited ZIRP.
I believe you guys have about 70% of your loan book is indexed to the short end of the interest rate
complex. And so a lot of it's repriced already, but there's still some. That dynamic happened not just for
you guys, but for other banks as well. So can you discuss whether you expect downward pressure on
loan yields to persist in this ZIRP cycle as well? And are you simply going to work through to offset those
headwinds? And in general, is there anything, I guess, different about this cycle that leads you to expect
those dynamics to play out any differently at this time?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sure. A couple of things there. One, on the loan book that -- keep in mind that a significant portion of the
swaps that we enter into from a balance sheet perspective are matched up against the commercial loan
book. And so it does convert some of those over to fixed rates and we've talked over the last couple of
quarters about the impact of those swaps going forward. And so you will see some very modest pressure
on yields coming from that as those swaps roll over.

On the consumer book, we are seeing rates coming down as far as the new originations compared to what
was the existing book, but we're also seeing improved credit quality for those new originations. And we're
also seeing margins a little wider on the consumer originations compared to the current rate environment
than where we've been historically. And so that will also help.

And so there will be some pressure going forward, but I would say that we still have other levers to help
offset that, including the full year benefit of the repricing of our deposit book that we realized in the fourth
quarter. And then also just this excess liquidity position, we think, over time, we can start to absorb some
of that and maybe reinvest that over time as well.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. That's super helpful. Maybe along with similar lines, can you talk about PPP? How much PPP
contributed to loan yields this quarter? And how we should expect that contribution to loan yields and NII
to trend from here? Maybe any color on how long the benefits of PPP, 1.0 and 2.0 are going to last just
largely through the rest of '21 or do they extend to '22? And that's my last question.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

That's great. And we've mentioned just briefly that in the fourth quarter, we had about $1.3 billion of the
PPP loans becomes forgiven. And so that accelerated about $28 million of fee income for the quarter. And
so that roughly added about 6 basis points or so as far as the overall margin. And so that clearly was
additive.

If you look at that first wave of PPP loans, we had about $8 billion of issuance, that as I mentioned, we
had about $1.3 billion of forgiveness this quarter and so that puts about $6.7 billion. We would expect
about 80% of that initial $8 billion to be forgiven. And so you'll see that come throughout the rest of the
year. I would say that, for example, we would expect about $1 billion of forgiveness in the first quarter.
And so that's a little less than what we would have seen in the fourth quarter, but still continue to show
that kind of a pace.

The next wave of PPP will be helpful for that, and we would expect to see about $2.5 billion of originations
in the second quarter. And so some of that decline that we would be expecting from that forgiveness
will be directly offset by the new originations, and we'll probably start the end of the first quarter with
balances of over $8 billion. And so I think that is helpful as far as just the perspective there.

As far as the fee income component to it, that if you look at both the normal accretion of the fee income
plus the acceleration coming from the forgiveness, that was about $110 million of fee income for 2020.

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

We would expect for the first wave of those $8 billion of loans, that number would be up to around $120
million or so as far as the fee income from both normal accretion and also the impact of forgiveness. And
so we have a little bit of a lift on a year-over-year basis from that. And then on top of that, we would
have the benefit from the new wave 2 of the PPP program coming through with loan yields and fee income
realization from those credits as well.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

So the vast majority by the end of '21 should be realized? Or does it kick spill over into '22?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I would say that the vast majority of the first wave will clearly be addressed in 2021. We'll probably see
some of this next wave continue to hang over into 2022 as well. And so I would say that, that incremental
lift that we're getting from that will be realized in both 2021 and 2022.

Operator

Next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Don, just to follow up on that last point. So all of that, when you just ran through on PPP is inside your NII
guidance for this year?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

That's correct, yes.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then secondly, just on the loans, I heard your point earlier about some of the moving
parts. And can you just reconfirm for us just how much do you think Laurel Road can do this year? And
how much more the mortgage business can grow as an offset to the planned runoff in the auto portfolio
on the consumer side?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sure, Ken, that as far as consumer loans that relatively stable outlook for total loans would assume,
consumer loans in aggregate grow about $2 billion and -- from 2020 to 2021. And that growth really
coming from both residential mortgage and from Laurel Road. Just to put that in perspective, we had
almost $600 million of originations from Laurel Road in the fourth quarter. Just continuing at that pace
would be in the $2.5 billion type of range as far as 2021 originations from that category.

On the residential mortgage side that despite what we're seeing and hearing in the industry that we think
that we can actually show stable to maybe even increasing our overall residential mortgage originations
in 2021. But keep in mind that we are at the early stages as far as rolling out that platform throughout
our branch network, seeing strong growth there. And of that $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and of the
$8.3 billion for the full year, about half of that was for purchase money as opposed to refinance. And so
we think there still will be opportunities to continue to show growth there. And that's adding over $1
billion a quarter as far as the new loan originations in the residential mortgage side. And so that consumer
growth in those 2 areas specifically are at the foundation of how we can get to that kind of relatively
stable outlook for total loans.

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just a follow-up on expenses. Given the plan for expense to be overall flat, I'm just
wondering, you've got some variability in the investment banking stuff, but just in terms of the cadence of
it, given the plans to reduce branches and the severance-related benefits that you get over time, is there
any way to understand like the cadence of how expenses traject through the year? Whether or not you're
ending lower than you're starting, that type of thing?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Great question. And I think you hit on some of the challenges there, which is that a number of our drivers
of our revenue growth really have a variable cost component to it as far as the origination. And so that's
a little bit of a challenge. I would say that as we look going into the first quarter, we would tend to have
some seasonality in those numbers, and we highlighted a little bit as far as the benefit expense being
up in the first quarter. We would expect expenses down considerably from where they were in the fourth
quarter, but probably up from what we would have seen last year.

Last year, our revenue outlook was negatively impacted by some market valuation adjustments that also
had a corresponding adjustment to our incentive compensation. And so we think that we'll be in a position
to generate positive operating leverage for the first quarter and have positive operating leverage for the
full year. And I just want to restate that as far as our expense outlook, we are saying it's down low single
digits, so down 1% to 3% as opposed to stable. And so that's after funding the investments we're making
as part of our strategic initiatives as well.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Saul Martinez with UBS.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I just wanted to back up a little just to make sure I understand the mechanics on the PPP dynamics
through net interest income. So on the -- there's an incremental, I guess, $10 million, so pretty modest
on the first waves of PPP. And then on top of that, you overlay the second round, which I think you said
was $2.5 billion. So if we were to adding that second round and obviously recognizing that these are 5
years and the fee rates might be lower, I mean, how much of an incremental lift is that from the second
round? Are we talking -- it seems like a modest number, but would be talking in the neighborhood of
something like $10 million a quarter? If you could just kind of help us square away sort of the full year and
connect the dots fully on the full year '21 versus the full year '20 tailwind that you get more broadly from
PPP?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sure, Ken (sic) [ Saul ]. As far as the impact of that second wave, we talked about $2.5 billion in the first
quarter. I would say that the full year average probably will be somewhere around $3 billion related to
that next wave of the PPP loans. If you look at both the stated coupon on those loans and the realization
of the fee income, it tends to be something a little north of 2% type of yield. So you pick up over 200
basis points on those balances through the year. So you're probably looking at something for the full year,
somewhere around $60 million kind of a lift from that compared to just having to sit in cash.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So we should think about the tailwind then just '21 versus '20 from PPP more broadly, being sort of that
$60 million plus the incremental $10 million of $120 million versus $110 million, so something in the
neighborhood of $70 million. Is that a fair way of looking at it?

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Well, what I would say is that for the fee income, we had $110 million in 2020. For the first wave, that's
about $120 million for that first wave of loans and then this new origination volume of the roughly $3
billion for average would be on top of that. And so we'll actually see a lift year-over-year of, say, $70
million would be a ballpark.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. And that is -- that's embedded in your guidance, obviously.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

That is embedded in our guidance. That's correct, yes.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

How much of a headwind is the roll-off of the hedges in 2021? Do you have that figure? How much of that
goes the other way? And -- because I presume that those hedge roll-offs and the incremental headwind is
also embedded in your guidance.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

The headwind is embedded in the guidance. I don't have the dollar amount for 2021 as far as the direct
impact there. But it is reflected in that outlook.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Do you know offhand how much hedge benefit you got this quarter from the swaps?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

From the swaps, when you say benefit, I'm reluctant to know what that is because it is part of our true
hedging strategy. And so as far as the cash flow swaps, the net interest income add to us for those cash
flows swaps is about $90 million, which is down about $5 million -- excuse me, about $4 million from the
previous quarter.

Operator

And next we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Don, can you share with us, when you look at the allowance for loan losses, currently based on your
slides, excluding the PPP loans, it looks like you're at about 193 basis points. And at the start of the year
when all of you and your peers had to convert over to the CECL reserving, I think your reserves are about
122 basis points. As we look further out, maybe end of '22, what do you think the reserve levels could
get to? Do you think they could get back down to where they were in January of this year before the
pandemic?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I think we could see trends in that direction. I don't know the absolute timing of that. I don't know how
to predict where the economic outlook will shift over time. But I would say as we go into 2021, that the

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

3 pieces that impact our provision expense under CECL are: one, the economic outlook. And so assuming
that's stable with what we would have predicted, won't see any impact there.

Credit migration has been a positive for us. And each quarter, as we take a look at what our projected
credit losses are, that trend continues to get better. And so that's allowing for reductions to the provision
compared to normal.

And then the third piece is for loan production. I mentioned on the call a couple of times in the last few
quarters is that provision each quarter would be in that $80 million to $100 million range. And so if the
economic outlook doesn't change and if the migration is consistent with expectations, that would imply
about a $90 million per quarter provision expense on average and about $360 million for the year, which
would be below what that charge-off guidance would imply. And so we would expect to see that allowance
ratio come down over time and could have some opportunity to see that come down more quickly if we
continue to see the credit migration outperform like we have.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Very good. And Chris, a bigger question for you or a bigger picture. Obviously, Key and your peers are
positioned to really benefit from a recovery in the U.S. economy coming hopefully this year as the vaccines
are more widespread over the summer -- by the summertime. The stock shares included since the Pfizer
announcement in November have had a real strong run here. And so everything is shaping out good.
And as you pointed out, your fourth quarter investment banking numbers were blockbuster. When you
go home at night and you go down the elevator, what are the risks that you think about since things are
shaping up pretty good for you and your peers as we look out over the next 12 months?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Gerard, I think for our entire industry, the #1 risk is cyber. I think we're in the trust business. And to
the extent there was a significant breach in the industry or of any particular company, I think that is -- I
think that's the #1 risk. The #2 risk, I think that we all need to focus on are just a whole another cadre
of competitors. If you think about a lot of the fintechs and you think about what some of those companies
have been able to do in terms of garnering new clients, I think that is a strategic risk.

Kind of more tactically, we think about sort of the key areas where I think you could see significant
degradation in asset values and, fortunately, we're well positioned here. But I think obvious ones are
travel and entertainment. I think that's -- as you point out, I think that, that will come back because I
think the vaccine has a lot to do with that. I think hospitality industry is one that you need to focus on.
The other couple of areas, and as you know, we've been out of them by strategy is both retail and office.
I think those are areas that, as an industry, we need to keep a close eye on. So those are kind of starting
with sort of strategic down to tactical, what I think about.

Operator

Next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

My first question -- I'm sorry for another question on your net interest income outlook. But I'm wondering
if you could give us a sense on what level of cash deployment or what level of investment securities
growth you would expect for 2021. And maybe this next one is for Chris. Embedded in that net interest
income outlook, how do you see core commercial loans ex PPP trending throughout the year within your
guidance? It seems like a lot of your peers have been quite optimistic, surprising the market on loan
growth recovery, particularly in the second half of the year.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

Sure. As far as the outlook for net interest income and some of the assumptions we have there for the
reinvestment, in the fourth quarter, we increased our core investment portfolio by about $3 billion. And
that was investing at a faster pace than the runoff. And I would -- and our outlook would have some of
that same type of pace continuing throughout the current year that we're currently sitting on over $14
billion in cash and about $2 billion in T-bills that we think would be available for us to continue to redeploy
either through loan growth or through reinvestment. And so that would be the core assumption that we
have there.

Just on that component that for the roughly $6 billion that we invested this quarter, the average
reinvestment yield was about 1.28%, so down from what the runoff level would be. But reflected some
of the strategy as far as investing in certain securities and then swapping them back so that, say, 5 years
down the road, those fixed rate securities would convert over to floating rate. So our expectation would be
to continue that kind of a strategy going forward.

Chris, on commercial loan growth?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, Erika. So a couple of things. As Don mentioned, loan growth, first of all, consumer is an area that
will continue to be an outlier of growth for us, and I think we're well positioned for that. Next area, if you
think about commercial real estate, we have a very, very good franchise. We're actually not growing the
on-balance sheet debt there and that's by strategy. I think last year, we probably placed $11 billion with
our targeted customers in our real estate book. As it relates to C&I, we haven't yet seen growth.

If you're looking at utilization, Erika, it is now at or below even prepandemic. We haven't seen people
investing in property, plant, equipment, investing in people. But what we have seen, and I think is a
very good sign, and you saw it in our investment banking numbers in the fourth quarter, is people are
starting to make strategic moves. And so we're having great strategic discussions with our clients and
our prospects. And I think people are thinking now with the election behind us, with the vaccine rollout of
really what are they going to do to grow their business.

So I too am optimistic that we'll see an increase in line utilization and that we'll see people start to invest
in their business. The other thing that would obviously be helpful for line utilization because if we had a bit
of inflation, if people actually started investing and going long in inventory, and I think that's an unrealistic
scenario as you think about the back half of the year.

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And just one follow-up question on expenses, Don. Your guidance is off of the GAAP base of $4.109
billion.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

That's correct, yes.

Operator

Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate the color you gave on the reinvestment and the impact of liquidity as well as your NII
guidance. Just wanted to see if you can help us in how to think about the trajectory of the net interest
margin here in the coming quarters. I know there's also a PPP benefit. But just want to see if you can give
us a lot of color in terms of how that could trend in the next coming quarters.

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Good. As far as the margin, it's challenging to predict just because the timing of some of the deposit flows
is also creating either pressure or change there. And so with our assumption of having deposits growing
low single digits, it implies that our margin will come down slightly from where it is as of the fourth
quarter. So something slightly below the $270 million. And I would say that from quarter-to-quarter, that
will be impacted based on, like you said, the PPP forgiveness timing and also the changes in the overall
equity position.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. All right. That helps. And then separately, Chris, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on
M&A interest, both bank and nonbank. We've clearly seen some banks there in your backyard move on
some deals. And I know you've flagged competition as one of the risks that you think about, and you can
certainly see that intensifying in the coming years. So basically, I want to get your thoughts on whole bank
M&A from that perspective and then also on the nonbank front.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Thanks for your question. Well, my comment with respect to intensity of competitors was really
nonbanks and thinking about some of the fintechs. But as it relates specifically to your question, we're not
really focused on whole bank consolidation or acquisitions really at all. We think we have everything we
need to be successful. We think the best way for us to generate value is to execute our targeted scale and
go out and grow organically.

So having said that, obviously, we take the responsibility very seriously of being a public company, and we
know we have to go out there each and every day and create value. As it relates to nonbanks, I'm really
proud of the job we've done over many years of being able to buy entrepreneurial firms and successfully
integrating them into our business. And I think about Cain Brothers, I think about Pacific Crest Securities
and most recently, Laurel Road. It was a born digital company that we've been able to really, not only
integrate into our business, but actually, helps Key grow -- helped both Key and Laurel Road have grown.

So I think you'll see us continue to go out in keeping with our focus around targeted scale, buying these
niche businesses that can help us really serve our targeted client bases.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful. What areas of businesses would you emphasize in terms of the nonbanks?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

I think we'd probably look at the verticals that we're in. And I think we also would probably look at -- if
you think -- let's look at what we've done. We've bought boutiques that are really focused. We've bought
digital businesses/analytics businesses. Those are the kind of businesses that I think really turbocharge
our existing 3.5 million clients.

Operator

Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.

Sun Young Lee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Janet Lee on for Steven Alexopoulos. So my first question is on deposits. You're guiding to deposits
going up even more from here after 20% growth in 2020. Is this a function of your customers still holding
on to cash in their accounts? Or does this bake in any assumption about new client acquisitions from your
successful PPP?

KEYCORP FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2021

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I would say it's on all fronts. And so we are assuming a growth on a continued basis. One is that, we, in
the last 3 quarters, have shown a lot of strong retail household growth and with a focus there on primary
operating accounts for the retail customers throughout our commercial customer base, we have increased
efforts around making sure that we have that expanded full depository/operating account relationship
there as well. And so those will be helpful.

It would also reflect the assumptions like we saw last year that as the PPP loans were originated, a good
portion of those proceeds were deposited into deposit accounts with our customers. And so we would
expect to see some lift from that. And then just the most recent round of stimulus also adds deposit
balances.

And each quarter this year, we've tried to estimate where our deposit flows will be. And I think each
quarter, we probably underestimated where they actually come through. And so I think the customers
continue to have liquidity and continue to build those positions. And that's essentially why we're assuming
that we'll have continued growth there as well.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Don, the only thing I would add to that is we have a very successful third-party commercial loan servicing
business, where we are named primary servicer on $300 billion worth of commercial real estate.
That business has grown very, very well, and that generates deposits. And we also, from a strategic
perspective, are very focused on primacy with both our consumer clients and our commercial clients, and
we're getting a lot of lift there.

Sun Young Lee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's helpful. And it is positively surprising to hear that you expect overall residential mortgage
originations to remain stable to potentially increase in 2021 versus 2022. So do you -- are you saying that
the consumer mortgage income line on your fee income, is that going to be stable? Or is it going to go
down like single digits? And how does it fit into the overall fee income guidance of up low single digits?
Like, where are the other like offsetting line items that are going to see bigger drop?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. As far as the outlook for 2021, that we would expect that line item to come down slightly, more
reflecting the impact of the extremely high levels of gain on sale we experienced, especially in the third
quarter of this year. So we saw that come down in the fourth quarter and would expect to see ongoing
pressure there. So even though the origination volumes would be stable to maybe up, we would expect to
see some pressure there.

As far as the other categories on fee income that we would expect good growth in service charge line
item, that those categories were under pressure throughout a good portion of the, say, second and third
quarter of 2020, and we would expect to see growth coming from that category. And especially reflecting
the impact of the low rates, we would expect to see good growth in trust and investment services line item
between what we're doing from a retail and commercial brokerage/account activity there. And just our
overall investment management strategy, we would expect to see some growth there.

And then even though we've had a record year for investment banking and debt placement fees, we do
expect that to grow again for 2021. And so we've got a good pipeline in that business. We've got a good
team, and we're expecting to add bankers to that area throughout 2021 as well, which will help deliver
those results also.

And we'll go to Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on line utilization. Where is it today? And where do you think it can go? And
kind of what's the sensitivity for every 1% increase to commercial loans?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

So this is Chris. This is an area that, frankly, through the pandemic, we've been challenged to really pin
down on where we think it's going to go. If you think about people drawing on their lines and then paying
back those draws, we're about at 50% in our C&I book right now, which, Peter, is a little bit below where
we would have been prepandemic.

And I think the real catalyst there is: one, our clients are sitting on a lot of cash. So arguably, we'll have to
burn down some of their cash before they start to utilize their lines. So they have elevated cash positions.
That's the first thing. And the second thing that I mentioned is there's plenty of slack now in the global
supply chains. And so people aren't really investing and going long per se on inventory. So I think you'd
need those 2 things to happen. The biggest driver of both of those, obviously, is to get real economic
growth.

Don, what would you add to that?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

No, I think that's right. I mean as far as the 50%, that implies roughly about $50 billion in outstanding
balances on those lines for us. So just to put that in perspective, if that would increase by 1%, then that's
-- which shows that 1% growth on the $50 billion.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just one question. Just on net interest income, the outlook of low single
digits, that 2020 is on a GAAP basis as well. Is that right?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I'm sorry, repeat that, please?

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Sure. Sorry. The fee income outlook, the 2020 base, that's a GAAP number?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

The 2020 base is the GAAP number, and our FTE adjustment isn't assuming much of a change on a year-
over-year basis there. But I guess, we would have a tax rate change, we would start to see that. But
it runs usually about $29 million to $30 million a quarter or a year -- excuse me, a year for the FTE
adjustment.
