Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your
host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. .

Irene Holman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are D.G.
Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO.

As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may
differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.
Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and their corresponding GAAP measures are found in
the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 press release, both of which are available on
our IR website.

This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the second quarter of 2020, which exclude
restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings press release. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. To say that this quarter was different
and challenging would be an understatement. I am very proud of how our leadership and team members
have stepped up to the challenge. Whether dealing with the pandemic or with social injustice issues, our
team has been fantastic throughout this uncertain time.

Let me start off by providing you with an update on our pandemic response and a brief overview of the
quarter before turning it over to Tom to dive into the details.

So starting with an update on the pandemic, the Grainger team continues to work tirelessly to keep the
world working during this challenging time. As I outlined on our first quarter call, Grainger is an essential
business, and our customers count on us to keep their businesses up and running.

Our pandemic response is wrapped in 3 broad priorities: First, serve our customers well through this
challenging time; second, support the needs and safety of our team members; and third, ensure we
remain in a strong financial position. I'll provide a quick update on each point.

First, our businesses remained open every day to serve our customers. I visited one of our DCs last week,
and we have implemented several measures to protect the safety of team members and to ensure the
continuity of our operations. We also recently reopened our branch showrooms to add to the curbside
pickup service we have been operating throughout the pandemic.

Our KeepStock team members continue to serve the vast majority of our customers. The exception would
be some disruptive businesses where we've had to flip to alternate solutions. Throughout, our team
is focused on customer and team member safety, including new protocols, temperature checks, space
covering mandates and social distancing guidelines. This has certainly made operating more difficult, but
we believe we have done very well with these changes.

On the customer front, business reopenings and related activity continue to vary greatly based on
industry and geography. Sales to health care, government and other essential businesses remained strong
throughout the quarter. Sales to nonessential and disruptive businesses bottomed in April, and they've
rebounded in May and again in June, although they still remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels.
I'll talk about the pattern of revenue in a minute. Our supply chain has operated well throughout the

pandemic although we have seen some lumpiness as we work to match supply with tremendous demand
for some pandemic-related items.

For most product categories, things have improved. But for some categories, global shortages will make
supply a challenge throughout the balance of the year. Our team is working tirelessly to ensure supply for
customers as the pandemic ebbs and flows.

As we mentioned before, supporting the needs of our team members is a critical importance, especially
during this period of uncertainty. Our team members are essential to serving our customers, and team
member health and safety remains a priority. We have been fortunate to have absorbed the pandemic
without major layoffs and currently have less than 3% of our workforce still on furlough. We have more
team members who will return to work in the next few weeks. Having an experienced cohesive team will
help us accelerate growth through the recovery. In addition, we remain vigilant around safety. Our team
members give us great marks for making safety a priority as they support our customers.

Finally, we have maintained a tight focus on our financial position throughout this period. On our Q1 call,
I discussed our priority to preserve cash, including deferring action on certain capital projects, pausing
our share repurchase program and drawing on our revolving credit facility. We continue to focus on cash
preservation and have reduced nonessential SG&A spend by over $75 million sequentially in the quarter.
That more than exceeds our $40 million to $55 million target set on the previous call. These actions
helped us to finish the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity.

Since the business performed well in the quarter, we have begun to evaluate repaying part of the revolver
and are assessing a potential dividend increase. Depending on the shape of the pandemic, we will see
some sequential cost increases related to things like advertising, some travel and the reinstitution of merit
increases. But we remain committed to managing expenses very closely given the uncertain path ahead.
To be clear, we are managing costs well, but also investing for the future success of the business. We
continue focusing balancing the long-term health of the company alongside our short-term operational
needs.

Turning to our quarterly results. The business remained resilient despite this unprecedented period. Our
daily sales finished down 1.8% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, underpinned by heightened
sales of pandemic-related items that nearly offset a mid-teen decline of non-pandemic-related sales. With
the MRO market down 14% to 15% in the quarter, we gained a lot of share fueled by pandemic-related
sales, selling to new customers and improving non-pandemic sales as the quarter progressed. Gross
margins were pressured primarily due to pandemic impacts, which Tom will detail in a bit. A meaningful
portion of this margin pressure is temporary in nature, what we don't know is how long the pandemic will
last.

Despite great SG&A performance, we have taken action to keep team members and customers safe that
have added some short term costs. Obviously, we're incurring expense to ensure we create safe work
spaces and interact, but also doing things like expediting shipping and allocating product to lower-margin
health care and government customers. To state the obvious, we have been focused on helping customers
and communities as much as possible, which sometimes means we have added cost.

We've produced $230 million of operating cash flow and $189 million of free cash flow. That's a solid
result in this environment. Balancing the short-term with progress in strategic initiatives has been key. We
continue to make progress on our key priorities.

We are on plan to remerchandise an incremental $1.6 billion of our assortment this year. To support
further acceleration of these activities, we plan to launch our new product information management
system over the next month. We have made great strides in analytics and marketing capabilities, including
upgrading internal talent to own more of the marketing activities. Our new customer information tools
have enabled us to better match marketing and sales activities with new customers.

We launched a new visual search application that is based on machine learning. We are getting great
reviews on this solution.

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

We are seeing continued traction with our KeepStock and other embedded customer solutions. We know
that customers who have at least 1 embedded solution, including KeepStock and EDI Pro account for
roughly 60% of our revenue. So this is an important customer segment. Here, we have upgraded our
systems and processes to accelerate new installations and improve service on existing solutions. With
our endless assortment model, MonotaRO continued to invest in technology and capacity to fuel their
growth, while we have started to see the benefits of last year's investments at Zoro in the U.S. And lastly,
we further refined our international high-touch footprint with the completed divestiture of Fabory, and
we announced an agreement to divest Grainger China. This helps us simplify our footprint and focus our
efforts on our core markets.

Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important this quarter to show the underlying trends with
pandemic and non-pandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Over the last several
weeks, I've been participating in virtual market visits with customers that were originally scheduled to be
in person. I have talked with dozens of customers in several different industries to get a sense for how
things are progressing. It's important to note that even for customers with strong revenue performance,
there has been a disruption in normal activities.

For example, our hospital system has been heroic in dealing with the pandemic and saving lives, and their
pandemic product demand has been enormous. But many of their normal facilities maintenance projects
have been put on hold through this time to focus on COVID, which means that even hospitals had lower
non-pandemic sales through the last 4 months. There's a backlog of work that will need to be done in the
future. But for now, customers in all industries are focusing on keeping people safe and recovery.

In the U.S., we started to see increased pandemic sales in February, and they really picked up in March,
where we quickly moved in-stock inventory. This trend continued with pandemic-related sales up around
70% in the second quarter. And while the environment remains fluid, this has continued at an accelerated
rate into July. The heightened demand came from a multitude of customers across numerous industries
with most of the pandemic products going to health care, government and essential businesses.

Through most of March, non-pandemic sales were pretty stable. With the stay-at-home orders, we saw
non-pandemic sales fall off significantly in late March, but they have gotten better each month since
modeled out in April. We've seen further improvement in July. The good news is that we have seen a
steady improvement in non-pandemic revenue across all customer types. It's still below pre-pandemic
levels, but it has improved. While we don't know how this will progress, we do feel good about our ability
to help customers weather the storm regardless of how the pandemic evolves.

So with that, I will turn it over to Tom to take us through the quarter's results in detail. Tom?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, D.G. Starting with our total company results. As noted on Slide 8, daily sales were down 1.8% on
a constant-currency basis. This decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, reflecting lower sales of
non-pandemic products as well as significant headwinds from unfavorable product mix due to heightened
sales of pandemic-related products.

It should be noted that our endless assortment business grew approximately 16% in the quarter, showing
tremendous resiliency despite the challenging market conditions. Combined, the U.S. segment and endless
assortment business representing the majority of our revenue grew daily sales about 1% in the quarter
and roughly 4% year-to-date. Gross margin for the total company was down 290 basis points versus the
prior-year quarter. This decline continues to be driven mostly by pandemic-related impacts, particularly
noticeable in our U.S. segment, as well as continued business unit mix impact as we experienced faster
growth in our lower-margin endless assortment business.

We gained 100 basis points of SG&A leverage with a total year-over-year cost decrease of $43 million.
This leverage stemmed from prudent cost reductions across all business units, partially offset by increased
pandemic-related costs to keep our people and facilities safe. Sequentially, total SG&A spend decreased
over $75 million, exceeding our previously communicated goal of $40 million to $55 million, a great result

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

as we were able to deliver better-than-expected savings in many areas of the business. We generated
operating cash flow of $232 million, which we used to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders
and maintain a robust financial position.

During the quarter, we paid dividends of $86 million to shareholders, had total capital expenditures of
$43 million and significantly invested in inventory to ensure we can satisfy our customers' needs going
forward. Operating cash flow was 114% of net adjusted earnings and return on invested capital was over
28% year-to-date. As expected, our liquidity has remained strong, and we are evaluating increasing our
dividend and beginning to repay our revolver draw.

I would note, our calculated decremental margins are a bit skewed given the modest level of sales
decline. While the decremental margin calculation is useful, it has limitations with relatively small sales
declines. For example, if our sales would have declined 10% in the quarter with the same gross margin
and SG&A spending, our business results would, in fact, be worse, but our decremental margins would
have improved from down 111% to down 50%.

Overall, U.S. segment daily sales decreased 2.4% in the quarter as compared to a decline of an estimated
14% to 15% for the broader MRO market. The decline was primarily driven by volume decreases,
including unfavorable product mix from heightened levels of pandemic-related sales as well as decreased
volume of non-pandemic products.

In the U.S. segment, we estimate that pandemic-related product sales were up over 70% in the quarter,
peaking in May but elevated throughout the quarter. Non-pandemic products were down in the mid-teens
but saw sequential improvements from April lows. Gross margin was 310 basis points unfavorable to the
prior year. The variance was driven primarily by 3 factors: pandemic-related headwinds, tariff fuel cost
inflation and the impact of our rescheduled national sales meeting.

First, while difficult to pinpoint, we estimate that pandemic-related headwinds accounted for
approximately 60% of the gross margin decline in the quarter. These headwinds are multifaceted and
include product mix impacts as well as we continued to sell significantly increased levels of lower-margin
safety and cleaning products skewed more toward larger health care and government customers.

Additionally, as we work to support our customers during this challenging time, we saw further margin
pressure as we sourced high-demand products from non-traditional suppliers. This included increased
freight and handling costs to ensure expedient delivery of these much-needed and critical supplies. These
dramatic but temporary pandemic-related impacts are not expected to continue once we return to more
normal course operation. The remaining gross margin decline was primarily driven by the lapping of year-
over-year cost inflation, which was largely driven by tariffs that went into effect in 2019.

Finally, our national sales meeting represents a roughly 30-basis-point headwind related to the
reformatting and retiming of the meeting.

From an SG&A perspective, we gained 60 basis points of leverage with costs decreasing approximately
$25 million year-over-year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower travel expenses as well as
reductions in marketing, labor-related costs, professional services and general frugality. These decreases
more than offset temporary pandemic pay increases for hourly branch and DC team members, and
enhanced safety measures in our facilities. Operating margin remained strong at 14.7%, but declined 250
basis points in the quarter on lower gross profit margins that were only slightly offset by the achieved
SG&A leverage. Return on invested capital was a very healthy 38%.

Looking at the U.S. MRO market, while extremely difficult to predict in this environment, we estimate
the U.S. MRO market declined between 14% and 15% in the second quarter. Ranger was able to capture
roughly 1,200 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, a 70% increase compared to the first quarter share
increase. It should be noted that despite the pandemic, year-to-date daily sales are up 1.6%, and we have
gained over 900 basis points of share.

Moving on to the other businesses. Daily sales in our other businesses increased 2.7% or 2.5% on a
constant-currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at -- grew combined at 16% year-over-
year, driven by strong customer acquisition at MonotaRO and low single-digit growth at Zoro. MonotaRO

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

continues to perform at an impressive rate despite the Japanese recession and amidst the pandemic
backdrop. Sales at Zoro accelerated throughout the quarter, with June up near 10% and July growing at
an even faster rate. The international high-touch businesses have been severely impacted by pandemic-
related shutdowns, with each geography experiencing meaningful year-over-year declines.

Gross profit margin declined 140 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by declining margins at
Fabory and MonotaRO. MonotaRO's result is driven in part by freight increases from the acquisition of
new B2C customers. We achieved significant SG&A leverage in the second quarter, resulting in operating
margin expansion of 65 basis points. The SG&A favorability stems largely from decreased expenses across
our international high-touch businesses, most notably at Cromwell, and expanded leverage in endless
assortment.

It is notable that despite some gross margin headwinds at MonotaRO, the endless assortment business
grew operating margin in the second quarter. It is encouraging to see the 2019 investments in Zoro
paying off. Further, despite significant top line challenges in 2020, Cromwell has meaningfully reduced its
operating loss year-to-date.

On June 30, we completed the sale of the Fabory business, the full operating results of this business
are included in our second quarter results. Given the immateriality of the business, we will not be
recasting our prior-year financials to reflect this transaction. So we will face revenue headwinds, but we'll
have a modest tailwind to operating margin rate comparisons over the next 4 quarters. Starting in the
third quarter, we will provide organic daily revenue comparisons to strip out the top line impact of the
divestiture.

Turning to Slide 12. In Canada, daily sales decreased 21.7% or 19% in constant currency. The decline
is comprised of roughly 17.5% in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately
1.5%. Volumes at the Grainger Canada business continued to be impacted by the economic slowdown and
lower oil prices stemming from the pandemic.

Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 145 basis points year-over-year, driven by the
combination of aggressive pricing actions aimed at reinvigorating our customer base, pandemic-related
mix impacts and lower vendor rebates. These impacts were partially offset by lower freight costs. Our cost
management actions drove SG&A savings of $12 million year-over-year, resulting in 60 basis points of
leverage. Operating margin was unfavorable 85 basis points versus prior year.

Before I turn it back to D.G., given the unpredictability of the virus, it remains nearly impossible to predict
how customers -- how our customers will be impacted, but wanted to give you a sense for how July is
unfolding and what it might mean for the third quarter. From a sales perspective, trends in early July are
showing sales up mid-single digits on an organic total company basis, which strips out sales from our
Fabory business.

July-to-date trends show continued momentum with non-pandemic sales gaining steam from April lows
and with pandemic-related sales remaining at elevated levels. Further, every business unit is showing
improved performance in July when compared to June results. The situation clearly remains volatile. And
as we saw in Q1, these month-to-date metrics may not be good predictors of our full quarter results.

As we move into the second half of 2020, we anticipate gross margins will remain depressed as we expect
pandemic-related impacts will continue. While we don't know how the situation will evolve as the year
goes on, given what we know now, we anticipate improvement from the 290 basis point year-over-year
headwind we saw in Q2, but to what extent will be largely dependent on the pandemic-related actions of
our customers.

With respect to SG&A, as business unit activity ramps up, we expect to see some natural increases in
spend related to marketing and travel, and we also reinstituted our annual merit increase, which was
pushed from April to July. With this, we anticipate total company SG&A cost to range from $715 million to
$730 million in the third quarter. Importantly, we remain focused on long-term growth, and we'll continue
to invest in people, process and technology to ensure we remain the industry leader.

With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Tom. Before we wrap up the call and go to questions, I want to touch on an important topic. The
recent events of hatred and racism stand as reminders of the injustice in our world, and particularly for
the African-American community. At Grainger, one of our core principles is to do the right thing. The right
thing here seems fundamental: respect each other, embrace our differences and stand out for what is
right. Remaining silent is not an option. Collectively, we need to be better.

As a company, we know that diversity, inclusion and acceptance of our differences makes us stronger. This
is central to our Grainger Edge principles and vital to our commitment to keep the world working. We have
been encouraging our team members to have real conversations with each other about their background
and identity, including the tough topics of race, gender, age and sexual orientation so that we can better
know and understand each other. We know these conversations alone are not sufficient to solving the
problem, and we need to collectively take action to ensure that economic opportunities are more plentiful
for all.

While we have work to do, we are committed to improving our talent and recruiting processes to root out
bias, and we're committed to promoting diverse hiring opportunities. This includes giving clear metrics
and visibility, ensuring equitable pay and helping team members address unconscious bias. We'll also
continue to direct an arm of our charitable efforts to promote the educational advancement of those
without privilege or access.

I want to thank our team and our customers for performing so well through the pandemic. We are pleased
with how we performed, and we remain committed to gaining share profitably and delivering strong
results moving forward.
Now with that, I'll open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Baird.

David John Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

First off, thanks for Slide 6. That's very helpful to give us a picture of what's going on under the surface
here. But my question is, could you give us an update on your efforts in high touch? What initiatives are
you driving on most right now to accelerate growth in that core business?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Thanks, David. I think they are the same things we've talked about in terms of being critical, and
they really fall into 2 groups. One is improving our offer, our product assortment, our product information,
our customer information. So we're rolling out a new product information management system. We are
remerchandising a bunch of the assortment to make the experience better for our customers. We continue
to invest in digital technology for our website. So that's kind of the first set of things we're doing.

We've also increased our marketing effectiveness and reimproved our digital marketing, which is both --
which really hits all customers within the Grainger model, the high-touch model, and that has been very
effective. And we've reinvigorated our KeepStock and on-site solutions for customers. We have a good
traction going into the fourth quarter of last year and the beginning of this year. Some of that's slowed
down, but we still have new installs. We still have changed some installs for customers to help serve
them during this time. And really we think that almost every large complex customer has either a digital
solution that works for them or we help to manage inventory. And so we're pushing on those basics of on-
site service to make sure we do that right. And all that is leading to a strong share gain within the U.S.
business.

David John Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And second, on the Zoro U.S. growth initiatives that you laid out last year, is it correct to think that
the costs are behind you now and you're in the harvesting stage? And obviously, great timing on those. As
we look to the future, will those kind of investments be less chunky ahead? Or will you periodically step
those spending initiatives up and then followed by a period of harvesting the benefits?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We would expect that to be less chunky. And the reason is a lot of the investments we made over the
last 15 months or so, mostly in 2019, were really about a fairly significant strategic change to expand the
assortment in the millions of products. We passed the 4.4 million products available to customers online
Mazuro recently, and we've got a great pipeline. That required us to do it very, very differently than we've
done historically. And so those investments are behind us. And I would expect them to be less chunky. We
have -- for the next 3 to 5 years, we will continue to expand margins with that business as we grow, given
where we positioned ourselves right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair.

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

So first off, pandemic growth is holding up fairly well in July, as you cited. I realize this is hard to answer,
but what is your outlook for pandemic sales going forward? Is there any visibility there?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Well, so it's a great question, Ryan. Yes, there is -- I mean, well, visibility in the traditional sense, I'm
not sure. But certainly, if you look at our customer base, there are customers now who have planned,
particularly PPE, into their process like they've never done it before. So you talk with customers. One
customer told me they used to use 700 per day of a PPE item. Now they're going to use 40,000 per day,
as an example. So given the awareness of the virus, we would expect elevated levels of pandemic product
for the foreseeable future. Will it be as much as we've had? Probably not, although as we see cases rise,
my guess is there will be pretty significant elevated levels of pandemic product moving forward. But I do
think this has forced people to change the way they think about personal protection and think about some
of these products and keeping team members safe. So we expect to see elevated product levels for at
least the next 1.5 years and probably beyond.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then second question on non-pandemic sales. So I guess 2-part question. Were
the share gains there as strong? It looks like maybe not. Maybe clarify that. And then how did margins
perform in non-pandemic sales year-over-year? Any surprises there?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. First, and I can turn it over to Tom. Margins were not surprising for us there, and they performed,
clearly, better than the pandemic sales, because a lot of the pandemic sales are very large orders to
large contract customers. So the margins were certainly better with non-pandemic. I would say that it's
challenging. Our market assumption of down 14, 15 in the U.S. would assume that non-pandemic sales
were down quite a bit more than that. And so we do believe we gain significant share in non-pandemic
product as well. Getting that level of detail, looking at that -- our model is almost impossible to do. And so
I would say, don't really know. We think we gained share throughout all product categories. Whether we
gained more or less share with non-pandemic is really, really hard to do. My guess is it's less, but still very
strong.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Just as a thought. Your concern for social issues is laudable. You guys might want to even think of
expanding your presence in the Chicago area, maybe even the south side of Chicago. Just as a thought.

Donald G. Macpherson

Yes, yes.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

No, it's [indiscernible]. Like, why not? Consider it. So my question is, D.G., on Canada. Canada's results
have been pretty bad for a while. But in some respect, they're down 19% or whatever core. They held up
the profits pretty well. How did they do that exactly? Like, why was there not more decremental drag? Is
that just because it's been bad for so long that it's been able to sort of move and adjust the costs? And
would you expect that kind of performance going forward in terms of Canada's cost preservation?

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

The answer is, yes, we expect it going forward. I think the thing that's probably not easy to understand is
-- I spent some time with our customers recently in Canada, and our services improved dramatically there
over the last couple of years. And coming off of the SAP installation and some other things, we have real
challenging period there with service. And so I think a lot of this is just customers coming to realize that
we're providing strong service, building better relationships, and we've taken the cost actions we have.
So we feel like that business is poised to do much, much better. Obviously, they're going to be faced with
some market challenges, but we feel like they're positioned to do better. And we've taken a lot of cost out,
but we also continue to invest in pockets for growth. And we feel like from a share perspective, we can
gain share and gain share profitably given our current position.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Well, I was going to ask you about Canada strategically. It has been -- I appreciate the investment
posture. Like, is there a way to maybe even step that up over time? I guess the question is, so at some
point after what's been like 3 years or whatever, pretty tough results there, I'm assuming, number one,
you're not able to actually sell the business. Because I think years ago, you guys implemented initiatives
to integrate it more with the U.S., so selling it would actually be challenging. You'd have to untangle it. So
if you can't really do that, is the plan to just get it profitable over time to a certain threshold and it sort
of sits as a cash cow? Or you really think it can sort of do what some of the -- some of what you've been
able to accomplish in the U.S. in terms of share gains, can it do that in Canada, perhaps by shifting away
from oil and gas more to other pockets of their economy or whatever?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes, we believe we can do that. And actually, we're starting to see that. So with government, health care,
manufacturing, we're starting to get some traction there. And as that happens, we believe it can be a
growth engine. We're obviously going to be very, very focused on profitability. But we do think there's
going to be nice growth coming out, particularly the eastern part of Canada, and we've already started to
see some of that underneath the numbers. And so we feel like -- and you're right, it is running -- we're
running it more like the U.S., and that's helped our cost position. But the team up there is very focused
on profitable growth. I think we've got a really strong leadership team up there and the sales organization
now, and we're pretty excited about the path and the ability to grow consistently and grow profitably.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

So it sounds like 2021 could actually be a significant inflection year, without putting words in your mouth.
Is that reasonable as a thought process?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

It's a reasonable assumption. I think pandemic aside, how it evolves. But yes, we feel like -- we felt like
this year was going to be significant improvement. We started to see that in the first couple of months and
then, of course, the world stopped. So we feel like we're well positioned when things do come back for it
to be an inflection.

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Yes. I just wanted to stick with Canada for a second. And I think I saw aggressive pricing there. Wondering
what enabled that. Was that kind of catch-up on -- now that service levels are more enabling? Or is there
lack of elasticity?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

No. Most of that is what we saw in the U.S. with pandemic. So large sales of pandemic items to
government customers, some health care customers. That is -- the majority of the aggressive pricing
would have been to serve the pandemic.

Christopher D. Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And on the share gain, I think Tom mentioned 900 basis points. Just curious. Again, another crack
at trying to filter that with the pandemic demand. It doesn't seem like it'd be a sticky type of share gain
that you have, the way you normally accrue shares. So wondering about how you're viewing retention of
that.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Well , the way I'm viewing it personally is, we -- the world is a little unusual right now, right? So to say
that you gained 1,200 basis points a share when you were down 2%, it seems like a strange thing to say.
We think it's accurate analytically, but it's a little messy, right? Because we -- it's hard to tell what's going
on underneath that. We feel like we are gaining share. We feel like we're doing the right things. And we
feel like our normal share gains, we'll be able to retain. There may be some of that that's hard to retain,
of course, depending on sort of pandemic sales. But certainly, we feel good about it, but we don't -- we're
not taking it literally, if that's your question.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research.

Adam William Uhlman
Cleveland Research Company

Just to follow-up on that question. In the past, you used to talk about the medium-sized customer
recovery from lapsed customers or folks who used to do business with. Could you remind us of what your
headroom is of gaining share with those folks?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we saw an interesting dynamic with midsized customers during the quarter that has since
reversed. And so let me talk about that for just a second. So with large customers, we ended up
prioritizing a lot of pandemic efforts for large customers, hospitals and government customers, in
particular, and essential manufacturing businesses and others distribution businesses. As a result of that,
we held pandemic product from the website, in some cases, and you're seeing all the competitors do that.
And we did see the midsized customers get hit harder during the initial shelter-in-place orders. What
we've seen though is they've actually come back stronger. And so we're seeing very strong growth with
midsized customers in the last 6 weeks, which is encouraging.

We've acquired more new customers than we really ever had during this period because we've had
product and many others haven't. And so we think we've got a very strong -- a lot of headroom with
midsized customers, we were, at one point, $1.8 billion, and we think we can get back to there and
beyond over time. So we think we've got a long way to grow to have outgrowth with midsized customers.
And the pandemic has been a strange period for everything, but we're now starting to see that growth
come back in again.

Adam William Uhlman
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. Got you. And then how should we think about inventories, specifically for the rest of the year? And
maybe just some thoughts on working capital for the second half, would be great.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

So I'll turn it over to Tom here in just a second. I would say we have made significant inventory
investments to be able to get continuity of supply for our customers. So more than we obviously typically
would, given some of the supply challenges that existed in the world, and that has been a working capital
build. We would expect that build to stay throughout the remainder of this year and into next year before
it starts to bleed off, but I'll turn it over to Tom.

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, D.G. Yes, what was part of our operating cash flow bridge was a significant investment into
working capital and, specifically, inventory. When it became clear, coming through the first quarter and
into the second quarter, that we were in a cash generation position, then we felt it was right to invest in
working capital, use our strong balance sheet so that we would be able to take care of the needs of our
customers. So we have done prebuys. We've done prepayments. And we think we're well-suited to take
care of the needs going forward to help out those key customers.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just going back to the pandemic. Actually, no, let me skip that. Let's go to single channel. I mean, the
growth at Zoro was actually pretty impressive. As was -- I'm not sure, but we get the daily sales monthly
from their website. I mean, I think the factors are pretty clear. But is there any way to think about the
SKU expansion year-over-year? And how much of that is contributing to the growth versus just demand?
And I'm curious, given the nature of the shutdowns and the pandemic, is there any cannibalization
happening between single channel endless assortment and your traditional business during this period of
time?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So great questions. So I think I mentioned, we have a very strong pipeline, millions of products in the
pipeline to add to Zoro. If you look over the last 3 or 4 years, you look at curves of new product adds and
their productivity, remains a big part of the growth of Zoro. And in, let's call it, normal times, we would
expect product adds over the next 3 to 5 years to be as much as half of the growth of the business. And
so that's obviously an important growth driver. We have not seen any further cannibalization during this
period than we've seen at other times between Zoro and Grainger. In fact, Zoro's growth has been -- a lot
of it's been very, very focused on very small customers during this time and getting them product they
can't get elsewhere. So we're pretty excited about the pattern. I will say that both MonotaRO and Zoro
have had higher acquisition than normal, and some of that acquisition has been consumers. We don't
remarket to consumers. They do find as some -- as people have been trying to find pandemic-related
or really any product during this time. But the business acquisition has been stronger than normal, too,
and that's really the important number to look at. So that's strong business acquisition, driven in part by
product adds.

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Great. And then, obviously, the way you've broken out, say, the mix and the price/mix this quarter, I
think, is really helpful. The 30 bps of headwind from price and customer mix, would you be prepared to
talk about price in isolation? How is pricing tracking right now? And how do you feel customer pricing is in
terms of the go-forward? Are customers receptive of inflation right now? Or any change on pricing power?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We haven't really seen any change in pricing power. Our pricing -- and Tom, I'll let you answer this.
I will say our pricing, in normal years, we see GP trail off as the year goes along. This year is going to be
not as much of that as we do see price get better, and we've seen it get better through the second quarter.
And so we feel like we're going to get more price going forward. But Tom, do you want to answer?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Nigel, and I read your note before the call. And I think it's important
to note that we really haven't done anything new in terms of calculation. We've just broken out product
mix with volume. Product mix had always been in volume. But just historically, it hadn't been so relevant.
It was fairly static. Obviously, with the pandemic, it's a much, much bigger story, so that's why we broke
it out. And as it relates to our revenue bridge, it represents over 90% of the variance. The remainder, as
you note, is some customer mix and price. And as D.G. said, we've seen strengthening over the quarter,
and we expect that into the future in terms of price inflation, albeit we've seen a little bit of softness as it
compares to prior year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research.

Christopher M. Dankert
Longbow Research LLC

I guess just to carry that a bit further. Tom, in the past, you've mentioned that some introductory
pricing was certainly an onboarding engine for large customer acquisition. I guess, is that still a part of
the strategy? You highlighted some of the other pieces there, but should we still expect prices, from a
strategic standpoint, to be a bit lower in that large customer piece of the business going forward?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would say that's probably paused a little bit with the pandemic, just with the focus with the PPE, but
it's certainly still part of the acquisition strategy. And maybe since you brought up gross margin related,
let me try to unpack it even a little bit further than we did in the prepared remarks. As we're not giving
guidance, want to be as helpful as we can to everybody putting their models together.

So as we've said in the prepared remarks, we've got 60%, which is COVID-related. So on 310 bps, that's
roughly 180 bps unfavorable versus prior year. You've got NSSM, it's 30 bps. So there, it's 210 in total.
And the remainder is cost/other and as DG mentioned, historically, going from Q2 to Q3, we would see a
meaningful decline in terms of gross margin rate. This year, going -- as it relates to Q3, we expect that to
be mitigated somewhat for the following reasons. NSSM will no longer be a headwind, so we will gain that
back. We also see the tariff cadence improving. So tariff-related cost inflation will improve a little bit. And
then we see price inflation strengthening as well, and we expect that to continue into Q3.

Now the big wildcard, of course, is the pandemic impact as it relates to gross margin. So that is really the
wildcard in terms of what the actual gross margin rate will be for Q3. What we do expect, though, as we
compare the gross margin rate to the prior year, we don't expect to be down 310 bps in the U.S. segment
and 290 bps overall. We do expect improvement from that. So just wanted to give you that color to help
you all with your modeling. Thanks.

No, that's extremely helpful. And then just to follow-up. I guess, we've seen China and Fabory go away
here. I guess, just any quick thoughts on Cromwell. How it's executing? Does it still make sense in the
portfolio? Just your high-level thoughts would be great.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I guess, I'll give some thoughts. So Cromwell is -- it is a business that is very much in our high-
touch solutions model. It looks a lot like Grainger. They have executed, I think, while the last year, to put
themselves in a position where they can grow and improve profitability dramatically. So the pandemic
doesn't change our thoughts on the business. We've talked about sort of making sure we have a fast
recovery of that business. We should be able to get very clear signs on the pace of that recovery coming
out of this. So I'd say, happy with the team, happy with what they're doing. Service is really, really good
there now and starting to win back some business, and they're starting to improve profitability, they've
improved their cost position. I want to give that a chance to run out a little bit more. Obviously, the
pandemic may slow that a little bit. But certainly, we still have high expectations for how they can turn it
around there.

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Maybe a couple of questions on capital allocation. When do you think you might be resuming buybacks?
And then any other color on a potential dividend increase, either the timing, magnitude? Are you tying it
to a payout ratio? This is -- D.G., as you said, these are not normal times, but how does that -- how do
you -- how are you looking at the dividend increase?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

We'd expect that dividend increase would be similar to what it has been in prior years, Deane. With
respect to timing, we've been talking about it. And if something happens, it would probably happen in the
third quarter. With respect to repurchasing shares, right now, with the spike and are we going to have a
shutdown to with an abundance of caution, we really haven't resumed the buybacks, even though we are
obviously generating robust cash flow. That, we would probably start to think a little bit harder at the end
of Q3. And if we were going to do something, it would likely be in Q4, I would think.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's helpful. And considering the divestitures of Fabory and Grainger China, are you contemplating any
other portfolio moves over the near term? Any divestitures?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Not at this point, we are not.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Good. And then just last one from me. Could you expand on, in the context of having to source some high
demand products from -- I think you described them as nonstandard suppliers. What the challenges are.
I think you touched on freight, but did you have to qualify the suppliers? And how do you think this issue,
this headwind abates?

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So it's been a very unusual time for supply. I think the things that we've been really focused on are
making sure we can get supply of high-quality products. So we do have to qualify suppliers. We have to
decide whether or not the product meets our quality standards and actually does what it says it's going
to do. And then we have to, in some cases, as Tom mentioned, yet you have to pay some upfront money,
which typically would not happen, and we've done that in a number of cases. So it's a -- and as this thing
unfolded, it was a little bit like the Wild West in the sense that everybody claimed they had a solution, and
oftentimes, those solutions weren't real. And so we've had to work with our team in China and to work
with our team in the U.S. to really understand the quality, the availability, the integrity of the supply, and
that's been really important. I think we've done a nice job navigating that. But I expect that to weigh now
in some categories that may remain. But generally, it's gotten a little bit easier lately.

Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.

Hamzah Mazari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

D.G., you touched on the top line growth for Zoro and MonotaRO. I was hoping maybe you could just
touch on how to think about profitability of Zoro versus MonotaRO. Are there any structural differences,
whereby Zoro shouldn't look like MonotaRO longer term? Just any thoughts there.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

We have looked at that. And as you know, Masaya Suzuki is running that business at this point, the Zoro
business, and he's been the CEO of -- and still is the CEO of MonotaRO. The differences, if they exist,
are relatively minor. We think that the Zoro business should be able to get to certainly high single-digit
operating margins, which is very profitable from return on invested capital. And we've got our plans
to go ahead and make that happen over the next several years. And so we feel really good about the
profitability path of Zoro.

Hamzah Mazari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just a follow-up question, I'll turn it over. Tom, you gave some incremental color on gross
margin. So it's more of a clarification question. If pandemic sales continue sort of at the same pace as
July, is Q3 gross margin just down sequentially, assuming pandemic sales kind of continue at the pace
they are?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Well, just to reiterate, Hamzah, there's going to be some tailwinds, for sure, and that's the NSSM meeting,
that's the cost tariffs and that's the strengthening pricing. We would also expect, as D.G. said, some of the
money we paid to, let's say, air freight supply, we would expect that to likely go down as well. The bottom
line is it's just so hard to predict something that's never happened before in terms of the pandemic. So I'll
just reiterate. Historically, Q3 gross margin is less than q2. Would not expect it to be that dramatic of a
falloff in -- as it has been historically. So I'll leave it at that. But we do expect that it will be significantly,
from a bps perspective compared to prior year, not as down as 310 or 290 for the overall company.

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

If I could go to the U.S. segment, just thinking a little outside the box. Can you kind of frame for us what
the opening of branches means from a sequential sales uptick if we were thinking of that as like a noncore
add back, what that means in terms of sales and maybe margin mix?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

So you're talking about opening our showrooms where we were only doing curbside for a while?

Michael Lawrence McGinn
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Correct.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I would say that just rough math, walk-in traffic is about 10% of our volume or revenue, at
least at this point. And what we see is we see a modest increase when we open the showrooms. It is
-- it should help margins because, typically, the profile of those customers are not generally contract
customers, and it's usually higher-margin sales. So it will be modest for the overall growth profile, but it
will help. And we've seen that already happen as we've opened those up.

Michael Lawrence McGinn
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then second one for me. I think Nigel was mentioning the SKU count additions on Zoro. You
have a fellow, I guess, B2C company out there with similar ambitions to rapidly increase SKU count. Can
you give us a framework for how many resellers you have added and how much it would take to get to
that $10 million, and whether you view that $10 million as a high hurdle, low bar? Any commentary there
would be great.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. given -- I would say that given the -- we're talking about every quarter, adding tens of suppliers. So
it's not thousands of suppliers before, but it's tens of suppliers. But we have a line of sight into getting to
6 million or 7 million SKUs at this point, and we feel like getting to $10 million is not all that difficult to
do given the new processes we have in place. I will say that the MonotaRO business in Japan is about 20
million, roughly 20 million items. So we've done this before. We understand the process. And I think the
team has done a great job of configuring to be able to step on the accelerator, and we have a very nice
pipeline at this point.

Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just a quick one on -- so you talked a lot about gross margin expectations for third quarter. Just if you
could provide any framework. Maybe I missed this earlier, but any framework around how to think about
SG&A or incremental margins in the third quarter if sales continue to grow in that mid-single-digit range?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, related to SG&A, I'll refer you back to the prepared remarks where we think, on a total
company basis, SG&A will be between $715 million and $730 million. And that is a decrease, obviously,
from prior year, but an increase from Q2 as the country starts to open up and we're spending more on
travel, we're spending more on advertising. Those types of things. As it relates to decremental margin,

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

if we were to see a volume decline from 5% to 10%, which is inconsistent with what we've seen so far,
July to date, we would expect decremental margins to be in the 35% to 45% range, consistent with
what we said last quarter. Obviously, if we continue at a mid-single-digit growth, then we would flip from
decremental margins to incremental margins. And there, I think, depending on, again, and I have to keep
-- I apologize, I have to keep giving the qualifier of what the pandemic looks like. But depending on how
the gross margin behaves, we could be around 20% plus/minus gross margins as long as the pandemic
does not take a really harder hit on gross margin.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

What -- go ahead. Go ahead, D.G.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

[indiscernible] to Tom is we talked about adding travel costs back. That may sound a little odd in today's
world. What we really mean there is we are now able to visit most of our customers. So we're talking
about mileage reimbursement for our sales team, which will increase. It's not a huge number, but that's
the type of cost add-back we would be having, is being able to engage our customers, again, which we
started to do.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. I assume -- great clarification. I assume that $715 million to $730 million is embedding sales growth
since you're growing 5% to date? Or is the range there because you don't know. How do I think about
that?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

I think our assumptions change frequently now as the world changes. But certainly, right now, we would
envision -- all we really know is through the first 3 weeks, we're up about mid-single digits.

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

And I'll just reiterate, it is lower than prior year, which was in the $760 million range.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. And then last one for me. Did you mention the year-over-year benefit from tax in the second quarter
to free cash flow? I might have missed that, too. Sorry about that.

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Can you repeat the question, please, Patrick?

Patrick Michael Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I thought I read in the slides or somewhere that there was a benefit from timing of tax payments and free
cash flow in the second quarter.

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, yes. Thank you. Yes, there was $115 million benefit deferral of federal income taxes. Instead of
paying our federal payments in April and June, like we did in the prior year, we pay them in July.
