Presentation

Operator

Good morning. The Roper Technologies Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call will now
begin. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.

Zack Moxcey
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper
Technologies. We hope everyone is doing well. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President
and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley,
Vice President and Controller; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also
includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are
available through the webcast and are also available on our website.

Now if you'll please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's
call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on
this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that
information.

And now please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted
non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release
and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. For the second quarter, the difference between
our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related
intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue; a restructuring charge
associated with certain businesses in our Process Technologies segment, these were additional structural
actions not contemplated in our prior guidance; transaction-related expenses for completed acquisitions;
and lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow results to exclude income tax payments deferred from Q2 to Q3
due to COVID-19.

And now if you please turn to Slide 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will
take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We hope that everybody listening or reading are doing
well and enjoying the summer.

With that, let's go ahead and start with our agenda. As usual, we'll start with the enterprise highlights
from the quarter, which are quite good given the health and economic challenges associated with the
current pandemic. I'll then walk through our key financial and operational levers on a segment basis and
compare how we did versus what we thought heading into the quarter.

Rob will then discuss our P&L, our balance sheet, our cash position. We find ourselves in a very fortunate
position to have well over $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet and a completely undrawn $2.5 billion
revolver.

Following Rob's remarks, I'll walk through our detailed segment review and outlook, followed by our Q3
and full year guidance. And finally, I'll conclude with the highlights for the quarter and discuss our outlook
for continued capital deployment. We'll then look forward to your questions.

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Now let's turn to a brief run-through of our Q2 results. Next slide, please. To start, I'm very proud of how
Roper performed in the quarter both on an operating basis and a balance sheet basis.

On an operational basis, our revenues declined 2% in the quarter and 3% on an organic basis. We saw
organic growth in each of our 2 software segments. In addition and as we foreshowed last quarter, we saw
very strong demand for our medical product businesses and laboratory software mostly used in the global
fight against COVID-19. Worth noting and broadly, our businesses did not experience much, if any, supply
chain disruption in the quarter, which contributed to our revenue performance.

We also saw gross margins increase 70 basis points to 64.7%. EBITDA margins were impressively flat
versus a year ago at 35.3%. And DEPS was strong and came in at $2.94. Most importantly, free cash flow
increased 10% to $315 million.

Specific to our balance sheet, 2 items of importance. First, we successfully completed a $600 million 10-
year 2% bond offering in the quarter. Also, we were able to deploy $150 million for 2 bolt-ons, indicating
the window for capital deployment is reopening. More on these deals as we turn to the segment pages.

So while 3% organic revenue declines are certainly below normal, given the macroeconomic backdrop
heading into the quarter, I'm very pleased with this performance, especially as it relates to our margin
performance and cash flow. To this end, this quarter's performance serves as a great example that
illustrates the intimate knowledge each of our teams have with their business, their customers, their
supply chains and their employees. As we said for many years, nimble execution yields great results, and
that is certainly the case for this quarter and so far this year.

As we'll discuss later in the call, we are maintaining our full year organic revenue outlook to be plus
or minus flat, which we believe is a testament to our decade-long business model transformation. In
addition, our greater than $1.5 billion cash position and our undrawn $2.5 billion revolver allows us to be
offensive relative to capital deployment. Our M&A pipeline remains full of high-quality opportunities. And
prior to turning to the next slide, I want to thank our entire leadership team and our 16,000 employees for
your tremendous work this quarter. Thank you.

Next slide, please. Turning to the second quarter segment results summary. This page summarizes our key
business model levers and how they performed in the quarter. Starting with Application Software.

We expected revenues to be down mid-single digits in the quarter but actually grew 1%. As we did expect,
renewal rates remained high and recurring revenues remained strong. Also, we did see strong demand
across our laboratory software businesses as they worked aggressively to enable scores of COVID-19-
related testing capability on a global basis.

A good guide for the quarter was our software license sales. We saw across the segment better-than-
expected conversion of perpetual ILF sales pipelines. A further positive variance was the success our
teams had in implementing our software remotely, which led to higher service utilization rates and
revenues. So this segment performed better than expected based on these 2 factors, better license sales
and higher service utilization rates.

For our network segment, we expect it to grow low single digits and did, coming in at 2%. For the
software businesses in this segment, just about what we expected, high levels of recurring revenues and
renewal rates and decent network expansions at ConstructConnect and DAT. More on this later. But the
TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues to push to the right, impacting
more the second half versus this quarter.

As for the MAS segment, we expect it to decline mid-single digits but did modestly better, only declining
1% in the quarter. Verathon and IPA outperformed our expectations and were driven by exceptional
demand for their products and solutions throughout the quarter. As expected, our other medical product
businesses were negatively impacted and continue to be negatively impacted by reduced elective hospital
procedures.

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Neptune performed in line with expectations and was down given they had limited access to meters,
especially in Canada and the Northeast United States where meters are installed inside residences. Finally
in this segment, we saw sharp declines, as expected, in our industrial businesses.

Turning to our Process Tech segment. We are down 26% in the quarter versus an expectation of being
down 30-plus percent. The businesses in this segment performed generally as expected, slightly better
than we thought at PAC and AMOT. Finally, the better-than-expected revenues levered very well the EPS,
with DEPS coming in at $2.94 versus our guidance range of $2.50 to $2.70.

After Rob's comments, I'll come back and discuss in more detail our segment-by-segment performance.
Rob, I'll turn it over to you.

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Roper Technologies as always.

So turning to Page 7. Looking at our Q2 income statement performance. Q2 organic revenue declined
3% versus prior year, with total revenue coming in at $1.306 billion. We had positive organic revenue
growth in both Application Software and Network Software & Systems while sharp declines in our smallest
segment, Process Technologies, pulled our overall organic growth into low single-digit negative territory for
the quarter.

Margin performance, as Neil mentioned, was a standout in the quarter as our businesses expanded gross
margin by 70 basis points to 64.7% and held EBITDA margins flat at 35.3%. As a result, EBITDA declined
only 2% to $461 million. Our tax rate came in at 22.3%, a little higher than last year, resulting in adjusted
diluted earnings per share of $2.94, which was well above our guidance range of $2.50 to $2.70. So in
summary, really good execution by our business leaders in a very challenging environment.

Next slide. Turning to Page 8 and looking at cash flow. Cash flow performance for the quarter was very
strong. On a GAAP basis, our operating cash flow was $449 million, which represented a 49% increase
over last year. However, for better comparability and clarity, we are adjusting our results for the $124
million of income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3 due to COVID-19, and those taxes
were subsequently paid in July. So after adjusting for the timing of the $124 million of tax payments that
pushed to July, our Q2 operating cash flow grew 8% to $325 million, which represented 25% of revenue.

Q2 free cash flow grew 10% to $315 million, which was 24% of revenue. Looking back at the past 2 years,
our Q2 free cash flow has compounded a strong 12%. Congrats and a special thank you to the finance
teams at each of our businesses for continuing to make cash flow and cash collections a high priority. It
truly was outstanding cash flow performance in a challenging environment.

Next slide. Turning to Page 9 and our asset-light business model and negative working capital slide. We
exited the first quarter with working capital of minus 4.4%. And in Q2, we further improved this metric
with working capital as a percent of revenue moving to minus 5.4%. While we're certainly happy as always
to see our income statement hold up well in Q2, we believe it's just as important, if not more important,
that our cash flow and working capital metrics also remain strong. In fact, as we continue to improve on
these important working capital metrics despite the challenging macro environment, this bodes very well
for our ability to compound cash flow at higher levels as the economy does eventually rebound from the
pandemic.

Next slide. Turning to Page 10, our strong financial position. So it's really a continuation here of the same
story we discussed last quarter. Roper's liquidity position and balance sheet remained very strong. We
ended June with over $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet.

To date in July, as mentioned, we have made some tax payments. About $316 million of tax payments
have been paid to date in July. That's the previously mentioned $124 million of deferred payments as well
as $192 million of taxes due on the gain from last year's Gatan sale. So after making these payments, our
cash balance today is approximately $1.6 billion, and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility remains fully
undrawn.

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

In June, we took advantage of historically favorable conditions in the bond market to issue $600 million
of 10-year notes at a coupon of 2.0%. At the time, we tied the record for the lowest coupon ever issued
by a BBB issuer. Really great execution by our team and nice to once again see very strong demand for
Roper bonds, driven by our consistent ability to generate cash flow, high levels of recurring revenue and
our diversified portfolio of asset-light businesses.

At the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 2.1x. And with our large cash balance and fully
undrawn revolver, we remain very well positioned with significant financial capacity to take advantage of
our large pipeline of acquisition opportunities.

So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Rob. Let's go ahead and turn to our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $398
million, up 1% on an organic basis, and EBITDA was $172 million or 43.1% of revenue.

To start, our retention rates and other recurring revenues remained strong in the quarter. In addition,
we saw better-than-expected software license sales in the quarter, broadly across Deltek, Aderant and
PowerPlan. Of note, sales pipeline build that occurred prior to the quarter converted at a higher-than-
anticipated rate. In addition and as discussed earlier, we saw better service utilization rates and revenues
than expected.

Our laboratory software businesses, Sunquest, Data Innovations and CliniSys, all grew and performed
nicely, aided by the global demand to deploy diagnostic testing software interfaces and laboratory software
associated with combating COVID-19. Specific to Sunquest, we received the termination fee payment
for the Queensland project in the quarter. As a reminder, last quarter, we noted that the customer opted
to terminate this implementation in the face of COVID-19-related challenges. CBORD, which is our
software business that sells nutrition and food management software as well as campus access solutions
to hospitals and universities, did decline given their very limited access to both hospital and university
clients.

Broadly across the segment and of note, we are absolutely seeing an increased desire from our customers
to migrate to our cloud or SaaS offerings, one of several trends that COVID appears to be accelerating.
This should be a long-term growth driver for our business as we have a large installed base of customers
who will, over time, migrate to the cloud.

And turning to the outlook for the segment. We expect to be roughly flat on an organic basis for the
second half of the year, with the third quarter facing a challenging prior year comp specific to perpetual
license revenues. We continue to expect high levels of recurring revenue retention. As a reminder, the vast
majority of our customers in this segment are enterprise or larger companies. Furthermore, we serve a
diversified and durable set of end markets; most notably, government contractors, marketing services
firms, law firms, utilities and hospitals. That said, we do anticipate some continued pressure on our new
logo software license sales.

This quarter's license revenues were aided by sales pipelines that were built pre COVID and converted
better than expected in the quarter. The second half funnel is increasingly comprised of post-COVID
shutdown activity. As a result, we expect our prospects' decision time frames may extend longer than
our historical experience. That said, we are encouraged by the fact that the top-of-the-funnel activity
looks good, and we like the MQL to SQL conversion rates, but again, expect decision timing could be more
elongated than normal.

With that, next slide please. Turning to our network segment. Revenues grew 2% organically to $423
million and EBITDA was $176 million or 41.5% of revenue.

As a reminder, most of our software businesses in this segment share highly recurring SaaS revenue
models, which are further aided by strong network effects that drive high retention rates and network
adds, which were certainly the case in this quarter. To this end, our ConstructConnect network expanded

7

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

in the quarter and was driven by strong customer adds and network utilization. As a reminder, our
ConstructConnect business' primary product provides building contractors with all available commercial
building projects that are in the planning phase and enables them to bid and win work. In an economic
environment like this one, the value of this product further increases.

Our DAT business grew high single digits in the quarter, led by large number of carrier additions to the
network and strong growth in our rate data offering. To add to our rate data product capabilities, we
acquired FMIC in the quarter. FMIC is the leading benchmarking and rate analysis firm focused on the
contract freight market. When combined with DAT, the FMIC data sets will be a unique product offering
that benchmarks both the contract and spot truck freight markets in the U.S..

In addition to FMIC, we also acquired Team TSI. We are integrating Team TSI with our SHP business.
When complete, the combined business will have comprehensive operating, financial and quality
benchmarks that span the continuum of post-acute care, namely skilled nursing and home health. In
addition to helping the post-acute providers operate their businesses more efficiently, SHP will help
improve patient outcomes through innovative real-time data and evidence-based collaboration among
acute care providers and their post-acute partners. We're excited to see this strategy unfold. As mentioned
earlier, these bolt-on acquisitions have a combined purchase price of $150 million.

Turning to last year's acquisitions. And it's worth noting that Foundry and iPipeline continue to perform
well and are proving to have quite resilient business models as we expect. As we look to our RF IDeas and
Inovonics businesses, they were challenged in the quarter, directly resulting from having limited access to
customers. And finally, the TransCore New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project continues and
is deemed essential. However, the project, at the election of our customer, has slowed and continues to
push into 2021. Execution of the project remains strong, but the time is elongating.

Turning to the outlook for this segment. We see mid-single-digit organic growth in the second half.
Relative to TransCore New York project, as mentioned, we see this project pushing to the right. Notably
about $0.20 of DEPS is being pushed into next year as compared to what we thought a quarter ago.
That said, we continue to see growth and resiliency in our network software businesses, driven by higher
recurring revenues, strong retention rates, expanding networks and solid network participation.

Next slide, please. Turning to our measurement and analytical segment. Revenues declined 1% organically
to $364 million and EBITDA was $132 million or 36.2% of revenue. In the current environment, this
segment's activities are best broken into 4 boxes: one, Verathon and IPA; two, other medical product
businesses; three, Neptune; and four, our industrial businesses.

First, Verathon and IPA, both experiencing tremendous demand for their products directly attributable
to hospital demand resulting from COVID-19. Verathon experienced strong demand for their GlideScope
video intubation products. As a result of COVID-19, the percentage of all intubations, not just COVID-
related, that are being done using video assistance has meaningfully increased. Verathon's demand is both
for capital systems, which means an expanding customer base; and the pull-through consumables.

We have to give hearty congratulations to Earl, Tracy, Tim, Jeff and the entire team at Verathon. It's one
thing to have unprecedented demand, it's a completely different thing to be able to flex the supply chain
to fulfill the demand within a single quarter. Congrats and thanks to the Verathon team.

A similar story with IPA. Hospitals rapidly adapted their automated scrub distribution systems to help
deploy scrubs more broadly to staff within the hospital setting.

Second and relative to our other medical product businesses, we did see revenue headwinds tied directly
to government-mandated lower patient volumes within acute care hospitals on a global basis. We also
want to note that this group of companies consistently grows mid-single digits. This growth is conditioned
on regular hospital admissions patterns.

Third, Neptune was negatively impacted by restricted access to indoor meters, in particular in Canada and
the Northeast United States. And finally and as expected, we did experience a sharp decline in our short-
cycle industrial businesses. However, in the second half of the quarter, we did see modest improvements in
consumable demand.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

As we turn to the second half outlook, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth in this segment, led
by continued strong demand at Verathon for the reasons just discussed. In addition, we expect to see
reduced levels of non-emergent capital procedures providing continued headwinds for our non-Verathon
and non-IPA medical product businesses. We do expect to see improvements in Neptune on easing
lockdowns, especially in the Northeast United States, which will provide better access to indoor meters.
Also, we are cautiously optimistic given that July municipal budgets appear to be largely intact. And finally,
we expect to see gradual improvements in our short-cycle industrial end markets.

Next slide, please. Turning to our Process Technologies segment. Revenues were $121 million in the
quarter, down 26% on an organic basis, and EBITDA was $33 million or 27.4% of revenue. This was
certainly a difficult quarter for these businesses, and we expect the outlook to remain poor for the balance
of 2020. Despite a uniquely challenging environment for these businesses, they still had high 20% EBITDA
margins in the quarter, and our leadership teams have done a great job of navigating these end markets
and continuing to make no-regrets investments.

We saw our upstream businesses decline approximately 40% in the quarter. Our PAC business also
declined, and it was related to weak fuel demand in the quarter. As a reminder, PAC is our laboratory fuel
analysis business. Also, CCC was weak based on the inability to perform field service work, all related to
COVID-19. One bright spot in the quarter was Zetec, which experienced growth based on the strength of
their new nondestructive testing products.

Also in the quarter, we initiated targeted restructuring actions across a few of our businesses in this
segment, which resulted in a $13.6 million charge. None of these structural changes were considered in
our guidance from a quarter ago. These actions will position these businesses to better serve its customers
and realize longer-term savings. While the oil and gas markets and customer commitments remain more
muted, we believe this is the right time to execute these restructuring activities.

The outlook for the balance of the year continues to be an extremely challenging one as we expect to see
approximately 25% organic decline for the second half. Specifically, we do not anticipate any recovery in
upstream oil and gas markets and expect upstream to account for less than $40 million of revenues in the
second half. In addition, we expect to continue to have limited customer access, which hampers our ability
to perform field service work.

Next slide, please. As we turn to our guidance, we are narrowing and modestly raising the midpoint of our
full year adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $11.90 and $12.40 per share. We continue to guide
full year organic revenues to be plus or minus flat. In addition, we're initiating DEPS guidance for 3Q in
the range of $2.90 to $3.

Now let's turn to our summary and get to your questions. Next slide, please. Given the global pandemic
and associated shutdowns in the quarter, we are pleased with our performance with revenue only being
down 3% organically, EBITDA margins holding flat versus the prior year at 35.3% and cash flow growing
10% to $315 million.

From an operating point of view, our businesses remain focused on employee health and safety, continue
to improve the efficiency of remote work, remain super intimate with our customers and continue to
focus on long-term durable growth. To this end, our businesses continued to invest in growth-oriented
operating initiatives. Our leaders, all of whom are long-term builders, are masterful at maintaining
product investments during down cycles, which oftentimes lead to market share gains upon recovery. As a
leadership team, we remain steadfastly committed to this concept.

For the full year, we expect to have plus or minus flat organic revenue growth. We believe our portfolio
of businesses and our governance processes continue to be well suited to navigate these difficult times.
Our balance sheet is stronger than at any point in history with over $1.5 billion of cash and $2.5 billion
of revolver capacity. And specific to capital deployment, we do have a high-quality and active pipeline
of opportunities as private equity sellers have recently reentered the market. That said and as always,
our CRI-based strategy focuses on long-term cash flow compounding, and we will continue to patiently
evaluate and pursue capital deployment opportunities that are consistent with this strategy.

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

And as we turn to your questions, I'll remind everybody that what we do is very simple. We compound
cash flow by operating a portfolio of businesses that have leading positions in niche markets that have the
proven ability to generate increasing cash flow as our businesses expand. We provide our business leaders
with Socratic coaching about what great looks like relative to driving long-term CRI-accretive organic
growth, with particular emphasis focused on strategy, operations, innovation and talent development. Our
business leaders understand that success in our culture is based on their ability to compete and win for
talent and to compete win for customers that, in turn, allow us to compete and win for shareholders.

To this end, we incent our management teams based on growth. And based on these factors and
perhaps most importantly, we have a culture that is rooted in the principles of mutual respect, trust and
transparency. And finally, we take the excess free cash flow that is generated by our businesses and
deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company that, in turn, helps
accelerate our cash flow compounding. It is these simple ideas that deliver powerful results.
And with that, now let's turn to your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can we start with the congestion tolling project? Just give us some context of this latest pushout. It would
be fair to assume that just logistically, COVID is presenting issues in terms of being able to work on the
project, but has there been any change in scope that's being considered?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Deane, no change whatsoever in the scope of contract value that we talked about a few quarters ago. It
remains the exact same. And so the only thing that is happening here is the project is pushing a bit to the
right into 2021 for the reasons you said, a little bit access to personnel related to COVID and a little bit
just at the election of the customer wanting to pace the project a little bit.

And I think also, we highlighted last quarter -- I mean, the motivation of the client has never been higher.
I think it was just around this time last quarter the proceeds from the project for 2021 and '22 could be
used in MTA's operating budget, where the initial project, Deane, was going to be used for capital only. So
there is a clear motivation to get -- by the customer to get the project up and running. It's just slipping to
the right a little bit.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just to clarify, there was a discussion of pushouts in the first quarter. So this $0.20 of EPS push out, this is
new and incremental, correct?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

That's correct.

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes, that's correct, Deane. So the project was originally around $200 million for this year. Now we've
got about $110-or-so million in for 2020. And as Neil mentioned, the rest just pushes to the right and we
expect to be complete in '21.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then second topic would be the net COVID impact across your businesses. And I'm not sure
if this is a fair question to ask, but you listed a number of ways that Roper is positioned to help between
the lab support system, CliniSys, Data Innovations, the Verathon intubation systems. Those would be the
positives, but the negative, is it all related to just the deferrals of nonemergency procedures. So how do
those 2 net out?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

If your question is relegated to the medical product businesses versus a broad -- is it related to that or is
it broader to Roper? I want to make sure I understand your question.

RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

No, no, no. Just the medical related, sorry.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Yes. So the -- it's a net -- a meaningful net grower, right, when you look at the benefit of those.
Verathon and IPA, good guy against the bad guys of the other 4 or 5 medical product businesses
aggregated together, it's a very meaningful positive good guy.

It's worth noting though, the Verathon demand, while it certainly surged in the quarter, the team worked
really well to work down the backlog and got a little bit more to go in the second half of the year. The
team at Verathon believes that the demand is -- will endure a bit, right? It's about the number -- the
percentage or the market share of global intubations that are being done with video assistance versus not.

Going into the pandemic, it was somewhere in the 15% of all intubations were done with video assistance
and 85% direct. And that market share of video is going -- it's meaningfully higher now, and it will stay --
it will be meaningfully above 15% on the back side of this. So the market just grew, we believe, for these
products that Verathon has.

Operator

The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

I was trying to get a sense -- and a little bit of follow-up on Deane's question, but trying to get a sense
of ConstructConnect. You commented how the pandemic perhaps helped -- is helping catalyze some
growth there. I mean very few of us are experts in many of these businesses. I'm certainly not an expert
in ConstructConnect by any stretch of the imagination. But can you give us a sense of how that business
grows in this type of environment?

Is it -- well, I'll just leave it at that, just open-ended. How does it grow? And how much is the impact?
Is there any way to -- the magnitude of the pandemic really helping get word-of-mouth or otherwise out
there on the product?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes, happy to talk through that. So just to remind you and everyone, ConstructConnect, the primary part
of the business, all for nonresidential or commercial construction in the United States and Canada that's
in the planning phase. So once a shovel goes in the ground, other constituents in the value chain pick up
that. This is about planning. It allows general contractors, subcontractors, building product manufacturers
to be aware of the projects that are being planned so they can bid for and win those projects, and we have
software that organizes all of that activity.

So when the market is raging hot, right, all the subcontractors have more work than they can possibly
do. The value of leads or what new projects is lower, right? And so we've always sort of said if there's 5
market conditions, 5 is white hot and 1 is there's basically 0 construction, the ConstructConnect value
proposition is best in positions 2, 3 and 4, right, where there's work and activity going on but not so much
work that contractors have so much to do, right?

And so what's essentially happened here, and ConstructConnect reports on this and Zack can get it to you,
is nonres construction activity is down 20-ish percent versus prior year. It was up a little bit in June versus
May, but that's the exact environment where the value proposition of leads and project awareness sort of
thrives. And that's why you saw more contractors come into the ConstructConnect market and grow in the
quarter.

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

I would just add to that. It's a SaaS business, Scott. So there's not huge swings in the revenue like you
get with the perpetual license business. We're seeing increased activity in the network, and that leads to a
little bit of more subscriptions, more customers. And then over time, that drives additional growth with the
business.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Right. And those customers, I mean, do they come in and then they generally stick around or they come
out when economic conditions get weaker?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Really appreciate the question. So history, if you go way back in the arc of ConstructConnect, some of
them will stay and some of them will leave. But since our ownership in '16, the ConstructConnect team
has worked really hard to build habituation into the product, if you will. So now there's integrated takeoff,
which is the estimation process and directly linked.

And so we believe the customers, when we look at their utilization of the product, they're in the product
on a multi-time a day basis now, where 5, 6, 7 years ago, they'd be in the product only when they needed
to look for a new project. And so we believe, based on that, the sort of the long-term retention rates of
the business go up.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay. Okay. Super helpful. Okay. Congrats, guys. Good luck this quarter.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Congrats on the book as well.

Charles Stephen Tusa

recently did, could you just give us some color on the revenues and what you paid for those, just general
multiples for some of the ones you've done?

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Steve. So there's the 2 acquisitions in the quarter. Combined purchase price is about $150
million, and we've got about $25 million or so revenue in the model for '21 and EBITDA margins there in
the mid- to high 40s. So pretty good cash.

But each business is being integrated into a business. So there was not a lot added for the second half
because there's some integration going on, but both are real good strategic adds to the Roper businesses.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then just a last one on the -- on some of the -- I think you guys had expected a bit weaker
performance in some of the software businesses. I know you went through some of this in the prepared
remarks. But is there anything that kind of gives back a little bit in the second half that's notable and is
material in any of those software businesses? Just perhaps some deferred downside relative to what you
would have expected in the second quarter, some timing items.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

So in the second quarter, I mean -- yes, I think the second quarter software, for the reasons we said on
Application Software, I mean, it was the better utilization rates on the service side. And we expected more
deferral or push-outs of the license activity, and that proved to be a little conservative. And so that --
but that was broad -- that license activity was broad across Deltek, Aderant, PowerPlan. We saw good
performance across the diagnostic businesses that we just talked about. Some of that -- a lot of that was
COVID-related.

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

Right. There's a lot of good things that happened in acute care software in the quarter which were driven
by the demand around COVID, right? So some of that stuff happened in the second quarter that we didn't
expect. And we'll see what continues into the second half, but that's difficult to predict.

Operator

The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.

Joao Pedro Joaquim Carvalho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Joao Carvalho on for Julian. Maybe just to start, Application Software margins came in pretty strong
for the quarter. Can you just give some color on what contributed there? And maybe as part of that, just
your thoughts on how margins look there and at other segments for the second half.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

I'll take the first part of that and let Rob take the second. It's directly -- the Application Software margin
performance in the quarter is directly tied to better license activity. As you know, perpetual licenses in
quarter are super high margin, 90-plus percent, 85%, 90%. So when you outperform an expectation on
license, then you tend to have better margin performance.

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

And then we also received the Queensland payment for Sunquest, which put revenue and large -- high
margin on that revenue in the second quarter as well which helped. And then as we look at the second
half, the margins don't move around a lot in the software segments, which is a great thing, right? It's high

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

recurring revenue, very stable business models. You don't get this sort of swing. So we certainly expect
EBITDA margins to be sort of flat or a little bit better year-over-year in the software segments.

Joao Pedro Joaquim Carvalho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Perfect. And then some interesting comments you guys mentioned, municipal budgets seem to be intact
so far. Any thoughts on how much this holds in the second half and then maybe thoughts on what level of
potential cuts you guys are dialing in for kind of your outlook next year? I know that's a bit early. And then
maybe just as part of that, can you just remind us kind of what percentage of sales within M&AS is kind of
tied to municipal budgets?

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

Very little as a percent of revenue. I mean it's going to be the part of Neptune that swings around with
budget, and Neptune is a pretty stable, high recurring revenue business. So it's a real small percentage of
the segment. I mean single digits that's going to really be driven by swing in budgets.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And more broadly, coming -- this time last quarter, in the height of the shutdown, a risk item that
we flagged was are Neptune's customers' budgets going to be intact as they roll into their New Year's
because a large percentage of these customers have a July 1 fiscal year, just given the broader economic
challenges that municipalities and cities are experiencing. The good news is the budgets appear to be
largely intact. So that -- the first risk item appears to be mostly retired.

The remaining risk item is now the spend against the budget, right? And that's a to be determined. But
the first step is a checkmark, and we'll see how things unfold the rest of the year.

Operator

The next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Neil, maybe just some commentary on the elective procedure impact in the quarter. Obviously, like things
are still incredibly fluid with the virus, but I'm just trying to understand maybe how much of this pushes
out into 2021 and whether there's like a revenue boost in 2021 once, hopefully, elective procedures come
back.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the products -- the companies that we have that are somewhat indexed to procedure volume, it's
one derivative behind it, right? So very little of our businesses are a consumable in a procedure, but our
capital and products are used by other companies who are used in a procedure. And so we're buffered a
little bit by what our customers are seeing.

We did see a little bit in the second -- maybe the June time period, some of the true consumables sort
of pick back up, and that's just going to be volatile for the balance of the year. We would expect, as I
mentioned in the opening comments -- in the prepared remarks, I mean, this group of businesses, going
back for many, many years, grows like clockwork at mid-single digits, and that assumes a patient volume
that are normalized. And so to the extent volumes are normal in 2021, then we would see a pickup in that
group of businesses.

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Just a sense, Joe. So the sort of other medical products businesses which exclude Verathon and IPA, which
have huge COVID benefits of everything else, those businesses were down double digits in the quarter.
And they would normally be mid-single growers. And so I think we will catch up some of that at some
point, but it's very difficult to predict when.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful, Rob. And just maybe my quick follow-up. I thought your commentary around like
the acceleration into cloud-based solutions was interesting. I guess, Neil, if you could maybe just provide
some context for what that opportunity could be for you guys, either qualitative or quantitative, that
would be helpful.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll leave it at sort of on the qualitative basis, right? So as we've said for a long time, we -- as a
guiding principle, we allow our customers to pace the transition to the cloud. We don't force it or have a
forced product migration. We're just there waiting for that to occur.

We have some businesses like Strata that are born in the cloud. We have other businesses like Aderant
and PowerPlan that are still vast, vast majority on-premise. And then we have companies like Deltek that
are somewhere in between, right, sort of in the middle in their journey of the migration.

What we've seen at Deltek is that, that migration is a net growth driver. And we can talk about that in
more detail later to the extent you're interested. But you basically are taking a large installed base of
customers who pay you annual maintenance and you're uplifting them to the cloud. So you're providing all
the backbone and IT sort of management services.

But also, you're doing all the release management, getting them on the most recent release that are
more micro releases, and so the customers get to take advantage of what you're actually developing. And
that has real value associated with it in the mind's eye of the customers. And so for that reason, as they
migrate from on-premise to cloud, there's an uplift in recurring, a pretty meaningful one. And that's a
multiyear growth driver for our enterprise on Application Software -- or in Application Software.

Operator

The next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Can you talk about maybe some of the implications of a potential infrastructure bill, what that might have
maybe on -- I'm guessing Deltek would be the most, maybe PowerPlan, I'm not sure, but how that might
impact overall the portfolio?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

It's not -- I think it would have a slight impact. And the reason I say that -- I'm looking at Rob and
Shannon. It's not something we talk about, right? And so about an infrastructure bill, we're not rooting for
one. So I...

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The government contractors are always spending money on whatever there is to spend money on.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

16

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Rob's point there is very good, right? So the contractors go where fast flow is of government spend. And
so maybe you get a few more government contractors that could be Deltek customers, but that's probably
it.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. Can you kind of just set a range, kind of floor? I'd assume like within -- your software
businesses did better than expected obviously, but I'm guessing there's huge, huge differences between
like a -- businesses like CBORD where you couldn't go -- like people weren't on site. Like can you kind of
scale what was the -- even if you don't want to get into the specific business name, so like how big were
some of the biggest declines and how big were some of the biggest gainers in the quarter?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll set it up. I'll give you some context and let Rob sort of give you his view. So as we mentioned
last quarter in this segment, about 70% of revenues are recurring. 20% are tied to services, and that's
generally coming -- working off some sort of 6- to 18-month backlog, and then 10% of the revenue is that
perpetual license. So the most short term impacted is that 10%. So that tends to mute the magnitude of
the swing in any given period of time. Assuming that the in-flight implementation projects don't stall, we
do not see a lot of that blot, if any, of that activity in the quarter.

So with that, Rob?

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. They are just very stable businesses. So I'm just looking through all the software businesses, and
sort of they're all kind of between a low single-digit gain or low single-digit decline, with the exception of
CBORD, which is a little bit worse than that. So again, that's a little bit better than expected.

Because you know a huge part of the businesses are stable, the question is, are you going to get any of
these license wins in the quarter? Are you able to deliver services? And we were. And so to the extent
that continues, that certainly helps us. There just aren't big swings in these businesses, which, of course,
we had huge swings in the product businesses, where there's more issues with not being able to access
customers, et cetera.

Operator

The next question comes from Alex Blanton of Clear Harbor Asset Management.

Alexander M. Blanton
Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC

I wanted to ask about the pushout in the TransCore business in New York City. You mentioned $0.20 going
into 2021 from '20, a new $0.20. And then I think you said, I wanted to confirm this, $110 million now
in this year versus $200 million before. So that's a $90 million pushout. Is that -- are those the right
numbers?

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

They are, Alex. There was an interim step in there that last quarter, the $200 million became $175 million
and now it's $110 million. So the move from $175 million to $110 million is your $0.20.

Alexander M. Blanton
Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC

Okay. That's what I wanted to know. So that $65 million pushout generated $0.20 per share pushout. So
we can calculate the incremental margin there. That's what I'm getting at.

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

These are all rough numbers, but yes.

Alexander M. Blanton
Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC

Yes, I knew that. Yes. We don't need the precision.

The second thing is we haven't really -- I don't think anyone asked about the acquisition pipeline. You've
got max $4.1 billion of spending power for acquisitions. What does that look like? What are you working
on, big, small? What's the timing? Is some of it getting pushed out because of COVID? What's the
situation there?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Alex, appreciate the question. So I'll give you a little bit of context and color. So we had a pretty -- the
activity coming into COVID, I mean, it was as busy as we have been that I can recall since being here in
2011 in terms of what the funnel activity looked like. Obviously, everything shut down. I mean when the
credit markets shut down, everything shut down in April, and May, it was -- there was really no activity
anywhere. No sellers were selling anything for obvious reasons.

At the end of May, first part of June, we saw some green shoots. We obviously got these 2 bolt-ons
complete, which were sort of in the pipeline pre COVID. And really here, since the middle of June until
now, it's almost as if we're back to January, February in terms of private equity seller interest and activity.
The private credit markets aren't fully back, but they're back enough to give sponsors confidence that they
can run a process or processes. And so we're encouraged by all of that because we're sitting here with
what you just said, a large amount of cash and borrowing capacity to sort of continue this -- our long-term
CRI-driven sort of compounding strategy.

I will note, the things that we see -- obviously, the things that come out of the shoot first after a slowdown
are the very best assets, right, the ones that have the best niches, the best competitive position, the best
-- highest level of recurring revenue, durability, things like that, and those tend to be fairly valued, right?
There's not a lot of bargains that we would say we see in the software space, but values -- valuations
consistent with what we saw coming into the pandemic.

Alexander M. Blanton
Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC

What accounts for the pickup? The COVID situation is actually worse than it was in April. There's spikes all
over the place, and the government that doesn't have control over it all. They're not even trying. So what
accounts for the opening up of acquisition activity?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

We can only speculate what's in the mind's eye of the sellers, right? But a couple of things. First is the
types of -- everything I just said I should have qualified by saying our M&A pipeline is 100% software
focused, right? And so these are businesses even in the public markets that are privy to be resilient sort of
than comparables, if you will. And so that colors my comments on what our funnel activity looks like.

The other thing is private equity sellers, which is where we buy 100% of our assets from, have to return
capital. They have limited sort of pressures. That's a constant drumbeat. And then finally, and this is me
certainly speculating about private equity's view of what might happen in election and taxes, but that
certainly may be a motivating factor to get some things done by the end of this year.

ROPER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Taxes. Okay. Yes. I had another question but it now slipped my mind.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

Happens to me all the time.

Alexander M. Blanton
Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC

Yes. You said 100% software focused -- oh, I know what it was. Your sister company, Dover Corp, used
to say that -- one of the favorite things they said was that during recessions, they always gained market
share because they had the dominant positions in their companies, in their markets and so weaker
competitors would lose out some business and even go out of business during recessions. So Dover
actually benefited from a market share standpoint during economic downturns.

How would you characterize Roper in that regard? And what is happening now? Are you gaining share
overall from people having a lot worse time than you are?

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

So we would echo those comments that companies like Roper, in our history, is we continue to invest in
product through cycle, especially in the down cycle because your competitors oftentimes are not able to.
And we also stay super close to our customers. The vast majority of what we -- our companies have direct
channel access versus have to work through distributors so you stay super close to the customers. And
almost certainly on the back end, you gain share either because of customer intimacy or because you
develop or launch some new product or product capabilities. So 100%, that is the case for Roper in this
current environment.

Alexander M. Blanton
Clear Harbor Asset Management, LLC

Okay. And this is a tough one, but what percentage of this $4.1 billion you think you might deploy this
year?

Robert C. Crisci
Executive VP & CFO

That's real hard -- yes, that's really impossible to predict. We're going to do the work we always do.
And yes, we certainly have the capacity, but we only do the best deals and we never feel pressured. But
certainly, the balance sheet has never been stronger. So we feel good about our ability to deploy capital
this year.

Laurence Neil Hunn
President, CEO & Director

As my predecessor said many years ago, our discipline is only outmatched by our patience.
