NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings First Quarter 2020 Conference Call.
My name is Jonathan and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants,
this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Ms.
Andrea DeMarco, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and ESG. Ms.
DeMarco, please proceed.

Andrea DeMarco
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020
earnings call. In the past, we have hosted our earnings calls from various locations, including London, the
New York Stock Exchange and even onboard our vessels. Never have we hosted a call with our entire team
scattered in different locations. It's one of the many ways we're adopting to the new environment, so I ask
that you bear with us as we find our sea legs on our first socially distanced earnings call.

I'm therefore joined virtually today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian
Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will
begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss results for the quarter
before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions.

As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations
website at www.nclhltdinvestor.com. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call,
which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will
be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.

Before we discuss our results, I'd like to just cover a few items. Our press release's first quarter 2020
results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call also includes
forward-looking statements that may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results
to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the
cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.

Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release
and presentation.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone joining us today, along with your
loved ones and colleagues, are safe and healthy. Every one of us is doing our part to combat is pandemic
by sheltering in place and practicing social distancing. But no one is doing more for us than our first
responders, frontline workers and those providing essential services. To them, I'd like to extend our
sincerest thanks on behalf of everyone in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings for all they are doing for
communities around the world.

In the 3 months that have passed since we last spoke, the entire world's way of life has changed. The
impact from COVID-19 global pandemic on our company and the broader travel industry have been swift
and severe. In my weekly communications to our team members, I consistently stress 2 themes: first is to
ensure that we are taking care of our guests, our crew, our travel partners and each other; second is what
I consider key to overcoming this uniquely challenging time in our history, and that is to be nimble and to
be ready to adapt to the fluid environment around us.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

And what the team at Norwegian has accomplished in the 2 short months since we suspended voyages
is nothing short of extraordinary. In that time, we have laid up our entire fleet, repatriated over half of
our 28,000 crew members, significantly pared back operating and capital expenditures, improved our
debt maturity profile and successfully completed a historic simultaneously executed quad-tranche capital
raise of $2.4 billion. These actions will enable us to weather the unlikely scenario of over 18 months in
a 0 revenue environment and still have enough liquidity to relaunch operations when conditions allow.
I couldn't be proud of what our team has accomplished, and now they have risen to the occasion by
continually adapting to the ever-changing environment.

In its 53-year history, Norwegian has overcome a myriad of exogenous events, many during the tenure of
this management team. And we haven't just persevered after these challenging events. We've proven our
mettle, our resilience and we've thrived. We have done so because of the mix of the unmatched value and
unique experiences that only cruising provides, coupled with an exceptional management team, one that
has faced and overcome uncontrollable black swan events in a multitude of headwinds time and again.

While much remains unknown regarding the severity and duration of the global economic downturn
resulting from COVID-19, we do know from history that the excitement factor and value proposition that
cruising provides will be, when the time is right, a compelling driver of reviving consumer demand. And
as far as that value proposition goes, we believe that we have an unbeatable competitive advantage with
3 brands that offers the most value path proposition in the industry. To demonstrate that advantage, for
the 2 months of sailings we operated in the first quarter of 2020, we generated higher net yield revenue
and adjusted EBITDA than over the prior year, and this, despite numerous canceled sailings in Asia and
the incremental customary cost without corresponding revenue that came from the launch of Seven Seas
Splendor.

On Slide 4, we provide an update on our current book position. There continues to be demand for cruise
vacations, particularly beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 and accelerating through 2021, with the
company's overall book position at this time and pricing for 2021 within historical ranges. These are
2 examples, one from the recent past and one pointing to the feature, both of which demonstrate the
underlying demand at cruising and cruising on our brands has had in the past and will also have in the
future. As I mentioned earlier, the impacts from COVID-19 were swift and severe, and they require a
response exponentially faster and larger than any in our recent history.

I'll direct you to Slide 5 of our presentation where we parse our company's response to the pandemic in
3 phases. In the first phase, which I will discuss in a moment, we addressed our immediate operational
concerns. In the second, which Mark will cover in his commentary, we swiftly executed on a financial
action plan to reduce costs and increase liquidity. Lastly, I'll come back to discuss where we find ourselves
today, developing a road map to launch a new era of cruising across our 3 brands.

Phase 1 began by quickly addressing concerns over COVID-19 when the virus was mainly impacting Asia,
and we proactively canceled or modified 40 voyages in the region across our 3 brands. Despite the virus's
initial impact predominantly affecting greater Asia, we began adapting and enhancing our embarkation
and sanitation protocols worldwide, which you can see on Slide 6, across our 28-ship fleet. As the leader
in one of the most consumer-facing industries in the world, the health and safety of our guests and crew is
always our top priority, and we are accustomed to implementing new procedures quickly and efficiently.

As the pandemic progressed, we continued to adapt and increase the rigor and frequency of our protocols.
When guests became hesitant to travel, we introduced relaxed cancellation policies to alleviate many of
our guests' concerns by providing them peace of mind regarding their cruise vacation. Our most decisive
action came on March 13 when we announced what we thought was a temporary 30-day suspension
of voyages across all our brands. Never had our company halted sailings across an entire fleet and
suspended them for an extended period of time, but it was necessary for us to play our part in combating
the spread of COVID-19.

With voyages suspended, our next challenge was safely disembarking our guests as soon as possible and
securing safe harbor for our 28 vessels. The offices and crew across our fleet, along with our shoreside
teams, displayed an extraordinary amount of urgency, professionalism and compassion in the face of
this monumental task. Today, all vessels remain in safe harbor and we continue to work with the CDC

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

and other regulatory bodies to repatriate crew back to their home countries. Our guests impacted by the
canceled sailings were offered value-added future cruise credits worth 125% of the cruise fare paid to
compensate them for the disruption and disappointment of canceled vacation. This enhanced offer, which
has proven to be popular, was provided to guests in real cash refunds and can be used on future voyages
all the way through the end of 2022.

Lastly, our entire shoreside operation was moved to work remotely, an endeavor that involved shifting
an entire global workforce to work virtually in a matter of days. I want to commend our IT and human
resources team for flawlessly executing on this initiative in such a condensed time frame.

And currently, as you can see on Slide 7, we swiftly developed and launched our financial action plan
to prepare the company for a prolonged voyage suspension. Mark and his team were instrumental in
spearheading this phase of our response, so I'd like to turn the call over to him now to discuss our action
plan in more details, provide a deeper dive into our liquidity position and discuss our results for the
quarter. Mark?

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Given the swift and significant impact COVID-19 has
had on our business, my remarks today will not be typical for an earnings call. I will not focus on yield
growth or net cruise costs as today, these metrics simply aren't relevant. Instead, I will focus on the quick
development and execution of our financial action plan and how we believe we've positioned our company
to withstand an unlikely scenario of over 18 months in a 0 revenue environment.

Slide 7 illustrates our 4-point action plan, which we quickly implemented to conserve and increase cash
to protect the business. The 4 key areas of focus include: reducing operating expenses, reducing capital
expenditures, improving our debt maturity profile and securing additional capital. First, let's focus on
operating expenses on Slide 8. We deployed several levers to reduce both shoreside and shipboard
operating expenses. SG&A savings included the significant reduction or deferment of near-term marketing
expenses, the introduction of a shortened work week with a commensurate 20% salary reduction for team
members and a furlough of approximately 20% of shoreside employees through July 31. These actions
affecting our team members were especially difficult. However, unlike layoffs, the furlough process allows
impacted team members to remain employees of the company while continuing to receive benefits. In
addition, we committed to covering our team members' share of medical insurance premiums during the
furlough period. It was the least we could do to support our impacted team until we can welcome them
back.

As for shipboard operating expenses, as you can see on Slide 9, with cruise voyages suspended through
June 30, we meaningfully reduced expenses such as crew payroll, fuel, food and port charges. As we
reduced our manning levels and transitioned the majority of our ships to cold lay-up, we continue to
repatriate crew back to their home countries, working through challenges around global travel restrictions.

On Slide 10, we provided details around ongoing monthly ship and administrative operating expenses
under 2 scenarios: a warm lay-up and a cold lay-up. The primary difference between the 2 scenarios is
that a cold lay-up is a prolonged lay-up with further reduction of staffing to a skeleton crew and further
savings to fuel expense, repairs and maintenance and other operating costs. All of the cost-saving
measures implemented have significantly reduced operating expense to approximately $70 million per
month, with all of our ships in a cold lay-up scenario and approximately $110 million per month in a warm
lay-up scenario. With the majority of our ships transitioning to cold lay-up, we are moving towards the
lower end of that range.

Shifting to capital expenditures on Slide 11. We identified approximately $515 million in reductions. Non-
new build capital expenditures for the remainder of 2020 were reduced by approximately 65% or almost
$350 million. We are also finalizing documentation to defer approximately $170 million of new build
CapEx-related payments due through March 31, 2021. Total CapEx for 2020, including both new build and
non-new build, is now expected to be approximately $805 million, of which approximately $195 million will

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

be spent throughout the remainder of the year. First quarter CapEx was elevated due to the delivery of
Seven Seas Splendor and the whole revitalization of Norwegian Spirit.

As we look forward, we are also benefiting from lower near-term CapEx commitments resulting from
moderate capacity growth, with no new capacity additions scheduled for delivery until mid-2022, which
could be delayed, given extended closures at shipyards. Given the continued uncertainty, we are not
providing CapEx guidance for 2021 and 2022 at this time. Another key focus in our action plan was
improving our debt maturity profile through the deferral of amortization payments and the extension of
maturities.

As you can see on Slide 12, we took advantage of an industry-wide 12-month debt holiday initiative
granted by export credit agencies, and we expect to be able to defer approximately $540 million of total
debt amortization payments through March 31, 2021. Approximately $385 million of this has already been
finalized with Hermes, the export credit agency in Germany, and we are currently finalizing documentation
for the balance with our other ECA lenders. This initiative also provides financial covenant testing relief
for 12 months, with all postponed amortization to be repaid evenly over the following 4 years and 8
semiannual installments.

In addition, our commercial lenders also agreed to a 12-month debt holiday for approximately $150
million of amortization payments, bringing our total aggregate deferrals of payments to approximately
$700 million. We also extended our debt maturity profile meaningfully by exercising a contractual option
to extend our $230 million Pride of America term loan maturity by 1 year to January 2022 as well as
extending our new $675 million revolving credit facility maturity by 1 year to March 2022. These actions,
coupled with the amortization deferrals, leave us with no significant debt maturities through 2021.

On Slide 13, we outlined the multiple measures we took to secure over $3 billion of new capital and
liquidity in response to COVID-19. In March, we quickly secured a new $675 million revolver and
subsequently drew down on both that and our existing untapped $875 million revolver. Just last week,
we completed a series of highly successful capital market transactions led by Goldman Sachs. Significant
demand for this capital raise resulted in the transaction being oversubscribed many times over. Not only
did we have excess demand across the 3 offerings, the greenshoe options were also fully executed for
both the ordinary shares and exchangeable notes.

As a result, the transaction was upsized from $2 billion to approximately $2.4 billion of gross proceeds,
significantly strengthening our financial position and extending our liquidity runway. We are extremely
pleased with the result of this transaction and are proud of the team's adaptability to execute this
extremely complex capital raise while sheltering in place.

Turning to Slide 14. We have provided an illustrative liquidity runway that shows how we believe we are
well positioned to withstand an unlikely scenario of over 18 months in a 0 revenue environment. Our pro
forma liquidity post the capital market transactions is approximately $3.7 billion as of quarter end. At the
end of the first quarter, we had just under $1.2 billion of advanced ticket sales related to the remainder of
2020, including approximately $800 million for voyage cancellations through June 30, where guests can
choose to accept a value-add future cruise credit or a full cash refund.

To date, slightly over half of guests have requested a cash refund. For the remainder of 2020, we have
approximately $370 million of advanced ticket sales on the books. Our net liquidity is approximately
$3.1 billion, assuming roughly half of the customer deposits for all sailings in 2020 are refunded. Our
cost reduction and cash conservation measures have resulted in a significant decrease to our monthly
cash burn rate, which is now expected to be in the range of $120 million to $160 million per month. This
includes additional cash financing expense associated with debt refinancings and new financing secured
last week, which is expected to be approximately $12 million per month over the next 12 months. This
burn rate excludes cash refunds and cash inflows from both new and existing bookings.

As you can see, we believe we have significantly extended our liquidity runway to over 18 months in a
prolonged 0 revenue environment scenario, which we do not expect. The recent capital raise and the
significant measures taken to reduce costs and conserve cash and alleviated management's concern about
the company's ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, which is simply a technical

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

accounting reporting requirement that is -- that received some slightly out of context media attention last
week.

Shifting the focus to our financial results. The first quarter was significantly impacted by COVID-19.
Not only did we feel the impact from canceled and modified cruise voyages, we also recorded a $1.6
billion noncash impairment loss related to goodwill and trade names. In addition, the reduction in fuel
consumption driven by canceled voyages resulted in an approximately $14 million loss related to a portion
of our fuel hedge portfolio due to a reduction in forecasted fuel consumption and flows through the other
income line. As a result, we recorded a net loss on a U.S. GAAP basis of $1.9 billion or $8.80 per share.

Looking ahead, given the rapidly evolving impacts from the pandemic, we cannot estimate the impact on
our business or the longer-term financial and operational results with certainty and therefore will not be
providing second quarter or full year guidance. While we are not providing traditional guidance, we do
expect to report a net loss on both a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis for the quarter ending June 30 and the
year ending December 31, 2020.

Before returning the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate our confidence in our ability to weather the
impacts of COVID-19 and emerge stronger on the other side. Our strong liquidity position gives us
ample resources to absorb a prolonged voyage suspension, allowing the team at Norwegian Cruise Line
Holdings to focus on doing what is right for our guests, crew, travel partners, team members and other
stakeholders while protecting the equity of our brands for the long term.

Lastly, we believe in our business model, which has demonstrated its resilience repeatedly in the past and
are confident it will do so again.

With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to discuss our next phase of response to COVID-19 and
provide some closing commentary.

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

Couldn't find the mute button, Mark. Thank you. With our ships in safe harbor and an enhanced liquidity
position post our extremely successful capital raise, we now shift our focus to the third phase of our
response as seen on Slide 15, executing on our road map for a new era of cruising. This phase is critical,
very critical, and will be predicated on 2 main factors: first, receiving approval to safely resume operations
from governments around the world, including the CDC; and second and most important, providing
consumers with absolute confidence in our ability to deliver safe and healthy vacation environment
through new and enhanced health and safety protocols, utilizing the latest state-of-the-art technologies
and testing methodologies.

Nothing will be more critical to resuming sustained and profitable long-term operations and making
cruising the safest option in the travel and leisure space and providing our guests with the peace of
mind around their good health while vacationing aboard our vessels. This will require a multipronged,
multidisciplinary and multi-agency and global strategy that will involve strong collaboration between cruise
lines, industry associations, national and local governments, public health agencies and ports around the
world.

Our goal is to preserve the traditional elements of the cruise experience, the great value, the multiple
destinations visited, the wide array of dining and entertainment offerings modified as necessary as to the
many changes we are becoming accustomed to in our daily lives.

Another area of focus is working with our port agents and operators around the globe to understand and
coordinate plans for reopening. This endeavor will undoubtedly involve fits and starts as destinations
decide when to reopen cruise ports. Overlaying these plans with possible new consumer demand trends
will guide the early days of our gradual relaunch, including which itineraries will first come online. Having
assets with rudders and propellers is a unique advantage to our industry as we can be extremely nimble
and reposition our ships as needed.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

While our operations team's focused on protocols and destination, our brand presidents will focus on
reactivating and accelerating the sales and marketing machine that is at the heart of our market to fill
philosophy. Our brands have done a fantastic job fostering demand in engaging guests and travel partners
in this challenging operating environment with our ships sitting idle. As we prepare for sailings to resume,
we will have to adapt our marketing strategy to focus on health and safety measures while, at the same
time, keeping sight on the overall drilling experience of cruising and what makes it such a unique vacation
experience in the travel industry.

With new protocols in place, coordination with ports and demand engines churning, what follows will be a
phased relaunch of voyages. We expect sailings to restart with a handful of vessels phasing in others over
a period of 5 to 6 months before we have our full fleet back in operation. As I said earlier, as with many
new endeavors, there will be fits and starts that will require the quick implementation of new protocols,
which we will continue to adapt as we learn what works and as newer, more efficient and more cost-
effective technologies involve and become readily available.

Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with a few key takeaways from Slide 16. First, we have
significantly strengthened our financial position to withstand a prolonged suspension of voyages by
significantly reducing operational and capital expenses and executing several liquidity-enhancing
measures, including a successful capital raise of $2.4 billion. Second, there continues to be demand
for cruise vacations despite limited marketing and demand-generating investments. And lastly, we are
intently focused on developing and executing the next level of health and safety protocols for a new era
of cruising, led by a seasoned management team that has proven its ability to navigate through uncertain
and challenging times.
And with that, Jonathan, let's open up the call for questions, please.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So focusing on the future, how do you think your higher domestic source mix and your higher absolute
yields will affect the way your recovery looks versus the industry in general?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

Thomas, I think there's a lot of muscle memory throughout the ecosystem and so everything is relative.
I think the demand -- overall demand certainly will be impacted. It will be weaker as we roll out, as the
economy takes its toll, as people need to regain confidence in the cruise industry and our ability to keep
them healthy. But if we were -- if we had the highest yields coming into this, I think we'll have the highest
yields during it and highest yields coming out of it. Part of it is because of our brands. Part of it is because
of our fleet. Part of it is because our go-to-market strategy, as you know, is not to discount to fill. It's to
market to fill. So we're very anxious to getting back to do what we do best, which is marketing. And as
you know, we have literally shut down the marketing machine, the sales and marketing machine over the
last 10 weeks or so. And despite that shutdown, as you've seen in our disclosures today, we're still taking
bookings. And that gives us a lot of encouragement that despite everything that's going on, people still
want to cruise. And I think that's the best indication we have that there is a future and the future will be
bright.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you -- there was some encouraging comments on the prepared
remarks around overall book position and pricing for 2021 being within historical ranges. How much of
that is new money being booked versus rebookings of existing mortgages? And how should we think about
that?

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The vast majority, the vast majority of the booked position today that has us within historical ranges,
and historical ranges for us means '17, '18, '19, '20, the last 3, 4 years, the vast majority is good old cash
bookings. Over time, as people finalize their future plans, we hope that they do take advantage of those
future cruise certificates, which, as you know, are good through the end of 2022. So they've got plenty of
time. But today, the vast majority of those sailings -- of those bookings, I should say, are just normal cash
bookings.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I guess -- I know there's a lot of unknowns, but how do you think about the free cash flow generation at
the ship level at various occupancy levels as you start seeing some go back out in the water and there are
still different social distancing measures that could be in place?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

Don't think of it as load factors. Think of it as total revenue. As you know, yield total revenue's made up of
3 variables: load factor, ticket revenue and onboard revenue. And so there is a relatively low total revenue
threshold before that particular sailing is cash positive. But look, the #1 factor as we relaunch operations
is not the -- necessarily the revenue of a particular sailing or the EBITDA of a particular sailing. It's
regaining the confidence of the consumer so the consumer can continue to book under the normal booking
curve. Remember, this is a forward-looking business. The cash flows that comes from customer deposits
and the advanced payments is what fuels this industry and what has been draining out of everybody's
treasury over the last 10 weeks or so as we either cancel sailings or people cancel their own voyages for a
myriad of reasons.

So as we start operations, we've got to regain momentum, Stephen. This is an industry, a company that
was running 1,000 miles an hour and overnight was shut down to just a screeching halt, and we've got
to get that momentum back. And so I am less concerned about what the EBITDA, the revenue may be
of a particular sailing, especially in the first 30 or 60 to 90 days, but I'm more concerned about getting
back normal operations, getting back to the sales and marketing machine, churning out which churns out
the cash flow necessary to rebuild our advanced ticket sales because the important part is knowing that
people book 7, 8 months in advance, let's not forget that. And so I'm concerned about cash inflows in
the short term as we resume operations, and we'll be looking at what revenue and EBITDA will be 6, 7, 8
months after that in the normal course of what the booking curves are.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And as a related follow-up, can you just remind us, what percentage of forward bookings
typically come onboard the ships? And any other color? It sounds like you're kind of going down this path,
but around when working capital would potentially inflect as we think about different booking curves and
ships coming back out in the water.

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

I'm not sure I understand the question, Stephen.

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Stephen, I think -- this is Mark. So there's 2 pieces to that. I think you were asking how much -- how
many customers book while on board? Is that correct?

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Correct.

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I don't think we've disclosed that but, obviously, we have very solid programs under our
CruiseNext program, where we are able to secure forward bookings but we don't give publicly those
numbers. In terms of the working capital, the way we're thinking about it is, look, we've -- one of the
positive signs that we've seen is we've seen a significant inflow of new bookings and new cash but as well
as customers with existing bookings. And while we are now in the process of obviously refunding quite
a few customers their advanced bookings, we believe that in the next 30 to 60 days, we are going to be
working capital positive as a result of the new and existing cash that's coming in from those bookings. So
you will see it. There is going to be a little bit of a slow ramp-up to that. But again, in the next 30 to 60
days, we see a positive working capital from that.

Harry Croyle Curtis
Instinet, LLC, Research Division

Wanted to go back to the comments you made, Frank, about the importance of customer confidence.
You've recently brought on Scott Gottlieb as a consultant. Can you walk us through some of the new
protocols that -- what they might look like to improve that confidence as potential customers consider
cruising again and the safety aspect?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

Look, I don't want to run what we're going to be developing. That is up to all the experts that we have
put together. We think we've put together a very strong team. So it's first things first. The #1 gain
consideration today is to get the CDC to lift a no-sale order. That's job 1. Can't go very far without that.
And so we have to introduce a series, what I would refer to as robust and comprehensive series of
protocols that gives the CDC confidence that the environment onboard a cruise ship is healthy.

And then once we do that, we have to communicate whatever those protocols may be to the traveling
public and bring -- and give them the same confidence that we were able to instill in the CDC. So it's a
multipronged process. Similar submissions to the CDC will likely have to also take place around the world.
The U.S. isn't the only country concerned with the spread of COVID-19, they all are. We've seen some
recent cracks in the opening, if you will, of what's happening in the EU. They have a more unified plan in
place to gradually reopen borders and therefore tourism. So that's very helpful and encouraging.

But this will take some time. We want to do this right, Harry. This is not an exercise of optics. This is not
an exercise of, let's get away with the minimum required. I want to do everything humanly possible within
the bounds of what technology offers us today to be able to look my own family in the eye and say, "You
are safe to go onboard our cruise ships." And until we do that, respective of what the CDC or anybody else
might say, we're not going to operate. We want to make sure that we preserve and enhance the equity
value of our 3 brands, and you're not going to do that if you have outbreaks of disease on board. So it's
still too early to talk about specifics but know that everything is on the table to make sure that we can
provide that health, security and confidence among all stakeholders.

Harry Croyle Curtis
Instinet, LLC, Research Division

Maybe a quick follow-up on the comment that Mark just made about working capital positive. Can you talk
about your -- the expectations of how -- when you get -- when you begin to market again, when you get
2 or 3 ships in the water, is that likely to lift the velocity of bookings as customers actually feel confident
that they can set itineraries? And Mark, maybe you can comment on how you get to maybe a 30- to 60-
day narrowing of that working capital gap, and whether or not just by setting those itineraries is really the
primary catalyst for that.

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think -- so first, let me be clear that since we've shut down, and I'll reference the month of April,
we have taken a significant amount of new cash bookings and collected a significant amount of advanced
ticket sales. And that is during a period where we had a horrific news flow and we had essentially 0
marketing in the market. And that continues through May and it continues to increase. So I think you're
absolutely right. To the extent when we can actually get voyages on sale and we actually start to really
spend a little bit more marketing dollars, I think you're going to see that flywheel spin even quicker.

But even without that, and again, that's what's important and why we're so confident here is that we
continue to take in a significant amount of cash today. And so it is not our working capital -- my working
capital comments are not dependent on us saying that we have to announce an itinerary in 1 month or
2 months or 3 months. That will help and that will help accelerate but it is not dependent upon that. So
again, it just continues to demonstrate with the new cash coming in, the resiliency of this industry.

And consumers are smart. They understand that there will be solutions. We are seeing customers come
back. They're booking, obviously, not to the volumes that we would like to see in a normal environment.
But consumers know this product's going to be there and that they have confidence in it. So bottom line is
that will help but it is definitely not dependent on that.

Harry Croyle Curtis
Instinet, LLC, Research Division

Well, that's a positive statement relative to the negative press that you see in the media these days. Good
luck with that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is probably for both of you, Frank and Mark. Just question/ clarification on your booking commentary
because it seems to have moved around over the past few weeks and we've just been getting a lot of
questions on that. So when you filed your 8-K on April 27, and that data was as of April 17, you said the
2020 book position was meaningfully lower with pricing down low single digits. And then that changed
in a following 8-K. You said that bookings as of 4/24 were meaningfully lower but pricing was now down
mid-singles. And then for '21, the pricing commentary didn't change but the booking commentary did,
so as of 4/17, your book position was flat. And then at 4/24, it was slightly lower. In both cases, pricing
remained down to single digits. And then in this release, there wasn't really a lot of color on the booking
commentary. So just trying to get an idea overall about the trends because just based on that, it seems
like they're getting worse. But also like is it even meaningful, right? So like how much of an indication do
you think it really gives us for pricing and bookings once cruising actually opens up?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

So Felicia, as time goes on, remember, we started the year in a incredibly better book position than
any other time. We had a huge lead. We had a huge lead at the end of February. And as the COVID-19
pandemic has worked its way through the booking process, we're taking less bookings than we were this
time last year. We're still taking bookings, as Mark said. It's encouraging to see how much bookings we're
taking, given that the entire sales and marketing apparatus is shut down that we're working virtually. The
travel agents, which still make up the majority of our business, is not at full strength either.

But as time goes on and we take on less bookings in the current period or periods than prior year, you're
going to see a deficit being built over time as we continue to be shut down and not until we reopen all the
sales and marketing activities and the travel agents reopen for business, et cetera, would you see a pivotal
acceleration of new business that hopefully gets us back to a rate that allows us to sail full. So over time,
if things continue the way they are today, over time, the commentary will be that we are falling behind to
where we were this time last year because we are taking less bookings today than we did a year ago.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay, that makes sense. And then just to clarify something you said earlier because you said it very fast.
Just that -- because we were talking about the historical booking patterns for '21 and you're saying, I
think that was in terms of how much is booked in '21 in the high teens. So I think you said 17%, 18%,
19%. Did I hear that right?

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

No, I think that was a reference to say when we look at our historical trends, it was based on calendar
years '17 through '20.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

Yes, not a percentage.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. So -- but if we look at -- got you. If we look at normal historical booking patterns though just for
the industry in general, I think this time this year, the following year is somewhere around 20%, 25%
booked. So is that the metric when you're staying in line with historical patterns?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

We won't comment as to your high-teen 25% because we typically don't comment on where our book
position is for the following year at this early stage. But we are comparing where we are right now for
'21 compared to where we were right now a year ago for '20 and compared to what we call the historical
range, which includes 2017, '18, '19.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just on your comment that the full fleet could return in 5 to 6 months, I was just
wondering, is that based on customer surveys you're doing now and the booking curve? And do you
think you'll be sailing at historical occupancy levels? Or does that really depend on kind of some of the
regulations that will be in place?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The return to service of a phased approach of roughly 5 vessels per month is what we believe we
operationally could handle in terms of bringing back the ship from cold lay-up, including re-crewing the
vessels, et cetera. And so that -- given that we have 28 vessels, if you bring back an average of 5 vessels
a month, it's going to take about 6 months to get all ships back operating. Now that assumes that the
itineraries that these ships would operate are available for operations. And so it could be that if ship #19
is operating a certain itinerary and that itinerary is not open or certain key ports in that itinerary are not
open then maybe that, that vessel has to stay late up longer periods of time.

So the 6-month ramp-up assumes, more than anything else, our operational capability to ramp up and
that the ports are open, has nothing to do with consumer demand because we believe consumer demand
and the bookings that follow are based on our ability to market, travel agents being back open again, the
whole industry being back in operation as opposed to sitting idle, et cetera.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And on the occupancy side, do you think you'll be sailing at regular occupancy levels?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

No, I don't think so one bit. I think it'll take time to ramp up loads. We don't know, for example, whether
government agencies will require us to initially sail at less than 100%, even if there was demand to sail
100%. Just remember, the -- it's very easy and very quickly to dismantle the whole apparatus and that it
takes time to refill the apparatus. So if the booking curve on average is 7 to 8 months, it's going to take at
least that long without taking in consideration economic factors of how it may have affected the consumer
to get the pipeline back to a full or near-full environment.

And so this is going to take time. All we can do now is use some level of reasonable projections. But
until we get back in the game and recognize that being back in the game could be different than it was

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

before for the reasons I noted before, what are the protocols that we will have to operate by, what ports
are open, et cetera, those are the biggest gating factors, not necessarily consumer demand. I believe
that consumer demand in this industry and this -- these 3 brands of ours are very apt at marketing. The
travel agents are well behind us. There is pent-up demand, let's not forget that. People only talk about
the negative, but the fact that the industry has been shut down now over 4 months, there'll be pent-up
demand. People will want to cruise again. And so all those are positive factors. But nothing takes the place
of time and we have to be conscious of that.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

I have just 2 quick questions. Were you able to take advantage of the drop in oil that we saw in April?
Because you had a slide in the appendix shows oil prices just at the end of March. And my other question
is, the people who are booking, are they booking -- are you getting bookings from people who are within
driving distance to the ship they're booking on? Or are you still -- are you seeing people who are booking
also going to fly to get to the port -- the ship that he's booking on?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

I'll take your second question and Mark will answer your question about fuel. I thought somebody would
ask me this type of question so I looked into it. For the Ocean and Regent brand, their #1 itinerary in
terms of demand for Q1, early Q2 is Japan, it's Dubai, several of the World Cruise segment. So therefore,
you have to fly there. And so this notion that people aren't going to want to cruise to faraway places or
exotic destinations, what we're seeing is defying that. So we're not seeing any particular area of strength
other than these Japanese itineraries, these World Cruise segments that are sold out literally. No particular
destination is performing particularly well or particularly bad. People are booking and people are canceling
sailings in the future at the pro rata rate that we have those itineraries available either. I'll let Mark answer
the question about fuel.

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

So yes, we did take advantage of some of the recent fuel pricing and opportunistically layered on some
hedges for '22 and '23. We didn't do anything for the remainder of 2020, obviously, because we're already
68% hedged for the back half of the year. And really, the big question is when are we going to be able
to restart. So we didn't want to do anything there and we continue to look at 2021. So we -- now that
we have our capital raise behind us, we will continue to focus on that. And again, from an opportunistic
standpoint where it makes sense, we will enter that market.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Just one other quick question. In the fact that some of your -- like Regent Cruises include plane tickets
and you have had promotions in the past that include airfare, do you think there's an opportunity to work
with the airlines who, unfortunately, like your industry have been unfairly hurt by this to get a deal on
plane tickets that you could help market in the future to people who want -- who cruise but don't live close
to the ports?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

We definitely believe that airfares in the near to -- in the next 6 to 12 months will be lower than usual so it
will be a tailwind to cost. And we'll look to do more and more promotions, including air on itineraries that
require that, yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour from JPMorgan.

Brandt Antoine Montour
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just one for me. Based on the internal scenarios that you're running for load and for price and assuming
you can't start sailing in August, roughly how much of your fleet do you think needs to be in the water to
break even on an EBITDA basis?

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Brent, this is Mark. So again, I think there's 2 ways to think about this, right? In terms of -- if you
look at our historical EBITDA margins, they're about 30%, so that kind of gives you upwards of 30%.
That kind of gives you how much -- whether it's revenue or a combination of costs we can reduce and you
could translate that into a percentage of fleet. But then it depends on whether or not the ships are full or
operating at reduced load. But as Frank had said earlier, our concern right now is not, are we operating
in a positive EBITDA or a negative EBITDA? We are -- we need to gain momentum. We need to get ships
in the water to accelerate the product awareness and get that ATS cash flywheel going again. And that's
what we're focused on for the next 6 to 8 months.

So there's not a magic number of ships because there's just too many dynamics between the pricing
and the load and then what the spend is. So I will tell you that we -- obviously, we don't want to run the
business at a loss but we will have to run the business at a loss for the next few months, but it's more
importantly about getting that cash flywheel going again. So...

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Mark, let me ask the working capital question a little bit differently and I hope this makes sense. But you
guys have indicated this morning that -- I don't remember which adjective you used but a good bit of the
2021 bookings are new or unique bookings. So after the first wave of refunds that have already occurred,
is it fair to say that for every dollar you are refunding now, you're bringing in a new dollar for an advanced
booking? Or is that ratio still tilted way more toward a net cash outflow?

Mark A. Kempa
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would say looking at it today, there's still -- it is still definitely weighted towards a net cash outflow.
And what I was referring to earlier is that when we look over the course of the next 60 days, by the end
of that 60-day period, we believe that ratio would flip to a positive. And that's just a matter of timing,
and again, given the amount of refunds that we are implementing as a result of the canceled voyages. So
again, that's -- I would -- we anticipate in the next 60 days that, that is a positive ratio. But I will tell you,
again, it's very encouraging that we are substantially offsetting those refunds with that new cash coming
in, and that's where we definitely see some of the green shoots of this industry.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay, got you. And then second question, I think it might be for Frank or you, Mark. But I assume you
guys have run all kinds of scenarios as to what the business looks like as it comes back online. And can
you kind of help us think about the time lines you guys are kind of projecting or expecting that we might
be looking at in order for you guys to return to some kind of profitability level, whether that's a 2019 level
or whether that's a 2018 level? Anything like that would be pretty helpful as well.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

So let's start with 2020. 2020 is a wasted year. At a minimum, the industry is going to go the entire
Q2 without a penny of revenue, impossible to overcome. Depending on how quickly we can reopen and
whether, in our case, for example, can we execute on the plan that I laid out where we bring back the
fleet gradually over a 6-month period. So pick a date. But just for argument's sake, pick October 1 as the
first start date, and I only pick October 1, don't read much more into what except that it's beginning of
a quarter. And you figure that we won't be fully operational until the end of Q1 of '21. And during that
time, you are ramping up your marketing, travel agents hopefully around the world, especially in the U.S.,
coming back to work. The booking curve traditionally is 7, 8 months.

You put all those factors to work and what you end up with is a very challenging period of time through
Q1, getting better in Q2, every subsequent sequential quarter is better, whether you get back to full
operation, full load factor, full pricing sometime in '22, I personally don't believe. I think the runway will
be longer. But '21 will be a transition year. And then you can start the rebuilding in earnest in '22 forward.
And whether you get back to 2019 levels in late '22 or in '23, and if you're really pessimistic, in '24,
there's so many details involved.

Steve, I know you know this, the normal -- the things we normally talk about are out the door. We're
talking about just -- it's almost like relaunching a company from scratch when you have the entire fleet
shut down and you don't know when you're going to be able to start again because it's not up to you. It's
up to public health officials and governments around the world. It's very difficult to predict with certainty
revenue and EBITDA. As I said before, it's a building block. And the building block starts with when can
we start to operate? When can we start marketing? Marketing is the seat of cash. Cash comes in 6, 7,
8 months later. That cash can be recognized as revenue and therefore then EBITDA. So we got to have
patience. It took decades to build this industry. And in a matter of weeks, we dismantled it, and it's going
to take not decades to build it up again but it's going to take a little time. And we just have to be patient.
No one is more impatient than me. But I recognize that this is going to be a recovery effort that's going to
take multiple quarters, perhaps multiple years to get back to the good old days of 2019.

Operator

Our final question then for today comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research.

Vince Charles Ciepiel
Cleveland Research Company

So it sounds like your plan is, if things go right, maybe 5 to 6 months of reactivation and reactivating the
full 100% of your fleet. I know you have a bit relatively younger age in your fleet versus the industry.
But could you comment on what percent, if at all, do you think the industry may lay up or retire or scrap
through this pandemic?

Frank J. Del Rio
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I can't speak for the industry at large with any kind of specifics. As you pointed out, we have a very
young fleet so none of our vessels are remotely eligible, if you will, for scrapping or for anything else. I do
believe in a macro environment, given what we are facing, that you're going to find that certain vessels
will be retired, vessels that might have been marginal performers in good times may not be worthy, so to
speak, of staying in service. So you might see that. You might see new delivery.

I remember all you guys being so worried about capacity increases and over the last couple of years that
it was 5% or 6%, and it was a couple of points higher than the historical average. And oh my God, oh my
God, and you saw how the industry was able to easily digest new capacity coming online, and we all had
the best years of our history. But I do believe that certain vessels that may be scheduled for delivery in
the next 12 to 18 months may be delayed and that will help the capacity situation.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 14, 2020

And different companies will have different plans on how to bring back their fleets. One of the things that
I've been telling folks that I usually don't say is that I'm glad I only have 28 ships. Usually, I want more
ships. That's why we have 9 vessels on order because when you have what you have and they're all full
and you're making lots of money with them, you want more vessels. But in this environment, I'm glad I
have less vessels.

So look, like in many industries that are facing the kind of challenges we're facing, there's going to be
survivors and there's going to be some that don't survive and there's going to be success stories and
failures. We think we're in very, very good position, given our liquidity profile, given the quality of our
assets, our go-to-market strategy, our management team. So we feel like we will be one of the success
stories that will write the history books on COVID-19. We'll see where the chips fall for everybody else.

Thank you, operator. I look forward to our next call in 90 days or so. Things will, I'm sure, will be very,
very different. I hope they're different for the best. In the meantime, I hope you all stay healthy and
continue fighting the good fight. Thank you very much.
