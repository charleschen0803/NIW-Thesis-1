Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Mettler-Toledo International
Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jamaria, and I will be your audio coordinator for today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn our presentation over to your hostess for today's call, Ms.
Mary Finnegan. Please proceed, ma'am.

Mary T. Finnegan
Head of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm responsible for Investor Relations at
Mettler-Toledo and happy that you're joining us. I'm on the call today with Olivier Filliol, our CEO; and
Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer.

Let me cover just a couple of financial or administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available
on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation is also available on our website.

Let me summarize the safe harbor language, which is outlined on Page 2 of the presentation. Statements
in this presentation, which are not historical facts, constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of
activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any
forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see our recent Form
10-K and other reports filed with the SEC from time to time.

All of our forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed
under the captions "Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results" and in the "Business and Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections of our filings.

Just one other item. On today's call, we may use non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed information
with respect to the use of and the differences between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly
comparable GAAP measure is provided in our Form 8-K. Let me now turn the call over to Olivier.

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Mary. Good evening, everyone. I hope this continues to find you safe and well. I'm calling in
from Switzerland tonight, while Shawn and Mary are in Columbus, Ohio. I will start with a summary of the
quarter, and then Shawn will provide details on our financials. I will then add some additional comments,
and we will open the lines for Q&A.

The highlights for the quarter are on Page 3 of the presentation. Local currency sales increased 6% in
the third quarter, which was much better than we expected. Demand in our end markets continues to
be negatively impacted by COVID-19. However, we had excellent growth in China, and the performance
of our Lab business was very strong. With our strong product portfolio and the innovative sales and
marketing strategy, which we have successfully adapted through the challenges of the new environment,
we believe we are gaining share. We have very strong growth in operating margins due to the benefits of
some of our temporary cost actions as well as our ongoing margin and productivity initiatives.

Growth in adjusted EPS and cash flow was excellent in the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our
performance in the quarter given all the ongoing challenges of COVID.

As we look to finish this year and into next year, we remain cautious on the global economy. The impact
of COVID on different regions of the world continues to evolve and change quickly. And the ultimate
repercussions to the global economy are still to be determined.

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Our strategy is to remain focused on those items we can control, namely keep our employees safe and
continue to serve our customers, the majority of which are in essential end markets of life sciences
and food manufacturing. We have been successful in continuing to launch new products while, at the
same time, ensuring our go-to-market approach is most effective given current customer dynamics. Our
adjusted go-to-market model and full leverage of Spinnaker has proved to be exceptionally powerful in
this environment. This includes incorporating digital tools and techniques to engage with customers in
remote settings. Versus our direct competition, we believe this has provided a very strong advantage and
has reinforced the leadership position that we hold in the vast majority of our product lines.

Based on market conditions today, we believe we can continue to gain share and deliver solid results
in 2020 and 2021. I will have some additional comments on this topic shortly, but let me first turn it to
Shawn to cover the financials.

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Olivier, and hello, everyone. Sales were $807.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 6% in local
currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 7% as currency benefited sales growth by 1% in the
quarter.

On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 3% in the Americas, 4% in
Europe and 10% in Asia/Rest of World. China local currency sales increased 17% in the quarter.

The next slide shows sales growth by region year-to-date. Local currency sales declined 1% in the
Americas, 2% in Europe and increased 1% in Asia/Rest of World. China local currency sales increased 5%
on a year-to-date basis.

On Slide #6, we outline local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, Laboratory sales
increased 9%, Industrial increased 1%, with Core Industrial up 8% and Product Inspection down 9%. Food
Retail increased 5% in the quarter. One question I know you have is how much benefit did we have from
COVID tailwinds in the quarter. We estimate our local currency sales growth benefited between 1% and
2% in the third quarter from COVID.

The next slide shows sales growth by product area for the 9-month period. Laboratory sales increased 2%.
Industrial declined 2%, with Core Industrial up 1% and Product Inspection down 7%. Food Retail declined
7% on a year-to-date basis.

Let me now move to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, which is summarized on the next slide. Gross
margin in the quarter was 58.2%, a 50 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.7%. Our margin
initiatives centered on pricing in Stern Drive contributed to the margin growth. We also benefited from
temporary cost actions, offset in part by higher transportation costs and unfavorable mix.

R&D amounted to $34.7 million, which represents a 7% decline in local currency. The decline is principally
driven by timing of activity as well as some temporary cost savings measures.

I would expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the historical range of 5% for the full year.

SG&A amounted to $205 million, a 1% decrease in local currency over the prior year. Our temporary
cost containment measures as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives were principal contributors to this
decline.

Adjusted operating profit amounted to $230 million in the quarter, which is a 17% increase over the prior
year amount of $196.2 million. Operating margins increased 250 basis points in the quarter to 28.5%. We
are very pleased with this margin growth.

A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $14.1 million in the quarter. Interest
expense was $9.3 million in the quarter. Other income amounted to $3.8 million. Our effective tax rate in
the quarter was 20.5% before discrete items and adjusting for the timing of stock option exercises. We
expect to maintain this rate in Q4 in 2021.

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Moving to fully diluted shares, which amounted to $24.2 million in the quarter and is a 3% decline from
the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $7.02, a 22% increase over the prior year amount of
$5.77. On a reported basis in the quarter, EPS was $6.68 as compared to $5.20 in the prior year. Reported
EPS in the quarter includes $0.12 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.15 of restructuring and a $0.07
difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises.

The next slide shows our year-to-date results. Local currency sales were flat for the first 9 months, and
adjusted operating profit increased 5%. Operating margins increased 140 basis points in the 9-month
period. Adjusted EPS amounted to $16.30, an increase of 9% over the prior year amount of $15.02. That
is it for the P&L, and let me now cover the cash flow.

In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $212 million, which is an increase of 44% on a per-
share basis as compared to the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation. DSO declined
3 days in the quarter to 36 days as compared to the prior year. We are seeing concrete results from our
focus on receivable collections and cash flow management during this period. ITO came in at 4.3x.

On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow was $430 million as compared to the prior year amount
of $345.1 million. On a per-share basis, this is a 29% increase. We now expect full year adjusted free cash
flow to be in the $600 million range to repurchase approximately 775 million shares in 2020, which would
put us in our targeted range of approximately a 1.5x net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio.

Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging given the significant uncertainty
surrounding COVID-19 and the ultimate impact for the global economy. We do not assume any
deterioration in the global economy or that our customers are subject to lockdowns again. Visibility is
limited and market dynamics are fluid and changes in customer demand can happen quickly. While the
economy is outside of our control, we continue to feel confident about the factors within our control,
namely executing on our sales and marketing initiatives and continuing to launch new products with clear
value-added benefits to our customers.

We believe we are well positioned to continue to gain share and have been successful in identifying
and capitalizing on pockets of growth despite the challenges within our end markets. We also expect to
continue to generate margin improvement, driven by our pricing and Stern Drive initiatives.

Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2020, we now expect local currency sales growth will be
approximately 1% as compared to the prior year. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of
$24.87 to $24.97, which is a growth rate of 9% to 10%. With respect to the fourth quarter, we would
expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 5% and expect adjusted EPS to be in a
range of $8.60 to $8.70, a growth rate of 11% to 12%. For 2021, we expect local currency sales growth
to be in the range of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS to be $27.50 to $28.30. Given the midpoint of 2020
guidance, this results in a growth rate of 10% to 14%.

Some further comments on 2021 guidance. We expect interest expense to be approximately $41 million
in 2021 and total amortization to be $53.5 million. Other income, which is below operating profit, will only
amount to approximately $4 million in 2021 as compared to $13 million this year due to lower expected
pension income. As I mentioned earlier, we would have expected -- we would expect our effective tax rate
in 2021 to remain at 20.5%.

In terms of free cash flow for the full year, we expect it to be in the range of $640 million to $650 million.
We will continue to repurchase shares and expect to end 2021 in our targeted range of approximately 1.5
net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio.

Some additional details. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to
increase sales growth by approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, neutral for the full year 2020. In 2021,
we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 2%. In terms of EPS, currency is neutral in
2020 and will benefit EPS growth by approximately 1.5% in 2021.

That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Olivier.

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating results. Our Lab business had
outstanding growth in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth and benefited from COVID-related
activities. Process Analytics and automated chemistry also had very good growth, driven by the overall
strength in biopharma trends. Most other product lines showed modest growth. Sales growth in all
regions was strong. We expect the strong biopharma trends to continue to be favorable as we enter
2021 and believe the first half of the year will benefit from a vaccine research and testing as well as
bioproduction scale-up and production. We spent a disproportionate amount of R&D and sales and
marketing investments in Lab and believe we are well positioned to capture growth.

In terms of our Industrial business, Core Industrial was up 8%, driven by strong double-digit growth in
China and slight decline in both Europe and the Americas. China is benefiting from strong demand across
most product lines, in part due to pent-up demand. Overall, we are very pleased with the resiliency of our
Core Industrial businesses in 2020 given the challenges of the end market. Our outlook for this business
is solid as we expect to continue to identify pockets of growth. However, we are not immune to the overall
economy.

Product Inspection was down a little more than we expected in the quarter with declines in all regions.
In the near term, market conditions continued to be challenging as large packaged food companies
are focused on COVID-related safety in the manufacturing site and on operational execution. We are
more optimistic for Q4 and are well positioned once packaged food companies return to a more normal
operational mode and believe we will benefit from pent-up demand. However, it will take some more time
for this to develop.

Food Retail grew mid-single digit in Q3, better than we had anticipated. This business will likely be
relatively flat in Q4, and looking to 2021, we expect growth in the low single-digit range.

Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 4% with good
growth in Lab and Food Retail. We would expect sales growth in Europe to be relatively flat in Q4 and
low to mid-single digit growth in 2021. Americas increased 3% with very strong growth in Lab, offset by
declines in Product Inspection and, to a lesser degree, Core Industrial. We would expect better growth in
Q4 in the Americas, and we expect mid-single digit growth in 2021.

Finally, Asia/Rest of World grew 10% in the quarter with both Lab and Industrial doing very well. As
mentioned, China had 17% growth in the quarter, with excellent growth across most product lines. We
would expect China to continue to do well for the remainder of this year, although we do not expect the
same level of pent-up demand that we saw in Q3. We expect market conditions to be favorable in 2021,
although China will face tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. One final comment on the
business. Service and consumables were up 6% in the quarter.

That concludes my comments on a business. While 2020 has been extraordinary on many different levels,
we remain focused on our core growth strategy. We are the market leader in the vast majority of our
product lines and have a weighted average share in the 25% range. We have long spoken to you about
our strategy, namely, to introduce new products and use leading edge data-driven sales and marketing
initiatives to gain market share each year. Small gains in market share can have a meaningful impact to
our growth. We believe we have accelerated market share gains this year by enhancing our digital sales
and marketing tools and combining this with advanced data analytics to identify and guide our field force
to the best potential opportunities. We couldn't accomplish this without investment we have made over
many years to structure our front-end to allow our direct field reps to spend majority of their time on
noncustomers and customers with good cross-selling potential.

Let me provide you a little more context to this. The challenges surrounding COVID provided an
opportunity to accelerate digital sales and marketing development that were already underway. On
the same call one year ago, well before COVID was a factor, I discussed with you the efforts that were
underway surrounding digital sales tools to free up our field resources for more impactful discussions
with our customers. These sales tools included a new digital library for storing vast resources as well
as field sales mobility solutions, mobile CRM and the launch of eDemo for more efficient product demo.

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

With this foundation already in place, we were able to quickly adapt and transform our go-to-market for
remote capabilities in March. We further enhanced our digital capabilities this year with developments
like simple product demos through eDemo, live and core browsing capabilities with our customers via
Microsoft Teams. This has allowed us to maintain engagement with our customers despite the challenges
that COVID has brought to remote work environment.

Digital sales and marketing tools are one component. We also use advanced data analytics and machine
learning to identify thousands and thousands of customer sites that have potential sales opportunity.
During this past year, we had -- we also leveraged heat map of customer segments that helped us
navigate COVID resilience and recovery. Internally, these opportunities generate sales alert that
we provide to our front-end organization. The alerts include insightful information, such as product
descriptions, cross-selling opportunities, contact data, CRM activity, site pictures and specific value-selling
guide for associated products and more. We have structured our front-end so that back office resources
can qualify these sales alerts. They have knowledge of our customers and can determine if the computer-
generated alerts have the expected potential, and if so, the ideal timing for customer interaction. This
helps us guide our direct field sales force to the best opportunities and with all the necessary materials for
an effective customer interaction.

We also leverage our front-end via telesales reps to sell to smaller or less complicated accounts. The
digital demo tools available to our field force are also fully available to our telesales teams, thereby
supporting their efforts to articulate the value of our products to customers. With the investments we have
made in inside and telesales resources over the last several years, our front-end is now structured. The
field reps spend the majority of their time on noncustomers or existing customers with strong cross-selling
potential. The combination of our strong product portfolio, the innovations we have made to our sales and
marketing tools and the investments we have made over several years to our front-end organization is
leading to accelerated market share gains versus our direct competitors. There are still relatively small
gains overall, but they have allowed us to help offset the challenging market conditions of the COVID
environment.

The COVID challenges have [indiscernible] accelerated [indiscernible] in our sales [indiscernible]
approach, but also in our margin and productivity...

Operator

Olivier has rejoined us.

Mary T. Finnegan
Head of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you.

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Yes, I am back. I was interrupted. Shawn is just signaling me by video that I -- where I stopped.
So I will continue on. And I was just finishing talking about sales and marketing initiatives, and I'm
coming to the point that digital sales and marketing tools are one component. We also use advanced
data analytics and machine learning to identify thousands and thousands of customer sites that have
potential sales opportunities. During this past year, we also leveraged heat map of customer segments
that helped us navigate COVID resilience and recovery. Internally, these opportunities generate sales
alerts that we provide to our front-end organization. The alerts include insightful information such as
project descriptions, cross-selling opportunities, contact data, CRM activity, site pictures and specific

We have structured our front-end so that back office inside sales resources can qualify these sales alerts.
They have knowledge of customers and can determine the computer-generated alerts have the expected

We also leverage our front-end via telesales reps to sell to smaller or less complicated accounts. The

made in inside and telesales resources over the last several years, our front-end is now structured, the
field reps spend the majority of their time on noncustomers or existing customers with strong cross-selling
potential.

The combination of our strong product portfolio, the innovations we have made, our delta marketing
tools and the investments we have made over several years to our front-end organization is leading to
accelerated market share gains versus our direct competitors. They are still relatively small gains overall,
but they have allowed us to help offset the challenging market conditions of the COVID environment.

The COVID challenges have helped us accelerate improvement, not only in our sales techniques and
approach, but also in our margins and productivity initiatives. Our supply chain teams around the world
had to overcome numerous obstacles this year, including obtaining necessary protection supplies,
compensating for component shortages, orchestrating global safety stock, navigating freight capacity
and adapting to changing trade restrictions. We were one of the first manufacturing facilities [ to have
opened ] in China, and we did not have a single day of shutdown in our western facility. At the same time,
the team continues to make progress on their Stern Drive initiatives, which are focused on productivity
improvements in our manufacturing and back-office operations. Globally, more than 130 projects have
been completed this year with 350 projects currently underway.

That concludes our prepared comments. The current environment continues to be the most challenging
and unique we have ever faced. We are executing very well, and while much uncertainty still exist in our
markets, I remain confident we can continue to gain share regardless of economic conditions and are well
positioned for solid results in 2020 and 2021.
I want now to ask the operator to open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a really good print here. Olivier, maybe on the China comments, the 17% growth here, could
you maybe help clarify what portion of that 17% was perhaps pent-up demand? And I think you guys
mentioned 1 to 2 points of COVID tailwinds. Is the COVID tailwind the same as pent-up demand? Or is
that a separate item?

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

Let me do the second part first because that's easy to answer. No, it's not correlated with pent-up.
The tailwind from COVID is mainly coming in tips business that we have with our Rainin and biotech
businesses. They serve the testing markets, the COVID testing markets. So we got that tailwind, as pent-
up is not labeled that way. China -- to isolate the pent-up aspect of the China growth is not so easy to
quantify. But I think another way to look at our numbers in China is the year-to-date. As you will recall, in
the early part of the year, China had a significant decline and here, we have seen a very good recovery in
Q3. And in that sense, there is a significant aspect of that is pent-up demand. We see kind of a V-shaped
recovery.

But beyond that, I certainly feel we have won good market share gains here in China. The team has
executed extremely well during the whole COVID crisis. We -- when there was a lockdown, our Chinese
team continued to stay in contact with customers. We were very fast in bringing deliveries back and have
certainly gained a lot of confidence with the customer base. And then we had the whole go-to-market
change in management that I described before in the prepared remarks. This is -- we did roll that out
globally, but also, particularly in China, and that has benefited us also in Q3. So different aspects that
drove very nice growth, but pent-up demand was certainly one of them.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful. And then now for my follow-up, I guess when you look at the '21 preliminary outlook, 4%
to 6%, I'm curious, are you assuming any share gains within that 4% to 6%? And perhaps comment on
what's being assumed for the different segments.

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So let me take the first part, and then Shawn can take the second part. In terms of share gain, yes,
we do count on share gains. But I -- our whole strategy is not for bold share gains, but actually share
gains every year a few basis points because that adds up to something significant when we think about
organic growth. We have experienced here maybe in the last 2 quarters a bigger shift in share gains. I
would hope that in next year, we can still also have maybe a little bit an above average share gain, but not
in the same magnitude as we have seen in the last 2 quarters.

Shawn, maybe to the second part of the question?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Vijay, let me start first with the product categories, and then I'll talk about the regions. So for 2021,
we currently would expect the Lab business to be mid- to high single-digit growth. In the Industrial
business, we're currently thinking the Product Inspection business will be about mid-single-digit growth,

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

with the Core Industrial business being more like low single-digit growth. And we expect food retailing to
be more like low single-digit growth. From a regional perspective, we would -- we're currently thinking
that Europe will be more low to mid-single-digit growth, while the Americas and China will be more like
mid-single-digit growth.

Operator

Your next question will come from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Actually, Shawn, I want to pick up right where you left off on Europe, being flat in the fourth quarter, low
to mid-single-digit next year. Obviously, COVID cases going up a lot there. The Horizon's 2020 budget has
been cut. What gives you kind of confidence in that market being relatively stable?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, hey, Tycho, I think our guidance right now is based upon -- we're assuming market
conditions remain the same in terms of where we sit today. As we kind of think about COVID cases,
of course, it's a very fluid situation. We're currently not experiencing anything in our business where
customers are not allowing us on-site to do installations or we're not seeing it affect their behavior at this
time. But of course, there's certainly risks with COVID, and we certainly acknowledge that. But as you can
kind of see, too, our guidance for the fourth quarter for Europe is flattish. So it's modestly a little bit down
from where we were in the third quarter. And then for next year, again, we're thinking more like low to
mid-single-digit growth.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then Product Inspection, you mentioned that was a little bit worse than expected. You're talking
about mid-single-digit growth there next year. So are you getting leading indicators from your consumer
packaged goods customers and others that, that demand will come back sooner rather than later?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, it's an interesting one. We certainly have conversations with customers that indicate that
there's certainly an interest to do projects. But right now, we do see that a lot of customers are distracted
with their own operational challenges at the moment, not -- in terms of having the time to really initiate
new projects is something that we're still looking forward to. But nonetheless, we -- from a cadence
perspective, we do feel like the fourth quarter will be better than Q3, and we certainly are more optimistic
going into next year. And as you know, we feel very good about this business in terms of our overall
competitive advantages and the general dynamics that drive growth in this business around topics like
food safety and things like that. So we're much more optimistic for the midterm. It's just a little bit
difficult to tell at exactly what time we'll start to see customers returning to more of an investment mode.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then lastly for Olivier, there was a lot of talk on the call about market share gains, and that's great
to see. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about where those gains have been the greatest.
Anything you can kind of quantify? And then with the digital infrastructure now built out, how will they
step up share gains going forward? Could they start to accelerate?

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Yes. Actually, quantifying it, very difficult. Of course, we don't have particular market data from our
direct competitors. We have some data points from our peers that give us a lot of comfort. I think it's
more information that we get from our markets around the world. We see it also in terms of many new
customers that we can gain. We have some KPIs that we use internally to monitor how much of our
business comes from existing customers and how much comes from new customers. That all gives us
these indications that we have been winning share.

I would be really hard pressed to come up with a number. Also, what I want to say is we feel this is
something we achieved across the world, across businesses. And this is also very much driven by all these
programs that I described that we apply really across everything. What we certainly also see the biggest
benefit is in our direct business, and our direct business has been also growing faster than, for example,
the indirect business. That's probably another indication why these programs work really well.

Your next question will come from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.

Michael Leonidovich Ryskin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

It's Mike Ryskin on for Derik. First, I want to follow up on the guidance comments for '21 both on the top
line and on the adjusted EPS. Just curious, as you obviously posted strong results in 3Q and you've got
a mid-single-digit guide for 4Q, when you go into next year, you're going to be facing significantly easier
comps in the first half of the year. And your comp for all of the fiscal year '20 is going to be a little bit
easier. So I'm just wondering, is this more of a -- not a lot of visibility in the second half of the year? I
know we walked through some of the geographies and the business segments. But just curious where
you're seeing the puts and takes given what should be a very easy setup for first half '21.

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Mike, I'll take this one. It's Shawn. Hey, as you know, we're -- we don't have a lot of backlog in
our business. So we're only about 1.5 months of backlog at a time. So of course, it's always a little bit
challenging to put out our first guidance for next year. As we kind of look towards the year, you're right,
we will benefit from easier comparisons in the first half of the year. But then we look at topics like China
in Q3 of next year, and we'll have more difficult comparisons there. So overall, I would say we feel good
about the business. We feel good about our execution. We feel good about our momentum, but it's always
a little bit challenging to kind of -- to guide with some of the uncertainty out there.

If I look at like maybe puts and takes, I would say that China is always one that can be an upside or a
downside. China, we always like to say things can move -- can change rather quickly in China. And I think
over the last 9 months, we'd certainly see things change in both directions very quickly there. So we're
looking for upsides and downsides. I'd say -- I point out and highlight China. I think another one that I
would also highlight is Product Inspection. It's also a similar size of our total business. We feel very good
about this business, as I mentioned with Tycho's question. That's also a business that can have upside or
downside based upon some of the dynamics that I described earlier.

Michael Leonidovich Ryskin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then a quick follow-up along the same lines. If we sort of look at the P&L., if
my math is right for '21, obviously, you're guiding to about 40 basis points of margin expansion, give
or take, on the operating margin. So just trying to think through what changed in 2020 relative to your
initial expectations? Is this just a lot of the costs that you pulled back on this year coming back? Or is this
additional incremental investments on top of what would normally happen just sort of looking at the '20 to
'21 move there?

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Yes. So I think we'll probably do a little bit better than that, Mike, but you're right, it's going to be a little
bit lower than our typical guidance of 70 to 100 basis point range, which we still feel very good about
from a medium term perspective. We also have to keep in mind that we're coming off of a strong year
of operating profit margin growth in 2020 of 120 basis points. In terms of the program supporting our
margin, we feel really good about the momentum that we have in terms of the pricing program as well as
our Stern Drive program. But you're right, one of the things that will be maybe a little bit of a headwind
next year is the temporary nature of some of the cost savings measures that we had in 2020 that we now
need to bring back into the cost structure for 2021.

Operator

Your next question will come from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Shawn, sticking with the 2021 outlook. Free cash flow guidance a little below 10%. Can you speak to any
working capital needs for next year? And then what are you penciling in for CapEx?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Just one second, Brandon. Let me pull it up here. So let me start with the second one. So for CapEx,
we have $103 million in our model for next year. So that's going to be up about $10 million from this year.
We have some facility investments that we're going to be making in the first half of next year. Otherwise,
we feel good about our overall free cash flow growth next year. I think it's going to be kind of in line with
our operating profit growth generally.

There's always maybe timing topics from 1 year to another. But I think especially if you look at like the 2
years combined, like this year and next year, overall, we're very pleased with the growth. I mean you saw
the cash flow generation that we had here in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, really, really
impressed with the execution in the organization on a lot of different management of cash initiatives, and
I feel like we'll continue to have that momentum as we kind of go into next year as well.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then one more. Can you talk about what's embedded in terms of net pricing capture in '21? And as we
think about gross -- or margin expansion generally, would that be leaned more on the gross margin side
than OpEx, given some of your comments about some of those cost items coming back into the P&L?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Sure. So in terms of our gross margin for next year, right now -- like for this year, right now we're
-- we did just over 2% in terms of price realization for Q3, and I think we'll probably be at that kind of a
level for 2020. As we look to 2021, we do have good momentum in the program, but at the same time,
we're looking at a lower inflationary environment.

So at this point in time, we're right now thinking that we'd be more like in the 1.5% kind of a range for
next year for price realization. And then if we kind of like look at the overall gross margin expansion next
year, probably something in the 30 kind of basis point kind of a range, that would exclude maybe a little
bit of unfavorable effect of currency. One of the things that we have as a headwind also to our gross
margin next year is going to be some of these temporary cost savings that we talked about that come
back that will also be a little bit of a headwind in terms of our gross margin expansion next year as well.

Citigroup Inc., Research Division

This is Jesse on for Patrick. Just wanted to touch on the 1% to 2% of COVID-related tailwinds. Wondering
if you could break that down a little bit further between the areas you laid out between testing and vaccine
research and bioprocessing. And then just curious what's implied there for 4Q '20 and 2021 guidance.

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

So as mentioned, it is related to the tips business and pipettes. It's related to testing kits or for testing
centers, where pipettes and the tips are used. That's the part that we call tailwind because, obviously, this
is tied to the number of tests being conducted and the tips demand associated with that. This can have
a very high volatility in demand, and we see actually that volatility also following the waves and different
regions. So the 1% to 2% was for Q3. For Q4, we would expect more like 1%. And when we think about
next year, we could still see some tailwinds at the beginning of the year, and depending how COVID
evolves, it would start to diminish, and then we would start to have some headwinds from a comparative
standpoint.

Jesse Aaron Klink
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just looking back at the earlier days, the pandemic in relation to China, saw a pretty
strong drop-off in 1Q, but strong recovery in 2Q and 3Q. So as we look ahead, would we expect kind of a
similar dynamic if there is -- the country was to shut down kind of due to the resurgence of cove cases? Or
do you think kind of with this new go-to-market strategy you can see more resiliency within China, even if
we do see quite a big resurgence of COVID this quarter and into 2021?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think what changed is every country learns to deal with COVID in a more differentiated way. I see
that I experienced that myself being based in Switzerland and Europe, the second wave has a totally
different impact on the business world. And it is because governments react differently, but of course,
also because business and individual people react differently to that. We are so much more knowledgeable
about things. We have today face masks that protect us and so on. And so the B2B world that we are
living in is not impacted as much anymore. I see also the reaction of all the -- our customers to be much
more controlled in that we have semi-lockdowns, for example, in Europe right now, we don't see it in
the same way in order entry, leads generation and so on. And the second factor is what you just also
mentioned that we have already adjusted our go-to-market approaches. And in that sense, I do expect a
much smaller impact on our business from any second wave that are -- is taking place right now.

Your next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

I was hoping you could tease out for us just how much of the sales in the quarter you think might have
benefited from some sort of catch-up from earlier in the year? And are there any dynamics looking at sort
of the 3 businesses you should just be keeping in mind going into the fourth quarter that catch-up might
impact?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Jack, this is Shawn. Of course, it's always difficult to try to know or to quantify that. I think the one
region that certainly stood out the most from our perspective was China in terms of catch-up and, as we
talked about, we definitely see more of a V-shaped recovery in China compared to maybe some of the
other regions.

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

In terms of some of the other geographies, it's a little bit more difficult to say. Was there a little bit of
catch-up in Europe? Maybe, but very difficult to say. But I think I'd maybe just then kind of pivot towards
how we're currently seeing the fourth quarter in terms of guidance, and those types of factors would have
been considerations for us as we kind of provided our guidance for the fourth quarter.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Great. And then wanted to follow up on R&D investment. Just a clarification. I think I heard 5% of sales,
but I wasn't sure if that was for the full year or for the fourth quarter. And regardless, I think you're calling
for a nice step-up going into the fourth quarter. Just maybe talk about where you're finding new projects.
And do you think you'll continue to invest at these probably more normalized rates in 2021?

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

So the 5% is more for the full year. And the 5% is actually a good number for also midterm. We always
have a little bit of a fluctuation from quarter to quarter. But yes when you think about it -- when it's
independent of product launches or particular events, then the 5% applies. The reason why you saw this
summer a bit of a slowdown in the spending was, on one hand, the timing of projects, including also
product launches and some of the temporary cost measures that we had, including also [indiscernible]
furloughs in Europe had also some impact on the R&D spending. And in that sense, yes, Q4 will resume
more normal level, maybe even a little bit higher level of R&D spending.

Operator

Your next question will come from Richard Eastman with Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Olivier, when you look at the -- or Shawn, the Core Industrial business was up 8% in the quarter. And I
may have caught that you said Americas and Europe was down modestly. So was the growth -- was that
the case? And was the growth of 8% pretty much derived from China?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it was. Very much. So China was very strong, also related to this pent-up demand effect that we were
talking about before and then the overall strong momentum that we see in our Chinese business. And then
you might also recall that the Core Industrial in China has a little bit of higher percentage of the business
mix than the rest of the world. So in that sense, a double effect.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. And given there's a cyclical element, obviously, COVID would have impacted the business there as
well, just access, I guess, if nothing else. But if you think about the cyclical aspect of core industrial in
the Americas and Europe, how does it feel? If you sift through COVID, does it feel like that business is
maybe bottoming when you think about capital budgets and expenditures on Core Industrial in the 2
bigger geographies there?

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

So if you would have asked me 2 quarters ago or even 1 quarter ago, I would have thought that Core
Industrial would be impacted more by COVID and the recession. I mean in that sense, pleasantly
surprised. And I certainly explained it on one hand that the global economy recovered faster than we
expected. But the second one also is, we were very successful in shifting our resources to the more
resilient industries. And the more resilient industries, for example, being biopharma hold up very nicely,
and we certainly feel we could gain share there also with our Core Industrial business. So yes, I'm happy
to see that it's less cyclical than we would have expected and shows that we have also good execution on
it. There are individual segments like, we call it, the MPE market, materials, plastic and electronics market,
that is clearly down and suffering from the economic environment.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And you -- when you talked about earlier in your presentation, Olivier, when you talked about the digital
marketing tools, do these -- does that account for some of this more resilient -- I mean is that part of how
you shift your resources? Do you deploy those on the Core Industrial side as well?

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

Oh, yes, absolutely. We really deploy it everywhere. And I think there is a multitude of tools that are
helping. So one hand, we do the segment analysis and heat map that show us which account sites have
the most potential, and we guide our sales force go after these opportunities. And then we use the digital
tools, sales tools, virtual sales tools on top of that, so that, for example, our salespeople also for Industrial
business would engage customers, not only by physical visits but more and more by video calls, by online
webinars that are dedicated to accounts. We have a digital library and all that. All these topics apply
across the business, including Core Industrial.

Your next question will come from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.

Stephen Barr Willoughby
Cleveland Research Company

Two questions for you. Just wondering if you could break out -- you commented that consumables and
services was up 6% in the quarter. If I remember correctly, I believe service was down year-over-year in
the second quarter. Just wondering if you could give any -- a little bit more color between consumables
and service. I guess along with that, too, where do you stand in terms of being able to meet demand
for pipettes these days? Are you building backlog at all given the increased demand in pipettes, any
CapEx you need to do? And then my second question or topic is, Mary, looks like you're stepping up the
share repurchases in the fourth quarter versus what you were expecting 90 days ago. How much in share
repurchase activity is implied within the guidance you gave?

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

Good. Shawn, do you want to take the first one, I take the second one and Mary the third one?

Stephen Barr Willoughby
Cleveland Research Company

Perfect. I got everybody.

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Good. Steve, so on the first one, I want to also clarify in the script, we realized that the 6% should
be on a year-to-date basis for service and consumables. So in the quarter, service and consumables were

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

actually up by 12%, and that included about 4% growth in the core service business with very strong
double-digit growth in our consumables business.

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

Got you. So on the second one, the pipettes themselves are less of a capacity constraint issue. It's more
the tips. And on the tips side, you have capacity problem in the whole industry, so not just that. We are
in a reasonable situation because we have 3 production facilities. We have one in Mexico, we have one in
California and we have one in China. They are all running at full theme and, of course, we leverage the 3
different facilities for the global supply, not just for local supply.

We have been successful in increasing the capacity over the last few months and will continue to further
expand capacity. There are different levers that we have. We feel good about it. And we certainly feel that
this capacity increase will also allow us to further gain share. The demand is certainly here, and I think
we are in a good position to be faster to orders in terms of raising the capacity. This includes also a bigger
facility expansion or new facility that will go live next summer. But our whole focus is actually to expand
capacity already here in the next couple of weeks and certainly also into the first quarter. Mary, you take
number three?

Mary T. Finnegan
Head of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Sure. So in terms of share repurchase, as Shawn mentioned on the call, we want to keep our net debt-to-
EBITDA in this 1.5x range. And so of course, the actual amount we do next year will depend a little bit on
your assumption in terms of EBITDA and cash flow. If I just look at the midpoint of our range, we would
be repurchasing somewhere around $850 million level. And of course, it could be a little higher, a little
lower, just depending on how things play out.

Operator

Your next question will come from Daniel Arias with Stifel.

Daniel Anthony Arias
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Olivier, maybe just packing around the edges and sticking with the market share gain conversation.
Obviously, that's easier to do in some places than others. So I guess I'm just curious on the segments or
areas of the market where you found it to actually be more difficult to take share. What is it about the
competitive offerings that's allowed them to kind of hold share more than others? Is it customer loyalty,
price? What are the factors that are hardest to overcome that you're finding?

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

It's certainly in the area that we have talked about also in the past, and that's retail. In Food Retail, our
Spinnaker approaches, our sales and marketing approaches have not the same benefit. In retail, we
clearly see that we have a highly competitive market because it's more difficult to do value-selling, to
differentiate in front of the customers. [ The projects are typically also bigger ]. So that's certainly an area
where we are not focused on market share gains, but actually on profitability.

The second differentiation I could make is direct or indirect channels. Wherever we go direct channels,
these approaches play much better to our benefit. We are introducing Spinnaker and applying Spinnaker
approaches also to indirect channels. But you can imagine we don't have the same impact, and we can't
implement all the tools in the same way. So that's probably the way I would mostly differentiate. From a
geographic standpoint, I don't -- wouldn't differentiate. And for the core business, outside of retail, and if
it's not a particularly big project or so, all of what we do here is applicable and would help us on the share
gains.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Okay. That's great color. Maybe just operationally, are you guys through the SAP implementation
within Product Inspection? And then on Blue Ocean, when you think about where or how you finish the
year there, what percentage of users do you think are fully under the umbrella of Blue Ocean by that
point?

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

So indeed, we had the last implementation in Product Inspection going live in Q3 in Tampa. This was the
most demanding and the most complicated facility and operation to go into launch and go live. And you
can imagine it was even more difficult to do that under COVID, very difficult people being in home offices,
international teams not easily being traveling. Given all these challenges, we are happy with how things
went.

It, nevertheless, had some impact on our Q3 numbers, as Shawn highlighted before, and we still have
some more work to do in terms of -- implementation of Blue Ocean has been a challenge. Also after the
go-live, there is always challenges in workflows that need to be optimized. It still has material data that
needs to be optimized and so on. We are still going through these. But I do expect that in the next couple
of weeks, we will have full stabilization and then we'll start to have the benefit like we have seen in all
other units, including the other PI unit.

I want to recall that a few years ago, we went live with Garvens and Blue Ocean, the checkweighing
business that initially was very difficult. And today, this checkweighing business is so much benefiting from
the Blue Ocean implementation in terms of material cost savings, operational efficiency. I do expect that
these things will also come to Tampa. But right now, we are still kind of streamlining things that we have
to [ implement ]. And Shawn, do you want to talk about the second point?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So we -- most of the units remaining are, I would say, smaller units in the company. So -- but we
have a handful of smaller units in Europe still to go as well as in Asia/Rest of World. The largest unit that
we would have would be our French market organization, which will go live in a couple of years. In terms
of the overall users, I'd probably estimate it's in the 80% kind of a range that are currently on the system.

Olivier A. Filliol
President, CEO & Director

All major producing organizations are now on Blue Ocean. That was the key part missing with Tampa, and
that's also one of the reasons why the majority of the benefits that we can get out of Blue Ocean are now
in operational mode.

So for starters, could you be specific on the growth in China between Lab and Industrial? If you disclosed
that earlier, I missed it.

Shawn P. Vadala

Yes. We had high single digit growth in both of those areas, Dan. I mean, I'm sorry, not high single -- I'm
sorry, double-digit growth. I apologize. We have double-digit growth in both the areas, in both Laboratory
and Industrial in China in the third quarter.

And safe to assume Lab was above 20%?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

No. Actually, our Industrial business was stronger than our Laboratory business in the third quarter, which
is kind of supports our comments on why we thought like there was pent-up demand on the industrial
side.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then my follow-up. Shawn, can you help me think about how you're framing any year-
end uncertainty in your fourth quarter guide? Is it fair to assume that your 4% to 5% local currency
assumption reflects a better result than that during the month of October with more caution around
December? Or are you assuming more linearity in your performance?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think it's always difficult to try to comment on any particular month. I mean there's obviously prior
year comparisons that can come into play here. But I would just say that, hey, we feel very good about
our guidance. We feel good about how we entered the quarter. Of course, we had the benefit of seeing the
month of October when we provided our guidance. And we don't have any -- we didn't factor in anything
particular from an uncertainty perspective other than that we acknowledge that there is uncertainty in the
market and things can always change quickly.

Operator

We do have one other question that just came into the queue, and that is from Dan Brennan with UBS.

Daniel Gregory Brennan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Sorry about that. I guess we just didn't queue in appropriately. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just 2
questions, Olivier or Shawn. So the guide for '21, and I don't think this is covered, but like the core growth
at low single just seems really potentially conservative. I know you're assuming that the world is still kind
of -- we're not there yet with COVID, but nonetheless, given what you just posted this quarter. And then
also for China, I know there were some questions earlier, but just maybe give us a little flavor for those 2
particular guides kind of what goes behind that? Are you assuming maybe things get a little worse from
here, and that's what's baked in?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Dan, I'll take the question. This is Shawn. So on the Core Industrial side, as Olivier mentioned before,
we're really pleased with the resilience of the Industrial division recently and actually for the past couple
of years. So we feel very good about the execution there. We feel really good about our ability to target
the more attractive faster-growing, more resilient segments of the market. But nonetheless, we're not
immune to the economy. And so when we look historically, we do have that in the back of our minds that
this business historically is the more susceptible to the global economy. And that -- and so that's a little
bit on our mind with the low single-digit growth. And then maybe the second thing is that we just had
extremely strong growth in China and Industrial, as we just mentioned a few minutes ago. And so we're
going to have a much more difficult comparison in China when it comes to the Industrial business next
year. And as we mentioned earlier, China is a disproportional percentage of the mix for that business
compared to our other businesses.

And then I think the second part of your question was China for next year? Or was it...

Daniel Gregory Brennan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. I know you covered it several times, but could you just maybe, in closing, just give us a flavor for
kind of what's happening now? I think there was a question earlier about was there any kind of catch-up.
I think maybe Jack asked it. So just to be clear, did China benefit from a catch-up this quarter? And if not,
the 5% next year is really just conservatism or the comp? Or just any color there.

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So just to clarify, in the third quarter, China was up 17%. We had double-digit growth, both in the
Laboratory business and the Industrial business with stronger growth in our Industrial business. We did
feel like there was a pent-up demand in China in the quarter. I mean if you kind of look at the sequential
quarters starting with Q3 being down 13% in China, it's very much of a V-shaped type recovery. We
feel like the team is doing well. We feel like we're executing extremely well. All the digital marketing
approaches that Olivier mentioned earlier also benefit in China. We feel like we're gaining a little bit
of market share there. So we feel very good about our execution. Of course, we also feel very good
about the growth prospects of China kind of going forward, especially from a medium- to longer-term
perspective, especially with trends in biopharma and things like that.

As we think about 2021, I always like to say, in China, things can always change very quickly. And so --
and we saw examples of that going in both directions already in the last 9 months. So we're always a little
bit cautious in that regard when we try to forecast in China. But currently, sitting here today, we feel like
mid-single-digit, we feel good about that. Could it be higher? Could it be lower? We'll see. We tend to think
that the Laboratory business will be stronger in terms of growth for 2021 compared to 2020 compared to
our Industrial business. And a lot of that is just coming off this very strong quarter on the Industrial side
in Q3 and just kind of acknowledging that we're going to have a harder comparison in the second half of
next year. I think we're going to start the first half of the year very strong in China. They'll have a much
easier comparison in Q1. It's really about the second half of next year.

And at this time, we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn it back over to the panel for
closing remarks.
