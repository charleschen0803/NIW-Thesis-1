STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is David, and I will be your operator
for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the
company's most recent filings with the SEC.

Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's
current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Welcome to Stryker's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's
CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening
comments, followed by Katherine with an update on Mako. Glenn will then provide additional details
regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.

We finished 2019 on a particularly strong note, with Q4 organic sales growth of 8% despite notably
difficult year-over-year comparisons. This performance helped propel full year organic revenue growth to
8.1%, topping the high end of our most recently raised target of 7.5% to 8%.

2019 marks the seventh consecutive year of delivering accelerating organic sales growth, which has
consistently been at the high end of med tech. In 2013 and 2014, we grew in the 5s organically. '15 and
'16, we grew in the 6s. And '17 and '18, it was in the 7s. Also, this past year marks our 40th consecutive
year of sales growth since Stryker went public in 1979.

The performance in 2019 was balanced across divisions and geographies, reflecting the durability of our
business model.

Turning to the results by our 3 segments. Q4 was led by over 12% organic sales growth for
Neurotechnology and Spine, with our Neurotechnology businesses growing in the high teens. Orthopaedics
posted a 7.3% organic sales increase in the quarter, powered by impressive double-digit growth in Knees.
Our Orthopaedics performance continues to reflect meaningful share gains fueled by Mako and our 3D-
printed implants. As Katherine will detail in her comments, Q4 delivered the strongest robot quarter
since the launch of Mako. We finished the year with a healthy order book, demonstrating the commercial
and clinical success of this highly differentiated technology. MedSurg was up roughly 7% organically in
the quarter, as Endoscopy led the way, growing 10%. All other divisions achieved mid-single-digit gains
despite challenging comparisons. MedSurg continues to be a strong and consistent grower year in and
year out.

International organic growth was 7.6% in Q4 and, for the full year, matched the U.S. growth rate of 8.1%.
Emerging markets led the way with strong double-digit gains in Q4 and the full year. While it has taken
some time, 2019 was an excellent year in emerging markets, and we are well positioned to continue this
momentum into the future. Europe once again registered full year organic sales gains in high single digits
as we make progress towards achieving similar market share levels as we have in other developed market
regions. This performance was well above the market and has significant runway as we continue to drive
sales force specialization. Australia and New Zealand also had a strong Q4 across its portfolio.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

In the past 7 years, we have strengthened our international businesses and have taken key steps to
strengthen category leadership across our portfolio. The pending addition of Wright Medical later in 2020
will address our last meaningful category leadership gap: upper extremities.

We continue to make investments in our sales, marketing and R&D teams around the globe in order to
support our goal of consistently growing at the high end of med tech. But with our focus on our Cost
Transformation for Growth initiatives, we are also delivering leverage. Op margin expanded roughly 40
basis points in the year, which included absorbing approximately 30 bps of dilution related to acquisitions.

We exited 2019 with nearly $15 billion in global sales and have demonstrated the ability to continue to
drive high growth despite our larger size. We have expanded our offering through internal investments
and acquisitions and believe we are well positioned to achieve continued success for our customers,
employees and shareholders. Looking at 2020, we are on track to continue to achieve strong organic sales
growth and leveraged earnings.

In closing, the tremendous efforts of our 40,000 employees around the globe enabled us to once again
achieve strong results and deliver on our promise to our customers and patients to make health care
better.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Thanks, Kevin. My update today will focus on Mako and the key data points that have allowed you to track
our success in executing on our orthopaedic robotics strategy. In Q4, we sold 89 Mako robots globally
versus 54 in the comparable quarter a year ago. This includes 63 in the U.S. in Q4. Globally, our installed
base of robots is approximately 860, with close to 700 in the U.S. In January, we received Japanese
approval for the Mako Partial Knee indication, adding to the indications for the Total Knee and Total Hip
procedures. We now have 9 Mako robots in Japan and continue to believe this represents a significant
market opportunity.

Looking at U.S. procedures. In Q4, Mako procedures increased nearly 50% to 36,600, bringing the full
year total to over 114,000. Total Knee procedures posted a roughly 59% increase in Q4 to approximately
24,000, while full year Mako knee procedures increased roughly 66%, topping 75,000.

Demand for Mako is being driven by the myriad of unique benefits of our robotic technology, multiple
reconstructive applications and the ability to perform a cementless knee. Mako SmartRobotics have
enabled surgeons to achieve a "know more so as to cut less" approach to joint replacement, which is
driving improved outcomes for patients. These capabilities are clearly helping to increase robotic utilization
rates, which achieved strong double-digit growth, both year-over-year and sequentially. Lastly, it's worth
noting that demand for our 3D printed cementless knees continued to climb, exiting the year at over
36% of our U.S. knee procedures. We also continue to see growing demand for the Mako hip application,
underscored by over 40% growth in hip procedures on Mako in 2019.

Please note that going forward, we will no longer be providing quarterly Mako results. Since acquiring
the company in early 2014, we have provided detailed Mako data for 23 consecutive quarters in order to
allow investors to accurately track the performance of this differentiated robotic technology. As we are now
6 years since the acquisition and nearly 5 years since the initial launch of the Total Knee indication, we
believe we have validated the strategic rationale and competitive advantage of Mako as witnessed by the
roughly 600 basis points of U.S. knee market share that we have gained since 2013.

Going forward, we continue to expect to take meaningful market share in Knees, owing to Mako, along
with our differentiated portfolio of knee products, including our 3D-printed implants. We will continue to
report on a combined basis both manual and the Mako-implanted knees in our knee line, while robot sales
will be reported in other orthopaedics to allow for accurate tracking of our Knee revenue. Looking at 2020,
our Mako order book remains robust and supports our expectation for continued share gains in both Hips
and Knees.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

Thanks, Katherine. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related
drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.

Our organic sales growth was 8% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of
selling days as Q4 2018. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable, 0.6% from the prior year, while foreign
currency had an unfavorable 0.6% impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. sales continue to demonstrate
strong momentum with organic growth of 8.2%, reflecting solid performance across our portfolio.
International sales grew 7.6% organically, which was balanced across our international regions. Organic
sales growth for the year was 8.1%, which was slightly above our most recently raised full year guidance
of 7.5% to 8%. U.S. international organic growth was also 8.1%. 2019 had one additional selling day
compared to 2018. And for the year, price had an unfavorable impact of 0.9% on sales.

Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.49 increased 14.2% from the prior year, reflecting strong drop-through
on sales growth combined with good operating expense control. Our fourth quarter EPS was negatively
impacted by $0.02 from foreign currency, which was in line with our expectations. Our full year EPS was
$8.26 with growth of 13%, reflecting strong sales growth and disciplined leverage.

Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant
currency and organic growth of 7.3%, including organic growth of 7.2% in the U.S., highlighted by
U.S. Knee growth of 10.5%. This performance reflects strong demand for our Mako TKA knee platform,
3D-printed products, Trident II hip implants and continued ramping of our T2 Alpha Nailing System.
Internationally, Orthopaedics delivered organic growth of 7.6%, which reflects strong performance in
Australia, Canada and Europe.

MedSurg continued to have strong growth across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency
growth of 7.4% and organic gains of 6.8%, which included an 8% increase in the U.S. Instruments had
U.S. organic sales growth of 4.1%, reflecting a strong prior year comparable. Full year U.S. organic growth
for Instruments was 10.2%. In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in waste management, Steri-
Shield and smoke evacuation. Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic sales growth of 15.4%. Endoscopy had
strong performances across many product lines, highlighted by double-digit growth in its video products,
including the 1688 camera and accessories, insufflator, suction/irrigation and booms and lights businesses.
The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 5.7%, reflecting solid performance in its bed, including
services and stretcher businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 2.4%, reflecting
strong comparables across most geographies.

Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 18.2% and organic growth of 12.5% as K2M
anniversaried during the quarter. This growth reflects strong performance within our Neurotech product
lines. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted organic growth of 16.5% for the quarter driven by strong
demand for our hemorrhagic, ischemic stroke and our neuro-powered instruments products, including
Sonopet iQ. During the quarter, we continue to be ahead of our K2M cost integration plan and begin to
see good momentum related to our sales integration efforts. For the quarter, we delivered an increase in
sequential quarterly growth and on a full year pro forma basis delivered low single-digit increase across
our combined worldwide Spine business. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth
of 16.6%. This performance was driven by strong demand in Europe and emerging markets.

Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was
favorably -- was favorable, approximately 60 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the
prior year quarter, gross margin expansion was favorably impacted by acquisitions and foreign exchange,
which were partially offset by price and business mix. For the full year, our adjusted gross margin of
65.9% was unfavorable, approximately 20 basis points from the prior year. Compared to the prior year,
gross margin expansion was favorably impacted by acquisitions, which were offset by price, foreign
exchange and business mix.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Adjusted R&D spending was 5.6% of sales, which was 10 basis points lower than prior year quarter.
For the full year, adjusted R&D spending was 6.1% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 32.3% of sales,
which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 10 basis points. For the full year, our adjusted SG&A
was 33.5% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year by approximately 40 basis points. For both the
quarter and the year, this reflects continued focus on operating expense improvements through our Cost
Transformation for Growth program, including key projects focused on indirect purchasing and shared
services. This is offset by the negative impact of acquisitions and continued planned investments in other
CTG program efforts like our ERP project.

In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 28.3% of sales, which was 80 basis
points favorable to the prior year quarter. Our full year operating margin of 26.3% was up 40 basis
points favorable from the prior year, delivering on our commitment of 30 to 50 basis points op margin
expansion. Our operating margin primarily reflects good leverage and continued operational savings offset
by investments and acquisitions, the latter of which had approximately 30 basis points negative impact for
the year.

Next, regarding other income and expense, our expenses decreased from prior year quarter primarily
due to favorable interest rates. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 16.3%. Our full
year effective tax rate was 15.8%. These rates reflect a higher operating tax rate reduced primarily by the
benefit related to stock compensation expenses. For 2020, we expect full year adjusted effective tax rate
to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.

Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $4.4 billion of cash
and marketable securities, which includes the proceeds from our EUR 2.4 billion offering completed in
December to partially fund the announced Wright Medical acquisition. Including this funding, total debt on
the balance sheet was $11.1 billion.

Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.2 billion. This
reflects increased adjusted earnings, which are somewhat offset by increases in working capital and
increased acquisition integration and restructuring spending. Turning to cash flow for 2020, we will not be
repurchasing any shares, and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be flat year-over-year at $600
million to $700 million.

And now I will provide 2020 guidance on a stand-alone basis and further guidance, including Wright
Medical. Based on our momentum from 2019 and assessment of the current economic and market
conditions, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% for 2020. There is 1
additional selling day in 2020 compared to 2019. As you update your quarterly models, please note that
Q1 has the additional selling day, and Q2, Q3 and Q4 have the same number of selling days.

If foreign exchange rates hold near their current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be nominally
impacted for the first quarter and full year. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of
1% to 1.5%, which is fairly consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2019. In addition,
we expect to continue to deliver on our full year commitment to expand operating margin. Including
the negative impact of closed acquisitions, we anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating
margin in 2020.

Finally, for 2020, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9 to $9.20
for the full year, including approximately $2.05 and $2.10 for the first quarter. As it relates to Wright
Medical acquisition, we reiterate our previous guidance. Assuming an end of Q3 2020 closing, we expect
the transition -- transaction to be neutral to our 2020 EPS. For the full year 2020, we would not deliver on
30 to 50 basis points op margin expansion on a combined basis. However, we would still expect to deliver
positive operating margin expansion.
And now I will open up the call for Q&A.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

My first question is for Kevin. I was wondering if I could get your perspective on the 2020 guide. Last year,
obviously, you guided a 6.5% to 7.5% and ended up delivering over 8%. This year, you're once again
guiding to 6.5% to 7.5%. Is there anything you're going to do different, Kevin, with your outlook for 2020
versus 2019, either from a macro market perspective or kind of a Stryker-specific perspective?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bob. I would say, as I sit here today, I feel very similar to how I felt at the beginning of last
year: a really nice balance of headwinds and tailwinds, good operating performance across our businesses
and our regions. But it's early in the year, and so we're giving a guidance that we feel very confident being
able to hit. If things play out the way they did in 2019, obviously, there could be a scenario where things
would improve, but we really had a great year across many areas in 2019 and not a lot of turbulence in
the macroeconomic environment.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. That's fair. And then I was wondering if you could just quickly comment on a couple of other quick
things. First, from a pipeline perspective, are you guys still expecting a new bed and new physio launch
sometime in 2020?

And then I know this is a tiny business for you, but I'd love to get your perspective on coronavirus, and
could that impact procedures in China?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Okay, Bob, I'll take the first part, just talking about some of the positives that we see. The pipelines
are very strong across from all of Stryker. Robotic surgery adoption, as you saw with the big fourth
quarter, continues to be a tailwind for us both in Hips and Knees as well as Mako. We have year 2 of our
camera launch in Endoscopy. Our Aspiration business in Neurovascular will be another tailwind. We have
acquisitions that are going to be turning organic. So we have a whole list of those kind of tailwinds. And
then across Medical, there's a number of new products that we'll be launching in acute, emergency care
and Sage.

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes. And Bob, maybe I'll just hop on to that. Really too early to get into details about coronaviruses. You
probably know our exposure in emerging markets is low. And in China, it's even lower. It's low single
digits. And that's one of the variables we often contemplate when we set out a range. So at this point,
recognizing it's early, no comments.

And just building on Kevin's comments, as he mentioned, Medical does have a really healthy pipeline
of products coming, including a bed. And I should probably also note though, LIFEPAK, which is one of
the Physio products, as a PMA product, that is no longer expected to be launched this year. Again, that's
-- overall, there's a lot of products, so it's not impactful from a revenue standpoint. But that will not be
launched this year.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Operator

Your next call comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just 2 questions for me, one on sales and one on margins. So Kevin, 2 businesses stuck out this particular
quarter: Knees and neuro. So just sort of curious, what drove those very significant Mako placements?
And in any way, was there a change in sales strategy from capital to rental? And then neuro, I'm just
curious what the drivers were in the fourth quarter. We've sort of waited for that pipeline to come through.
We're expecting a big year in 2020. Was the fourth quarter kind of the first beginning of that? And how
you're thinking about neuro for next year? And then I had a quick follow-up on earnings.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So starting with Mako. This is just a continuation of the great success we've been having. There was
no new strategy. There's no change in the way we price Mako. We've always been flexible in terms of
different approaches to financing, whether it's leasing, whether it's rentals. And so the mix didn't change
dramatically, maybe a little bit more rentals but very, very similar to what we've had in the past. I think
it's just -- there's a growing realization that technology is here to stay. And that adoption rate, we expect
to continue to increase in the future.

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes. And David, on the neuro, it was really across the board, both geographically, strong double-digit
growth in the U.S., in Europe and Canada as well as other regions outside of TOM. And then the various
business segments all had really healthy double-digit growth, whether you're looking at hemorrhagic
or ischemic, and that really is across the board. We launched some new products last year, a new flow
diverter outside the U.S. And part of our bullishness heading into this year is tied to the planned -- having
the full portfolio around the end of Q1 of our Aspiration products, including the larger-bore 074. So that
should be a nice new product entry for us into that segment of the market. So it was very balanced, both
geographically and across the product portfolio.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just a quick one on earnings. Kevin, investors are very focused on organic acceleration,
and this was yet another year in 2019 of acceleration over '18. But what's interesting is this is the second
consecutive year of earnings acceleration, which I think some investors have missed. So I think you're
right in the associated dilution has concerned investors on your opportunity for improving leverage or
earnings growth for the company. So your conviction in the minimum 9% is clear, but the question really
is, can you do better? And is Wright integration going to delay your cost transformation initiatives?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, David. So 4 years ago, we gave 9% as a floor. And since then, we've delivered 12% and 13%
each of the 4 years. So we saw it as a floor, and you can see we've clearly surpassed the floor by a wide
margin. We really believe we have our Cost Transformation Growth -- for Growth firing, and we're going to
continue to be able to deliver very strong earnings.

The point on op margin is obviously just a math issue. With the amount of growth that were coming in and
the profile of their P&L, it will take us time to work through the synergies that we need to work through
for -- to get back on to an op margin expansion. But as you heard from Glenn, we expect to still deliver
positive op margin in 2020.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Your next call comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Crédit Suisse.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congrats on these really strong numbers. So Kevin, I wanted to ask if you could, maybe Katherine, talk
a little bit about where we should think about the sort of progress or the timing, cadence around upper
extremities, given the -- that, that is an important part of this Wright Medical acquisition. It certainly fits
well with the Mako platform. Maybe talk about how that deal fits and what it can do to maybe accelerate
that program. And then I had just one follow-up.

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes. So as we've talked about on prior calls, we're continuing to prioritize in terms of next indications in
Spine and upper extremities. For Mako, We have independent R&D teams working in collaboration with
the Mako robotics team on those. It's too early to get into the time line. I think what Wright will do for us,
as we've said before, significantly bolsters our competitive position, so when we come to market, we will
have a stronger portfolio of products. But it'd be premature to comment beyond that in terms of timing
around the robot launch for either of those additional indications.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Understood. And then maybe just a follow-up on Spine. What, if anything, if you can provide any color
as to what you think has sort of gone well there. Obviously, you did a lot of things right, I think. But
maybe where some of the challenges have been as things evolved the last quarter or so and where in that
portfolio do you think the integration is going really well? Any color you could provide would be helpful.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

This is Kevin. So certainly, we had some challenges early with the integration, with the overlapping sales
forces and didn't do a lot of hiring, new products got delayed. The fourth quarter showed some real signs
of positive momentum on the sales force side, clear targets, clear accountabilities and then a number of
new products being launched on our sales meeting. So very excited that we're sort of back on offense
after going through the tricky parts of the integration. We were very aggressive on costs, and so those
cost synergies were ahead. But now I'm looking forward to 2020 and in the future to seeing accelerated
growth in our Spine business. We're well positioned now. It was tough, certainly, in the first 6 months, but
very encouraged by what I saw in the fourth quarter and expect 2020 to accelerate.

Operator

Your next call comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Sort of digging into the Spine question as well. Last quarter, we saw a demand/supply imbalance coming
from sort of K2M versus legacy Spine. Can you give us a manufacturing update? Where are we on the
supply versus demand at this point? And are there like any further tailwinds in the near term if demand
remains at these levels going forward?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks, Pito. I would say it's improved, and that's really the trajectory is -- on Spine, is there's
still improvement to go, of course, because we still have legacy Spine products in manufacturing that
we're optimizing. And -- but the fact that it is improving, you saw the sequential improvement. We feel

trajectory will continue to improve to get us to that acceleration throughout 2020. And that -- part of that
is having a better capability to meet the demand for the full portfolio of products.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Then one margin question. So as I'm seeing that there's dilution from acquisitions in 2019, you
guys have been very clear about. Going -- for 2020, how should we think about core Stryker delivering
margin improvement with the organic revenue growth versus simply having less dilution to deal with in
2020 versus 2019?

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

Yes. I think on 2020, as we think about it and the way we've always segmented and planned on it, even in
spite of the Wright acquisition, is for the core business and maybe our smaller tuck-in acquisitions that we
would normally do in the course of 2020, we will still strive and we will still incentivize our people and our
businesses to deliver the 30 to 50 basis points expansion.

I think as Kevin explained, just mathematically with what we'll average in on a combined basis at sales
and at that op income line, we won't be able to hold 30 to 50 basis points expansion for 2020 when we
close on Wright Medical.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

But we do have continued dilution because of the Mobius deal that we did at the end of the year and
some other deals, maybe not to the same extent that we have this year. But we still do need to offset that
dilution, and we are committed to continuing to deliver 30 to 50 in spite of that. And obviously, if dilution
decreases, we expect to be at the higher end of that limit.

Your next call comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.

Frederick Allen Wise
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Kevin, let me go back to Mako and a couple of questions there, just particularly around Mako hip. What's
next there? Can you give us any color about drivers of adoption from here and your plans? And just help
us appreciate some of the initiatives that are ahead in 2020. Maybe, Katherine, you'll fill us in on the mix
of Stryker accounts versus competitive -- it's been 50-50. Does it continue at that kind of level?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Sure. I'll start off with Mako hip, really excited about the progress. So a lot of surgeons were initially
interested in the knee. And then as they got the experience with Mako, they started to look at hip. And
once you try the hip application, it tends to be pretty sticky.

We're very excited. In the second quarter of this year, we're going to be launching new software upgrade
to our hip program. And that's going to be much more user-friendly. The registration process and some of
the software has been a little bit challenging from a change management standpoint. This is going to be
much slicker and really exciting. Early feedback we've had some surgeons has been very positive. So I am
bullish on continued expansion of Mako with Hips.

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes. And so we've seen very consistent hovering around that 55% to 60% of the robots we place are going
into competitive accounts, and that was consistent again for the quarter and the year.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Frederick Allen Wise
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And just a follow-up question. Kevin, you've done amazing job in transforming Europe and had a
great performance. It seems like there's a lot more to go based on your comments. And just at a high
level, as we look ahead to 2020 and maybe beyond, beyond some of your comments about Spine, you're
feeling better. Are there other areas where you're turning special focus that we might imagine could,
based on that focus, just like Europe, perform better as 2020 unfolds? Or what are you less than satisfied
with?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Well, it was a terrific year, as you saw, overall. I would say that the emerging markets, this has been the
best year we've had since I've been the CEO, very strong double-digit growth. And to me, I would expect
that, that will continue, hopefully, for the next decade. We are so underrepresented there relative to our
overall portfolio and market shares around the world. But I would say, hopefully, this is the first year of
many years of very strong double-digit growth in those markets. We've made leadership changes. We
struggled with emerging markets for the first 4 years or so. 2018 was a good year. 2019 was a great year.
And that's the area that I think has the biggest upside in addition to Mako in both China and Japan.

Japan now has all the applications approved on the robot. We're still waiting for the knee application to be
approved in China, hope to have that sometime this year. But those will be very, very good markets for
Mako as well.

Your next call comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And congrats on a really nice quarter. Kevin, maybe, first, I'll ask on the CapEx environment. What
were you seeing exiting the year with business and consumer confidence rates so high? And what do you
expect going into 2020?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Robbie, maybe I'll take that question. I would tell you based on our mix of capital, which runs a pretty big
range from relatively lower ASP to obviously much bigger ticket items, the environment remains really
healthy. We've seen strong growth across the board for our capital businesses.

And Mako, I would tell you what we are seeing is -- while it's still a long selling cycle, we are seeing
that kind of move up ahead of other capital requests in the queue with hospitals just given the growing
demand and acceptance of robotics. So we feel really good heading into this year in terms of the capital
environment, particularly the environment combined with the products that we're launching or continuing
to build on prior launches.

Robert Justin Marcus
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And while there were a lot of great performances in the quarter, the 2 misses versus Street
numbers that stood out were Trauma and Extremities and Medical. I was just wondering if you could give a
little more color on each of those and anything you saw in the quarter.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Starting off with Medical, I mean, they had very, very significant comparisons if you look at last
year's growth. And so we're still very pleased with our Medical business. And that has been a consistent

performer, if you go back 4 or 5 years, a consistent grower. The Sage and Physio acquisitions have been
terrific acquisitions for that business. So I would say that's more of a comp issue and expect that to
continue to be a strong performer, especially with a lot of new products coming in 2020.

In Trauma and Extremities, again, we had a very strong year last year. So a little bit of that was comp
related. And we still believe that we have the leading market performer in Trauma. It does vary sometimes
from quarter to quarter. We've seen that over the past 2 or 3 years, but the T2 Alpha launch is starting to
pick up steam. We also have a mini frag launch, which just occurred at the end of this year, which is pretty
exciting. That's one of our sort of soft spots in our portfolio.

So we believe we're well positioned, and we expect to continue to grow above the market. It was a slight
reduction versus what we've experienced before but nothing that concerns me.

Your next call comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.

Briana Michele Warschun
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is Briana on for Raj. I just have a quick question on Mako. So I'm just trying to characterize these
sites that are adopting Mako. Do you find any difference in sites that might have adopted some level of
computer-assisted navigation previously but not for robotics versus those that are mostly manual?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes. I don't think we have that level of granularity around it. I would tell you we see across-the-board
adoption by all types of customers. It can be high-volume hospitals. It can be more rural hospitals. It
really is wherever there's a surgeon champion. And increasingly, what we're seeing is increased demand
given how long we are into the launch now. We're also continuing to see increase in the percent of
hospitals that are now purchasing a second or additional robot. And -- but I can't really tie it to navigation
necessarily.

Your next call comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a nice print here. So one housekeeping question here on the guidance below the line. You
mentioned interest income came in above, I believe. The assumption for fiscal '20, Glenn, is that the new
run rate now we're looking at, somewhere in $8 million to $10 million per quarter on the debt line item?

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

Yes, that would be -- let me go back, and I'll have one of our guys get back to you on that. I mean
we basically will have more borrowings coming in if you think about what we're going to do for Wright
Medical. And so if that closes in Q3, then that will obviously change that interest number.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got you. And then one on Wright Medical. I know you won't comment on the timing, but the original deal
model was no impact to EPS in fiscal '20 and $0.10 dilution in '21. Just given your cash balance, your free
cash conversion, any change in your financing assumptions around the EPS contribution assumptions here
on the deal?

Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.

Xuyang Li
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

This is Young Li in for Matt. Maybe first on M&A. After you address the last category leadership gap with
Wright, what are your thoughts on expanding into additional verticals within med tech that you currently
aren't in? And maybe just thoughts on M&A for 2020 in general? How is the pipeline shaping up and views
on valuation of targets?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes, we continue to have a very strong pipeline. Obviously, with the size of the Wright Medical deal, we're
not going to be looking at targets of scale for the next year or 2 while we start to pay down that debt, but
we will still keep the lights on in our business development engine. We still have significant opportunities
to add to our portfolio. So when I talked about closing the last major gap, it doesn't mean we don't have
targets within all of our many businesses. Each business has business development people that are
focused, and we continue to see attractive targets that can continue to add to our category leadership.

But this was -- if you think about 5, 6, 7 years ago, Sports Medicine, Spine and shoulder were the areas
where we had the largest gap to category leadership, and we've made huge progress in our Sports
Medicine business, mostly organically but also with a series of tuck-in deals. With K2M, we've largely
addressed our Spine business, and then Wright Medical addresses upper extremities. So those are the
areas that we clearly were not in the top 1, 2 or 3 in the category, and that will propel us into that
category.

But we don't really feel the need at this point to start to branch widely outside of the 3 segments. These
are big segments. If you think about MedSurg, if you think about Neurotech and Spine and Orthopaedics,
where there are still very, very active hunting grounds for acquisitions. But again, the target sizes will be
smaller, at least, for the next year or 2 while we digest this one.

Xuyang Li
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess, just a follow-up, the Mako international focus. Pretty good quarter
here. Can you maybe just talk about the opportunities in international? I know you highlighted Japan and
China, maybe India longer term. And maybe at a high level, can you comment on utilization rates, U.S.
versus OUS?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

No, we're not going to get into the latter part in terms of utilization rate because you saw we're seeing,
across the board, a healthy increase, and that wouldn't be just in the U.S. But the data we have tracked
for you guys has been the U.S., given that it was the largest segment of our Mako revenue right now.
You're absolutely correct. There's significant opportunity outside the U.S., markets like Japan, China, Latin
America. We're selling robots, really, around the globe. Obviously, we're [ ahead ] in certain markets
versus others.

I would say, near term, we're probably most excited about Japan now that we have all the indications; in
China, once we get the knee indication. But there are a lot of healthy robot markets beyond the U.S.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Kristen Marie Stewart
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Congratulations on a good quarter. And Kevin, I just wanted to ask kind of a big picture question to you,
and then I do have a follow-up. If I look at the overall organic growth rate since you've taken over, it's
been this really impressive linear line up and into the right, accelerating growth, really, each and every
year. And I'm just curious on how you think about the growth profile of Stryker going forward. Should we
continue to expect kind of this nice linear acceleration story?

Going back to, I guess, one of the original questions, I think it was Bob who asked. Thinking about the
guidance, I know you guys tend to give kind of conservative guidance at the onset of the year. I know you
said last quarter you still felt very strongly, and you said it earlier, on this momentum. But should we just
think about Stryker continuing to have this acceleration growth profile from here? Or do you think that we
should think about more of you being in a position to sustain kind of around the level of where we're at?
And then one follow-up.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Kristen. Obviously, you've seen our focus has been on growth. We've been very acquisitive. We've
focused on adding and splitting sales forces wherever possible, investing in R&D at a healthy rate, which
fuels the growth. And so that's been our model, and that's continuing. And Wright Medical, this pending
acquisition, is another example where they're a very high-growth business and a very large business. And
so that -- our actual model isn't changing. We continue to have the same offense, and we're growing big
numbers on top of big numbers. And so that's what's been impressive, is for 4 years I've been asked,
"When is the growth going to start to slow down?" And it hasn't.

Now can you take a line and draw a straight line forever? Probably not. We also have to look at the
market. The market has been pretty healthy. We've maintained our gap and maybe accelerated our gap
versus the market in growth. But we think we have an offense in our operating model that's structured for
high growth. The way we -- the decentralized model, the dedicated sales, marketing, R&D and business
development in each division, we become a more global company, and that still has significant runway in
emerging markets in areas like Europe, where we didn't have high growth. Year after year, we're growing
in high single digits in Europe, which I think is rare. And that's not going to end anytime soon.

So I think we're structured to have high growth. Putting a fine point on the actual number is difficult
because you don't know what's happening in the macro environment, but I feel just as positive starting
this year as I did at the beginning of last year.

Kristen Marie Stewart
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. And then I was just curious, you guys made some changes, I guess, it was last
summer to just move around some of the structure -- reporting structure with Spine and then neurotech
as well to report up into Orthopaedics and MedSurg. Is that something that from an R&D perspective or
anything might have any implications from a growth perspective or anything like that? Maybe just talk
through if there's anything there from also M&A, if we should be thinking of it.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

No, sure, sure. That's just purely a reflection of the leadership changes. It's really a recognition of terrific
performance by both Spencer Stiles and Andy Pierce. These are 2 group presidents that are just shining,
and so we've given them additional businesses to manage. There is no change at the divisional level. So
the division presidents, who are also terrific, continue to run their business. But the change that we made
was one level above that, how we aggregate the divisions. But the center of gravity of our company are
the divisions. That's where the action happens in terms of R&D, marketing, sales. So don't read anything
more into that other than it's a management structure change to give more businesses to Andy and
Spence to manage directly, and it's a recognition of just how well they've performed over time.

Your next call comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler.

Andrew William Stafford
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

This is Drew on for Matt. I just have 2 questions here on Mako, and I guess I'll ask both of them. I just
want to follow-up on the comment you made on the software update in Hips there. Is that something that
could kind of close the gap where you're actually placing the system organically for hip applications that is
prior to knee?

And then second question is, I guess it seems like you guys have been talking about Knee being -- or
about cementless knee being a key growth driver for about 2 years now given integration with Mako. Just
kind of trying to gauge what your feel is as far as what any [ newer ] product, why is this, especially with
a larger competitor on the market? And do you see any headwinds or tailwinds here as we think about
2020?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Okay. There was a few questions in there. Let me start just with Mako and robotics in general. It's still
early innings within Orthopaedics. And we see a huge runway ahead of us to continue to have a broad
adoption of robotics. Cementless has been a steady grower, and we don't think that's going to slow down.
It will continue. It probably won't have big step changes. It will be a steady gradual progression.

And what we're seeing there are some new surgeons adopting cementless, but we're also seeing the
surgeons that started with cementless, with, let's say, younger, healthier patients, now starting to realize
that the benefits are so good that they're starting to put them in older patients and even patients, let's
say, who the bone quality may not be pristine but still adequate bone quality. So you're seeing even
surgeons that are using it who used to use it on a smaller percentage of the patients now seeing just how
well it's performing using it on a larger percentage of their population. So I think cementless will continue
to run, and we're pretty excited about the potential for the future.

And again, getting back to the technology, this has many, many years ahead of us, and we're very excited
about the potential.

Great. And then just early anecdotal feedback on the Wright Medical deal from your sales team. And then
just how you're modeling the Trauma and Extremities business leading into the deal closure? Are you
assuming there's going to be maybe dislocation leading into the deal closure? Or just how are you thinking
about that business?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes. I apologize. I really can't get into any color there. I'd refer you back to the comments we made at
the time of the acquisition. We don't own the company. They're a publicly traded company. We're still
competitors. So it would be inappropriate to say anything about that right now. We're obviously very
excited about what it will do for our extremities portfolio. But beyond that, I would just refer you back
to the comments that we made around assumptions tied to the synergies at the time that the deal was
announced.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes, but we still feel bullish about our own trauma business. We have new products that we're launching.
We have a very strong brand. And what -- the feedback we've had from our sales force is, I would say,
excitement, really, excitement that we -- that we're going to strengthen our position in Extremities and
become the really most attractive company for Extremities. That's what our belief is. That's what we're
telling our sales force. That's what we're hearing from them. So there's always risks of deal -- dislocation
in every sales force that we have. But for the moment, it doesn't appear to be significant.

what are your expectations for those markets in 2020?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Frankly, the market seems very stable, and it's been pretty healthy for some time now. Not everybody has
reported yet their fourth quarter. So until we see the total numbers, we're not going to have a clear idea.
But I would say the market is maybe modestly better. I think we said that at the beginning of the year. We
thought it would be just a little bit better, but it's not that it's had a step-change improvement. It's been a
good, healthy market. We expect that it'll continue to be a good healthy market.

Craig William Bijou
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Got it. And then just a follow-up on Mako. In 2020, I mean, can we expect to see any clinical data? Or I
guess, what's the plan for the release of -- or potential release of any clinical data during the year?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes, I'm sure. We always -- we don't always have line of sight since we're not always the sponsor of the
studies, but I would expect you'll continue to see data. Over what time frame or size of the study, that's
harder to tell. It will be another focus of the Academy meeting at the end of March. So we will again have
a booth tour, and we will be highlighting Mako and getting some insights around some of the new hip

Richard S. Newitter
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Kevin, maybe just the first one. In Europe, where you're underrepresented from a market share
standpoint relative to U.S. share -- dominant share positions, can you maybe just tell us where you're
most excited about potentially closing the gap even faster as you look to 2020? Where do you see the
biggest opportunities, especially as you move into the next 12 months? And where are you most excited
there? And then I had a quick follow-up.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Sure. I would start off with the MedSurg segment, so Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical. Those are
areas where we have the biggest opportunity for market share gains. We have terrific products, and as we
specialize in MedSurg, we do expect to have a much more significant growth. The potential there is pretty
significant.

I also believe in Knees. We've sort of underperformed on a market share standpoint historically. Mako is a
big help there as is specialization. So that's another area. And then I think Spine, now that we have K2M,
Spine had a terrific year in Europe last year. And we believe that will continue going into the future.

So those are the areas that I think -- we have a pretty good size hip business. We're pretty strong there.
Our neuro businesses are very strong in Europe. So those are the areas that we still have growth potential
but maybe not as much. But I would say MedSurg, Knees, Spine, significant runway.

Richard S. Newitter
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Got it. And maybe just a follow-up on cementless. Where does this category potentially get to? Is there a
cap in your view from penetration of what should be done, cementless in Knees? And just remind us what
your estimation for the penetration today is into the market.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

So we -- I think Katherine in her prepared remarks mentioned that we exited the year at just over 36%
of our U.S. Knees being cementless. We are seeing adoption around the world as well, not as fast as
the adoption rate that we're seeing in the U.S. I don't believe it will get to Hips, which is virtually all
cementless, just given the knee joint being a weight-bearing area. And with people's bone quality, there's
always going to be some more conservatism. But there's no reason to believe why it won't continue
to steadily rise, and I think it could exceed 50%. Hard to know and hard to predict, but I wouldn't be
surprised at all if it exceeds 50%.

Keep in mind that we have a very unique product for cementless, and that's why we're able to have this
kind of spectacular growth rate and great clinical performance. And we'll see how that -- whether that
applies to the rest of the market, but we certainly love our position in cementless.

Just 2 Mako-related ones for me. Katherine, I think you kind of alluded to it at the beginning of the call,
but can you maybe help us understand how you view enabling technologies in Spine? I mean, obviously,
you've got Mako as a foundational technology there with your nav suite, but you also acquired Cardan and
Mobius in 2019. I guess trying to understand how we should think about that in 2020.

And then just with respect to Mako in Japan, you've got the full indications across the portfolio. Just how
should we expect adoption to ramp there given you've had 5 years in the U.S. market already and you've
got clinical data and things of that sort? Should we expect an accelerated adoption in some of these new
markets internationally?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Sure. I'll take the first one, and then I'll ask Katherine to comment on Japan. Enabling technologies to
us, we're big believers that this is going to be important for the future. We're very excited about Mobius.
That -- we launched that at our sales meeting, and we're very excited about the potential of that being
part of the enabling solution portfolio. We're not ready yet to comment on robotics for Spine. So we
obviously have 2 options: one with Cardan, which came with the Mobius acquisition, as well as Mako. We
are working on those programs, but it's just too early to give you an idea of when that will launch. And
once we have a more firm date, we will let you know. But we are believers that, that is an important part
of the future.

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

And then your first question was specific around how we're thinking about Spine and Mobius in 2020?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

No, about Japan.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Oh, sorry, Japan. Excuse me. It's been an exciting market, and we now have all 3 indications, which is
obviously a big plus. We have 9 robots there. We got to 9 fairly quickly. It's a market that really embraces
technology. And obviously, we're going to bring years of learnings on how to optimize the sale. It'd be
premature to tell you how big it can be, but it absolutely feeds into our conviction level around the fact
that we believe we're well positioned to grow Mako year-over-year in robots and to continue to see
significant market share gains in Knees as we expand, not just in the U.S. but globally.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. In general, Japan, it will grow. It doesn't tend to spike as fast as the U.S., just if you look historically
and look at Intuitive Surgical, look at other businesses. But it will grow, and we're pretty bullish about it
and excited for the future.

Your next call comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company.

Steven Michael Lichtman
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Just first question with K2 now more in the fold, can you provide an update on the deformity opportunity
that you see ahead and how that portfolio maybe provides an opportunity for pull-through of more
traditional degenerative products for you guys?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

It's certainly part of the rationale at the time of the deal. K2M are leaders in the deformity market, and
the opportunity there to really leverage their call point and their relationships with key opinion leaders was
absolutely part of the rationale for the transaction, along with the opportunity to refresh our portfolio. So
that rationale was relevant then, and it's still very valid today.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And obviously, it took time to cross-train all of our salespeople. That was part of the integration
challenges that we have. They are all cross-trained on the K2M products. And you're right that pull-
through is a key part of why our growth will accelerate.

Steven Michael Lichtman
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And then just secondly, on EU MDR, just curious on your thoughts for Stryker specifically? And
obviously, as an industry leader for the market, how do you see that impacting cost, pace of innovation
and perhaps product discontinuations as a result of those regulations?

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

Yes. We continue to refine and expand how we look at EU MDR. We also have done a lot of work in terms
of thinking about the value proposition that we offer in that space. More and more, our investors are
becoming more interested in that and have asked us questions about it. When I was over in Europe doing
fundraising in November, it pretty much came up in every meeting. So it is something that we have a
focus on. Our communications department is working and has hired someone full time to look at it. And so
I think you'll see more out of us in the coming years.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Yes. I think one of the things Stryker did, and started, frankly, before EU MDR, was what we call a focus
on power brands. And so we've been rationalizing our portfolio pretty significantly, and that ended up
being a real blessing when EU MDR came about because we had already decided to move out of a lot of,
let's call them, peripheral SKUS. And so we're -- we feel very well prepared. There has slightly been --
recently been a slight reprieve on the dates for EU MDR, but we are all systems go ready for that. We
don't really believe it's going to have any meaningful change to how we innovate given that we do have
this kind of power brand-focused mentality around our innovations.

Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats again on a stellar year. I just wanted do 2 quick questions on Mako. First, I mean, China, I know
you're waiting on the Total Knee approval. Maybe you can just help provide us with some color just on
that opportunity. Any details that you can give in terms of, I guess, the TAM or a number of Orthopaedic
synergy you could address with Mako in China?

And then secondarily and with competition coming more into play this year, I understand that Stryker is
not going to be standing still. But what can we expect over the course of this year to hear about in terms
of iterative advancements for Mako Total Knee? Is there anything we could see at AAOS? Or anything --
how should we be thinking about the advancement of Mako Total Knee?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Yes. I think I'll start with the latter. The capabilities, the functions, the clinical benefits that the current
knee indication brings are increasingly being well-established and received. So that remains our focus.
Obviously, we have things in the R&D pipeline as we do with all our capital base products, looking at ways
to improve. But this is really a leading robotics technology with unique capabilities and indications across
the portfolio of joint replacements. As Kevin referenced, I believe, on his call, and I'm sure we'll talk about
Academy, we do have some new hip software coming to help facilitate that procedure. And so that will be
the focus.

It's really hard, turning to your question about China, to give you a quantifiable answer there. It's a
very large market, but it's still a developing market. It's around building out their Orthopaedics. But it's
certainly one, once we get our knee indication approved, we have a lot of excitement around. But just
keep in mind, OUS is really a number of different markets. It's not all tied to one or a couple of markets.
We've seen great performance in Asia and Australia and parts of Europe and Latin America and now seeing
Japan come online. So it's the totality of that geographic offering that I think will help really power our
OUS Mako performance.

Your next call comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.

Ryan Benjamin Zimmerman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Just 2 quick ones for me. Kevin, you guys have made a big push in the ENT, both with the Entellus
acquisition and Arrinex. Just curious if you could kind of speak to how you view your ENT business today,
whether you have sufficient scale in that business or what else you may need to do, whether it's further
M&A or additional hiring to kind of scale up in that space?

And then the second question is just around the instrument line. We've seen that revert to more of a mid-
single-digit growth rate relative to the first half of the year. And just love to get your thoughts on kind of
how we should be thinking about that line into 2020 and beyond just given the cadence there.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think you saw we split our sales force in Surgical, which is one the biggest part of our Instruments
division, had an incredible first half of the year, slowed a little bit in the second half of the year but still
a double-digit growth for the full year. Instruments has consistently, for the last decade, been a high
single-digit or low double-digit growth kind of business. And we expect continued high-growth out of
our Instruments franchise, so we are not lowering our expectations and thinking that Instruments will
suddenly become a slower grower.

And frankly, if you look at a lot of the acquisitions we've done, including more recently TSO3 and Invuity,
so there's a number of acquisitions. We keep feeding the instruments machine, and so you're going to
expect to see continued high growth out of Instruments.

I'm sorry, what was the other question? I think I missed the other one.

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

ENT.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Oh, ENT. We have sufficient scale now in ENT with -- I mean, Entellus, we already had some products
within Stryker, NasoPore and some smaller products. With the addition of Entellus, we have what we need.
I would call Arrinex a tuck-in. Could we do other smaller additions? Sure. Just like any of our businesses,
we can always do little tuck-ins. But I would say we don't need anything significant to be able to really win
in ENT. And I was very pleased with the momentum that we have in that business as we exited the year.

Your next call comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Yes, 2 questions. I guess, Katherine, clearly you've done a sizable volume of Total Knees on Mako.
2019 was a big year for you guys. As you start to expand into the other regions, what is -- what are the
key benefits that you're hearing most from your Mako surgeons at this point? What I guess I'm really
trying to understand is, what is driving the continued stellar adoption of the technology?

Katherine A. Owen
Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

I think it really comes down to several factors. The capabilities of the Mako robot with a CT scan
that is specific to that individual patient and allows for a patient-specific plan that can be changed
interoperatively with technology that allows optimal balancing of the knee, avoiding soft tissue disruption.
And it really helps improve outcomes. We've seen data that shows patients are ambulating more quickly,
they have less opioid use, they're getting out of the hospital more quickly. And that ties to having a
better-balanced knee and less tissue disruption, which is only possible with a patient-specific plan that
allows you to cut less because you have more knowledge specific to that patient. That's really resonating
with surgeons. And I think that's probably the biggest driving force behind what is increasing utilization
and adoption.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then I guess, just a financial question here. Look, you're going to have an increase in
your leverage once the Wright deal is done. I think you've mentioned you peak around 3x, but that's still
actually relatively low compared to other med tech peers out there. So I guess the question is where do

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

you -- where is the right level of leverage for you guys on a more steady state? And even as you come up
to these peak levels on -- post the Wright acquisition, can you continue to still do M&A as you continue to
move the leverage back down again?

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

Yes, I think the plan, first of all, is we would continue to deliver 30 to 50 basis points in the underlying
business even once we combine Wright. Then, honestly, we would work through the integration plan to
improve the overall leverage, which is obviously part of the acquisition modeling. I think as we think about
continuing acquisitions after we close on the acquisition of Wright, we would still plan to do small tuck-in
acquisitions, which are really the bread and butter of how we drive a lot of growth for our divisions. So I
don't see any change in that piece of the strategy.

There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any
