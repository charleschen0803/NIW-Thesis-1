Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone
Let’s get started with the balance sheet and take a look at average loans
In the second quarter, average loan balances remained relatively stable at $80.1 billion
Average balances in the consumer lending portfolio totaled $31.1 billion, a decline of $87 million
Consumer production increased 22%, but this growth was offset by the company’s decision to exit the third-party arrangement within the indirect vehicle portfolio
Excluding this runoff, average consumer loans increased approximately $140 million over the first quarter
Average indirect vehicle balances declined $201 million, or 5% during the quarter
Run-off in the third-party portfolio up $224 million, was partially offset by an increase of $23 million in our dealer financial services portfolio
The third-party portfolio is expected to decline between $500 million and $600 million on a full-year average basis during 2017. Average mortgage balances increased $168 million, or 1% consistent with seasonal increases typically experienced in the second quarter
We expect mortgage production in the second-half of the year to be comparable with the first-half of the year, despite additional declines in refinancing activity
Historically, our mortgage production mix has been weighted more heavily to home purchase versus refinancing activity, and enhancements to our online home loan direct mortgage channel will continue to provide a modest increase in production
Average home equity balances decreased $131 million, or 1%
Growth in average home equity loans of $52 million was offset by a decline of $183 million in average home equity lines of credit
Further, average line utilization decreased 66 basis points compared to the first quarter
Although, home equity balances are declining, the risk profile of the portfolio has improved significantly
We eliminated the interest-only option last year and today approximately 64% of total balances are in a first lien position
We also continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale lending initiatives
This portfolio increased $64 million, or 7% linked-quarter on an average basis
In addition, at the end of the second quarter, we purchased approximately $138 million of unsecured consumer loans, which are included in our other indirect lending portfolio
And we will continue to explore additional opportunities to further expand this portfolio
Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio remained relatively stable with the prior quarter, as the number of active cards increased approximately 2%, helping to offset a seasonal decline in outstanding balances
Turning to the business lending portfolio, average balances totaled $49 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $19 million, as growth in commercial and industrial was partially offset by declines in owner occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate construction loans
As Grayson mentioned, we experienced solid production increases during the second quarter, with commercial and investor real estate loan production increasing 56% and 35%, respectively
In addition, commercial line utilization increased 20 basis points and commitments for new loans increased approximately $700 million from the previous quarter
Growth in average commercial and industrial loans was led by new or expanded relationships in government and institutional banking, asset-based lending, financial services, and the real estate investment trust portfolios
However, this growth continues to be offset as we produce exposure in certain instances
For example, average direct energy loans decreased $67 million, or 3% during the quarter and now represent less than 2.5% of total loans outstanding
Average medical office building loans decreased $40 million, or 12%
In addition, investor real estate construction loans decreased $41 million, due in part to our ongoing efforts to better diversify production between construction and term lending
While production is improving, the declines in average owner occupied commercial real estate loans reflect the continued softness in demand and competition for middle market and small business loans
We expect to maintain the momentum experienced this quarter through the second-half of the year, with future growth driven in part by the technology and defense, financial services, power and utilities and asset-based lending portfolios
Let’s take a look at deposits
Total average deposits decreased $478 million less than 1% from the previous quarter, while average low-cost deposits decreased $335 million
Total average deposits in the Consumer segment increased $890 million, or 2% in the quarter
And this growth reflects the unique strength of our retail franchise and the overall health of the consumer
Average Corporate segment deposits decreased $581 million, or 2% during the quarter impacted by seasonal declines in public funds deposits
Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $496 million, or 5%, as a result of ongoing strategic reductions of collateralized deposits
Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments
Average deposits in the other segment decreased $291 million, or 8%, driven primarily by declines in average retail brokered sweep deposits
We will continue to manage and optimize our overall deposit base in the context of our balance sheet growth
Let’s take a look at the composition of our deposit base
Second quarter deposit costs remained low at 15 basis points and total funding costs were 34 basis points, illustrating our deposit advantage
As a reminder, our deposit base is more heavily weighted toward retail customers
Approximately, 74% of average interest bearing deposits and 53% of average interest free deposits are considered retail
In addition, we have a loyal customer base, as more than 44% of our consumer low-cost deposits have been deposit customers at Regions for more than 10 years
And finally, approximately 50% of our deposits come from MSAs with less than 1 million people and approximately 35% from MSAs with less than 500,000 people, both are in the top quartile versus our peer group
It’s for these reasons, we believe that our deposit base is a key component of our franchise value and is a competitive advantage, in particular, in a rising rate environment
So let’s look at how this impacted our results
Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $904 million in the second quarter, an increase of $23 million, or 3% from the first quarter
The resulting net interest margin was 3.32%, an increase of 7 basis points
Both net interest margin and net interest income benefited from several factors during the quarter, including higher interest rates and favorable credit-related interest recoveries
Further, one additional day in the quarter benefited net interest income by approximately $5 million, but negatively impacted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points
Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect continued growth in net interest income, net interest margin will be stable to up modestly, and this includes the negative impact of one additional day in the quarter and the potential need to issue debt in the near-term
Non-interest income increased $15 million, or 3% in the quarter
This included the recognition of $5 million deferred gain associated with the sale of affordable housing mortgage loans that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an operating lease impairment charge of $7 million recorded during the second quarter, compared to $5 million impairment charge recorded in the first quarter
When indications of possible impairment arise, we evaluate the current value of operating lease assets and record impairment charges when necessary
These impairment charges are recorded as reductions to other non-interest income
Adjusted non-interest income increased $9 million, or 2% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in capital markets income and bank-owned life insurance
Capital markets income increased $6 million, or 19%, as increases in fees generated from Fannie Mae DUS real estate placements and merger and acquisition advisory services were partially offset by declines in revenues associated with debt underwriting and loan syndications
Bank-owned life insurance increased $3 million, as a result of higher claim benefits
Mortgage production increased 25% during the quarter, while mortgage income remained relatively stable within total mortgage production, 80% was related to purchase activity and 20% was related to refinancing
An increase in mortgage servicing income was offset by modest spread compression and lower hedging gain
During the quarter, we completed the purchase of rights to service $2.7 billion of mortgage loans
And including this transaction, we have purchased the rights to service more than $15 billion of mortgage loans over the past four years
And looking ahead, increased servicing income is expected to help offset the impact of lower refinancing volumes
Looking forward, we expect a pickup in capital markets revenue along with modest growth in wealth management, mortgage and card and ATM fees to contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the second-half of the year
Let’s take a look at expenses
Total non-interest expenses increased 4% during the quarter
On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $899 million, an increase of $27 million, or 3% compared to the first quarter
Total salaries and benefits increased $19 million and included $10 million associated with a pension settlement charge
Excluding the pension settlement charge, salaries and benefits increased $9 million, or 2% and included a full quarter’s impact of merit increases, as well as increases in production-based incentives
These increases were partially offset by lower payroll taxes and a modest decline in staffing levels
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect higher production-based incentives commensurate with revenue growth
However, we expect total salaries and benefits to decline as pension and settlement charges are not expected to repeat at this level
Professional and legal expenses increased $6 million during the quarter, primarily due to an increase in legal settlement expense
Furniture and equipment expense increased $5 million, primarily associated with capital investment projects, including an enhanced online banking platform and other technology initiatives
As these are now included in our run rate, we expect furniture and equipment expense to remain approximately this level for the remainder of the year
The second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio increased 50 basis points to 63.2% and includes the impact of the pension settlement and operating lease impairment charges
These charges negatively impacted the adjusted efficiency ratio by 100 basis points during the quarter
And despite the negative impact of these charges, we continue to expect the full-year adjusted efficiency ratio to be approximately 62%
With respect to taxes, the effective tax rate improved 90 basis points in the quarter to 29.5%
Now shifting to asset quality, net charge-offs totaled $68 million in the second quarter, a 32% improvement over the first quarter and represented 34 basis points of average loans
The provision for loan losses was $20 million less than net charge-offs
A reduction in non-performing and criticized loans resulted in an allowance for loan and lease losses decline of 3 basis points to 1.3% of total loans outstanding
The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio increased to 6.9% in the quarter, compared to 6.1% in the first quarter, reflecting a specific reserve increase related to one oilfield service credit
Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale decreased $181 million, or 18% to 1.03% of loans outstanding, driven by broad-based improvement in commercial loans
Total business services criticized loans decreased 7% and total delinquencies decreased 5%
The improvement in criticized loans was primarily due to declines in energy and transportation and warehousing loans
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans, or coverage ratio was 127% at quarter-end
Excluding energy, the coverage ratio increased from 135% to 163% in the second quarter
Total direct energy charge-offs were $18 million during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $31 million
Let’s move on to capital and liquidity
During the quarter, we repurchased $125 million, or 9.1 million shares of common stock and declared $84 million in dividends to common shareholders, resulting in 70% of earnings being returned to shareholders
At the same time, our capital ratios remained robust
Under Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 12.% and the fully phased in common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at a 11.3%
And finally, our liquidity position remains solid, with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%, and we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter-end
As Grayson mentioned, we are pleased with our CCAR results and remain committed to prudently investing in our businesses for future growth, as well as returning an appropriate level of capital to our shareholders
Turning to our outlook for the balance of 2017, our expectations remain essentially unchanged from last quarter
Excluding the impact of our third-party indirect vehicle portfolio, we expect full-year average loans to be flat to slightly down compared to the prior year
However, looking ahead, we expect to modestly grow average and ending loans on a sequential linked-quarter basis over the second-half of the year
We expect full-year average deposit balances to be relatively stable with the prior year
We expect net interest income another financing income growth of 3% to 5% and full-year adjusted non-interest income growth of 1% to 3%
Total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2017 are expected to increase between zero and 1%, and we remain committed to achieving a full-year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 62%, with positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range
We now expect the full-year effective tax rate in the 30% to 31% range, and we expect full-year net charge-offs to remain in the 35 to 50 basis points range
So in summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and remain focused on continuing to execute our strategic plan to drive growth and shareholder value
With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning
And I’ll now turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call
Yes, Betsy, I want to add a couple of things
We don’t focus on trying to get to any particular loan deposit ratio
We believe the core of any bank franchise is the ability to attract and retain low-cost core deposit and we are very good at that
Regardless of if our loan-to-deposit ratio was even lower, we send a message to the field every day, all day about attracting low-cost core deposit
That’s just so fundamental to our profitability
That being said, we would love to have those deposits deployed in the loan book versus somewhere else, securities or otherwise
And we’re looking to grow loans as is prudent
And we did a little better this quarter, we’ll talk about loans in a minute
But we have good core funding
We’re ready to grow loans, but we’re not going to force it
We’re going to take what’s out there
Our teams are working hard to grow appropriately, and again, we’re not trying to solve for a given ratio
Yes, that’s a great question, because we’re really talking about holding the company debt versus bank debt
We – the liquidity profile of the bank is in great shape, as we just mentioned
We do have some corporate needs too at the holding company that that we need to take care of
The exact timing of that not sure, which quarter that will hit in
It likely be towards the end of the year
So I don’t know that there will be a whole lot of impact from that this year could be some
But the general corporate purposes include things like our share buyback too that we had to think through how we fund that
So that’s really what it’s about
Yes, that’s correct
We’ve talked about anywhere from $750 to $1 billion range that we would be looking at
Yes, sure
So before we get to NIM, which is at the result what we talked about NII
So we believe we can continue to grow NII
We’ve talked about the fact that we had good production from a loan standpoint
We expect loan growth to be more robust in the second-half of the year than it was in the first-half of the year
We’ve done a good job of controlling our deposit cost
Our deposit costs were up 1%, call that at 10% beta
Thus far, we’re not been able see, it’s been among the lowest of our peer group
And it really gets back to all the discussion we had on our deposit franchise and our beta and our core accrual smaller markets that we get deposits from
So we think that – the curves helped a little bit
I would tell you on the corporate side, LIBOR starts to move before increases happened
So we did get the June increase
The commercial side of that started to reflect it earlier, because LIBOR moved in advance
We do pickup a little bit more on the consumer side their prime base
Kudos in terms of the probability of the December rate increase, it’s not very high from a profitability standpoint right this minute
But as the market starts to anticipate that LIBOR to move too, I think our outlook really takes into account today’s boards
From a NIM standpoint, we did have 2 basis points that came through NIM this past quarter on recoveries – credit recoveries
We had guided a three to five
Last quarter, we ended up with seven and the two points really came from that
We don’t forecast those recoveries if they happen, they happen
And so that’s a little piece of the disconnect, where you’re trying to figure out why it’s stable to up modestly
You also have to look at where we are
I mean, we have a – on a relative basis to our peers, a pretty strong NIM
And when we have the curve, it’s pretty flat
So the profitability of what goes on relative to our existing NIM is even harder
So you don’t see quite the expansion that we’ve had
But if you take out the 2 points that I just mentioned, we should see growth similar to what we saw in the last quarter
Yes, we put in a plan to get down to that 9.5% by the end of 2018. We’ve mentioned numerous times, we can’t quite get there
We don’t think, at least, it depends on what loan growth looks like over that period of time
We’ll get close
We had anticipated, of course, we knew what our ask was at that time
We just are reluctant about sharing anything specific until our regulatory supervisors have an opportunity to object or not object
And so we’re confident at the submission even though we didn’t know
And we’re confident, we can get to that 9.5 in due time and we’re confident we’re going to get to our 12% to 14% return on tangible common by then as well
So everything is coming together, as we planned
As we stated in the Investor Day over a year-and-a-half ago, we feel very good about where we’re marching towards that goal at this point in time
And we’re delivering on that 150, which is now at 260, a year early
And so, I mean, I just used that as an example of where not only we’re trying to reduce expenses, but we’re trying to accelerate the pace of that expense management activity
Yes
So it’s a great question
Clearly, we – it’s critical that we get our common equity Tier 1 and other ratios to follow along with that to an appropriate level of capital for our company and optimized best we can, both in common and preferred – common items like preferred And I think that we can do that over this fairly short period of time
As you optimize your capital based on the risk within your balance sheet, we do start leaning more towards a higher percentage of our income being paid out in a full dividend
So we had as files our ratio in the 30% to 40% range, that’s moving up in the 35% to 45% range
As time goes, we’ll refine that as well
But I would think that right now based on where we are in the 35% to 45%, would seem to be a reasonable dividend payout ratio for us
Yes, Ken, it’s a great question, and you did the math exactly right
So you’re – take that $899 and back out the settlement fees, you get closer to another items you mentioned, you get about where our run rate is
Clearly, we are intently focused on managing our expense base
Grayson mentioned revenue is challenged
Erika brought up revenue being challenged
We’re not counting on rates to bail us out
And as a result, we are focused on everything expense-related from people, process, technology
And right now, we think that that run right that you mentioned is fairly accurate for us for the remainder of this year
Yes, as you know, about 60% – a little over 60% of our – or right at 60% of o our total expenses is compensation-related
So if you’re going to move the meter on expenses, you’re going to move it based on that
And so being able to – we have natural attrition as every company does, takes care of a piece of that, trying to change processes up quicker than we otherwise would have done to the piece of that not having to backfill people that attrit is important
As John mentioned, the branch consolidation, so we’ve put 22 on the Board and maybe we don’t consolidate quite at the pace that we have done in the recent history
We continue to look at our retail footprint in terms of consolidations and additions
So for us managing expenses all about optimizing everything that we do and we have a pretty high sense of urgency to get that done
So we’re going to look to bring forward as much as we can
Again, our goal is focusing on getting our return by the end of 2018 in that range of 112% to 14% and expense management is a critical piece of that
Yes
So I’ll give you some parameters
So we don’t really factor in data for the next quarter
But kind of over the next 12 months, our beta assumptions really haven’t changed
They started 40%, end up at 60% at the terminal pass-through
I think a good guide that you might want to have everybody could use is for every 5 data points, it’s about $8 million for us
So as we get a hike, that could be anywhere from $50 million to $60 million of NII just depending on what happens from a beta standpoint
We do think that the pace of change or pace of rate increases is helpful to keep beta down
But we also are realistic in knowing at some point, we’re going to have to pass-through some of the increase at a faster pace than we have today, which is only 10%
So we think we’re probably a little conservative in terms of our longer-term beta assumption, especially for the next increase or two
Yes, that’s a great question
And I’m glad you brought it up, because that’s not a static number
The 9.5%, we evaluate that all the time
We look at our risk profile
We think through the derisking that we’ve done
That 9.5% could go both ways
I mean, if we put more risk on the balance sheet, because we decide do something else, we’ll hold appropriate capital for it
But if we derisk continue to derisk the 9.5% goes lower than that, and I think it’s incumbent upon us
We’ve espoused 9.5% and we’ve kind of left it alone at that, because we’re at 11.3. Now let us get the 9%, as we start approaching 9.5%, we’ll give you a better indication as to what – tighten that up a little bit
But it’ll be over time for us get to that number
You did really good math, that’s about where we’ll be we need right at $700 million of preferred over time to bolster our Tier 1, which we’re solving through common equity
So, our capital regime is really about getting the capital down to the appropriate level, but optimizing this fact as well
So we want to solve the common equity Tier 1 with common equity obviously non-common needs to be a component of that, it’s cheaper than our cost of common today and you’ve nailed it
Well, we won’t
And we will – we’re going to wait as long as we can, because we don’t want to have the negative carry
And we’ll do that in conjunction with the whole optimization and rightsizing
So timing is critically important to us and we’ve got that timing down path
To the extent that we have – so our commitment is to have an appropriate amount of capital common equity Tier 1, as well as Tier 1. And if we’re solving Tier 1 with common equity, I don’t think there’s regulatory supervisor that hears that you solve that with that type of capital instrument
So we don’t have to issue of non-common instrument, preferred instrument unless we’re taking our common out as well at the same time
So we’re not forced to have negative periods, where I think we’re going
Okay
