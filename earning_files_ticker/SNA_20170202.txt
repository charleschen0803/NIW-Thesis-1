Good morning, everybody
I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and of our year and I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress
After that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials
The Snap-on fourth quarter, sales increases and broad profit gains marking another period of encouraging performance; again this quarter we had opportunities and we had headwinds
We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds
Overall sales in the quarter were $889.8 million, 4.5% higher than last year
That total included acquisition related volume from Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont and it also included the impact of $15.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency
Our organic growth in the quarter was 3.6% with gains registered across every group
EPS, it was $2.47, up 11.3% from the $2.22 registered in 2015. Our OpCo operating margin reached 19.8%, an increase of 70 basis points and those profits include $3.7 million of adverse foreign currency
Financial services earnings of 51.6% (sic) [$51.6 million] (3:27) were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin including both financial services and OpCo of 23.6%, an improvement of 90 basis points in the quarter
And our markets, well the Automotive Repair segment continues to remain favorable, changing technology, the aging vehicles requiring new tools and more repairs
Our Tools Group – progress in all geographies, gains throughout the franchise network and the repair systems and information, our RS&I Group, advancements across our businesses serving repair shops, owners and managers
All of them
Taken together these businesses confirm the ongoing strength of the repair market, and clearly demonstrate the opportunity available
Now for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I, the markets were mixed but overall positive
There were of course headwinds and some still recovering industrial sectors and a few macro-economically challenged geographies but in total, progress was across that group
military sales were robust
Budgets restraints loosened, and we are on point to take advantage
And we're ready to act in the future as further opportunities arise in that area
C&I's also the most international of our businesses
And in the period, our overall activity in the regions outside the U.S
increased, overcoming the economic turbulence that exists in Europe, the Middle East, and in some parts of Asia
So across the corporation, I would characterize our environment as mixed but positive, with ongoing strength in automotive repair and some improvement in the afflicted critical industries and the challenged geographies
And we remain confident that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, on the opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending in critical industries, and building in emerging markets
In looking ahead, we also see clear runways for further improvement
The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement in RCI is continuing to drive significant advantages
Our fourth quarter and our full year results clearly confirm that progress
And our new acquisitions, they provide more opportunity to apply those processes and create value
Now for the full year, sales were $3.43 billion, an as reported increase of 2.3%
The organic volume gain was 2.9%, with the Tools Group up 5.6%, RS&I rising 4.7%, and C&I slightly ahead of last year
Our EPS in 2016 was $9.20, an increase of 13.6%
And driving those earnings was an OpCo operating margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points for the full year
And when we include the income from financial services of $198.7 million, which rose $28.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation was 23%, up 170 basis points
Results achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities on our runways for growth, and by driving down our runways for improvement
Now let's move to the groups in our fourth quarter
In C&I, sales increased 1.6% from 2015, impacted by $6.2 million of unfavorable currency and helped by $4.2 million in acquisition related volume
Organic sales were up 2.4%, the second straight quarter of increases for C&I but with varied results across the group including gains by SNA Europe and by industrial, and decreases in the power tools and in places like India and Indonesia
C&I operating income was $43.9 million
That represents an operating margin of 15.3%, a rise of 40 basis points
That's our second quarter of 15%s
Encouragingly SNA Europe again posted increased organic sales, up high single-digits, continuing its progress
Now 13 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth
And the profit climb for SNA Europe was even steeper, now up 15 straight quarters
Snap-on Value Creation at work with innovative new products, and improved new processes creating those extended trends in some what I would call fairly challenging geographies
Also in C&I our Industrial division moved forward
As I mentioned before, on strong U.S
military sales, and also an array of new products
New products like – innovations like our radiator cap removal for the railroad sector, a specially designed offering used on locomotive or engine radiator caps replacing field cobble sockets, which were prone to early failure
The Snap-on solution incorporates deep machine grooves which provides the ample engagement and the strength necessary to remove what you might imagine are those very stubborn railroad caps
The new adapter can be paired with a standard ratchet, eliminating the need for the previously used long T-handled tool and therefore requiring less clearance to perform the task, making the job easier in those tight engine quarters
Another productivity solution born from a long list of customer connection made every day, this one for the rail industry
And for the Aviation segment, our Industrial division launched the Versatorq 2, torque data acquisition system, designed to verify and record torque ratings in tight and even hazardous environments
Places like aircraft fuel lines, the Versatorq 2 allows easy torque measurement deep inside air frames, where access is difficult and it includes an explosive-proof electronics making it safe, even in combustible environments
This unique Snap-on offering enables the technicians to record critical information, storing and recalling up to 3,500 torque readings
And the product is UL compliant for safety, and ATECH certified for use in potentially explosive atmospheres
And based on that, we believe we have a clear winner in the Versatorq
Our Power Tools division recorded lower sales in the quarter, as I said
That said, it did launch some promising new product
Product like our CTR714, a 14.4 volt quarter-inch drive cordless ratchet
It was launched in December so it didn't drive the quarter, but it has a great future
This latest tool in the Snap-on cordless family includes a tapered head designed for better accessibility, 35 foot pounds of torque output, perfect for applications with fasteners 10 millimeters or smaller that are delicate and difficult, a variable speed trigger for that all important control with those small fasteners, a built-in LED light to illuminate any work area, and new drive materials for increased strength, size, power and durability
Terrific for small fasteners in tight spaces, because of that, because of the size, power and durability and the applicability to tight spaces for small fasteners, we believe we have another best-in-class product with our cordless ratchet
Well, that's C&I
Now on to the Tools Group
A 3% rise in organic sales
Operating earnings of $73.5 million; a margin rate of 17.6%, up 10 basis points, a gain which includes 70 basis points impact from negative currency
So overcoming that fairly significant negative currency hit
Now, the volume growth in the Tools Group was not what we've seen in recent periods
The full year average for the group is 5.6%
But importantly, based on what we see in the shops, and what we hear from our franchisees, we don't believe there's been any significant change in the overall auto repair market
It's still robust, and offers abundant opportunity and we don't believe there's been any change in the positive trajectory of the Tools Group growing strength
We often speak of our Snap-on's runways for coherent growth, strategic avenues of sales opportunities
At the top of the list is enhancing the franchise channel, and we believe we're positioned to continue that positive trajectory
Throughout the year and even in the recent quarter, the Tools Group demonstrated significant progress along that runway, financials trending positively, the franchisee health metrics consistently gaining, both clearly representing a strengthening vehicle repair center, and an improved proposition for our franchisees
Beyond the numbers, there's a great deal of optimism throughout the network
You can see if you talk to these people
The franchisees attending our 2017 kick-off events held early last month all over the country, display a great deal of enthusiasm about the vehicle repair sector in general, and about their individual businesses in particular
I participated in the kick-off and I believe the level of excitement and confidence surrounding the van channel is stronger than ever
And our optimism was acknowledged by multiple publications, listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice
Again this year, Snap-on was ranked among the top 50 in Entrepreneur's magazine's list of top 500 franchises, finishing number one in the professional tools and equipment category, and the Franchise Business Review which collects franchisee feedback, satisfaction feedback, franchisee satisfaction feedback listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the tenth consecutive year we've received that reward
Finally, and my favorite, the Military Times included Snap-on in its Best for Vets annual ranking, coming in at number five, and representing the only mobile tool franchise on the list
Now this type of recognition would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product, many developed from insights from our customers, guided by Snap-on customer connection and invested with Snap-on technical insight and innovation
And in 2016, for the seventh straight year, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products
Those million dollar sellers developed from direct observations gained in the field
Take for instance the ATECH 300 electronic torque wrench
Launched in the fourth quarter, this latest torque offering solves an important customer problem
Many light vehicles today, pickups and SUVs, now use fasteners requiring between 250 foot pounds and 300 foot pounds of torque, and specifications for accurate measurements of those higher torques are increasing in number
The Snap-on ATECH 300 is the first light vehicle half-inch electronic torque wrench to rate at 300 foot pounds
It's lighter, more accurate, and it eliminates the need to add heavy duty tools just to accommodate the new pickup and SUV torque requirements
Designed and manufactured in our City of Industry facility in California, the ATECH 300 incorporates the same great features as our other ATECH models-a reduced profile for better accessibility, a longer handle for easily applying the extra torque, power interruption technology to prevent power resets and protect the data, and a large LCD screen for greater visibility
Franchisee feedback? Well, we launched it late in the year and it's selling out
We said, I think in many forms including this one that there's growing opportunity in vehicle precision, in torque measurement
As vehicles become more automatic, there's more need for more precision
Even in the fourth quarter we saw confirmation in that trend
Our torque line grew nicely; it's one of the reasons why we acquired the torque skills of Sturtevant Richmont and we expect good things going forward in that growing product line
Now let's move to RS&I
Volume in the fourth quarter was $319.8 million with an organic rise of 8.9%, significant gains in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a mid single-digit increase to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit rise of undercar equipment
Operating earnings of $82.5 million increased $10.4 million to 25.8% of sales, up 10 basis points, overwhelming, overcoming the impact of the newly acquired operations
RS&I expanded across the repair shop owner and manager sector, across the full sector, but particularly with independents
Our diagnostics and repair information businesses recorded double-digit volume growth with those important customers
Our Mitchell 1 operations offers independent shops leading facility management software, innovative marketing services, and the most comprehensive repair information anywhere
Using the Snap-on Value Creation principles of customer connection and innovation, our Mitchell 1 team utilizes thousands of customer contacts every year, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the speed to solution of its pro-demand product, and expanding the literally hundreds of millions of actual repair events in its unique sure-track big database, and in the fourth quarter the RS&I results clearly show the effect of the Mitchell 1 progress
Now for our diagnostics division, another encouraging quarter, led by ongoing success of recent product launches
We mentioned a couple of these in the third quarter: the MODIS Edge, handheld scanner, very sophisticated handheld scanner, and our thermal imager
A whole new category of vehicle diagnostics will both continue to exceed expectations, and both drove the diagnostic division to strong double-digit gains
RS&I also advanced its work station product line in the quarter, introducing the new EPIQ diagnostic work station
The EPIQ work station combines two of Snap-on's top of the line products, matching our sophisticated VERUS handheld with our EPIQ tool storage box into one custom platform
This enhanced work station is targeted for shops desiring capability
This combo will address the most challenging repairs
Convenience, everything a technician needs is right at hand
And confidence: the visible presence of the work station tells the customer that this shop is serious and sophisticated and able to tackle the most difficult of repairs
Work station sales are up nearly 40% year-over-year, and the new EPIQ combo is part of that success
The RS&I Group also includes progress with OEM dealerships
Over the years Snap-on Business Solutions, SBS, has developed an extraordinary level of insight and capability in developing and running electronic parts catalogs for dealerships
And their skills paid off in the quarter
As SBS captured the contract to provide a state of the art EPC for another major vehicle OEM, another win, and more growth for Snap-on in the OEM space
Finally in the period, the RS&I equipment division registered a low single-digit organic increase with mixed results across our North American and International Undercar operations
That said, we keep driving to expand our position with repair shops, with new products to sell and with strategic and coherent acquisitions
And in the fourth quarter, RS&I made an important addition to the equipment division with the acquisition of Car-O-Liner
The Car-O-Liner business brings greater capabilities in collision repair and strengthens our overall position in the heavy-duty segment
Given the trends in the collision space, the higher emphasis on shop efficiency and the power of matching Car-O-Liner with our other RS&I divisions, we believe this acquisition will create even more opportunities to expand with repair shop owners and managers going forward
We're excited
Well, that's our fourth quarter
OpCo organic sales growing 3.6%; EPS $2.47 in the quarter, up 13.6%
Progress along each of our runways for coherent growth, progress along those runways for coherent growth and acquisitions that will give us more to sell and make those runways even wider, and clear advancements down our runways for improvements, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and Rapid Continuous Improvement driving a 19.8% operating margin, 70 basis points higher than last year
It was an encouraging quarter
Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo
Thanks, Aldo
Well, you heard about our year and our fourth quarter
I believe they represent continuing confirmation of the opportunities along our runways for growth and testimony to the possibilities inherent in Snap-On value creation and our runways for improvement
C&I growing again in a very turbulent environment, finding the opportunities where they exist in critical industries, continuing the upward trend in Europe in difficult and uncertain economies, reaching an OI margin of 15.3%, one of its highest, up 40 basis points
The Tools Group growing, not equal to recent periods, but still displaying the hallmarks of continuing achievement: a robust vehicle repair sector, positive franchisee health, strong product introductions, and a continuing enthusiasm across the franchisees and the customers
And through it all, profit growth, OI margin of 17.6%, up 10 basis points, despite a 70 basis-point headwind from unfavorable currency
And RS&I, 8.9% organic growth, confirming the strength of vehicle repair, progress with independent shops and dealerships, exciting new products spearheading those advancements, and OI margins reaching 25.8%, up despite the impact of Car-O-Liner and its lower profit levels
And the acquisitions, Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont adding more product fuel for growth and providing more opportunity for improvement
It all came together to bring our OpCo operating margin to 19.8%, up 70 basis points
And when you add Financial Services, the overall operating margin was 23.6%, up 90 basis points
It was an encouraging quarter and an encouraging year
And we believe we have the market and the position and the team to continue the trend of extended positive performance through 2017 and beyond
Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates
I know, again, many of you are listening
The progress accomplished is a direct reflection of the capability and perseverance you contribute to our effort
For your achievements in the quarter and the year, you have my congratulations, and for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks
Now I'll turn the call over to the operator
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session
Yes, there was, there was
Look, the thing is, as we said, we launched two dynamite new products and actually the thermal imager for us is a whole new category of diagnosing a vehicle, not data driven but physically driven by looking at a vehicle
Like, for example, if you're looking for a bad cylinder, it's tough to tell from the electronic diagnostics, but you can tell if you focus the thermal imager on it and see which one is hot
That changed everything
That created a lot of volume in that situation, a lot of attention for diagnostics
And then the MODIS Edge was another extension of our already pretty robust line, but a pretty good tool
So those two really drove the business into that 8.9%
Then you had the Mitchell 1 had its usual strong performance in terms of selling to shops
And then we had some comeback with dealerships, which can be lumpy
The lumpy side can be dealerships
But mostly, the story is new product
Well, we always say, look, it's 4% to 6%
That's what we're targeting in most environments
We expect RS&I to be in the middle of that, and the RS&I numbers in the last three years are 4.9%, 4.9%, 4.7%
But this particular one with these new products we feel pretty positive
No
Look, okay, the Tools Group was not equal to its normal trend, but 3% isn't a poke in the eye with a stick in a 1.9% economy
So we still feel okay about that
But you could have reasonably expected more
But everything we look at, the enthusiasm of the market, the strength of our product, our franchisees, how they react, we feel pretty positive about that
So what I'm saying is, is that you look at those numbers and you may say, below trend but in anything you look at from a physical point of view or for a conversational point of view or seeing a product pipeline point of view, you feel confident
Morning
No, I don't think so
The timing is not really – we have up weeks and down weeks
It's hard to make any interpretation in that, David
I think simply stated, I hate to use an analogy like this, but sometimes your clean-up hitter hits a single and a double and doesn't hit a homerun and you still win the game, and that's the way we see this quarter
I wouldn't use the word weaker 3%
I hate to use that word because I think it's a reasonable growth, but yeah, it is below trend and we are unsatisfied with that number
Well, we always say our growth is going to be in the 4% to 6% range, and that's the kind of thing we think of
And Tools Group grew at 5.6% in the last quarter – I mean last year, sorry, last year
And so I don't think we see anything to interrupt our trajectory, let's put it that way
Well, I'll speak to the originations
Look, originations is in the Tools Group (44:02), it follows the Tools Group
And fundamentally in the quarter what you see is high growth in the diagnostics area
The diagnostics products were the hottest, in particular the thermal imager, which tends to be at the bottom end of the diagnostics range, we would still classify it as big ticket
But the origination, the credit penetration in that area of diagnostics tends to be lower
So you fundamentally look at the characteristics of the diagnostic sales and we shake our head and say, yes, lower administration, makes a lot of sense based on what we sold in the Tools Group
And so that's kind of our view in that – and It's perfectly explainable in those kinds of situations and seeing what happens with the Tools Group
It's a lot less change next quarter because of the characteristics of what sells and what new products come out
In terms of the reserves, I'll let Aldo talk about that
Well, we don't see the end market weakening, actually
That was the whole point of half of my script here
I don't think we see that to the extent that anything we see – I was just on a van the other day, two days ago, and it didn't seem that way
I was in the garages and those guys seemed pretty robust in their view of the world, talking about how they've had to turn away business, in fact
I know this is a windshield survey, but in terms of the kickoffs were three weeks ago
And we all go out all over the country and everybody came back saying, our guys are more pumped than ever before
So we don't see that, anyway
We don't see the end-market weakening at all
I think ticket was up, but it was – when we say that big ticket you can classify it into three pieces or three general pieces, David
You've got the tool storage boxes, right
They're the biggest of the big ticket, and almost all of them get financed
And then you've got diagnostics that goes through a range
And then you have some other dribs and drabs, like we'll sell welders and things like that, but that is not a big ticket item
Big ticket grew faster in Tools Group, but the lion's share of that growth was in the diagnostic product, the MODIS Edges, which are expensive, and they are – maybe list price is probably $6,000, $5,999, something like that
And then you've got the thermal imager, which was at the bottom of the range
The list price is somewhere I think around $1,300, $1,400. So the thing is, is that you've got a lower end at that level
So your big ticket was greater than the Tools Group, but more anchored in the lower end of big ticket than in maybe the quarters we've been used to lately
Tool storage was slightly off this quarter
So the tool storage representation was not as strong in this
So thus the smaller originations than it used to because thermal imagers, the penetration, the need for financing is a lot lower than for tool storage box
No, maybe
There's a lot of things
I think – I don't know
Fundamentally these kinds of things are fairly judgmental in that situation (49:23)
That's certainly a possibility, although we don't think – we try not to pull ahead those kinds of things, but certainly launches of new products really affect this kind of thing
And remember that you're talking about difference between 3% growth and 6% growth in the Tools Group, you're talking about one set of sockets once a week for every franchisee
So it's a difficult thing to – when you're talking about those differences, it's a difficult thing to pin down exactly the results
I would say if you're talking about tool storage, the biggest effect was hot diagnostics taking a lot of attention
Yeah
There is
I mean I think we say that we keep driving up the margin, there's a lot of reasons for this
I mean fundamentally we see a lot of opportunities even today for improvement in Snap-On in every division, that's number one
Number two is, yes, material prices are rising, but we don't buy that much and you've never heard me explain on this call variance associated with material costs and we've made a couple of acquisitions now that gives us more grist for the Snap-On value creation mill
So I see lots of opportunities there still
So I don't think, by no means have we hit the top anywhere
Bingo! It was flat, but we increased the Techno-Vans, which sells diagnostics
We moved those up 10% in the quarter, 20% year-over-year
So that's a relevant question
I didn't add that before, but that's one of the things that helped drive the diagnostics business
It all come together, new product and more power in the field's marketing of all this
Now, as I've said in the past, I'm not so sure that has an effect, and the fact that we didn't increase Rock 'N Roll vans doesn't necessarily have an effect because we think we get better every quarter at using them, but the fact is we haven't increased them for some time
I'll just say, I don't like to talk about the absolute number because I don't want to get pinned to the cross of reporting on hit products every year
But I'll just tell you this, versus 10 years ago we've reached more than 6 times
And we keep growing on a regular basis
Sure
Just to ground ourselves, in the fourth quarter we took about a $15 million hit in revenue from currency and about $0.05 or $4 million on the bottom line in currency
And for the full year we had about $50 million, just north of $50 million, $51.5 million and $0.26 or $23 million in currency
Looking forward, this is the darndest thing; at the end of the year we would have said same stuff
It would have been the same numbers, right
When we looked at it we figured we're going to see more or less the same currency effect that we had last year
You kind of rolled it out maybe a little different in conversation
But since the year-end things have changed, and we think the currency number's kind of half, for ballpark numbers you can kind of look at a half type currency
Look, maybe a little bit more than that early, right now if rates stay right where they are today we think it ends up being about half
And the interesting thing about this is we talked about delinquencies and provisions in the credit company
The effect of currency, the $23 million, is humongous compared to our noise around that
And of course currencies can always change, so tomorrow I may wake up and this may all be different
But if you took them today, we'd expect some relief
And that relief would be big, would be nice
Oh, we're saying double-digit growth for the independent shop owners
The repairs, the diagnostics and software for the independent repair shop owners, Mitchell 1 sells the software in terms of SureTrack with the hundreds of millions of dollars of records of repair
And then diagnostics is the hardware and software-based sale, things like a thermal imager or a handheld diagnostic that will decode everything a car wants to say
So if you take that together it's like double-digits
I don't know
I hear all that, but I'm not sure I believe it
The thing is that every time I go in a garage sometimes the guys will tell me the weather has shafted us, and other people will say, the snow will make it bad for us because people can't get in
Other people will say the snow makes it good because they have a lot more procedures
So I'm not so sure how to play with that
What I will tell you about this is the Europeans tend to follow this
And the European business was much more sluggish compared to the North American business in this particular area
And Eastern Europe hasn't been too good to us in the equipment business either
I wish I could say that I was, but the problem is, it seems like when we take one step forward, we take a step backwards in another place
For example, we're up in China this year, India difficult
I'm sure you're probably familiar with the demonetization in India and people ran out of cash
And a lot of our smaller distributors do a cash business, so our business went – kind of weakened in the third quarter
So we're seeing that kind of balance
The turbulence has bedeviled us lately in terms of Indonesia being down and Thailand being up
So we see progress from a physical point of view, I feel better about the business, but we haven't been able to monetize it yet
I'm confident we will, but it hasn't been a meaningful contributor to us
It will be though
It will be
I'm just saying, I'm confident it will be
But it hasn't been yet because we're managing over all those differences
Well, yeah
I mean the thing is, is that a couple of things
Of course, increasingly the franchisees are deciding on their own to add assistants
Now we have about 20% of them up with assistants; I think there's 695 or something like that, up about 20% year-over-year
And that gives them more – in effect adds time to each van
And what we've done is, we've put programs in place to support them: new computer systems, tablets that allow them to have two people wandering around a garage or separated off the van and can still have a cash register in their hand
And so that's been a kind of positive event
That's one thing I can think of for sure
And then, of course, just this quarter we expanded the Techno-Vans, another 10% growth quarter-over-quarter, 20% year-over-year
And that saves time because it puts an expert at the beck and call of a franchisee for a short period of time, and it also gives him and expands his selling space
So the Techno-Vans both amplify the time and allow him to time share more space for selling
There's a number of smaller things which we focus on in terms of how they're going to manage their inventory, how they're going to do other things
I mean we are developing, actually remember: change is our friend
It requires the mechanic to change his tool set and to get new implements to allow him to repair these cars
And make no mistake about it, they need repair
And so we are working on this but just to be clear, unfortunately for us, it ain't happening next Thursday
There are 300 million vehicles on the road in North America and a very micro-percentage of them are really hybrids and electronic, even today
But we are doing new things
For example, hybrids and electronics, we have a whole line of insulating tools
If you're poking around inside those engine compartments whether they are electric or hybrid, there's a lot of voltage in there, you don't want to get fried
And in fact there's a lot of danger
So a whole set of tools has to be used to particularly do that and we have them available
In terms of automated cars, that's what I was talking about in terms of torque
Any time a car becomes more reliant on a system, it requires more calibration, more precise adjustment
And torque is one of the things that's more important
Of course, there's a whole bunch of other things like alignment and tire balancing, and a number of things that emanate from precision that opens up a whole new range of opportunities for us
So as cars become more automatic, we're investing in torque
You heard me talk about the AT300. Because of the need for that precision, that's why the SUVs and light trucks are requiring this precise torques of such large numbers
They didn't used to do that
And in terms of things like lane departure systems or self-parks or adjusting automated cruise control, they all need more of this and that means precision
That's why we're buying in the torque sector because we believe this is a natural emanation of it
And one of the bright spots of the Tools Group in the fourth quarter was torque was up substantially, verifying that, confirming that view of the world
