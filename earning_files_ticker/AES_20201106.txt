THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the AES Corporation third quarter financial review. [Operator Instructions]
Please note that this event is being recorded.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ahmed Pasha, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Ahmed Pasha
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 financial review call. Our
press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.

Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may
cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-
K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be
found on our website along with the presentation.

Joining me this morning are Andrés Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta,
our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.

With that, I will turn the call over to Andrés. Andrés?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter financial review call. Today, I
will cover both our near-term priorities and the progress we have made on our larger strategic goals.
On our last call, I outlined 3 top priorities: first, achieving our 2020 guidance; second, attaining a
second investment-grade rating; and third, decarbonizing our portfolio. We see all 3 of these goals, both
individually and collectively, as catalysts for attracting a wider investor base. Perhaps more importantly,
we see all 3 as clear demonstrations of our ability to thrive in today's evolving landscape.

Today, I am pleased to report that we're making great progress on all of these objectives and have several
exciting developments to discuss. First, as Gustavo will review in his remarks, our portfolio continues to
prove its resiliency in the face of COVID-19, and we're on track to achieve our full year guidance. In fact,
we expect to be at the top end of the ranges for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow.

Turning to our goal of attaining a second investment-grade rating. I'm proud to say that we were upgraded
by S&P earlier this week. This reflects the low level of risk inherent in our current business model. Two
investment-grade ratings will help us reduce our overall cost of capital and enable us to attract a broader
investor base. Following this milestone, we remain committed to further strengthening our balance sheet
and increasing the percentage of our business in the U.S.

Now to our third priority of aggressive decarbonization on Slide 4. As you may recall, we set a near-
term target to reduce our coal generation to below 30% of total generation by the end of this year and
to below 10% by 2030. I'm happy to report that with today's announced retirement of an additional 1.2
gigawatts, we have reduced our coal generation to 29% on a pro forma basis. 3/4 of these retirements are
in the U.S., and the remainder are in Chile. Importantly, these retirements were already anticipated in our
guidance, and we will achieve our decarbonization targets while delivering on our financial commitments.
We see the transformation of our portfolio as an ongoing process, and we expect to announce additional
coal retirements and asset sales in the near term. However, this milestone is significant in that it puts us
in compliance with the environmental criteria of several large investors, including Norges Bank. In the
longer term, we expect to produce net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Moving to our long-term strategy and the progress we've made to date. As we have discussed previously,
our strategy revolves around 3 core themes: one, investing in sustainable growth; two, offering innovative
solutions; and three, delivering superior results.

Turning to Slide 5. We are well positioned to meet our strategic and financial objectives. So far this year,
we have signed PPAs for 2.1 gigawatts of wind, solar and energy storage projects, which is the most we
have signed in the first 3 quarters of any given year.

On to Slide 6. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts, which is also the largest in our history.
Approximately 1/3 is under construction, with the majority expected to come online through 2022. Almost
half of this backlog is in the U.S., which we expect to grow as a proportion of our business going forward.
Our backlog includes a mix of solar, wind, energy storage and our Alto Maipo hydro project in Chile. We
continue to make good progress at Alto Maipo, where construction is more than 96% complete.

As you can see on Slide 7, renewables are now nearly 40% of our installed capacity, and this proportion
will grow materially as we complete the 6.8 gigawatts in our 100% renewable backlog and sell and retire
additional coal plants. In addition to our renewables backlog, we see significant growth opportunities at
our 2 U.S. utilities, DP&L and IPL. We are pleased with the recent developments at IP&L (sic) [ DP&L, ]
where we reached a constructive settlement on various pending regulatory proceedings. Gustavo will
provide additional details shortly, but this settlement is truly a milestone for DP&L as it grows its rate base
and its network.

Turning to Slide 8. I have previously discussed that our Green Blend and Extend strategy, where we work
with existing customers to convert the power sold from thermal to renewable generation while extending
the contract life. This approach allows all parties to meet their financial and environmental objectives.
Since our last call, we signed an additional 410 megawatts of solar capacity under a 17-year contract in
Chile, bringing our total Green Blend and Extend execution to more than 2 gigawatts. As a demonstration
of the strength of our existing coal contracts, in August, AES Gener reached an agreement with BHP for
early termination, resulting in a payment of $720 million, which we will use in part to fund our renewables
growth in Chile.

While we only report on our projects with signed PPAs, as you can see on Slide 9, we have a robust
development pipeline, which we believe is one of our key differentiators. We currently have a development
pipeline of 25 gigawatts in key markets, of which 12 gigawatts are in the U.S. Over the past couple of
months, we have been solidifying our pipeline by securing land and interconnection rights. We already
have very capable solar and energy storage development teams, and we recently acquired a group of
experienced wind developers.

Expected renewables growth in the U.S. is currently 20 gigawatts per year. However, this rate could
accelerate. We are very well positioned to take advantage of any increase in the rate of growth in demand
for renewables. Furthermore, we also could benefit from an extension of ITC and PTC incentives for
renewables as well as the potential for new incentives for stand-alone storage.

Turning to Slide 10 and our LNG strategy. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business as
complementary to our renewables growth by offering a clean, predictable and low-cost fuel that provides
capacity and flexibility to the system. We are focusing our LNG business in 3 markets: the Caribbean,
Central America and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural
gas to supply new generation and to displace coal and higher-cost fuel oils.

As you may know, we're developing an efficient 2.2 gigawatt combined cycle gas facility and a 450 tera
BTU LNG terminal in Vietnam. We have hit key milestones towards closing these projects, which will
help meet Vietnam's rapidly growing electricity demand. Last week, we signed a term sheet for the LNG
terminal in partnership with PV GAS, the state-owned gas utility. In parallel, we have seen strong interest
from potential lenders to finance the majority of the capital costs.

In Central America and the Caribbean, we continue to lead the transition to cleaner natural gas. We
currently have a total of 150 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity, and an additional 50 tera BTUs is under
construction in the Dominican Republic. We now have contracted 60% of this storage capacity, and we're

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

in advanced discussions for an additional 20%. This would bring our total contracted volume to 80%
in 2023 and beyond. For context, 200 tera BTU of LNG volume can serve approximately 3 gigawatts of
natural gas generation.

Moving on Slide 11. The second component of our strategy is offering innovative solutions. We see the
energy needs of our clients, like Google, evolving to achieve the highest standards in clean energy. We
are leading this transition through our unique integration of renewables with our scalable platforms of
Fluence, 5B and Uplight. Our technological innovation gives us a key competitive advantage. An example
is energy storage, where we have access to the latest technology in the sector and combine it with our
unique industry insights to create transformative clean energy solutions. As a reminder, working closely
with our customer, KIUC in Hawaii, we were the first company to develop a true 24/7 solar and energy
storage project, and we continue to advance new applications. In fact, we recently inaugurated the world's
first virtual reservoir in Chile, which combines run-of-the-river hydro with battery-based energy storage,
allowing us to sell our energy when prices are highest.

Turning to Slide 12. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third
parties, continues to maintain its position as the market leader in the sector. This year, Fluence has been
awarded 690 megawatts of contracts, increasing their awarded or delivered capacity to 2.4 gigawatts.
Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million this year, an increase of 400% compared to last year.

While rapidly growing their backlog, Fluence continues to enhance their digital capabilities and to
complement their suite of solutions. To that end, Fluence acquired AMS, the leading provider of AI-
enabled bidding software for storage and generation assets. Through the AMS acquisition, Fluence now
has ongoing contracts for digital bidding services for more than 2.4 gigawatts, most of it, additional to
Fluence's fleet. The integration of this technology to Fluence's current offerings will help optimize the use
of energy storage and to ensure the greatest value for their clients.

We're also looking to additional new products and innovation that could transform the sector, as shown on
Slide 13. With our recent investment in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company, solar projects can be
built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land. We believe that being able to double solar energy output
from a given area will become a great differentiator as solar penetration increases, especially near urban
and congested areas.

In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we
see an addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our own development pipeline. We aim to be the most
competitive solar operator and developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density
in combination with our ongoing robotic and digital initiatives.

One example of how we are integrating all of these technologies to improve customer outcomes is the
Andes II B project in Chile. This project consists of 180 megawatts of solar, incorporates 10 megawatts of
5B's technology and includes 560 megawatt hours of energy storage, the largest in Latin America.

Another example of our leading innovations is our Uplight platform, which is helping utilities improve
energy efficiency and balance system demand. Both of these capabilities are increasingly relevant to
Uplight's 100 million end users and 80 utility customers in the U.S.

Finally, as I previously discussed, we continue to be on the forefront of new technologies. To that end, we
have been running tests on hydrogen at several thermal plants in Latin America. We consider ourselves
to be well positioned to be a leader to incorporate green hydrogen if and when it becomes economic
sometime in the future.

Turning now to the third component of our strategy, which Gustavo will spend more time on: delivering
superior results. By investing in our development pipeline, we are earning attractive risk-adjusted returns.
As you can see on Slide 14, in the U.S., we're earning low double-digit returns, while internationally, we're
earning mid- to high-teen returns.

Before concluding, I would like to note that last week, we launched a new brand with a new logo, as
you can see on our slides. We have transformed AES into a leader in clean energy, and our new brand

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

symbolizes our position at the forefront of the technological and commercial changes that are redefining
our industry.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our
results, debt profile and guidance.

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business
model, our performance during the third quarter, and our capital allocation plan.

Let me start with our resilient business model. Over the last decade, we have proactively transformed our
portfolio. And now 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an
average contract life of 14 years, supported by credit-worthy off-takers. At the same time, more than 80%
of our earnings are now in dollars. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow.

Turning to Slide 16. You can see how our portfolio has performed during these challenging times. As
you know, a majority of our customers are large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that
continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. As a result, Q3 receivables and days
sales outstanding remained stable and very much in line with historical levels.

Moving on to Slide 17. The impact of the global lockdown on our financial results has been mostly limited
to our utilities. Our generation businesses have been largely unaffected due to the take-or-pay nature
of contracts and customers being deemed essential. As you may recall, in our first quarter call, we had
anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. Since then, demand
performance has been better than our expectation. For Q3, our initial projection was for a demand drop of
about 5% to 7% at our U.S. utilities, while the actual result was significantly less severe than anticipated.
On a weather-normalized basis, the net combined volume at DPL and IPL is mostly flat. Demand at DPL
was up 3%, largely driven by the higher load from residential customers, while demand at IPL was down
3% as the load from commercial and industrial customers has yet to reach pre-COVID levels. Accordingly,
the total net impact of the lower demand on our utilities was only $0.01 on adjusted EPS for the quarter,
better than our initial expectation of $0.02 to $0.03.

Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 18. Adjusted EPS was $0.42 for the quarter versus $0.48 last
year. Our quarterly results reflect an $0.11 impact, most related to last year's insurance recovery and an
outage that occurred this quarter at one of our facilities in Dominican Republic, which is already back in
operations. Results also reflect the regulatory changes that were implemented at DP&L and in Argentina
in Q4 2019. These headwinds were partially offset by higher contributions from the Southland repowering
project, our Eurasia SBU, our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives as well as a lower tax rate.

Turning to Slide 19. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $331 million for the quarter, a decrease of
$95 million versus the third quarter of 2019. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides
beginning on Slide 20.

In the US and Utilities SBU, PTC remained relatively flat. The benefit from the commencement of PPAs at
Southland Energy CCGTs was mostly offset by the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL in 2019 as well as lower
demand at our utilities due to the impact of COVID-19.

Before moving on, I would like to take a moment to update you on recent regulatory developments at
DP&L on Slide 21. I'm very pleased to announce that we have reached a successful settlement with PUCO
staff and key intervenors, resolving 4 open proceedings, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty
and allowing us to move forward with our smart grid investments. More specifically as a result of this
settlement, DP&L committed to file a new ESP by October 1, 2023, and will continue to recover its
approximately $80 million annual rate stabilization charge until the new ESP becomes effective. DP&L will
make smart grid investments of $249 million over the next 4 years, which will earn a return through the
investment infrastructure rider. Resolution was reached on the 2 pending retroactive SEET tests related to
2018 and 2019. And DP&L passed the SEET and MFA regulatory tests filed earlier this year.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 22. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was
primarily driven by drier hydrology at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia, resulting in lower generation
and high energy purchases. Lower PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects the outage-related impacts I
discussed previously as well as the arbitration settlement at Changuinola this year.

Finally, in Eurasia, higher results reflect lower maintenance and outages as well as lower interest expense
due to debt repayment in 2020. It also includes a favorable variance in India given the OPGC COD delay
last year.

Now to Slide 25. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted
EPS of $0.96 versus $1.02 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to
$1.42. In fact, based on our strong year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year,
we are now expecting to be at the top end of this range.

Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 26. As we have discussed on our prior calls, since 2011, we
reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. As Andrés mentioned, we recently
received our second investment-grade rating. We are very pleased that S&P has recognized the underlying
quality and strength of our portfolio. As you can see on this slide, we have improved our ratings by 2 to 3
notches over the last 4 years. Strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities, and we'll continue to
take steps to maintain and further improve upon current levels.

Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 27. We expected $1.5 billion of discretionary cash this year,
which is roughly $100 million higher than our prior disclosure.

Regarding asset sales, today, we are very pleased to announce a sell-down of 35% of our interest in the
Southland repowering projects for $424 million to Ullico, expanding from our successful partnership at
sPower. This transaction demonstrates the substantial intrinsic value of our portfolio and how we benefit
from our platform and long-term contracted assets. As you may recall, Southland has a 20-year contract
and was commissioned early this year. This sell-down implies a total equity value of more than $1.2
billion. With this transaction, combined with our previously announced asset sales, we have exceeded our
proceeds target for the year by approximately $100 million for a total of $650 million. Further, based on
our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now also expect parent
free cash flow to come in at the top end of our range of $725 million to $775 million.

Moving to the right-hand side, uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter, except the investments
in our subsidiaries, which are roughly $200 million higher. The increase primarily reflects a temporary
cash injection at Southland and higher investments in renewables. Approximately 90% of the $900 million
of investments in subsidiaries are in the U.S., contributing to our goal of increasing the proportion of
earnings from the U.S. to about half.

Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022 beginning on Slide 28. We continue to
expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated
from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.

Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 29. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder
dividends. Subject to any review by the Board, we continue to expected to increase the dividend by 4% to
6% per year, in line with the industry average.

We also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL,
the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener. Once completed, these
projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. We have made great
progress on our key objectives. Specifically, we secured a second investment-grade rating. We reduced

our generation from coal to below 30%. We signed 2.1 gigawatts of new renewable contracts, increasing
our backlog to a record 6.8 gigawatts. And we are growing our development pipeline and deploying new
technologies, such as Fluence, 5B and Uplight. Finally, with our year-to-date financial performance, we
now expect to be at the top end of our guidance ranges for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow.
With that, I would like to open the call to your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe starting -- just starting off with the Fluence process, could you update us on the latest timing and
expectations around the sale of the minority interest?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Sure. The capital raise at Fluence is going very well. We have strong interest, and we expect to get it done
by the end of this year.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So namely kind of no impacts from the elections or considerations around there specifically to the sale?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Not really. I mean this capital raise, people are looking at the long term. And certainly, lithium ion-based
energy storage has a great future ahead of it as the -- as I said in my remarks, it's growing very rapidly,
and it's the leader in the sector. So it really is a unique investment opportunity. So no, we've seen no
impact whatsoever.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And had there been any shift in the kind of interest or types of party evaluating Fluence?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

None whatsoever.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Great. And then just curious on the outage cited on the quarter. I know you said the facilities back
in operations. Any color around the outage itself and, I guess, risks in that facility going forward?

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

No, it was -- this is Gustavo, Rich. No, it was an outage that we had in DR, in one of our facilities there.
It's about $0.02 impact in the quarter, but the facility is back in operation already.

Operator

Next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Congratulations on a -- a litany of developments here, it's hard to know where to start.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

At the outset here, how about this? So you've had a lot of success across your businesses here. When you
think about the earnings trajectory of the renewables business altogether, how would you characterize
that, right? Given the backlog, given the success year-to-date, given capital available to deploy back into
it, how in aggregate would you kind of describe its attribution or contribution to the EPS growth rate? And
then relate it to Fluence as well, if you can. I know it's still small.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Let me start sort of big picture. Most of our business, most of our earnings is coming from the
traditional businesses. So this is sort of an add-on, and we're retiring some of the thermal assets. So it's a
transition.

So it's going to be growing over time. We feel very good about the way it's sort of blending in. It's
something like Green Blend and Extend. It's blending in to this growth.

So we have a backlog of 7 gigawatts. It's a good mix of U.S. and outside, and it has good returns. And
there's a variety of regulatory schemes under which they operate.

So we feel good about it. It's going to be growing, and it's going to -- it's replacing some of the older
thermal assets that we're retiring.

Second part of your question regarding Fluence, well realize that as I've said in the past, the faster
Fluence grows, to some extent, it pushes off a little bit positive earnings. We're creating an enormous
amount of value but all R&D, for example, or all upgrading of our teams around the world, that's
expensed.

So when you're growing 400% this year, we expect a 40-plus growth rate going forward. We have a
backlog of 1 gigawatt. So that's still off.

So there's no -- right now, Fluence is a drag of around $0.02. So it will -- everything has a positive
margin. We expect this to turn around, but it's a little bit of a function of how fast we grow. So ironically
the more value we create and the faster we grow, that might take a little bit more time.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

If I can pivot this slightly, more specifically to your guidance, when you think about this roll forward
coming up with fourth quarter, and I know I'm kind of asking for guidance without getting it explicitly. How
are you thinking about some of the major puts and takes here? Because as best I see it, it seems like you
resolved a number of these issues. And so I just want to make sure we're on the same page about this,
whether it's DPL, whether it's related to Gener, or frankly whether it relates to your execution on backlog
or on renewables. But can you give us at least a sense for some of the bigger puts and takes here and/or
other factors that you've mentioned?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. You've mentioned most of the factors. I mean we have rapid renewable growth, Green Blend and
Extend. We have DP&L, IPL growing their rate base.

I think the one that you did not mention was the growth of LNG. So you realize that we are doing very
well on contracting more really tolling of gas in the Dominican Republic. We're very -- actually, we have
the contracts there. We're very optimistic about doing more in Panama. And as I said in my speech, those
will all contribute to our earnings at '23 and beyond. So most of the investment is made.

So having said that, that's how we see it. So we feel optimistic. And that's why we've included the
retirement of -- or part of that guidance. So we can't give you guidance before the fourth call.

Gustavo, do you want to add something?

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would just add, Julien, in addition to what Andrés just said, I think California, the extension of the
legacy unit is another important driver, right? So -- and also the incremental cost cutting. Remember, we
had talked about $100 million of cost cutting through 2022, half of that through 2021. So those will be
helpful, and eventually we'll be able to capture more post that period.

And I think to your question on renewables, probably the best way to think about it is most of our free
cash is going to renewables nowadays. So it's about $350 million to $400 million of investment in new
renewables going forward. And you put low double-digit to mid-teen returns, and you see that this is
going to be an important driver of earnings going forward.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Andrés, sorry to clarify this. When you were speaking on LNG, can you elaborate briefly on Panama and
the IMO piece of this in terms of bunkering and the upside potential?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Well, basically our current facility, especially the storage tank in Panama, is about 30% utilized. All the
capital investment has been made. So to the extent that we can contract more gas passing through it,
that goes straight to our bottom line. And so we feel good about the possibility of contracting more gas in
Panama and increasing that utilization.

In the case of the Dominican Republic, we had talked about this for many years, and actually we filled up
the tank to the extent that we're actually having to build a somewhat smaller but second tank there to
meet all the demand. So realize that this is contracted. It's tolling. We're not taking commodity risk. So
our gas strategy in the Caribbean and Central America is playing out as planned.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

One more clarification, on Indiana, I didn't hear you say anything about PUCO and renewables. I know
there's an RFP out there. Apologies, if I could...

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. There is an IRP as we speak, so the team is finalizing. And it's one of the opportunities that we have
to sign up for more renewable growth there and rate base. So stay tuned, we'll be talking about that
shortly.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Not yet in there. All right, great.

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

Not yet in there.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Next question comes from Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congratulations on progress on a lot of fronts. I agree with Julien, it's kind of hard to know where to start.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Thank you very much, Steve.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I wanted to maybe start at a high level and just talk about your renewables business globally and
thinking about sort of how to realize the full value of the business. The business has become very large.
It's one of the biggest backlogs globally.

How do you think about ensuring that you realize the full value, given that it's housed within AES? And
this has always been sort of a question in terms of highlighting the value of these businesses. And then
I think it's just really accentuated, given the trading levels of pure clean energy companies. Just curious
how you're thinking about the long-term strategy there.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

That's a great question. We think about that a lot. So really what we see is that there is a true competitive
advantage of combining our existing platforms with the new. And I say that because it's easy to talk about
renewables, but really that's just energy. And what the market is demanding is capacity. So you're going
to get that capacity in the short term from your existing traditional facilities and then with energy storage.

So thinking about that, nobody is in a better position than us to do that because we really are the leader
in the -- not only the amount of energy storage, but more important, I think the new applications, finding
new ways to use this. So I feel very good about this sort of leading this transition in a very responsible
way, retiring our coal plants, selling coal plants, providing that capacity to some extent in other new
markets in -- with gas because quite frankly not all markets are capable with today's technology of
efficiently providing capacity. Even with batteries, it would be too expensive with renewables.

So we're leading that transition to a lower-carbon future. But at the same time, I think we're uniquely
integrating, be it energy storage, be it innovative renewables. I mean I think 5B, that technology will play
a greater role in the future as you get greater really penetration of solar in some areas. And so being able
to do it in a smaller space is very valuable. Being able to do it faster is very valuable.

We're really doing some very interesting things on robotics. We're doing some very interesting things in
digital, digital controls. And so Uplight is one aspect of it. But so is, for example, the purchase of AMS by
Fluence.

So that's a little bit how I see it. So while it's true that there is a premium today for pure renewable plays,
we think there'll be a premium tomorrow for those companies that truly satisfy what customers need. So
it's not only energy. It's energy plus capacity. And we will lead the way into providing capacity, energy and
customer-facing solutions into the future. So it's a very interesting transition, even though it's a little bit
complicated story.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Those are good points about capacity and also integration. I take those points.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Maybe shifting over to the corporate customer side. The Google arrangement makes a lot of sense. I was
just curious your latest thoughts in terms of additional appetite from other corporate or potential corporate
customers to do something along those lines, given AES' global platform.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

That's a great question. So we have a, say, arrangement with Google. We're exploring several fronts. As
you know, we do have an RFP out for 1 gigawatt in PJM. We will, we believe, making announcements into
the future in terms of how we will be working together. As I said, several fronts.

But this is not something that will not exclude other clients, potential clients. So as we find ways to
provide the capacity people need and the low carbon that people need, plus a digital overlay, that is
certainly something that we believe will be attractive to a lot of clients. So Green Blend and Extend, for
example, was an interesting solution for a lot of the big mining companies that wanted to lower their
carbon footprint and have cheaper energy. And again, that can transition over time to net-zero solution,
but it's going to take some time to get there.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. So it sounds like while there's a lot of opportunities, it's going to take some time to really --
to get traction with a lot of corporate customers to the point where this is a more meaningful part of your
overall business mix. Is that fair?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

No. I would say that -- I guess, what I'm saying is that I expect to do more with corporate customers.
What I'm saying is that, depending on what the situation is, it may take longer or less long. It depends
on the market they're in, depends on the availability of renewables in that market, and it depends exactly
what the customer wants.

I mean what we're really working with is sort of co-creating with clients and co-creating what they want.
And I think again we're also uniquely positioned to do that, not only because of the various technologies
we're involved in, but also, quite frankly our modus operandi with the client.

So if you think of something like KIUC in the first sort of 24/7 renewables, load-following renewable
solution in Hawaii, that was codeveloped with them. So the same way we like were working with Google,
we are working with other people. What we've done in Chile, we've also worked with the client.

So I hope that answers your question. So no, I don't see this way off in the future. I see it as a certain --
relatively short term and growing over time as the clients become more clear exactly what they want and
some of the technologies get cheaper.

Operator

Next question is from Charles Fishman of Morningstar.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Andrés, on [indiscernible] the PPAs awarded and signed year-to-date, Slide 53, big win at Gener on solar.
It looks like you picked up another project to that power solar. Why -- if I compare this exhibit to the 2Q
exhibit, AES distributed energy actually went lower on solar [ and storage? ] Is that you lost the project?
Or just moved it around to a different subsidiary? Or what -- can you help me with that?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Sorry, are you looking at, what, the Annex Page 53?

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Yes. Slide 53, at the AES DE, distributed energy, right, I believe? And you could see that, okay, you got
solar, 91 megawatts. You signed year-to-date energy storage, 97. But then if I go back to 2Q, I see AES
Distributed Energy to solar, 242, energy storage, 247. Both of those, quite a bit higher.

Ahmed Pasha
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. Charles, this is Ahmed. I think some -- Charles, some of these projects that we show in the backlog,
they are only either in construction or we have signed. If the project is completed, then that goes back to
operations. That's no longer part of our backlog.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. So this is something -- there was projects that went in to operation in the quarter that you moved
off this list?

Ahmed Pasha
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Once it's in operation, it's no longer backlog.

Ahmed Pasha
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes, it's been fulfilled. The backlog -- the way we define backlog is either it is in construction or we have
signed the PPA, but it's not yet in construction. But if it is completed, it gets out.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Even though it was signed this year, it goes in operation, you take it off this list?

Ahmed Pasha
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. Now another question, previously asked on Indiana, IPL, if I could maybe push a little harder
on that. We've recently seen 2 other utilities in Indiana really go all-in on solar. And yes, quite frankly, AES
has more solar experience than both those other utilities combined plus some.

Do you have the opportunity at IPL to retire from coal or old gas plants, that we should expect some
movement like that? It seems like the Indiana Commission is very receptive to that direction.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Yes. Well, we have an RFP for 1.2 gigawatts of renewables, so stay tuned for the results of that. And in
those numbers that I gave in this call of 1.2 gigawatts of retirement, there's the -- some of the older coal
plants in Indiana. So as they're regulated too, we have to get approval for this transition. But you're right,
we have a whole lot of experience on that, and that's what we're going to do.

Operator

Next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just wanted to clarify on the coal getting below the 30% announcement. Was there something that didn't
get done in terms of an asset sale or something? Because the -- I think these shutdowns were already
planned for a while, and they're not happening until '21 or '23. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out how
that fits into meeting it by the end of '20?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No. Thanks for the question. No, look, what we have in there in our pro forma are sales that we
already have a signed contract with or plants that we've already programmed to retire. Now that does not
exclude additional sales. Now we're not behind on any additional sales or additional shutdowns. And as we
said, we expect more in the near term.

So we're saying it's 29% already in the third quarter. We had said we would do it by the end of the year.
So stay tuned. We think we'll be comfortably below the 30% threshold.

And remember, that's megawatt hours. It's actual generation. So actually, capacity, we're already at about
26% and will be -- continue to decline. So no, honestly, we haven't missed any of our internal milestones.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. I'm sorry, Andrés, I need to clarify this. But these plants we've known are going to be shut down for
a while. This is not like new, I think, and they're not actually being shut down by the end of 2020. So I'm
confused...

Ahmed Pasha
Vice President of Investor Relations

No. I think -- Steve, Ahmed here. Most of these plants, I think, we got approvals. Like Hawaii, they just
passed the law. We've got the regulatory approval in Hawaii then also in Ventanas as well. So I think
these are all the developments that we just announced. So these are not some things that got approved
[indiscernible] [ months ago. ]

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Indiana too? Because I thought...

Ahmed Pasha
Vice President of Investor Relations

Which one? Indiana? It's about 500 megawatts. I think this also got approval -- we just made that filing, I
think, just about a month ago or so. So Steve...

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And on the meeting the target, it doesn't matter if they don't shut by the end of 2020 or you don't
sell by then as long as you're shutting a few years from now?

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean we've been in discussions with ESG investors like Norges Bank and really was like, "Show me
a path how you're going to get there in the near term." So really, this is reflecting what they've asked us
to do. We're going to overperform, I assure you of that. And we've been somewhat cautious in terms of
our announcements. Because as Ahmed said, what we've shown this time is what we've actually gotten
approvals to do. These aren't just, "Gee, I wish -- I'm going to shut this down." Well, can you really shut it
down? And you need to have the approval of the regulator, of the network operator. So that's where we're
at.

So honestly, this is exactly what we discussed with people like Norges Bank, exactly what they asked us to
do. And if anything, we're upfront about it.

Now it is pro forma because in some cases, you -- the retirement, they still need it for, say, another year
in some cases. But stay tuned. We'll -- I assure you that we will...

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

[indiscernible] you announced that Petersburg retirement a couple like years ago or we've had that
[indiscernible]

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

No. No, we did not.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's helpful.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

And I think the punchline is, Steve, just to be clear, we have not seen any delays in the transactions we
are working on as far as the sell-downs are concerned on the coal side. So I think we still continue to see
the interest. So I don't think there's -- you need to read anything between the lines.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's helpful. And then just the -- on the DPL settlement, the path there, it looks like you -- your --
it allows you now to invest the money and get the rate base growth from that.

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

That's correct.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

And also keep the current -- the old ESP rate. And then I guess at the end of the period, the old ESP rate
goes away, but you can then keep growing the rate base from thereon. Can you -- is there any way you
can kind of extend this old ESP rate that's still in through '23?

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

No. I think the -- our expectation is that October '23, we'll file ESP 4. It will probably take 12 to 18 months
to get approval, and then we're going to get into a new ESP without the RSC. But the plan is we will build
up the rate base in the meantime so we can continue to post growth post that period.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I have one clarification and then just one big picture question. Just going back to - maybe, Gustavo,
maybe this is for you. But just going back to Slide 28 here when we sort of look at the cash generation
and you have about $250 million left of the $900 million, $650 million announced. I just want to be clear,
the Fluence transaction, any proceeds there are not on this slide, correct?

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

Not on this slide. It's all going to be kept at Fluence.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And it will be kept just at Fluence? I mean there's not user proceeds in terms of -- with your
other businesses?

Gustavo Duarte Pimenta
Executive VP & CFO

No. None.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just big picture, obviously this year, you've executed strongly. But 7% to 9%, can
you just high level talk about what gets you to 9% versus what gets you to 7%?

Andrés Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

I would say that the difference will have to be in terms of the projects that we have, how fast, for
example, we fill up the gas tanks at Panama and the DR. It will have to be a little bit in terms of demand
growth at our utilities and probably execution of our renewable projects. I'd say those are the 3 drivers. As
Gustavo said, we have cost cuts inherent. We have lower financing costs as well. So all those are pluses.

So I'd say the ones that are outside of our control, to some extent a little bit, would be the demand
growth in the utilities and a little bit the timing of filling up the tolling capacity in Central America and the
Caribbean.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Helpful, guys. Maybe just one quick one. Just as you think long term, Andrés, I mean, you have a
pretty good competitive advantage here with storage and with renewables. Just how do you think about
balancing growing internationally versus sort of your renewable portfolio internationally versus being 50%
earnings from the U.S. that's your long-term target?

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

No. That's a great question. Look, our objective is to be an investment-grade company, continue to
strengthen our balance sheet and the mix of our businesses. We move very strongly towards investment-
grade, dollar, long-term contracted business. And that's why we've been so resilient this year in an
uncertain environment. I think we've proven that. And we've improved our credit rating in the midst of
COVID. I think that says a lot for the strength of our business.

We think the optimal mix, also given market conditions probably, is about half U.S. and half outside. And
we think that's optimal. We have big corporate opportunities in the U.S. It's a strong market for us. We
also think that we have good corporate demand internationally and somewhat unique to us. And we do get
higher returns in general internationally.

So we think a sort of 50-50 split would be ideal. It's not -- we can orient it in one direction or the other.
Part of it will have to do where our clients demand and where we have competitive advantages. But we
think we're developing really global competitive advantages. So it's not only international. We have them
here in the U.S.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
