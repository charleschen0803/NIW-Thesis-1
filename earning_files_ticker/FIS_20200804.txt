Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the FIS Second Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Head of Corporate Finance and Investor
Relations, Mr. Nathan Rozof. Please go ahead.

Nathan A. Rozof
Executive Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the FIS Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference
Call. The call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are
available on our website at fisglobal.com. Gary Norcross, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss
our quarter operating performance and business strategy as well as the trends we are seeing with
COVID-19. Woody Woodall, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our financial results and the trends
we are seeing within our segments.

Turning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are
subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The
company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor
language.

Also, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted
EBITDA, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share. These are important financial
performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation
of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information are presented in our earnings release.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary, who will begin his prepared remarks on Slide 5.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Nate. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. The COVID-19 pandemic will be
viewed as one of the most challenging times for our country and the world. However, I couldn't be prouder
of our response and the execution of our more than 55,000 employees and delivering a very strong
quarter despite all the challenges. The pandemic has been a catalyst, driving us to achieve outstanding
results, all while maintaining our implementation, processing and product development commitments
to our clients and prospects. This is very important, given our strong multi-quarter sales success and
converting these wins to revenue as quickly as possible.

COVID-19 has spurred changing consumer behaviors and reinforced the many benefits of automation,
artificial intelligence and cloud-native technologies and a true omnichannel experience. Our conversations
with clients who wish to adopt our next-generation suite of solutions are gaining momentum. And that
continues to show to our strong quarterly sales results that we will discuss later. These trends and results
drive our confidence in the company's ability to accelerate growth.

Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to discuss our strong second quarter. Our revenues grew 40% to almost $3
billion. This exceptional growth was achieved despite the impacts of this historic pandemics impact.
Given shelter-in-place restrictions around the globe, revenue decreased 7% on an organic basis. While
revenue faced headwinds, we expanded margins by 150 basis points as we continue to drive down our
cost structures through the Worldpay integration initiatives as well as ongoing benefits from investments
in technology and automation.

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

We generated $1.15 in EPS and over $650 million in free cash flow, reflecting the durability of our
business model. Given the ongoing strength in our sales channel, our sold backlog increased 7%
organically to $21 billion, giving us clear line of sight to continued acceleration of revenue growth. Given
these results, it is clear our resilient business model ensures we can deliver strong results given our
breadth and diversity of our solutions.

Turning to Slide 8. Last week marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Worldpay. It was
a significant milestone for our company and the industry as 2 of the preeminent teams and financial
technology came together. Worldpay brought us world-class merchant acquiring with its high-value global
e-commerce and integrated payment capabilities.

In banking, we have continued our investment in the new products and services that are transforming
the market, including Modern Banking Platform, Code Connect and Digital One. And in capital markets,
we brought investments in technology to enable us to be more agile with the movement of money across
the world. We certainly have a track record of success when it comes to advancing the way the world
pays, banks and invest. We're thrilled with the traction that we've seen over the past year by creating a
company that is significantly differentiated in the market.

The subset list of accomplishments that we have achieved on Slide 9 since last July is extensive and
covers every aspect of the new combined company. When we closed the Worldpay acquisition, the teams
on both sides immediately came together in very collaborative ways with a focus of creating something
unique in the industry. We continue to outpace expectations on our synergy goals and are well ahead
of schedule to meet our aggressive 3-year synergy targets. At the end of the quarter, our teams have
achieved more than $700 million in annual cost synergies and $115 million in annual revenue synergies.
We have an additional $60 million in revenue synergies that we are in the process of implementing now,
and we have a growing pipeline of cross-sell opportunities that will continue to drive additional growth.

Our ability to exceed our synergy goals so early is a testament to the value our colleagues are creating by
winning as one team.

On Slide 10, we recognized early the changing dynamics of the industry and decided to pivot the company
to growth by investing in next-generation technology that would allow us to successfully compete for the
next 10 to 15 years. We launched our journey over 4 years ago by investing in data center consolidation
and network modernization to position us to be the leader in cloud-based technology. Fast forward to
today, we have a significantly smaller data center network footprint. We will reduce over $250 million in
cost and have 80% of our total compute in the cloud by the middle of next year.

Next, we invest in our application stack, which is based on a modular componentized architecture with
open APIs that provide our clients the flexibility to innovate at their own pace. These investments included
our Modern Banking Platform, Code Connect, Digital One, post-trading derivative solutions and next-
generation syndicated lending. Together, these new products are propelling our growth in our banking
capital market segments.

Simultaneously, Worldpay was also investing in next-generation technologies. They launched the NAP
platform, access Worldpay, advanced e-comm capabilities and innovative often fraud solutions. This has
been the primary growth catalyst for our payments segment and what makes the combination of FIS and
Worldpay so powerful.

Next, we moved on to differentiate ourselves through building on our industry-leading client experience.
For example, we proactively committed to groundbreaking 15-minute service-level agreements for many
of our cloud-based solutions in sharp contrast to the typical industry standard of 24 to 48 hours. And we
simplified our pricing and contracting models for smaller financial institutions in order to make it even
easier to do business with FIS. These enhancements to how we support our clients are resonating in the
market.

Finally, we upgraded and integrated our internal enterprise tool sets, significantly improving our
communication and collaboration capabilities and further enabling our colleagues to better support our
clients. We began this journey to prepare for the future. While the pandemic has accelerated changing

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

consumer and enterprise behaviors in ways that none of us could have predicted, it demonstrates that the
strategic investments we've made in our technology transformation have paid off.

As shown on Slide 11, our strategic blueprint ensure FIS' continued success revolves around 3 simple
pillars: the first pillar centers around our ongoing investments in technology and innovation. The increase
in client demand that we are experiencing for our differentiated and next-generation solutions will
continue to power accelerating revenue growth trends for FIS.

Second, our relentless focus on driving efficiency and scalability is a key component of driving meaningful
operational results. As we continue to integrate strategic acquisitions, we will further build our scale and
operational efficiencies, allowing us to lead our peers with best-in-class margins. Lastly, we have a strong
track record of strategically allocating capital to maximize shareholder value. Our disciplined approach
to capital allocation includes investing in both high-growth acquisition targets as well as our organic
investments in product, technology and innovation.

Turning back to the quarter and a focus on sales results on Slide 12. Our clients are embracing our
cutting-edge solutions, which empower them to better compete in a world where technology is changing
at record speed. In banking, I'm pleased to announce that we extended our streak of consecutive quarters
with double-digit year-over-year new sales growth, which now spans more than 2 years. Our new
sales delivered over $1 billion in total contract value during the second quarter despite shelter-in-place
ordinances. Client demand for our Modern Banking Platform remains robust as clients seek new ways
to transform their legacy technology to a frictionless digital experience. We signed another top 30 U.S.
bank on our Modern Banking Platform, Code Connect and Digital One omnichannel solutions. They chose
FIs because of our product suites, cloud-ready modular architecture and due to our ability to implement
complex solutions. We look forward to supporting the bank's goal to leapfrog from legacy technologies to
the future of digital banking. This marks our ninth Modern Banking Platform win, including 4 of the top 30
U.S. banks.

Our speedy implementation of real-time lending services for many financial institutions allowed us to
streamline and process funding under the Paycheck Protection Program, supporting U.S. small businesses
and families throughout the pandemic. We also aided several U.S. states by quickly ramping up operations
to support prepaid and Pandemic EBT card processing during this challenging period.

Turning now to merchant. Client adoption of our premium payback solution remains strong, and we
continue to identify and close multiple cross-sell opportunities. For example, we entered into a strategic
agreement with a top U.S. pharmacy to improve their loyalty program with our premium payback solution
at its nearly 10,000 locations. Real-time redemption at the point-of-sale will drive foot traffic, increase
spend and lower the pharmacy's cost of payment acceptance. We also recently signed an exclusive
merchant referral partnership with a regional bank of over 500 branches. We will convert their existing
portfolio of 15,000 merchants to FIS and will provide all processing and back-office support functions
for the bank. Additionally, the largest independent gas station operator in the U.K. chose FIS to enable
payment technology at 900 fuel stations because of our in-store payment technology and our robust fraud
solution.

Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we are increasing investments in our integrated payments channel.
Together with several strategic partners, we are developing a creative new go-to-market solution and have
commitments to migrate over 20,000 new merchants by year-end.

Turning to capital markets. Demand for our SaaS-based solution remains robust. Clients are embracing
our differentiated end-to-end solutions that span the front, middle and back office as well as our
innovative RegTech solutions. We signed a deal with the top German bank that will enable them to
increase operational efficiencies by consolidating 3 existing competitor point solutions onto our end-to-end
solution suite. In addition, we signed a deal with a nonprofit finance cooperative with nearly $27 billion in
assets to power their commercial lending suite. As you can tell, this was a very busy and highly successful
quarter on many fronts.

I will now turn the call over to Woody to discuss the financials in more detail. Woody?

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Gary, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'd like to thank our colleagues who have
done exceptional work to empower our clients, giving back to our communities and support one another
through a very difficult time. While the global pandemic has had a significant impact on our quarterly
financials, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board. I'll begin with our
financial results before transitioning to our merchant transaction trends, then I'll finish with an update on
our balance sheet, liquidity position and cash flows.

This quarter demonstrated the durability of our business model as we continue to provide mission-critical
technology to our clients. We remain confident in our long-term fundamentals, competitive position and
overall investment thesis.

Turning to Slide 14 for highlights and accomplishments in the quarter. On a consolidated basis, revenue
decreased 7% organically or 6%, excluding corporate and other, exceeding our expectation from a few
months ago. Organic growth is also inclusive of a 2-point headwind, primarily associated with the shift
in the U.S. tax filing deadline. Each of our segments performed better than expected, driven by strong
execution and durability in banking and capital markets as well as improving consumer volumes in our
merchant segment. While we remain in uncertain times, we firmly believe FIS will be even stronger
coming out of this pandemic as we leverage our global scale, robust cash flows and commitment to
investment and innovation.

Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.2 billion during the quarter, and our margins expanded 150 basis
points to 39% as high-margin transaction volumes improved in May and June. We are reiterating our
commitment to $300 million in annualized short-term cost savings in response to the pandemic. Our
integration remains ahead of schedule as we show ongoing traction in the bank referral channel as well as
continued cross-sell wins for our Premium Payback solution.

In the quarter, we achieved $115 million in annual run rate revenue synergies, well ahead of our initial
expectations, which is especially impressive considering the multiple headwinds caused by the COVID
pandemic. We also achieved cost synergies in excess of $700 million, including $350 million in operating
expenses. As a reminder, we originally targeted $400 million in operating cost synergies by the end of
2022. At this pace, we are on track to reach our initial target by the end of this year, a full 2 years ahead
of schedule. In addition to operating expense savings, we also permanently eliminated $90 million in
annual maintenance CapEx this quarter by consolidating legacy technology platforms, which will manifest
itself in the form of reduced D&A on our income statement. Our sales performance continues to benefit
from long-term SaaS-based agreements, and we continue to have meaningful dialogue with our clients
around digital banking, continuity of operations and increasing their e-commerce presence. This increased
demand is driven by our clients looking to effectively manage their operations through the pandemic and
transform their business for a post-COVID environment. The pipeline continues to remain strong, giving
us confidence that the investments we have made are paying dividends and we'll continue to win market
share in attractive verticals.

Turning to Slide 15 to review our segments. Banking Solutions increased 4% organically or 5%, excluding
a 1-point headwind associated with the decline in transaction-related revenue caused by shelter-in-place
orders and other impacts associated with the pandemic. Ongoing investment in our banking segment
continues to drive recurring revenue as we leverage our cloud-based solutions to drive value to our clients.
Banking adjusted EBITDA was $608 million, representing 40 basis points of margin expansion to 41%.

Our merchant segment performed significantly better than anticipated as transaction trends improved
during May and June from April lows. The delay in the U.S. tax filing deadline contributed to a 6-point
headwind during the quarter as approximately $60 million of revenue pushed out of the second quarter
and into the third quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact, merchant revenue was down 19%.

While significant, this headwind came in approximately $30 million better than expected as some
consumers elected to pay their taxes early ahead of the delayed July 15 deadline. Merchant adjusted
EBITDA was $331 million, representing significant margin expansion of 41% over the prior year period,

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

primarily due to the Worldpay acquisition. Capital markets grew 3% organically in the quarter, driven
by balanced demand across our buy-side and sell-side verticals as our innovative end-to-end solutions
drove continued strength in recurring revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $287 million, representing margin
expansion to 46%.

Turning to Slide 16 for an overview of our recent merchant volume and transaction trends. Given our size
and scale, we've seen improving trends throughout the quarter and continuing into July, consistent with
the major networks. Merchant volumes returned to growth by the end of the quarter, increasing 4% in
June, while transaction trends exited the quarter approximately flat. Trends improved in both U.S. and
international, with particular strength in global e-commerce, which has experienced strong transaction
growth of approximately 30% when excluding travel and airlines.

COVID is dramatically accelerating the speed of adoption for e-commerce, and we will continue to invest
in our next-generation access Worldpay gateway as well as accelerate our global expansion in order
to capture new sources of growth and addressable market. While we are pleased with the improving
transaction trends, I will not be providing formal guidance for 2020 due to the dynamic and unpredictable
outcomes associated with the ongoing pandemic.

Turning to Slide 17. I wanted to provide some color on our balance sheet, cash flows and liquidity position.
Our total debt is about $20 billion, yielding a 3.5x leverage ratio with a weighted average interest rate of
1.7%. In the quarter, we generated $655 million of free cash flow or 22% of revenue, an increase from
18% in the first quarter of 2020. We paid down $544 million in debt and issued dividends of $217 million.
Capital expenditures were $243 million or 8% of revenue in the quarter. We remain highly committed to
investing internally in organic growth with no reduction in our 2020 capital budget. Liquidity remained
strong at $3.5 billion, having further increased by approximately $500 million during the second quarter.
This robust cash flow, strong balance sheet and ample liquidity allows us to continue to invest heavily in
technology and innovation, even as others are retrenching due to the pandemic. While the second quarter
was clearly challenging for all of us, I couldn't be proud of how our team responded. The strength of our
financial results demonstrates the unique durability and resiliency of our business model, increasing my
confidence in the future of FIS.

I'd now like to turn the call back to Gary for some closing remarks before we open the line up for
questions. Gary?

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Woody. I want to conclude our prepared remarks with Slide 18 by stating our continued
commitment to growth and innovation is unwavering. We're focused on continuing to keep our colleagues
safe while simultaneously pushing forward to become the Fintech employer of choice. We truly cannot be
successful if we don't maximize our talent. Inclusion and diversity is very important to me, both personally
and professionally as well as it is to all of us here at FIS. Recent social unrest in the U.S. underscores
the prevalence of systemic racism in our country and around the world. To that end, we recognize our
responsibility to strive for sustained social change, both domestically and globally.

We are setting significant goals for our company, including to double the representation of black and Latin
mix leaders at FIS. We are also rolling out further programs to help our colleagues with the increasing
problem related to student loan debt for incoming U.S. college program participants. For our clients, we
will continue to deliver innovative solutions and support during these difficult times. We will leverage our
scale and global reach to provide best-in-class service and quality. For our communities, we are continuing
to work on integrating environmental, social and governance factors into every aspect of our business.

We recently launched our first-ever global sustainability report, which I encourage you to download from
our website. As we maintain our commitment to ESG described in our report, I am proud of how we
are operating our company with integrity and the highest ethics, promoting diversity and inclusion and
preserving our natural resources. Further, we will continue to contribute to our communities by donating
both dollars and volunteer hours to organizations that support financial literacy and inclusion. We will
invest $30 million in minority-owned Fintech start-ups and double our supplier spend with minority-owned

businesses by 2023. Creating an environment that enables our colleagues, clients and communities to
thrive demonstrates how we are leveraging our technology and innovation at scale to reinforce FIS' global
leadership position and to drive above-market growth. This concludes our prepared remarks.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America.

Jason Alan Kupferberg
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Nice results here. I wanted to start with a top line related question. You've now secured 7 large next-gen
core banking wins over the past 3 quarters. So wanted to see if you can help us roughly size how much
revenue they could contribute in aggregate next year as they start to go live. And maybe as part of that,
can you just comment on the 7% to 9% organic revenue growth target you guys had pre-COVID and your
confidence level in that range as we move into 2021 and 2022?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Jason. If you step back about a year ago, one of the things we talked about was banking being
able to accelerate its revenue growth profile to get us into that 7 to 9x zone of growth. I think these MBP
wins and the timing of the revenue that will come on will certainly give us more confidence, if you will, in
that being able to drive into that 7% to 9% range in a pre-COVID world or a post-COVID world is where
we are today. The revenue comes on with these MBP clients about a year after the signing. So as we've
talked about in the last couple of quarters, we should start seeing some revenue very late in 2020, but
really more of that revenue is starting to flow into 2021. I don't think we're going to give a dollar amount
of where those MBP revenues are at this point, but certainly gives us incremental confidence in being able
to deliver 7% to 9% on a go-forward basis.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Let me just add a little color to that. When you look at the sizing of these contracts compared to our
traditional core banking deals done across community banks, order of magnitude, these are hands down
very, very significant and large contracts compared to anything else you would do in core banking.

The other thing that's important to note, not only have we signed 7, as we described, but keep in mind, in
the Modern Banking Platform wins, those are really deposits only at this point. So we have an opportunity
as we launch their deposit portfolios and bring their deposit products online in this newer technology
then to move into their lending portfolios and other areas of a traditional core bank. So we're real excited
about this potential. I mean not only as we've talked about for years, penetrating the top 30 with really
transformational core, we've got an opportunity to grow these core relationships with successful launches
on deposits. So it's a really good indicator, as Woody said, to push that banking business above mid-single
digits into a more upper single-digit kind of growth rate over time and makes us very confident to the 7%
to 9% as we discussed earlier.

Jason Alan Kupferberg
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Terrific. Maybe just another question on the margin front. I know last quarter, you gave us a guidepost for
second quarter EBITDA margin. So wanted to see how we should think about Q3 margins on a year-over-
year basis. I know it was kind of a stub period in last year's Q3. And then maybe as part of that, I know
last quarter you had said that full year EBITDA margins will increase year-over-year. So now that we're
halfway through the year, any thoughts on kind of magnitude of potential year-over-year improvement
from a full year perspective?

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Yes. I think as we go back a quarter, we tried to give you guys some of the low watermark back in --
where we thought we would be. Certainly, have seen improving trends over that time as we tried to
highlight in the prepared materials. If you think about the third quarter really, and the fourth quarter,
I would expect to see sequential margin expansion in both Q3 and Q4, Jason. I know the question is
coming. So I thought I'd go ahead and just address it. We've also taken a look at consensus revenue for
the third quarter and it's reasonably in line with my expectations, even though we're not giving a formal
guide.

With respect to margins, I think about margins for the third quarter. If you look back to 2019, margin
was about 43%. We've got 2 tailwinds and 1 headwind going into the third quarter from a margin
perspective. The first tailwind is about $90 million in operating expense synergies associated with the
Worldpay acquisition. The second is a tailwind of about $100 million in those short-term cost actions that
we've taken in response to the pandemic. And finally, we've got a headwind due to COVID impacting
our transaction revenues, which have close to a 90% contribution margin. And just as a reminder, as
those revenues come back in a post-COVID world, we would anticipate them to return at similarly high
contribution margin. So as you think about third quarter, that's how we're thinking about kind of the
revenue outlook and the margin profile.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.

Darrin David Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

All right. Nice results. Let me just ask, I mean, it was great to see the reacceleration on the banking
segment and the capital markets segments to positive territory. Can you talk about the drivers that really,
really inflected and what changed in this quarter versus last? I'm assuming a lot of that transactional
revenue that hit you in March, April has gone back to positive or closer to positive category.

And then when we talk about the digital transformation work we're seeing and given the pandemic, I
guess, Gary, can you give us examples of where structurally you guys are coming out stronger because
of those -- your products are meeting the incremental demand, given the digital transformation needed
across, probably mostly in banking, but maybe across the segments?

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. No, it's really across all key areas, Darrin. It's a great question. I mean the banking business and
the capital market businesses both performed very well. We did see some return in our issuer transaction
volumes, just like you would expect, as the acquiring volumes started increasing. So we see that flowing
to our issuer cards. But honestly, the base business really performed because of all the investments we've
made over the last 4 years in newer technology. And if you look at the success of the sales channel we
highlighted today, we really had now 2 years of double-digit sales growth. And so what you're really
seeing is that sales growth coming on board 12 months later and starting to see good solid performance in
the banking business, and that's going to continue to trend up. We're seeing those sales come across our
next-generation digital platforms, our next-generation Code Connect platforms, which is when you hear
people talk about open agile APIs or micro services, Code Connect is our solution for that. We've been in
market now for about 4 years with that, really extends the openness of all of our banking systems and
we're seeing tremendous growth in that area. And then we've also seen very, very strong wins in core
banking in the top 100, which is really a new trend that we've talked about that was being accelerated by
the next-generation of technology. But now I think it's being further accelerated by the pandemic.

If you look over in capital markets, once again, another really strong quarter by that team. We've made
a lot of investment in product over the last several years and also in the technology platforms, the data
center consolidation. And when we looked at product, we started building out a lot more robust digital
enablement. We really started looking at solutions that go across the front, middle and back office. We
also pushed hard several years ago in the open APIs and micro services. And as you look at that, now

the market is starting to transform that. So we really think we're just getting the advantage of a strategic
pivot that we made -- started 4 years ago and is ongoing of this rapid investment in next-generation
technologies. And as the market is breaking that direction, we're seeing the benefit of that in the growth
curve.

Darrin David Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

All right. That's really helpful. Very quick follow-up. Just the e-comm business in merchant is always
something that we honed in on a lot. I think it was up 30%, right? The actual volume. Can you talk about
the inbound new bookings you're seeing, just given it still seems like there's only a handful of companies
that could really handle cross-border e-comm? What -- in this environment, I would expect that to be
strong.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. No, I absolutely agree with you. I think that was actually the crown jewel that came out of the
Worldpay combination. We've been real excited. When you really look at global e-commerce and dealing
with the complexity that comes from that, you really can continue to see us being the kind of destination
of choice in some of these large complex deals. And so very focused on pushing that strong demand.
We had some nice wins already this year. As Woody highlighted, very strong growth in our existing
clients, up 30%, minus travel in airlines. It's important to make sure we carve that out, but when you're
looking at really the underlying health of this business. And so very pleased at our position. I think Woody
commented in his prepared remarks, we're really leaning in to some of the next-generation capabilities
there with access Worldpay and also doing a number of other things around our processing platform. So
we really feel great about our position in payments and in merchant specifically. You saw us highlight a
number of other wins. And so post COVID, I mean this is really a good, solid double-digit grower for FIS.

Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Woody, you called out achieving your $400 million OpEx savings target on the Worldpay acquisition 2
years early by the end of this year. How are you thinking about that target beyond the end of this year?
Is that a number that could move up substantially? Or would you anticipate reinvesting the excess in the
business?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's a great question, David. I think we're always focused on continuing to drive margin expansion
and look for efficiencies. I think looking back over both Gary and I's career here at FIS, we've always had
a focus on that, and we'll continue to have a focus on that. I will say if we continue to see the amount of
sales growth and delivery need that we'll have to go make these implementations, we'll continue to invest
some of that savings back into the business to drive top line growth, David.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. I mean when you look, David, you look at this quarter, we had 150 basis points of margin expansion.
We actually invested heavily in our delivery capabilities because as you're ramping on this kind of sales
growth, it's important that we've got the necessary staff to be able to deploy these complex solutions.
So we'll want to make sure that we continue to balance it between innovation and driving modernization
and transformation and also make sure that we continue to have margin expansion. But beyond the
end of this year, there are a lot more levers that we have to continue to drive operating efficiencies,
whether it's increased automation using artificial intelligence, which we're doing a lot with today and really

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

investing heavily there. Or whether you look at leveraging our COO organization and drive more functional
alignment to get more leverage and scale across some of our existing capabilities. But I'm very confident
that you'll continue to see margin expansion for years with that finance.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. And then the Capital Market Solutions business, you've talked in the last few quarters about
transitioning that to a higher growth SaaS model, perhaps more mid-single digit plus organic. How far
along are you in that transition? And when might we expect that higher growth rate to start coming
through? It's been very resilient, certainly.

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll start, Dave. I mean our recurring revenue within the capital markets group has grown to a little
over 70% now. We anticipate that to continue to grow as we see more and more SaaS sales versus license
sales. Licenses were down in the quarter from the capital markets group. So I would anticipate starting to
see that. I mean you're seeing more resiliency in the growth rate right now in the capital markets group,
but I would anticipate starting to see some acceleration of that into 2021 and beyond.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. I'll just build on that. The team is doing an excellent job of really leaning into the market and selling
into the opportunities that we're seeing with regards to SaaS. Every quarter, I and Woody really look at it
with regards to how many SaaS sales compared to license sales. And once again, I mean, this quarter was
no different. We saw a lot more SaaS sales come in than what we did on the license side. I -- we've talked
a lot about banking, and they had double-digit sales success this quarter. Capital markets was equally
very strong on sales. They had one large anomalous license fee last year. But when you really look at the
fundamental underlying growth of the sales engine, it was just a phenomenal quarter. And you saw the
resiliency of it in the -- in its growth rate. So these 2 businesses are proving to be in very good shape at
the right time in the market as you see the market breaking towards some of these newer technologies.
So I couldn't be happier with what the teams are doing here.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. Congrats on the strong results in a tough environment.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

A lot of encouraging trends here. Just a follow-up on some of the questions asked. Just on the banking

about the delivery cost of it, if there's anything unusual to consider with so much in the backlog.

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. No, look, it's a great question. Our big competitors here are typically in-house developed software
over decades, augmented by typically some form of consulting or off-shoring firm. It's typically who we're
running into. As you would suspect, these are very complex implementations of this size. And one of the
reasons why not only do we have compelling technology that really competes very well in the industry,
really the only proven company that can do these kind of large-scale complex transformations and with
proof points over the years around the globe. So as Woody talked about, they run anywhere from 12 to
18 months. They focus -- we've got some of our customers that were really -- were literally moving off
technologies that were installed in the early '70s, and we have some that are moving off technologies
that were installed in the last 15 years. But there's a lot of complexity in this. It takes a large program
effort to manage through that. At this point, you would expect, I'm very close to these implementations
as well as the rest of our leaders in the company, and every one of these implementations are in green
status at this point. So we feel very good at how the teams are working together. These customers have
not been -- or these clients have not been through this kind of transformation in decades. So they're very
excited about the opportunity of what this is going to drive for them to help them compete in market.
And so there's a real sense of energy of not only getting these right, but getting these installed on time.
If anything, they'd love to see us pull them early. So we're real pleased at where we are. As I mentioned
with David, we're certainly focused on investing in our implementation pipeline. We understand we don't
want our operating units to be the bottleneck for growth. So we're making sure that we're investing there
to be able to accelerate and meet our implementation demand as the sales team brings these contracts
into the company.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Owning the tech and owning the delivery should be an advantage. So got it. That's helpful to hear.
My follow-up, if you don't mind, just a quick one. No, I'm just trying to understand. I know you're a
large debit processor with both sides, Worldpay and legacy FIS. Debit has been outperforming. We've
been getting questions on how much of this is secular versus stimulus. So I figured I'd ask you for your
thoughts on that. And maybe it's overall, you can remind us of your exposure to debit in any way.

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll give you some color. As we've messaged before and continue to message, we think our overall
debit trends will match those that have been disclosed by the broader groups in the marketplace. We
continue to see growth there. I think the movement of cash out of the system more and more will
continue to drive more debit transactions there, Tien-Tsin. Don't know that we disclosed the specific
exposure on debit in the past, but we certainly are seeing incremental growth there and feel really good
about how we're positioned there for the long term.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. As we were talking about this yesterday, as you think about how much cash has actually come out of
the global economy, we're very bullish on all of our payment offerings. And as we think about how much
did that naturally come back post COVID, we think there's a real opportunity to really see a significant
jump to electronic, a lot of it moving to card not present. All of that paint significant benefits to us, not
only on the acquiring side, but also back into the issuing side. So we're very bullish on these businesses at
the moment.

A little bit of a follow-up there on a related matter. So just a broader update on the top 100 banks. I
believe last fall, you mentioned about 30 of those have been penetrated in terms of outsourcing and
clearly signed a good handful since then. When we think about that other 2/3 or so that's remaining, you
talked about some of them using sort of in-house developed software that's been augmented over the
years. To what extent are some of those banks already FIS customers maybe paying maintenance fees
on something that was purchased on a license basis years ago and you might already have a little bit of a
foothold or a relationship there. And then a quick follow-up after related to the original Worldpay-Vantiv e-
comm synergies.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. No, it's a great insightful question. We've got a number of those customers -- or substantial number
of those customers that are running in-house on our legacy technology or even outsourced on some of our
legacy technology. And so it's a real opportunity for us to cross-sell the Modern Banking Platform. Frankly,
a lot of those customers are watching how a number of these top 30 institutions are going to transition
and their success with the technology. But it really -- not only do we have an opportunity to bring on our
lending assets on top of Modern Banking Platform, but we have a huge amount of runway through the
rest of the top 100, and frankly, through the entire regional bank market. So just a lot of opportunity in
the U.S. with this new technology. We also are seeing similar demands outside the U.S. But given all the
movement right now in the U.S. markets, the sales teams are pretty focused there for now. But we think
there's, as I've said in my prepared remarks, easily 10-plus years of runway with this next-generation core
banking transformation.

Timothy Edward Chiodo
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. That's helpful color. And the follow-up is a quick one. I know you're not formally providing updates
on the prior Worldpay-Vantiv e-commerce synergies. But I believe the original target was roughly $100
million in run rate reps by the end of Q4 of this year. And I just wanted to see if there were any comments
or updates you could provide around that.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

It's -- honestly, as we've integrated the companies, it's almost getting too complex to break out synergies
related to what deal or this deal. So we've really been just focusing on the go forward. Clearly, the Vantiv-
Worldpay combination was very successful. And I think given our synergy results, you're seeing the
success come out of the FIS-Worldpay combination. But we talked about this in the past on calls. We
integrate these companies so tightly, it gets difficult to actually track what is a synergy and what's just
operating execution and what sales execution at some point in time. And so really, we've kind of moved
on beyond trying to track the Vantiv-Worldpay and just really focused on the FIS-Worldpay going forward.
But feel great about where we are in synergies. Revenue side already being at $115 million is significant.
You can go back on what our original estimation was, which was just $100 million by the end of this year,
already at $115 million. We've got $60 million more in the implementation cycle with a really strong
pipeline. So feel great about that execution. As Woody highlighted, we'll have the operating expense side
of this completely done at $400 million point by the end of this year. So just a lot of really positive results
coming out of the teams.

Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Dave.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. And I guess, my first question, just when we think about the gap between merchant kind of core
revenue decline in merchant of 19% and then some of the volume and transaction metrics that were
maybe 10% or so, give or take, better than the revenue, which is because of SMB, I get all that. But
as volume and transaction trends get better, does that gap shrink? Meaning, could we have a closer tie
between revenue and some of those other metrics as things progress?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

It certainly should, Dave. You've got some mix issues flowing, as you described there, with the SMB
versus, let's call it, grocery and drug as an example. But as you see those volumes return, you should
certainly see the associated convergence of the transaction trends and the revenues.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And you get -- do you get the full 6% back from the tax impact in Q2? Do you get the full 6% back
in Q3?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

We would certainly anticipate that, yes.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess my follow-up question, EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis, I think,
was down almost $200 million year-over-year in Q2. Revenues were down a little over $200 million. So
they actually match pretty closely, even with the synergies coming in. Why didn't EBITDA decline less than
that just given the synergies?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean the synergies are certainly flowing through, as we talked about. I think you got the high
contribution margin associated with the revenues themselves also impacting you there. And then we've
tried to manage our costs as rapidly as we could in reaction to declining volumes, Dave. So the 3 of those
together are really the impact.

The other thing, Dave, I'd just highlight, too. Based on some of the results that we saw through the
second quarter and based on some of our outlook, we actually reput in some bonus adjustment back into
our results. And that may be the other components you might be missing as you're bridging there.

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

A number have been asked and answered. However, I was curious at a higher level on the core banking
side. If -- as a result of the pandemic, you guys are seeing a repositioning of investment dollars from your
bank customers, specifically around mobile and digital. It sounds like as a result of the double-digit sales
trends in the quarter, that trend is likely underway. But I was just wondering if there's any incremental
color there sort of from a customer perspective. And then I had a quick follow-up.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. No, we clearly are seeing that repositioning, and you've seen strong double-digit sales growth for
the last 2 years, every quarter, coming out of the banking group. And when we talk about sales growth,
that's new TCV, that's not renewables. So that's not -- we don't disclose that. We have very, very high
retention rates, but really focusing on new business coming into FIS. And you're exactly right, the banking
industry, and we talked about it on last quarter's call, if you look at what's happened, they continue to
invest in digital over the years. The problem is given their legacy technology that's underlying their digital
frameworks, they just can't move fast enough. They don't have enough agility in deployment, and they
just can't get their cost down because of this foundational issue. And so we're now seeing people lean in
heavily on Modern Banking Platform. They're leaning in heavily into micro services. And they're leaning
into next-generation digital to take advantage of all of that. And just really seeing strong growth across
the pipeline. And then when you augment all of that with a lot of back-office services that banks are
continuing to push on all about trying to just lower their total cost of ownership. So a lot of people have
asked, given the interest rate environment and given the pandemic, why aren't we seeing spend decline,
the reality is most of our customers have just held on too long. And I think at this point, they realize
they're going to have to transform and spend their way out of this issue they have in order to be able to
compete in the future. And so we're certainly seeing the benefit of that through our sales success.

Matthew Casey O'Neill
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That makes a lot of sense. And then just as a follow-up to the last question, I know this has been talked
about a little bit. But just on the merchant yield, just curious around how impactful the underlying mix of
transactions kind of away from travel, for example, and presumably a shift more towards things like big
box and grocery and things like that, that are maybe lower yield. Is that underpinning some of the trends
that we saw in the quarter?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

That is certainly a component of the -- the mix of the customer base and where the volumes come off and
where they came back on. That's certainly a component of what's going on with yield there.

other words, without that, you would be taking up the number? And more broadly, as you kind of learn
to operate in this current environment, can you call out factors that you noticed or you said why don't we
make this change permanent? So what might your cost structure look like next year? Can you talk about
people, product development, real estate footprint, things like that?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think if you think about what we did, we had more permanent long-term synergies that we've talked
about at $700 million-plus, $400 million of that operating by the end of the year. We also took about a
$300 million set of actions that were more short term in nature, Ashwin, in response to declining volumes.
Can some of those be permanent? Probably so. We haven't gotten through exactly where we're at. But
some of that won't be permanent in terms of like short-term bonus, in terms of some of the travel that
may return in the process. But we're working through how much of that can we keep out of the cost
structure permanently. That's ongoing right now as we speak very live in terms of facilities rationalization,
in terms of other things that we think we can do and reduce our cost structure permanently. And it will
flow into 2021 as part of longer-term margin expansion opportunities.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Some examples of that, Ashwin, you actually -- you said in your question, we're looking really hard at
global real estate. We're successfully operating from home today. We're taking a real hard look on whether
we even reopen those offices. We're also looking at some of the basis of some of our travel that we've
done historically and really taking a hard look at that. We're also bringing a lot more leverage through
our tool sets and technology, as I mentioned. And all of these things are good short-term levers. But as
Woody pointed out, there'll be a number of things that we don't think we'll spend in the reopen. And so
that will then push into next year. We also have growing efficiencies around some of these large programs,
multiyear programs we've been running. The NAP program is ramping up. Our data center consolidation
program are wrapping up. So all of these things will also push into our margins next year as well.

Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And some pretty good sales announcements there. It seems like you might have cracked the
code on how to sell or at least close deals in this remote environment. The -- can you talk broadly about
how the bank spending environment is evolving. You kind of mentioned, obviously, some category changes
that are the same -- from a more digital, more mobile, less branch work obvious, kind of some of the puts
and takes around how the offering is changing, how the selling process is changing. A little more detail
would be great.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. We're really seeing spend increase in the areas that we started focusing on about 4 years ago. So
where are people spending and let's first start with where they're not spending. They're not spending
for on-premise-type deployments. They're not spending in legacy technology today. Those are areas
they're not spending on, which is where traditionally, they were spending in many instances over the last
3, 4, 5 years. What we're seeing is a really high accelerated spend of how do we take advantage of the
massive deployment of cloud technology that FIS has done over the last 4 years. It certainly raises their
availability to any -- to nothing the industry is seeing, frankly, lowers their overall total cost of ownership.
So really taking advantage of our cloud investments have been very important. They're leaning in hard
on our open API frameworks and spending a lot of money in that area. One, it gives them flexibility to
modernize through a more componentized approach. So instead of trying to do something big bang,
they're going to focus on individual components. That then leads into seeing a lot of spend around our
next-generation componentized architecture, whether it's digital enablement. So as you think about
our Digital One platform, that really is truly a new omnichannel platform, where no matter where the
interaction with the consumer or the business occurs, no matter what channel, it goes through a unique

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

platform. So there's a consistency. And literally, someone can start in one channel and end the interaction
in a totally different channel. And we're seeing that not only in banking. We're seeing the same thing in
capital markets. Frankly, seeing the same thing over in our merchant business as well. So you're right,
they're definitely moving spend from the traditional legacy. They're putting a lot of those solutions more in
a maintenance mode and then really trying to move and spend in next-generation digital engagements.

Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's great. I might have missed whether you mentioned something on whether the pipeline increased.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. No, the pipeline is very strong. We're very pleased with what we're seeing going on in our pipeline. It
continues to grow. We traditionally have run our pipelines at about 2x of what we're looking to generate in
any given quarter in sales. And I would say our pipelines are running higher than that today. So we're real
pleased with where -- not only our sales success, but the sales team is doing a very nice job of going out
and building transaction momentum through pipeline. Obviously, not everything in your pipeline closes.
We've talked about that a lot over the years that I've been CEO. But we're seeing very healthy activity in
the pipeline as well, seeing a lot of deal flow coming in and going all the way through the decision. So at
this point in time, I think Q3 is shaping up to be another strong quarter in sales force.

And your final question today comes from the line of George Mihalos from Cowen.

Georgios Mihalos
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats, guys, on very solid results and encouraging trends. I just wanted to circle back to your
commentary on volumes within the merchant segment. I think up 4% or so in June and getting better.
Just a point of clarification. When we compare that to the networks, that would seem to suggest an
acceleration to kind of the high single digits, 7-ish range or something like that. I just want to make sure
I'm thinking about that correctly. And then related to that, it sounds like e-comm clearly getting better,
more momentum there. Are you continuing to see improvement, though, in the U.S. SMB channel? Or has
that started to kind of flatten off in terms of improvements in July?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll touch base on the volumes themselves. We continue to see and continue the message that we're
seeing volumes and trends right in line with the networks as they continue to drive information in the
marketplace out by week, by month. We continue to be right on top of those trends overall. So I think
that's absolutely the case, and we continue to expect that given the scale and size of the business and our
exposure across the globe, similar to the networks. On the e-comm side, could you repeat the question on
the e-comm side? I couldn't remember -- I couldn't hear you exactly, George.

Georgios Mihalos
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

The e-comm side sounds like it's showing additional momentum, but just curious about U.S. SMB. Is that
continuing to improve as well? Or has that started to flatten out?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

No. I think it would continue to improve as well as we go forward here. E-comm -- demand for e-comm
continues to be robust across the board. So -- and I think that trend will continue for quite a long time,
given the environment that we're in.

Gary Adam Norcross

Yes. As we look at it, I mean, we certainly -- some of the customers that were utilizing or some of the
merchants that were utilizing Wirecard, we see that as an opportunity for organic sales. We've already had
some success in signing some of those customers, and we'll continue to focus on it. Obviously, they've
got to clear our standards around risk tolerance and other things. But we see a really continued good
sales opportunity across the board through our organic approaches with our go to markets and the various
