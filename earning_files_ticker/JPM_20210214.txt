JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This
call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and
Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is
available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.

Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $14.3 billion, EPS of $4.50 on revenue of $33.1 billion
and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 29%. Included in these results are 2 significant
items: $5.2 billion of net credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly; and a $550 million
contribution to the firm's foundation in the form of equity investments.

Touching on a few highlights. We saw another strong quarter in CIB. In fact, net income was an all-time
record with IB fees up 57% year-on-year, reflecting continued robust activity, and markets up 25% year-
on-year as the environment remained favorable in January and February, although it did start to normalize
in March.

In AWM, we had record net long-term inflows of $48 billion this quarter. And deposits of $2.2 trillion were
up 36% year-on-year and 5% sequentially as the Fed balance sheet continues to expand. But loan growth
remains muted, up 1% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter with the bright spots being AWM and
secured lending in CIB.

On to Page 2 for more detail on our results. When looking at this quarter's performance, there's a lot of
noise in the year-on-year comparisons, particularly given what happened in March of last year. And so
it's important to remember a few key points here about March of 2020. Effectively, investment banking
activity stopped or got delayed, except for investment-grade debt issuance. We recorded $950 million of
losses in credit adjustments in other and CIB as well as a $900 million markdown on our bridge book. And
in credit, we built $6.8 billion of reserves relative to this quarter's release of $5.2 billion.

So with that in mind, revenue of $33.1 billion was up $4.1 billion or 14% year-on-year. Net interest
income was down $1.6 billion or 11% primarily driven by lower rates. And noninterest revenue was up
$5.7 billion or 39%. While this comparison is in part impacted by several of the items I just mentioned, in
absolute terms, we saw strong fee generation across the franchise, including in investment banking, AWM
and Home Lending as well as a strong performance in markets.

Expenses of $18.7 billion were up 12% year-on-year on higher volume and revenue-related expenses, the
contribution to the foundation that I just mentioned as well as continued investments. And credit costs
were a net benefit of $4.2 billion driven by reserve releases. And here, it's worth noting that charge-offs
were down about $400 million year-on-year or 28% and continue to trend near historical lows.

Turning to Page 3 for more detail on our reserves. We released approximately $5.2 billion of reserves
this quarter as recent economic data has been consistently positive, indicating that the recovery may be
accelerating faster than we would have thought just a few months ago.

Starting with consumer. In card, we released $3.5 billion. As the employment picture has continued to
improve, the Round 3 stimulus has provided another level of support, and early-stage delinquencies
remain very low.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

And in Home Lending, we released $625 million primarily driven by continued improvement in HPI
expectations and, to a lesser extent, portfolio runoff. And then in wholesale, we released approximately
$700 million.

While a strong recovery seems in motion, we're also prepared for more adverse outcomes given remaining
uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the health of the underlying labor markets. So for
now, we remain cautious and are still weighted to our downside scenarios and that about $26 billion were
reserved at approximately $7 billion above the current base case. However, it's worth noting that even in a
more normalized environment, we wouldn't expect to be 100% weighted to the base case as we'll always
have some weighting on alternative scenarios.

Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1%,
flat versus the prior quarter, as net growth in retained earnings was offset by lower AOCI and higher RWA.
Perhaps the more interesting ratio right now is SLR, which is at 5.5%, excluding the temporary relief that
just expired.

As we've said all along, we were never going to rely on short-term temporary relief as a long-term
planning matter, and this is evidenced by actions we've taken. We've already engaged with our wholesale
deposit clients to explore solutions. And we issued 1.5 billion of preferred stock in the first quarter.

Having said that, it's worth reinforcing a few points here. First, it's important to remember that the SLR
is a leverage-based requirement, not a risk-based requirement. The growth in bank leverage has been
driven by deposits and therefore cannot be cured by reducing lending. In fact, the opposite would be true.
If we had more loan growth, it would help because it would absorb excess risk-based capital.

The issue is that we've had muted loan demand to date. And even if it starts to pick up, it's hard to
envision that organic loan growth could keep pace with further QE. And therefore, we expect this leverage
issue to persist for some time.

And finally, when a bank is leverage constrained, this lowers the marginal value of any deposit, regardless
if it is wholesale or retail, operational or nonoperational. And regulators should consider whether requiring
banks to hold additional capital for further deposit growth is the right outcome. As we told you last
quarter, we have levers to manage SLR, and we will. However, raising capital against deposits and/or
turning away deposits are unnatural actions for banks and cannot be good for the system in the long run.

And then just to wrap up on capital. Regarding distributions, the limitations were extended another
quarter. So based on our income, that corresponds to buyback capacity of about $7.4 billion in the second
quarter after paying our $0.90 dividend. Given the preferreds we plan to issue and the work underway
around excess client deposits, while, of course, this could become more challenging, we believe that we
should be able to buy back most, if not all, of that capacity.

Now let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 5. CCB reported
net income of $6.7 billion, including reserve releases of $4.6 billion. Starting with the key drivers of the
year-on-year financial performance, which I'll just note have generally been consistent over the last
few quarters against the backdrop of strong consumer balance sheets with higher savings rates and
investments as well as healthy deleveraging.

Deposit growth was 32% or $240 billion as existing customers' balances remain elevated, and we also
continue to acquire new customers. Client investment assets were up 44%, driven by market appreciation
and positive net flows across our adviser and digital channels.

Home lending originations were $39 billion, up 40% in an overall larger market. And auto loan and lease
originations were $11.2 billion, up 35% with March being the best month on record. However, loans were
down 7% as outstandings in card remain lower even as spend is recovering to pre-COVID levels. This is in
addition to the continued runoff of the mortgage portfolio and partially offset by PPP additions.

Mobile users grew 9% to nearly 42 million. And the customer migration to digital continued with branch
transactions still down double digits.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

In Consumer Banking, approximately 50% of new checking and savings accounts were opened digitally,
and that's up more than 10 percentage points year-on-year. Notably, we're also seeing a few emerging
trends worth covering. Consumer sentiment has returned to more normalized levels, reflecting increased
optimism. We've seen debit and credit card spend return to pre-pandemic levels, up 9% year-on-year and
14% versus 1Q '19, despite T&E remaining significantly lower. That said, we are seeing strong momentum
in T&E with spend up more than 50% in March compared to February and similar growth across cxLoyalty
and Ultimate Reward travel bookings. With higher rates, mortgage lock margins have tightened and refi
applications have slowed, but the overall market is still robust.

And on credit, government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have provided confidence that the
bridge is likely going to be long enough and strong enough. Taken together with the pace of the vaccine
rollout, we believe there's some permanence to the loss mitigation. And while 1Q '21 card losses are
higher quarter-on-quarter, we do expect losses to decrease in the second and third quarters.

In summary, revenue of $12.5 billion was down 6% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression
and lower card NII on lower balances, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending
production revenue. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 1% as we self-fund our investments. And
credit costs were a net benefit of $3.6 billion, driven by the $4.6 billion of reserve releases I previously
mentioned, partially offset by net charge-offs of $1 billion.

Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion and
an ROE of 27% on record first quarter revenue of $14.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2.9 billion
was up 67% year-on-year, excluding the impact of the bridge book markdown last year. IB fees of $3
billion were up 57%. And while we now rank #2, largely due to SPAC IPOs, we maintained our global IB
wallet share of 9%. The quarter's performance was an all-time record driven by the continued momentum
in the equity issuance markets as well as robust activity in M&A and DCM.

In advisory, we were up 35%, benefiting from the surge in announcement activity in the second half of
2020. Debt underwriting fees were up 17% driven by leveraged finance activity. And here, we maintained
our #1 rank and lead left position. And in equity underwriting, fees were up more than 200% primarily
driven by IPOs as clients continue to take advantage of strong market conditions.

Looking forward, the IPO calendar is expected to remain active with M&A momentum likely to continue.
And while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, the number of flow deals outside of the pipeline, both
this year and last year, make it difficult to predict the second quarter. So at this point, I'd say we expect IB
fees to be about flat year-on-year.

Moving to markets. Total revenue was $9.1 billion, up 25% against the strong prior year quarter. In
January and February, we saw a robust trading environment. And client activity remained elevated with
the positive momentum from the end of 2020 carrying through to the start of the year. In March, our
performance started to normalize but remained above pre-COVID levels.

Fixed income was up 15% with outperformance in securitized products and credit, supported by active
primary and secondary markets, partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currency and emerging
markets against the tough compare in March of last year. Equity markets was up 47% and an all-time
record driven by a favorable trading environment in equity derivatives as well as strong client activity
across products.

In terms of outlook, based on recent weeks, we would expect this quarter to be closer to the second
quarter of 2019, as 2Q '20 was the best quarter on record for our markets franchise but, obviously, it's still
early.

Wholesale Payments and Securities Services revenues were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, both
down 2% year-on-year with higher deposit balances more than offset by deposit margin compression.
Expenses of $7.1 billion were up 19% year-on-year on higher revenue-related compensation, partially
offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $331 million driven by the reserve
releases I discussed earlier.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

Now let's go to Commercial Banking on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.2 billion
and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 11% year-on-year with higher lending and investment
banking revenue in the absence of a prior year markdown in the bridge book, partially offset by lower
deposit revenue. Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.1 billion was up 65% with broad-based
strength as market conditions remain favorable. Expenses of $969 million were down 2% driven by lower
structural expenses. Deposits of $291 billion were up 54% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter as
client balances remain elevated. And loans were down 2% year-on-year and 3% sequentially.

C&I loans were down 4% from the prior quarter on lower revolver balances as clients continue to access
capital markets for liquidity, partially offset by additional PPP funding. And CRE loans were down 1% with
continued low origination volumes in commercial term lending, partially offset by increased affordable
housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $118 million driven by reserve releases with net
charge-offs of $29 million driven by oil and gas.

Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management generated record net
income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 40% and ROE of 35%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.1
billion was up 20% year-on-year as higher management fees, growth in deposit and loan balances as
well as investment valuation gains were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6
billion were up 6% with higher volume and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by lower structural
expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $121 million primarily due to reserve releases.

For the quarter, record net long-term inflows of $48 billion were again positive across all channels, asset
classes and regions with particular strength in equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $44 billion
as banks encourage clients to move excess deposits away from them. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall
client assets of $3.8 trillion, up 28% and 32% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by higher market
levels as well as strong net inflows. And finally, deposits were up 43% and loans were up 18% with
strength in security-based lending, custom lending and mortgages.

Now on to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $580 million. Revenue was a loss of $473
million, down $639 million year-on-year. Net interest income was down nearly $700 million on lower rates
as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. And expenses of
$876 million were up $730 million year-on-year primarily driven by the contribution to the foundation I
mentioned earlier. The results for the quarter also include a tax benefit related to the impact of the firm's
expected full year tax rate relative to the level of pretax income this quarter.

So with that, moving to the outlook on Page 10. You'll see here that our 2021 NII outlook of around $55
billion remains in line with our previous guidance, as the benefits of the steepening yield curve are being
offset by customer behavior in card. It's worth noting that forecasting NII is perhaps more challenging
than it's been in a long time as many of the key inputs, market-implied rates, deposit forecast, securities
reinvestment and customer behavior in card are all quite fluid. And as a reminder, while customer
deleveraging and higher payment rates in card is a headwind for NII, it's a tailwind for credit. And we now
expect our card net charge-off rate to be around 250 basis points for the year. And then on expenses,
we've increased our guidance to approximately $70 billion with the largest driver being higher volume and
revenue-related expenses, which importantly have offsets in revenue.

So to wrap up, the year has gotten off to a strong start, and a robust economic recovery seems underway.
Of course, there are still risks and uncertainties ahead that we're preparing for as well as specific issues
that we're facing, including the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned, the rate environment and tough
year-on-year comparisons, among other things. Having said that, the earnings power of the franchise
remains evident. And we'll continue to use our resources to serve our clients, customers and communities.
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.

Erika Najarian
BofA Securities, Research Division

My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, you noted during a December conference that you believe that
normalized ROTCE for JPMorgan would be about 17%. And investors were wondering, as we think about
JPMorgan perhaps cementing a higher GSIB surcharge at 4% this year, is 17% still achievable under that
context or constrained?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Erika, I'll start. So just a couple of things to think about on capital. So while we're -- we ended the
year in the 4% bucket for GSIB. And it's probably worth mentioning, given the continued expansion of the
system through the Fed balance sheet, even staying in 4% could become challenging for us. But just a
couple of things to keep in mind there is we believe that like we do have offsets in the stress capital buffer.
And we do believe that it's very possible that we'll see those come through in this round. Of course, it's
dependent upon the Fed models, not our models. But we've talked about things that -- actions that we've
taken sort of mechanical in nature in addition to moving investment securities into held to maturity, that
should give us some benefit on the SCB. Of course, that's scenario dependent, but we do expect some
benefit there that could offset.

It's also important to remember that we still are waiting for the Basel III endgame. And the indication
from the Fed is that they will address GSIB recalibration as part of that. And so it's quite possible that we
see GSIB recalibration but perhaps another constraint that we'll be managing. So there is a lot that we'll
learn over probably the next year or 2. And of course, the higher GSIB doesn't come into effect until the
first quarter of '23.

So we do think we have offsets. We're still thinking about 12% as being a target CET1 for us, of course,
given what we know today. But we are still waiting for that Basel III endgame to really understand what
we're dealing with. And at that 12%, in a more normalized environment, which wouldn't just be about
rates, it would also be about loan demand, 17% still feels achievable for us.

Erika Najarian
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And thank you for going through some of the leverage constraint now that SLR has been --
exemption has expired. The investors have also been wondering, as we think about your opportunity to
continue to facilitate the economic recovery globally, does the constraint on SLR and the moving pieces
on GSIB change your priorities in terms of timing or sizing of the $30 billion buyback or inorganic growth
opportunities that you've mentioned in the past?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

I would say, broadly speaking, no. But an important point there on SLR, we obviously -- the levers we
have are issuing preferreds. We can retain more common. But we're also working closely with wholesale
clients in a very selective way, as I mentioned, to find alternatives for excess deposits.

So it is true that common is one of the levers, although I will say that while it might give us more
flexibility, it comes at a much greater cost. So at this point, given what we know and what we expect, we
don't expect that we would have to retain more common. We think we can manage this through issuing

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

more preferreds and working closely with our clients to find alternatives. So I would say, broadly speaking,
no.

The GSIB constraints, as we've been saying for years now, is one that will become increasingly challenging
for us. And now, particularly with the expansion of the system, it's even more challenging than perhaps it
was just a few years ago, but we're managing through that as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.

John Eamon McDonald
Autonomous Research LLP

I wanted to ask about expenses. Obviously, you've raised the outlook by $1 billion a few times the last
couple of times you've spoken. I guess in terms of the increase that you announced today to the outlook,
can you give a little more color on how much of that is volume and revenue related, as opposed to the
other buckets you talked about in January, which were investments in structural?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, sure. So the increase from the $69 billion, which was the guidance we gave in the K, is almost
entirely volume and revenue related. And so there, I'll just make an important point that it's volume and
revenue related.

So as an example, volumes in CCB, just given the environment, they are very valuable for long-term
franchise revenue growth. But we may not see that revenue growth in the near term. But as we always
say, we don't manage this place for 1 quarter or even 1 year.

So there are expenses associated with volume growth that may not have the revenue growth you would
anticipate over the long run, but it's almost entirely volume and revenue related. There are a few other
things like marketing expense that, given the strength of the recovery that we expect, we now expect to
lean more in on marketing expense in the second half of the year. So that's part of it as well.

John Eamon McDonald
Autonomous Research LLP

Okay. And I guess the follow-up would be does that necessarily mean that it's more concentrated, the
increase in the first quarter because you had such a big quarter? And are there COVID-related costs that
you have in your numbers this year that might come out over time?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Obviously, some of it is in the first quarter. But things like further volume-related expenses like I talked
about or marketing, they're less so in the first quarter. And then what was your other question?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

COVID.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Those numbers are lower than they were even last year and included in the outlook but not material in the
grand scheme of things.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So if you're right on the economy, which I think a lot of us think you are, we're starting to see the spend
part of the pickup now, as you mentioned, across credit and debit and some of the P&A. So my question
is how do you think about the staging of the lens part. Both consumer and corporates are so flushed with
all that liquidity. How do you think about the timing for loan growth? And if I could get a consumer versus
wholesale comment, that would be great.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So you used the right word, which is demand. And it really is all about demand, which, of course, is
quite healthy, particularly as it relates to the consumer when you think about the amount of deleveraging
that we've seen through this process. So there, we do expect a second half pickup because, as you say,
we first have to see spend recover before we see relevering on the consumer side.

So -- and then it is also true even for small business, which is obviously part of CCB. Their demand has
been very low given the support that's available through PPP. And so that will likely pick up in the second
half as well.

And then elsewhere, AWM has been strong throughout, and we see that continuing. And then on the CIB
side, I mean that's always lumpy and deal dependent. But that's active as well. And we do see within
secured lending, opportunities there across asset classes. Again, that's a bit more opportunistic.

And then in the commercial bank, given the level of support, the amount of liquidity in the markets as well
as the amount of cash on balance sheet, loan growth there has been muted and probably will be for some
time. But again, that's incredibly healthy ultimately for the recovery. And so whether we see that pick up
later this year or next year remains to be seen, but it's all for good reasons.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate that. Maybe I'll just ask one follow-up on the deposit side. Obviously, deposit growth has been
incredibly strong. So the two-parter is what do you think happens on the deposit side as the economy
goes down the path that you've outlined, and what do you do with the deposit money in the meantime,
because I saw it loud and clear, Jamie's comments on it's hard to justify the price of U.S. debt. So what
are we doing with all that liquidity in the meantime?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

So first of all, I would say that deposits are going to be driven by the Fed balance sheet and, to some
extent, obviously by bank lending. But given the demand picture there, you can think of it in the near
term as all being driven by Fed balance sheet expansion. And so we obviously continue to expect
significant deposit growth, which is why we've been talking about this so much.

And then just in terms of how we deploy it, you will have seen that our cash balances are up quarter-over-
quarter. And there, it's just important to remember that, for sure, we are being patient in the investment
securities portfolio. That is true. I'll also mention that we are -- because of the steepening of the yield
curve, we are less short. Banks will drift long in a selloff, and so that has been part of the dynamic as well.
But there's short-term cash deployment also. And so what we saw there was when repo markets fall below
IOER, we're going to hold that short-term cash deployment in IOER relative to the repo market. So you'll
see that dynamic on our balance sheet as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I just wonder if you could elaborate on that. You mentioned the record investment banking pipeline and
flattish year-over-year as a best guess. So I was just wondering if you could talk about the mix dynamics
there. Obviously, the first quarter was just ridiculously great in terms of the ECM markets. And can you
just give us a flavor of just where you see activity? And how much is that underwriting activity potentially
dampening what might be happening on the commercial loan side?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I'll start with the latter, which is it's absolutely been very, very supportive of corporates. And
therefore, it has a lot to do with what we're seeing in terms of the muted loan demand from corporates.

And then in terms of the mix, we expect ECM and M&A to continue. But on DCM, there's a lot of flow
activity that doesn't necessarily get represented in a pipeline because it's high velocity-type activity. We
saw that in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see that now, which is why I said it makes it
a little bit difficult to predict the second quarter. So while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, there
is still a lot of high velocity activity. And so that's why we think that the quarter will be flattish year-over-
year despite the very high pipeline.

Again, no problem, Jen. Okay. The second one is just with regards to the comments that you guys have
made for a while about looking at acquisition opportunities. Just wondering just how is the interplay
between everything you've talked about already on balance sheet capacity and ongoing deposit growth
and limitations on CET1 and SLR versus how you make potential decisions around usage of capital in an
acquisition capacity.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, it's a great question. Interestingly, the issue is not that we don't have capital available to make those
types of decisions. The issue is that we have the wrong binding constraint. So the binding constraint
is leveraged, not risk-based. And so it doesn't change the way we think about acquisitions at all. In
fact, acquisitions and/or increased loan growth would help to kind of normalize the constraints between
leverage and risk-based. And so we would love to be able to absorb some of our CET1 through acquisitions
because, as I said, it sort of just brings the balance back into focus. The issue is that it's leverage-
based constraint that is the constraint, and we're in a low rate environment with low loan demand and
very strong deposit growth. So it's the combination of all those things that makes leverage the binding
constraint. But it doesn't change the way we're thinking about acquisitions.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Jen, a question on card and looking at the net charge-offs. You gave us the full year of 2.5%. And I know
you spent a lot of time in card earlier in your career. So maybe you could give us some sense on how
you're thinking about the "normalization" of that loss content over time.

When I think back to the bankruptcy changes in the '00s, it took many years for consumers to relever. And
I'm wondering, given your background there, could you give us a sense as to what is different this time?
And are there time frames historically we should look at for what a normal course like releveraging back to
normal of that card loss content should be? How do you think about that?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I would say, first of all, it's difficult to find a historical comparison that's totally relevant here
because I don't think we've ever seen this amount of support in the system, which came, of course, on top
of an already reasonably healthy consumer. So it's difficult to find the historical perspective. But I will say
the 2.5%, I mean, pre-COVID, we would have thought that our loss rate in card this year would have been
3.3%, 3.5%. So it just gives you a sense there of that tailwind on credit is significant.

And in terms of what it's going to take for consumers to relever, I mean we do expect there to be
significant economic activity in the second half. And so that could come quite naturally, but it could come a
little bit later given the amount of deleveraging we've seen. But the fact that we already see spend above
pre-COVID levels and, obviously, we still have restrictions in place, particularly around T&E on consumers'
ability to spend, when that comes back, we do think that we'll see spend tick even higher. And that will be
a point where perhaps we'll start to see that delevering, but it is difficult to know. It's a great question.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then the follow-up I have on your comments around the NII guide and the fact that it's hard to
forecast. I got a couple of questions in this morning just on, "Hey, why do you think it's flat versus prior
guide given the curve has deepened? And also deposit growth should continue to be up significantly given
QE is continuing this full year?"

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

So is there some spread angle that you're kind of thinking about that keeps you a little bit more muted? Is
it more the loan growth? Maybe you could talk a little bit about those piece parts that you identified.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I think it's probably all of the above, Betsy, but starting with the steepening of the yield curve. So
if you look at the earnings at risk disclosure, I mean where -- we did see the benefit roughly in line with
what that disclosure shows, which is, since we last guided on NII, we steepened probably 25, 30 basis
points. So that is incorporated in the outlook, but it is completely offset by the fact that we continue to
see consumer behavior in card in terms of higher payment rates. And we haven't started to see relevering
as we were just talking about even though spend has recovered. So card, the impacts of card completely
offset the steepening of the yield curve.

You also mentioned loan growth, which is critically important to realizing the benefits of the steepening
yield curve. And then I would just mention, we have reflected in our outlook the fact that we have been
patient on deploying further deposit growth into the securities portfolio in terms of duration.

And then also, it's probably worth noting that the marginal benefit of further deposit growth is quite small
given the fact that deployment opportunities are minimal. And so you can think about them as being
something less than 10 basis points because we do have pay rates above 0. So it's something less than
10 basis points. So the marginal deposit growth from here doesn't add a whole lot in this environment
anyway.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My question is for Jamie. And Jamie, your philosophy is to invest through a downturn. And you're
increasing your investments by 1/4 year-over-year. You already said that. But what's your philosophy
about investing through a boom as you expect over the next 3 years? I mean if the pie is growing, do your
investments go higher? It looks like that's not the case with the guidance you guys gave.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I think, Mike, the way I really look at it is it probably doesn't -- it isn't affected as much by boom
and bust as you think. So we isolate opportunities like for -- we announced we're going to hire Black
financial advisers. We're going to do that whether it's boom or bust. We're building new data centers.
We're building new agile. We're going to the cloud.

So I think it doesn't really change that much over time. I just think you'll probably see our investments go
up over time, not go down. We can get plenty of organic growth opportunities, which we want to invest in.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then how much are you spending in climate? Your 66 pages CEO letter was, I guess that's like --
could be 1/3 of a book almost. But you really had the table on climate risk and what you guys need to do.
How much are you actually spending? And what's the payback on that spending for shareholders? Or is
this really an ESG reputational benefit you're looking for?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

So I'll start there, Mike. And then Jamie, you can chime in. But climate is a long game obviously. And
we're investing a lot of effort in our ESG initiatives, not only because they have a positive impact

on society and communities but because they're also important to our clients, customers and our
shareholders.

So we don't exactly think about it that way, Mike. But we've also invested in multiple teams to help clients
through the transition. And we do recognize it's a transition, and clients appreciate that. We've also made
the Paris-aligned financing commitment last year. And we're going to release our annual ESG report next
month, so you'll see more there.

And then we also committed to finance $200 billion towards climate action and sustainable development,
and we're continuing to grow those efforts as well. And in fact, your question is quite timely because we're
planning to make an ambitious announcement tomorrow about long-term scaling of our financing efforts
here. So much more detail to come shortly on that. But Jamie, I don't know if you want to add anything.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.

James Francis Mitchell
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Just maybe a question on the bank SLR, which I think was a bit more of a constraint even than the firm-
wide SLR. Just I guess 2 questions related to that. What kind of flexibility do you have to kind of manage
the difference between the 2 moving assets out of the bank perhaps? And then just if you have any
updates or thoughts on potential changes that regulators are discussing to kind of give maybe relief 2.0 in
a more permanent sense on the SLR.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

So the bank SLR, I mean, broadly speaking, it's going to be the same levers. We do have a little bit more
flexibility, as you note, because we can move things. We can inject capital into the bank from the holding
company. So it's a little bit more flexible. But generally speaking, the constraints and the levers are the
same.

And then in terms of changes, we know what you know. And so we look forward to a proposal. The only
thing I can mention is, of course, the difference between the U.S. and Europe on Basel as it relates to SLR
is there, it's a 3% plus half year GSIB. And so we have a constant 2% buffer. And so -- and with that, you
get the flexibility in a Basel-compliant way to exclude deposits at central banks for a period of time. So it's
possible that it could look something like that, but we don't know.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

So I think there's too much focus there. We run the business and do a great job servicing clients over
time. We manage 20 years -- God knows how many different capital liquidity trends. We have multiple
levers to pull all the time to do that while serving our clients. If we've got to adjust our strategy going
forward, so be it. We'll probably be fine.

I think the question you should be asking isn't what it means for us, it's what it means to the marketplace.
I've already mentioned several times, we have $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, which
we cannot deploy in a whole bunch of different ways into the marketplace with repo or just financing
positions or helping people because of these constraints. So the constraints are more of a constraint on
the economy than they are on JPMorgan Chase. We will find a way, regardless of any constraints, to do
things.

The other thing is the GSIB, the SLR, they're all these bubble things, they need to be recalibrated. And
I think people should be asking why -- how would you be recalibrated to do the best job for the United
States and the people in the United States, not for JPMorgan. JPMorgan will be fine either way.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

A question, I apologize if you addressed this. I had to jump off for a minute here. But can you share with
us on the service -- mortgage servicing business, it looked like you had a small loss this quarter similar to
the fourth quarter. Can you tell us some of the metrics that went into why the servicing business recorded
a small loss?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Oh gosh, Gerard. I'm not even sure. But Reggie and the team can follow up with you.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Very good. And the second question has to do with when we go back to the day 1 loan loss reserves
established in January 1, 2020, for you and your peers under CECL accounting, if I recall, I think your loan
loss reserves to total loans at the time were approximately 1.87%. Today, they're approximately 2.42%.
I know you guys gave some color on your outlook for what you think credit will look like. You're being a
little more conservative. But can you share with us what would it take to bring the reserves back down to
the day 1 levels that we saw in January 1, 2020?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Well, it's very difficult to try to compare today to -- just taking our balance sheet today, taking the profile
of our portfolio today and compare it to CECL day 1 because we are very far away from that, in fact, in a
very healthy way. So that's very difficult to do.

What I will say is that it is true that things have continued to improve even since we closed our process
in the first quarter. And we obviously expect things to be -- we expect the recovery to be robust in the
second half of the year. And so if we continue to see that, if we continue to see labor markets recover, if
we continue to see vaccine rollout be successful, we would have future releases from here.

And -- but I would note importantly that the $7 billion, that is the distance between our reserve and the
base case, is just for context. We will always have weightings on alternative scenarios. And so all else
equal, which is there's a lot in the all-else equal bucket, but we would release something less than $7
billion. So difficult to compare back to CECL day 1, but there could be further releases ahead.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

One of the negatives to CECL, which I pointed out right at the beginning, that we spent a lot of time on
these calls describing something which is virtually irrelevant for the bank, which is these are multiple
scenarios, hypothetical, probability-based. And obviously, the more volatile environment, the more volatile
these numbers.

If a base case was $20 billion, and we now have something like 30, we're not going to be taking down a
lot of reserves now because you always -- as Jen said, you're always going to have an extreme adverse
case. Think of it like kind of a CCAR test, and you always have a percentage of reserves up for that
permanently. And so hopefully -- I mean my view is we should waste a lot less time in CECL. That makes
almost no difference to the company in general.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the CEO letter, where there was talk about being open to fintech deals, which is
something you've talked about in the past. But what type of deals would you be interested in? And I guess
could it be material to JPMorgan as we think about whether it's a strategy or a financial impact?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

So remember, we're after paying a steady, careful dividend and stuff like that. We much prefer to invest in
our business organically, including the acquisitions than buy back stock. We're buying back stock because
our cup runneth over. We have 13.6% capital to risk-weighted -- to advanced risk-weighted assets. We're
earning a tremendous sum of money, and we really have no option right now.

But I think the door is open to anything that makes sense. So we've already done InstaMed, which is an
electronic digital payments platform between providers and consumers in health care. We did 55ip, which
is a tax way -- a tax-efficient way of managing money. And we're looking at tons of things ourselves.
Some, we're building ourselves like Dynamo. Some, we're going to -- in part with other people. We've
got investments in probably 100 different hundreds companies at this point to be either partner with or
alike, but we're completely open-minded. It could be payments. It could be asset management. It could
be adjacency. It could be data. It could be anything like that. It cannot be a U.S. bank. So we're just
reminding people, if you got great ideas for us, let us know.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And is the mentality in fintech specifically, is it to potentially accelerate some of the investments that you
would have done on your own or to add capabilities or maybe protect what you already have?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Well, it's a little of everything because you see us adding Chase my plan and Chase my loan and obviously
see competing a little bit of Buy Now, Pay Later. You see us doing Chase offers and compete with people.
You see us doing Zelle payments. And we've got tons of fabulous stuff coming. We did do invest a couple
of years ago. We had a very good quarter. We're adding robo-investing, which is just getting going.

So we're adding a broad set of capabilities across the full spectrum. And you're going to see a lot more.
And you're going to see personalization of apps. And if you go into the payment system, you're going to
see global wallets. You're going to see tons of stuff that's coming.

And like I said, the fintech has done a great job. I'd point to add that they live under different constraints.
But they've done a great job getting rid of pain points, making automated, digitizing things, using the
cloud. It's incumbent upon us to go faster to the cloud. We already have 150 major AI projects. But my
guess is in 5 years, it will be 1,000 AI projects.

So we're going as fast as we can to do a great job for customers. And obviously, fintech will be a
challenge. There's a lot of money there. They're very smart people. I want to be clear. We're not wishing
regulations on them like on us. I think it would be bad for America. But we are wishing for a level playing
field when it comes to ramp certain products and certain services.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Just a quick question. I mean as we start to look out to forward rates and market, kind of implying Fed
moving somewhat in the near term or intermediate term, I mean how are you guys thinking about deposit
betas this cycle? And kind of what's included in your NII sensitivity, both on the consumer and commercial
deposits?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So...

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

So I think the way to answer is the betas have gamma, meaning they change over time. And we have our
best guess in numbers that Jen gave you. So obviously, the beta is going up all the time, and then it levels
off.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

That's right. And so the betas have gamma, like I'd say that -- you can think of it as being nonlinear,
meaning the beta for the first 100 basis points will be lower than the beta for the second and third
increments of 100 basis points. And so from here, on the retail side specifically, the first 100 basis points
will be very valuable because there is a lower beta associated with it. So that's really where we see the
benefit in NII with short rates in an environment with low loan growth.

Sorry about that. I had a question about the impact that negative rates at the short end of the yield curve
might have on your entity. Specifically, if we -- you touched a little bit on the IOER rate and the overnight
repo rate being raised. Would that have any impact on your market-related NII if they had to raise by 5
basis points?

Secondly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, is that incorporated in your $55 billion NII
guidance? And then thirdly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, does that have any implications
for what loan demand might look like?

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So I'll just start by saying while we have seen repo go negative at times, it's been quarterly. And
so we don't expect short rates to be negative for any longer period of time or -- and we certainly haven't
seen spikes, which is something you would worry about more.

I think with the amount of capacity in the money market complex and the fact that the Fed increase
their RRP facility, now that facility is at 0, so that certainly is supportive of ensuring short rates don't go
negative for any meaningful period of time. They also obviously could increase that. And then for us, I
would say, not a meaningful impact because, obviously, we have 10 basis points of IOER as an option for
us, but we do trade around it.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I will just add, the why is far more important than the number. Like NII obviously, like in trading, it goes
in and out, the whole thing has been equal. No, it just shows up in a different place. But if you go negative
NII because you're going back into recession because there's a negative variance, that's a whole different
issue than it was a temporary timing thing. I would tell you, we would expect rates to be moving up over
time, and we expect a rather healthy, very strong economy.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. And what we've seen so far on the short end is not unhealthy or something we're worried about.
It's a dynamic of so much cash chasing the supply.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe General.

Andrew Lim
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

So just circling back to the SLR, despite issuing 1.5 billion preferreds, you still lost about 30 basis points
on your SLR. I'm just wondering how you think about the ratio 2 or 3 quarters out from now, whether
issuing preferreds and having your discussions with wholesale depositors is there's going to be enough to
put a floor on the SLR at 5.5%, or whether you're going to have to pull harder on that, on those levers or
have to pull hard on other levers.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the minimum is 5%, so we have some room. Naturally, we will have a buffer above the minimum
as you always need to when you have binary consequences of going low. So you can think about some
management buffer above that, but we do still have room at 5.5%. And we do think that we can manage
this at this point through issuing. We'll be in the market again with preferreds as well as the conversations
that we've had with clients. So far, they have not been disruptive. We're hopeful that, that remains the
case and that we can manage this.

Andrew Lim
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

Okay. So what was your level of comfort for the buffer above the 5%? That's my follow-on.

And then just another question. You gave an update a couple of quarters ago, saying that you had a buffer
of -- or was it, let's say, excess provisions of about $10 billion versus your best case scenario economic
outlook. Obviously, you've released a lot of provisions since then. Can you give an update on what that
figure is now?

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So you can think about a buffer on the SLR of, call it 25 basis points. There, it is important to note,
something like AOCI is something that we have to incorporate into our thinking and the impact of AOCI as
that's part of Tier 1 capital. So we need to have a buffer to make sure that we can manage through any
noise we might see there. So that's why we have a buffer, and 25 basis points is probably a reasonable
one to think about.

In terms of the -- on reserves, the distance between where we are in the base case, as I said in my
prepared remarks, that's now $7 billion. What's interesting to note is that, that was $10 billion. It was
then $9 billion. And we've released $8 billion, and it's still $7 billion. So the -- all of the scenarios have
been moving. And there are lots -- there's a lot that goes into how we think about reserves. We've always
just provided that as context for everyone, particularly last year as we were managing through so much
uncertainty in terms of the inputs into our reserves.

So I wouldn't put a lot of weight into that because what I also said on the $7 billion is that you shouldn't
think about that as available for release because we will always have some weighting on alternative
scenarios. And so even if everything plays out exactly as we expect, based upon where we closed the
books for the first quarter, it would be something less than $7 billion.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'm still wrestling with the deposit conundrum. So I guess your national deposit share is something like
12%. And over the last year, I think your incremental deposit share gain is 20%. In other words, the
industry deposits were up around $3 trillion, and your deposits are up $600 billion. So I'm just wondering
how much of that was due to QE, and how much of that is due to organic growth. And maybe you can fill
us in because you're building out the branches in the lower 48 states, and you're expanding commercial
bankers and trying to build up all this organic growth at a time when you can't really monetize those
deposits.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So first of all, as we always say, we're running the place for the long term. And we don't expect this
challenge to be a long-term challenge, maybe a short to medium term but not a long term. And then I'll
just say that yes, there was certainly some organic growth, but it is Fed balance sheet and bank lending
that create deposits.

And so that's what we are focused on. And we do think, given what we expect here, that we can manage
it. So -- and it certainly isn't going to change the way we think about market expansion or otherwise as
that is long-term franchise value.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I think Jen, another to kind of -- Mike, the $600 million -- and it's really hard to see that. We think we're
growing actual share in almost every billion deposits, but $500 million to $600 million was the Fed balance
sheet. And we're a big wholesale bank and a big consumer bank. So obviously, a big portion of that shows
up inside our company. And again, we try to -- the new brands are doing great, but they're not going to
move the needle quite like the Fed adding $3 trillion to deposits in the system.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Erika Najarian
BofA Securities, Research Division

Apologies for prolonging the call. I just got this question a lot on Bloomberg from investors. I just wanted
to reask the first question another way. It seems like we have been waiting for recalibration on the GSIB
for some time now. On the other hand, clearly, the expansion of your balance sheet comes with additional
revenue generation and market share taking and some opportunities. And so investors are wondering,
if we don't get any sort of calibration that's meaningful and that CET1 floor does have to move up from
12%, what is the sensitivity of the normalized ROTCE outlook, if any at all, if that 12% does have to move
up in 50 basis points increment?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So if the 12% has to move up, Erika, that would obviously have an impact. But there is so much
between here and there and that being a reality that we can't really comment on it because not only --
I know we've been waiting for GSIB recalibration for a long time. But it has been made very clear that
GSIB recalibration will be part of the Basel III endgame, which we have also been waiting for, for a very
long time. And so there will be potential offsets that we yet are not -- we're unable to manage because we
don't know what they are yet. So we continue to wait for Basel III endgame.

And then as I said, we do believe we can manage the stress capital buffer. Again, it's scenario dependent,
but we do believe we can manage that to be closer to 2.5%, which helps an awful lot in terms of an offset
to GSIB constraints. So we are thinking about that 12% number until we know something different.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And I'll just add, we're going to finally kind of keep it at 12%. And we're pretty sure we can do it, so
I'm not that worried about it. But I don't know what the confusion is. If it did go up by -- if we're earning
20% tangible equity and our capital goes up by 5% and we get no return to 5%, our ROE goes to 19%.

So I don't understand the confusion. The underlying results are still fabulous and great, and you have
slight low returns. But I even think that will be temporary. We will, over time, find strategies and tactics
to get returns to compare to our shareholders. But the most important thing of those returns, we have a
great business, great branches, great products, great services, good margins, good service, good apps,
good controls, good -- and that's what we really build all the time.

And this other stuff of just managing around capital constraints that -- it's a shame that this is -- I mean
this is not the way to run a railroad anymore. We're spending time on this call on CECL and SLR, and it's

a shame. And it does distract from growing the American economy. I've mentioned over and over, we
have $2.2 trillion deposits, $1 trillion loans, $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, much of which
cannot be deployed to intermediate or lend. Now how conservative do you want to get?

Erika Najarian
BofA Securities, Research Division

No, I agree. I think the market needed to hear that.
