CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the ConocoPhillips Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My
name is Zanera, and I'll be the operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this
conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis. Ellen, you may begin.

Ellen R. DeSanctis
Senior Vice President of Corporate Relations

Thanks, Zanera. Hello to our listeners, and welcome to today's call. With me in the room today are Ryan
Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Matt Fox, our EVP and
Chief Operating Officer; Bill Bullock, our President of the Asia Pacific, Middle East region; and Michael
Hatfield, the President of our Alaska, Canada and Europe region, are also with us today. Dominic Macklon,
President of our Lower 48 region, was unable to join today's call.

Page 2 of the presentation deck contains our cautionary statement. We will make some forward-looking
statements during this morning's call. Actual results could differ due to the factors described on this slide
and also in our periodic filings with the SEC. We will also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures
today. And reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's
press release and on our website.

And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Ryan.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Ellen, and welcome again to all our listeners. Well, it's certainly early in the new year and this
sector is already off to another volatile start. Volatility can certainly be tough on an industry or a company
if you're not built for it. Well, we're built for it, with clear resilience to lower prices, full upside to higher
prices and a shareholder-friendly framework that works through the cycles. All of our usual results and
outlook details can be found in today's published materials, but we're going to keep our prepared remarks
pretty short. Our main goal is to reinforce why ConocoPhillips offers an attractive way to invest in this
cyclical business. That's the key theme as we reflect on 2019 and we look forward to the future.

2019 capped off a successful 3-year period in which we transformed our business model and significantly
improve the underlying performance drivers across our entire business. Slide 3 summarizes those 2019
results that contributed to this transformation. In the financial column, we delivered strong earnings,
and we generated cash from operations of $11.7 billion, delivering free cash flow of over $5 billion. Our
balance sheet got stronger. We ended 2019 with over $8 billion of cash and short-term investments and
lowered our asset retirement obligation by almost 30%, largely due to dispositions. And our North Star
return on capital employed was 11%. We delivered on our volume projections for the year with roughly
5% underlying growth, including 22% growth from the Big 3 unconventionals. The rest of our portfolio
delivered strong base performance, and we progress new projects and exploration opportunities across our
regions.

Our world-class portfolio keeps getting better. As part of our high grading efforts, we generated over $3
billion of disposition proceeds, and we have another $2 billion of announced dispositions that we expect to
close in early 2020. But we're not just selling. We're also on the lookout for opportunities to add low cost
of supply resources to the portfolio, like we did last year in the Lower 48, Alaska and internationally. And
when reserves closed for the year, we replaced 117% of our production organically.

2019 was another outstanding year for delivering on our disciplined, shareholder-friendly strategy. We
returned 43% of our CFO to our shareholders. That's essentially all of our free cash flow. We paid $1.5
billion in dividends, including a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend, and we repurchased $3.5 billion

of shares. In today's announcement, you saw our board approved an increase of our existing repurchase
authorization by $10 billion to a total of $25 billion. This demonstrates our commitment to executing a
consistent long-term buyback program.

Finally, our execution focus goes beyond just the numbers. We continue to take leadership role in
environmental, social and governance matters through target setting, engagement, disclosure, advocacy
and stakeholder alignment. We call this performance with purpose, and it's an imperative. So 2019 is over,
and we're in the starting gates for a new year and a new decade. In November, we laid out a powerful
10-year plan that can deliver on all the elements we believe investors want from this sector: a disciplined
strategy framework, consistent execution, strong free cash flow and compelling returns of and returns on
capital. That's the path we set for ourselves in 2016. That's what we delivered in 2017, '18 and '19, and
that's what we're ready to do again in 2020. We're focused on executing a strategy that we believe is right
for the future of our industry and certainly right for ConocoPhillips and our investors.
So with that, let's go to your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I appreciate the opportunity for a lengthy Q&A session. So I've just got a couple, and then I'll let someone
else jump on. I guess, first of all, there's a number of headlines have been circulating for quite a while
now around Alaska tax, and that's obviously a little different from the last time you presented to us back
in November.

So I'm just wondering if you can offer your perspective as to how you think -- what you think is going on
there, how do you think that plays out, whether they get signatures and what the implications could be as
to how you respond to that.

And my second one is really on the production outlook for 2020. Obviously, the Malaysia pipeline issue
appears to be back on the table again. So I'm just wondering if you could walk us through the cadence of
how we should expect production to evolve through the year. I'll leave it there.

Michael D. Hatfield
President of Alaska, Canada & Europe

Yes. Thanks, Doug. This is Michael. I'll answer the first question about the Alaska tax. So you asked where
we are in this process. The division of elections in Alaska is currently certifying signatures now. They
were gathered as part of the initiative for this November ballot. We anticipate that the initiative will be
part of the ballot. So they're in the process of certifying those now. Now as we showed in November,
we're currently planning to invest about $25 billion of capital over the next 10 years in Alaska. These
investments will increase the state's production and mitigate the current decline through tax. In fact, in
2020 alone, our net capital and OpEx spend in Alaska is expected to be roughly $3.4 billion. On a gross
basis, in 2020, total industry capital and OpEx spend in Alaska is expected to be about $6 billion.

Now if there's a negative change in the fiscal regime, our investment plans will change. But we've been
in Alaska for over 40 years. We know Alaskans understand the industry. It's the lifeblood of the state's
economy. We believe Alaskans will understand that short-term revenue gain is a risky and fleeting
proposition if it comes at the cost of billions of dollars of investment over the coming years. We've had
ballot measure challenges over the past few years that would have negatively impacted our business
and Alaska's economy. After understanding the issues, Alaska voters have voted no on all of them. Now
we're part of an industry group that will provide information to voters about the benefits of the current
fiscal regime, the benefits that it has on jobs, investment, oil production and long-term revenue to the
state. So the bottom line is we're working hard to ensure Alaskans understand the significant benefits that
investment by this industry brings to the people and the state of Alaska under the current fiscal structure.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So as things stand right now, no change in your current plans, more of a wait-and-see-type situation?

Michael D. Hatfield
President of Alaska, Canada & Europe

That's correct. So in terms of our current plans, we're waiting to see. We're executing on our current
plans, but we are gearing up to help Alaskans understand our view of the benefits that the current fiscal
structure brings to the state and the people.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Okay. And on the production cadence?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Doug, this is Matt. The -- I can give you an update on that. The -- so the most significant update
in our production guidance, as you mentioned, was associated with the KBB production in Malaysia. As
you know, most of KBB's gas is sold through the third-party Sabah-Sarawak pipeline to the Malaysia LNG
plant and it's exported from that plant. So in normal operating conditions for 2020, we do anticipate about
20,000 barrels a day being exported through MLNG via the Sabah-Sarawak pipeline. But right at the
beginning of the year, there was a significant operational issue with the pipeline. So our expectation for
the year, given that we don't operate that, our expectation is that might not be repeated at all through the
year. So that's what we're assuming at the moment. Then we're hopeful that we may get access to some
domestic gas offtake. But the magnitude of that and how long it might last is uncertain. So that's the
vast majority of the adjustment to guidance. We also had some puts and takes across the business units.
And we also adjusted our expectation for timing of dispositions, but the new range of 1,230 to 1,270,
best guess at the moment of what we should expect for this year. And that's about a 4% growth on an
underlying basis.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Matt, I don't want to press the topic. But are there any particular dips in the quarterly cadence as
we go through the year?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Well, obviously, we have turnarounds as we go into the middle of the year. We have one in the first
quarter at Qatar, and then we have usual turnarounds in Alaska and elsewhere as we go through the
second and third quarter. So it's a similar profile to previous years.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.

Douglas Todd Terreson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So Ryan, you guys are one of the few, if not the only big oil or E&P with higher rather than lower
normalized returns on capital in recent years. And while your stock has been a top performer in S&P
Energy 3 years in a row for this reason, in my view, your cash position is building, it's strong. You have
better valuation in your equity than a lot of peers. And so you're basically better positioned than your
peers for strategic activity. At the same time, you guys outlined a pretty compelling multiyear investment
plan in November, which suggested that you can attain your returns profile even without meaningful
strategic action. So my question is, with the ongoing decline in upstream values that we've seen in
public and private E&P, one, have strategic actions become more appealing to you guys? Are they more
compelling? And what effect on return on capital employed is needed for you guys to move forward in this
area? So 2 questions.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Well, thanks, Doug. Yes, I think we believe we're on the right track with what we're doing in terms of what
you describe our return profile focused on shareholder distributions, focused on free cash flow generation
and a hyper focus on our return on capital employed. As I said, 2019 was 11%. That is our guiding North
Star as we think about how we're executing the business. We have built a little bit of cash on the balance
sheet. We believe we need it for the volatility we're experiencing in the marketplace. Just look at the
month of January alone; early in the month, I think people were thinking it was headed to $70 a barrel,
and now people are thinking it might be going to $40 a barrel. So that's the kind of volatility we see in this

business, and we're keeping a balance sheet so we can execute our consistent programs, pay our capital,
pay -- fund the dividend, pay our buybacks back to our shareholders. So we're executing that consistent
program. We believe in it, and that's what we set up to do. And that's what we described to everybody in
November that it's not just a 1- or a 2-year plan. This is a plan that's got a lot of legs and it can go on for
the next decade. We have the portfolio and the people to execute on that plan. Now we have been in the
bolt-on acquisition game. We've had some assets that I described in my opening remarks, and we keep
on the lookout for some of those kinds of opportunities. But we also, I think, laid out a pretty consistent
framework at our analyst meeting in November about how we think about those

[Audio Gap]

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

As a consequence of that, we've resumed our legal enforcement actions. Of course, we're not the only
creditor out there. It's a competitive marketplace. And so I think you'll understand that I can't go into any
details at all about what those enforcement actions entail. But as you saw from us in 2018, you can expect
us to vigorously pursue all legal remedies that we have available to us.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And we appreciate that. The follow-up question is just around some of the demand issues in Asia. And
I was hoping, Matt and Ryan, you could put into context how we should be thinking about some of that
demand weakness in the context of other demand checks that you've seen. And just how does it affect the
way you think about your business, if at all?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And Neil, you're talking about demand for oil as opposed to, say, LNG?

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Both would be interesting, actually.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Both. Yes. So we do see some -- I mean we're factoring in some demand loss in the first quarter of this
year. And that translates into some reduction in demand as we go through the course of the full year. I
think our estimate's still, as we look at the markets and look at the global economies, we're still projecting
something on the order of 1 million barrels a day of demand growth as we go through 2020. Now that's
probably down 100,000 barrels or 100,000 to 200,000 barrels a day because of the current issues that
we're facing with the coronavirus in China. So we do see some impact to that. It will flow through to the
storage side of the equation. So we'll see some building storage, we believe, in the U.S. and in the non-
OPEC countries around the world as well. So that will put, obviously, some pressure on prices. We see
inventory draws, though, coming later in the year. And we still see pretty good supply growth in terms of
total liquids coming out of the U.S. that probably eats up most of the demand growth that we see coming
from around.

So it's going to be another volatile year, and that's what we've been preaching for, for the last 3 to 4 years
because it's a well-supplied world and any small changes in demand or changes in what OPEC or others
might do for the supply side will create that volatility that we've seen in spades here in January as well.
We do see some weakness in the spot LNG market. It's had some pretty warm winters around the world.
So demand has been -- demand growth, we still see over the long term in the LNG markets, but we've
seen softness in the LNG side. And of course, you know how that lags in terms of how it manifests itself
in our cash flows for the company. So -- but we still are long-term belief in the growth in the LNG market
and still participating in that channel of the business.

Operator

Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

A couple of quick questions. First, just looking at the quarter, in the Lower 48, we saw some declines in
the oil production quarter-over-quarter, NGLs and gas were up, I presume that was mostly mix effects.
And the Big 3 was with Bakken and the Eagle Ford down. But just any thoughts you could share around
that as well as we look out to 2020 and your guidance for 410,000 barrels a day there. Just any color you
could provide around rig count and production cadence specifically for the Big 3?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Phil, it's Matt here. The -- yes, so I think you probably saw our numbers for the production
individually for the Big 3. In aggregate, it was relatively flat. There was a -- Eagle Ford was down a little
bit just because of the timing of framework we're bringing wells on, and there was growth in the Permian,
and the Permian production is a bit gassier than the Eagle Ford production. So that's why there was that
slight mix shift. In terms of the activity, the -- we averaged 12.5 rigs in the last year across the Big 3: 7
in Eagle Ford, 3 in Bakken and 2.5 in the Permian. And that was -- those were supported by 6 fractures.
You'll have seen in our capital that as we go into 2020, it's pretty much the same level of activity in
aggregate to the same capital cost for the Lower 48 last year.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. Second question for Don. The cash flows in the quarter looked a little bit light there. I think
there is another bucket that had some headwinds. If you could just elaborate what might have been in
that bucket? And just generally, how we think about cash flow for 2020, if there are any moving pieces
we should think about, whether it's distributions or other things. You already talked about PDVSA, but
anything else we should think about?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Phil, I can point to a few items that may help explain the cash flow in the quarter. The way we look
at it, we take our ratable guidance items along with the cash flow sensitivities that we publish. And if you
do that and nothing else, you come up with an estimate of about $2.9 billion CFO, and I think a lot of
analysts came in at a number similar to that, whereas our actual results were about $2.7 billion.

So to start, LNG realizations, we're about $100 million lower than what our sensitivities would have
predicted because we don't incorporate the 3-month lag to Brent pricing. Brent was up about $1 quarter-
on-quarter, but JCC fell $5. And so that's what's causing that impact. In addition to that, our adjustable
controllable costs for the year came in at $6.14 billion versus our guidance of $6.1 billion. So that's $40
million or about $0.03 a share on that, and that came through the SG&A. And the items on -- and you all
have noticed that SG&A was up quarter-on-quarter, and what drove that increase was basically 2 things
about equally split: the mark-to-market on compensation because of the good quarter that the stock
enjoyed in the fourth quarter; and the other was due to an accrual that was made related to employee-
based incentive compensation.

So those were kind of unusual items. And we also made a pension contribution to the U.S. qualified plan
that was probably about $50 million higher than what our typical quarterly run rate was. And so I think
if you look at those items -- and even though we don't -- we try to encourage people not to include the
PDVSA $90 million payment, we know that some do. And so that may have been a contributing factor for
some folks.

As far as 2020, I think we've been pretty clear about what our distribution plans are, $3 billion of
buybacks. Nothing has changed on that. Our dividend rate is what our dividend rate is, until we consider

9

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

adjusting it probably toward the end of the year. So that won't have much impact. As far as CFO, you've
got some new sensitivities that have been updated for 2020 in the appendix of the materials that we
published today. And I would say as far as a benchmark and expectation on CFO at, say, current prices,
around $50 WTI, we would expect about $8.5 billion to $9 billion of CFO.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Just one clarification. With the proceeds from distributions of $2 billion, I
assume that's gross. Is there a net amount that you might have for that?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

I don't know that I can provide you a net on that. I know our Australia headline -- Australia-West headline
number there is about $1.4 billion, and we would expect cash proceeds to be about $1.1 billion based on
our expectation of closing at the end of this quarter. And then Niobrara, the proceeds on that are going
to be close to $400,000 about $380,000. But I haven't seen the estimates on cash on that. But I would
expect it would be close to the proceeds. And then the remainder is just smaller assets that we'll do to
round off to the $2 billion.

Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I think that was probably the shortest management introduction I've been on a call in at least the last
several years, so congrats on that. A couple questions. A couple questions to follow-up on, one on Neil's
question about the demand issues in Asia and maybe more specifically on LNG there. There have been
some reports that some of the buyers in China made a clear force majeure, and that's kind of a just-in-
time market. So I get that if they're not getting offtake, they're going to run into other issues. So I was
curious, direct exposure to China as you think about it. And then the second question on the LNG front.
Just an update of where we are with the cutter expansion and everything.

William L. Bullock
President of Asia Pacific & Middle East

Roger, it's Bill Bullock. I'll take this one. First, we've heard similar concerns raised in the market about
force majeure into Asia. But to date, we haven't had any force majeure declarations. So we are continuing
to watch the market and see. If we do, we'll be addressing those with spot sales or domestic sales in the
market and managing appropriately. So nothing to date, but we have heard similar concerns.

With respect to Qatar, we continue to be very interested in Qatar. We continue to believe we're well
placed. Qatar is a great location with -- serves the global market with low-cost supply resources. And it's
a strategic location that works well for both Europe and Asia. We are still in the process. That process is
being managed by Qatar Petroleum, and they're in control of that pace, and we're moving along at pace
as they provide. Really can't say any more on that at this time. What I can say is that we're very hopeful
the opportunity is going to be a competitive cost of supply addition to our portfolio. And as we laid out in
November, it needs to be a competitive cost of supply to be an attractive addition. So that's kind of where
we're at for Qatar.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a quick follow-up. Is there any reason to think anything material has changed in the project since
kind of late last summer when it picked up and certainly the Analyst Day in November?

Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first question is on ROCE. It's 11%, very strong for 2019. And the 10-year plan calls for a 1% to 2%
improvement per year, assuming your $50 WTI with some inflation. So ROCE about 16% in 2025. So
in terms of what is contributing to this improvement, can you talk about the ROCE of the incremental
addition -- incremental production adds relative to what you're achieving today? So perhaps any color
you may have on the absolute ROCE of the Big 3 or maybe some future Alaska projects or any other
conventional projects?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Jeanine, this is Don. I'll address the ROCE question. So yes, at the Analyst Day in November, we
showed ROCE growing between 1% and 2% over the 10-year period. And that's being driven primarily
by production growth because we're working at $50 WTI real. So there's a little bit of contribution there.
But the other thing that I would point to is our capital efficiency. Our DD&A is actually very flat, while our
production is going up. So I would point to those 2 being the primary drivers behind the improvement.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And my second question, it's on Alaska, and I think exploration. In the event
that Alaska activity is either slowed or pushed further to the right for either regulatory reasons or
otherwise, can you talk about what other opportunities may move into the activity queue as a result? And
I'm guessing these are mainly exploration activities because we assume that the Big 3 in the Montney, all
of those are already optimized for your 10-year plan.

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Jeanine, are you referring to what we would do in Alaska or what we do elsewhere in the globe?

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Elsewhere in the globe.

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So this year, about half of our exploration capital is going into Alaska, the -- and half is going
elsewhere. So the primary areas outside our Norway exploration program that we discussed and Michael
discussed that at the November Analyst Day. We also have an exploration program going on in Malaysia,
in the shallow water shelf of Sarawak. And we have exploration activity going on in Argentina, both in
the south of the country and in the Vaca Muerta. Those are the primary new explorations activity outside
Alaska.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Chairman & CEO

I would add, Jeanine, that we set an allocation for exploration. And if we don't have the opportunity to
compete for the cost of supply that we set, we bring down that allocation. But today, we're spending the
$300 million on exploration that we've allocated to that channel.

Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I think first question maybe is for Matt. Matt, in Permian, the fourth quarter, we see a big jump
sequentially. Should we look at it just the normal lumpiness because of the well coming on stream? Or
that this is signaling a beginning of a accelerating development pace and that we should assume the
growth starting in this year will be accelerating campaign over the last couple of years?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Thanks, Paul. Yes, we did a very strong growth quarter-on-quarter in the Permian. It was about 23%
growth. But that is, as you sort of implied, there's real lumpiness as we bring on new pads there. So we
actually expect Permian to be relatively flat in the first quarter and then growth will resume again through
the rest of the year. We had an unusually lumpy fourth quarter production.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And Matt, when that you think that Permian would take on a more accelerated growth? And when that you
think you will have sufficient of the delineation and the infrastructure in place for that to happen?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes, so what we lead in November was we're running about 2.5 rig piece. We will build over the next few
years there about 6 rigs running in the Permian, but that will be a sort of measured growth rate as we get
the confidence, much like we did in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken and we're doing in the Montney. We
make sure that we're -- we get the right spacing and stacking and completion design. So we're still in a
bit of a learning mode there, and we'll ramp up the rigs to the optimum over the next 2, 3 years. So there
is significant growth coming in the Permian, but it will be a piece that's consistent with the piece of which
we're learning how to optimize the completion and spacing and stacking.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

The second question is for, I think, Ryan. Ryan, over the last 12 months, ESG all of a sudden become a
far more active topics among the investor, even for the North American investor, and we over the last
2 or 3 years, we have seen some of the international integrated oil companies [ lay off that ] and move
outside or making a lot of investment outside into oil and gas for the transitioning of the low carbon
fuel transitioning or low carbon world transitioning. From ConocoPhillips standpoint, I mean how do
you guys look at that and saying that with the transitioning in the low carbon world? Are you just going
to essentially stick to what you guys are doing in the oil and gas or that you were evaluating other
opportunities set to supplement that?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Paul, I guess, right now, we're focused on the E&P business. That's the kind of company we are, and
that's what we're doing. We have a strong record on ESG in terms of transparency, how we think about
that piece, how we manage the transition. We're focused on eliminating emissions from our operations.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

We've done that over 7 million tons over the last number of years. We're the only E&P company, I believe,
that has an emissions target that is out there for our business. So we're focused on doing that. When we
get the external recognition for our climate stance, how we think about our climate action report, how we
think about our sustainability report, and how we describe that, how -- what we're doing in our business
to make it a more sustainable oil and gas business. So yes, we're focused on being low cost of supply
and really taking care of our own business in terms of our emission footprint, and what we're doing in our
activities to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, flaring fugitive emissions, methane, all of the above.
That's what we're about. That's what we're trying to do, and that's how we're managing the -- this aspect
of the company.

Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.

Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

My first one is on Alaska from an op standpoint. As you continue helping to inform voters on the potential
ramifications of the ballot measure, can you just give us a reminder of what operations over 2020 we'll
focus on in Alaska? And then any color on learnings from ongoing appraisal would be helpful as well.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So as far as our base operations, we've got a big operation that we continue to execute both at
Kuparuk and at Alpine. As Matt mentioned, we've got some smaller turnarounds that we've got to execute
this year. We've also got the ERD rig that's going to be starting up in the second quarter in Alpine. So
we've got a lot -- and we've got a lot of drilling that's going on. Now in addition, you asked about our
exploration program, and we're in the middle of that now. So we've got 4 wells that we're going to drill at
Willow 4 appraisal wells and 1 flow test that we'll conduct. We spudded our first well at Willow at the end
of January. So that's going on now. In addition, we're going to drill 3 exploration wells at Harpoon, and we
expect to spud the first well towards the end of February. So we'll be running 2 rigs between the Willow
and Harpoon programs.

Now in addition, we have our Norwell opportunity that we spoke to you about in November where we had
drilled the production well, and we had tested that well and flowed it back through our central facilities.
We produced up to 4,500 barrels a day from that production well, and then that well was shut in as
we monitor the pressure buildup. Since that time, we've also drilled an injection well that reached TD
in early December. We flowed that well back to clean it up just recently, and we're quite encouraged
with those results. In fact, our peak flow back was around 2,500 barrels a day. That well is now being
prepared for an injection interference test with the producer that I mentioned we previously drilled. So
we're going to do an injection test and interference test to see how those 2 wells are talking to each other,
and that information is going to help us a lot as we optimize future development planning. So we're quite
encouraged with the results that we've seen in Norwell. So in short, we've got a big program that we're
executing across our assets in Alaska, including at the non-op asset in Prudhoe Bay.

Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

My second question is just a follow-up to the discussion on how you all look at inorganic adds and the
potential for those to come into the portfolio mix. As you look at potential opportunities, compare them
to the existing asset base, what would you say are the disconnects between what you think could fit and
what clearly doesn't? And are you seeing quality packages with just different parameters on valuation? Is
there a lack of availability of assets in areas where you look to potentially add exposure? And then lastly,
are there any key differences between the domestic and international A&D markets as you guys look at
the landscape today?

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Jeoffrey, I think I'll take that. This is Matt. Yes. You saw that last year we -- on the inorganic front, we did
about $300 million of inorganic additions in the Lower 48, Alaska and internationally. The -- and we've laid
out the -- Ryan alluded to this a bit earlier, we leave a sort of very clear guidelines, we hope and certainly
clear internally as to whether we take in order to make an inorganic addition to the portfolio attractive.
And we've said there has to have an all-in cost of supply, including the acquisition cost of below $50 a
barrel. And it has to have a development cost of below $40 a barrel to compete for capital. So we've been
very clear on the criteria we would have to achieve, it's the same criteria for larger scale corporate activity
and for our exploration program and for resource conversion within the portfolio. So as we look around the
portfolio, we can see some potential for incremental bolt-ons, much like we did last year, but we're not at
the stage of consummating any of those at the moment. But there are still opportunities out there that
could be attractive additions to the portfolio as we go through time as long as they meet those 2 criteria
that I mentioned a minute ago.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I think this one is for Don. Can you discuss with the KBB pipeline, Don, how does that impact the
financials? I mean what the -- on a relative basis, how does that generate the cash flow relative to, say,
the Conoco as a whole?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Scott, for 2020 and as Matt said, we're not counting on the resumption of that Sabah-Sarawak gas
pipeline. So the financial impact that we're estimating is about $90 million of cash flow and about $60
million on net income. And that's -- okay? And that's built into the sensitivities in our -- that we published
this morning.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. I appreciate that color. And turning really quickly back to Alaska again, how has the process or the
progress gone with evaluating a sell-down in 2020 on that asset, considering, obviously, the propositions
that are out there? Do you find it's going to be a little bit more challenging in front of the November ballot
to get something done?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Scott. So I'll take you back just for a second to November at the analyst meeting when we provided
our preliminary 2020 capital and production outlooks. And at that point, we reflected that we would
retain our current ownership level through this year, so through 2020. And at this point, we only plan
to sell down after the uncertainty related to the citizens initiative has been resolved. And after we fully
interpreted the results of our 2020 exploration and appraisal program and when we progress through
Willow through the concept select gate. So after we've satisfied those 3 criteria, that's when we plan to
execute this sell-down. So that pushes the sell-down most likely well into next year. We won't execute
a sell-down in a way that causes us to lose control of the investment pace. We're already confident that
there's multiple quality parties that are interested in these great assets. We would be open to an equal
value strategic transaction or a swap rather than cash, if that makes sense. So that's where we are in the
process. We're going to resolve some of these uncertainties, and then we'll approach the market.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

On Libya, is -- with the situation in Libya now, is production basically 0 at this point? And do you have any
thoughts on the outlook? And I know you don't guide for production in Libya. But what are you assuming
in terms of your cash flow? What production level are you assuming for your cash flow guidance?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So you're right, we don't guide for production in Libya. Our guidance is excluding Libya. Right
now because of the disruptions associated with this conflict, our Libya project company and the Libya
National Oil Company have declared force majeure. And so we're just in the process of tapering down our
production. We're not quite at 0 now but we expect to be fairly soon. So our hope is that these parties can
resolve this conflict, and we can restart operations soon. But right now, we're tapering down towards not
producing.

Joseph David Allman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

In terms of your cash flow guidance for this year, are you assuming that Libya is off-line for an extended
period? Are you assuming kind of flattish production from the fourth quarter level?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes, we're assuming that it will just be off-line then.

Joseph David Allman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And on the defined benefit contribution, my understanding is that it was around $100
million in the fourth quarter and that you're guiding for about $100 million each quarter through 2020. So
beyond 2020, should we assume the same kind of quarterly contribution? Or is this just kind of like a 5-
quarter catch up? And could you talk about sort of the cash impact?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Joe, this is Don. Let me address that. So in the fourth quarter, our contribution to the U.S. plan was,
I believe, close to $80 million. We probably rounded that up to $100 million. But we plan to continue
contributions at that pace for the next 3 quarters, so quarter 1, 2 and 3 in 2020. And so what's occurring
here is that we've implemented a liability management strategy that's intended to de-risk the pension
liability over time. So the contributions that we make this year are going to allow us to shift more of the
-- our assets from equities into fixed income. And that's how we're going to be de-risking the plan and
hopefully reduce contributions as we go forward. So after the third quarter, you should expect that our
contributions will reduce significantly and then, hopefully, depending on asset performance and interest
rates, continue to be quite small as we go into 2021 and beyond.

Operator

We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ellen.

Ellen R. DeSanctis
Senior Vice President of Corporate Relations
