Presentation

Operator

Good evening. My name is Missy, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to
welcome everyone to the DaVita Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]

Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.

Jim Gustafson
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. And welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued
interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me today are
Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; and Joel Ackerman, our CFO.

Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings
press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and any subsequent filings that we make with the SEC.

Our forward-looking statements are based upon the information currently available to us and we do not
intend and undertake no duty to update these statements except as may be required by law. Additionally,
we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A
reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in
our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.

I will now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon. We are excited to talk to you today about our strong Q2
performance, our 2021 financial outlook and recent developments on our efforts to transform Kidney Care.
First, let me start the conversation with a clinical highlight.

A kidney transplant is the best treatment option for eligible patients with kidney failure. DaVita has worked
hard over the years to help our patients gain access to transplant through education and direct support
for patients to get on and stay on the transplantation waitlist. The cumulative impact is meaningful. Last
December, we announced a milestone of 100,000 DaVita patients who have received a transplant since the
year 2000.

To further advance the cause of transplantation, DaVita and the National Kidney Foundation are
collaborating on a year-long pilot aimed at improving health equity in kidney transplantation with a focus
on living donors. Increasing living donor transplant expands access to transplantation by increasing the
availability of organs, which has been the limiting factor in the number of transplants performed annually.
This pilot provides high touch and customized information to patients and families seeking a kidney
transplantation from a living donor. We look forward to learning more from this pilot, improving the health
equity of kidney transplant and continuing to be the leader in supporting our patients to receive kidney
transplants.

Shifting to the latest update on COVID. We have made incredible progress in our efforts to combat the
COVID-19 pandemic over the past several months. New COVID infections among our patients continue
to drop significantly through the last week of June, down more than 95% from the peak in early January.
However, similar to the rest of the country, we have started to see an uptick over the last few weeks. As of
last week, on a rolling 7-day average basis, new infections are still down more than 90% from the peak.

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Thus far, our mortality continues to remain low on an absolute basis as we believe that our vaccinated
patients are more protected from severe cases of COVID. We continue to educate our patients about the
benefits of vaccine to reduce vaccine hesitancy and we remain confident in our policies and procedures
designed to keep our patients and our teammates safe while they're in our care.

Now let me turn to our financial performance in the second quarter. We delivered strong results in both
operating income and earnings per share. Our margins expanded as we continue to manage costs while
delivering quality care. As a result, we delivered 6% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income
and 35% year-over-year growth in our adjusted earnings per share. Our free cash flow was particularly
strong this quarter, and we continue to return cash to our shareholders through our stock buybacks. With
the first half of the year behind us, we are now increasing the midpoint of guidance for the full year.

Let me transition to update our progress in our Integrated Kidney Care efforts, otherwise known as IKC.
Value-based care for our patients with kidney disease is gaining momentum and appear to have reached
an inflection point. We have always believed that coordinating dialysis care with the broader health care
needs of CKD and ESKD patients could simultaneously improve outcomes and reduce total health care
costs.

For years, we've been participating in a variety of small programs and pilots to build our integrated care
capability and better understand the economics. We believe we are at that point now where we are ready
to shift to the next stage of the evolution of integrated care.

You might be wondering why now? The trend towards value-based care is not new either in Kidney Care
or other segments of health care. So what's changed to make the developments of scale business viable
today? There's a couple of reasons. First, with the growth of Medicare Advantage, payers are looking for
innovative ways to manage the increasing number of ESKD patients choosing MA plans. These patients
tend to be more complex than most MA patients and should benefit from tailored care management.

Second, CMS recently initiated the payment models in Kidney Care. We're preparing to partner with
nephrologists in up to 12 markets beginning in January of next year to participate in CKCC voluntary
programs. Our participation in CKCC model will also provide us with operational scale in more geographies
to enter into other value-based arrangements.

Lastly, we've increased our confidence in our capabilities to deliver clinical and economic value at scale and
have leaned in on our willingness to take risk. We believe we're well positioned to win in integrated care
because of our strong partnership with nephrologists, our regular and consistent interactions with patients,
a broad Kidney Care platform that spans various modalities of care settings and a clinical data set and
analytics that we use to create, develop clinical interventions to support our patient holistically.

We have a demonstrated track record of improving patient outcomes, coordinating care and lowering
costs for patients in risk arrangements. For example, in our ESCOs, we were able to generate non-dialysis
cost savings in the high single digits, which translated into more than double the average savings rates
compared to the rest of the industry over the life of the program. With our special needs plan, we have
been able to lower mortality by 23% relative to other patients within the same center and county.

To give you a better sense of the scale of the business, as of today, approximately 10% of our U.S. dialysis
patients are in value-based care arrangements in which DaVita is responsible for managing the total cost
of care. This represents almost $2 billion of annual medical costs under management. In addition, we have
various other forms of value-based care arrangements with payers in which we have economic incentives
for improving quality and lowering costs.

In 2022, we expect our Integrated Kidney Care business to double in size, both the number of patients
and risk arrangements and the dollars under management. We also expect to see a dramatic increase in
the number of CKD lives we have under risk in 2022.

To prepare for this growth, we are currently scaling up our clinical team and furthering building out our
support function. Because of the investment as well as the delays in cost savings impacts of our model of
care and revenue recognition, we expect to incur a net operating loss of $120 million in 2021 in our U.S.

ancillary segment. This outcome is consistent with the OI headwinds from IKC growth we called out at the
beginning of the year and is, of course, included in our full year guidance.

The doubling of the business next year could result in an incremental operating loss in our ancillary
segment of $50 million in 2022. We expect significant improvement in our financial performance beginning
in 2023 as we begin to recognize savings from the new contract that we entered in 2021 and 2022.

Over the 5-plus year horizon, we believe that our IKC business could become a sustainable driver of
significant operating income growth. Currently, we serve approximately 200,000 dialysis patients across
the country. We utilized over $12 billion in health care services outside of the dialysis facility, including the
cost of hospitalization, outpatient procedures and physician services. In addition, we see an opportunity
to manage the care of upstream CKD patients who currently do not dialyze in our centers. Assuming that
we are managing the total cost of care for more than half of our dialysis patients as well as other CKD
patients at low to single digit margin, we believe that this could be a meaningful financial opportunity.

In summary, all of health care has been talking about value-based for years. We are excited for DaVita to
lead the way. With that, I will turn the call over to Joel.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Javier. We had a strong quarter despite the continuing operational challenges presented by
COVID, primarily as a result of strong RPT performance and continued discipline on costs.

For the quarter, operating income was $490 million and earnings per share were $2.64. Our Q2 results
include a net COVID headwind of approximately $35 million, similar to what we saw in Q1. Primarily the
impact of excess mortality on volumes and elevated PPE costs, partially offset by sequestration relief and
reduced travel and meeting expenses.

Turning to volume. In Q2, treatments per day increased by 0.4% compared to Q1. Excess mortality
declined significantly in Q2 from approximately 3,000 in Q1 to fewer than 500 in Q2. At this point, we are
cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us, but we're closely monitoring the potential impact of the
Delta variant, especially within pockets of the country that have lower vaccination rates. Longer term, we
continue to believe that we will return to pre-pandemic treatment growth levels with an additional tailwind
from lower than normal mortality rates.

Our U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $6 this quarter, primarily due to
normal seasonal improvements from patients meeting their coinsurance and deductible obligations. We
also saw favorable changes in government rate and mix, including the continued growth in the percentage
of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Patient care costs and G&A expense per treatment in total
were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Our patient care costs decreased sequentially, primarily due
to reductions in labor costs. Our G&A increased slightly primarily due to charitable contributions and
increases in personnel costs.

As expected, our U.S. dialysis and lab DSOs decreased by approximately 6 days in Q2 versus Q1, primarily
due to collections on the temporary billing holds related to the winter storms in the first quarter. The
majority of the impact of the storms on DSO and cash flow will reverse in Q2, but we may see an ongoing
smaller benefit through the balance of the year.

During the second quarter, we generated a gain of approximately $9 million on one of our DaVita Venture
Group investments, which hit the other income line on our P&L. We have a small investment in Miromatrix
Medical that recently went public. The value of this investment at quarter end was $23 million. Going
forward, we will be market to market every quarter.

Now turning to some updates on the rest of this year and some initial thoughts on 2022. As Javier
mentioned, we are raising our guidance ranges for 2021 as follows: adjusted earnings per share of $8.80
to $9.40; adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion to $1.875 billion; and free cash flow of $1 billion
to $1.2 billion. Also, we now expect our 2021 effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita to be
between 24% and 26%, lower than the 26% to 28% range that we had communicated at the beginning of

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

the year. These new guidance ranges exclude the potential impact of a significant fourth COVID surge later
this year.

I'll call out 2 notable potential headwinds during the second half of the year. First is COVID. We continue to
expect the impact of excess mortality will be higher in the back half of the year than in the first half of the
year due to the compounding impact of mortality through 2021. We're also expecting an uptick on costs
related to testing, vaccinations and teammate support as a result of the Delta variants. As a result, we're
increasing the middle of the range of COVID impact for the full year to $170 million from $150 million.
That implies a $30 million headwind from COVID in the second half of the year compared to the first half
of the year. As a reminder, this is the middle of what is a wide range of possible impacts depending on the
impact of the Delta or other variants and any additional COVID mandate.

Second, we expect to experience losses in our U.S. ancillary segment of approximately $70 million in the
second half of the year compared to $50 million in the first half of the year. This incremental loss is due
primarily to new value-based care arrangements and start-up costs associated with the CKCC program
that launches in 2022.

Looking forward to 2022, we do not expect anything unusual among the primary drivers of the business,
including RPT, cost per treatment or capital expenditures. However, we expect pressure on OI growth from
the increased spend on growing our IKC business, the possibility of union activity in 2022 that we did not
face in 2021 and the first year of depreciation expense associated with our new clinical IT platform that we
have been developing for the past several years. We will provide more specific 2022 guidance on a future
earnings call.
Operator, let's open the lines for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Lead off here on the IKC that you're talking about that you disclosed in the script $2 billion of gross
revenues and seeing that double in 2022. Can you remind us how that flows through the P&L in both the
dialysis segments and in other ancillary services? When will you begin to disclose these revenues and
costs on the P&L if you can model it? And then in 5 years, where do you think this can go? Is that a $12
billion number you referenced in the script? And from a margin perspective after Year 1, you put a high
single-digit margin on the $2 billion for next year and then additional drag from the $2 billion in new
capitated arrangements?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Pito. I hope I got all that, but please jump in if I didn't catch it. So starting off, in terms of where
it is on the P&L, we've got a segment of our strategic initiatives, which breaks down between U.S. and
international. The U.S. component of strategic initiatives is an excellent proxy for our IKC P&L. We've
simplified what exists in that segment over the last few years as we've exited some of the strategic
initiatives. And other than a couple of small things, it's everything related to IKC through that line. So I
think as you think about both revenue and operating income, using the U.S. component of SIs as a proxy
for our IKC business is a really good way to look at it. So that's number one.

In terms of where this can go over time, look, there are a lot of questions around how many members
we can enroll here, what our savings rate can be, how much of that will ultimately capture. I think a
reasonably simple way to model it would be to start with something like 1/3 of our ESKD population in this
-- use a spend per patient especially if you're looking out a few years of $100,000 per patient and that will
give you a medical cost under management.

And then the question is what percent of medical costs under management do we think can turn into
OI? And I would say a reasonable number would be something in the low single digits, something
equivalent to what a typical MA plan would drive as margin. So 1%, 2%, 3%, maybe 4% in that range
as a percentage of medical cost under management, I think, is the right way to think about what the
potential for this is in the out years.

Sorry, Peter, I think you had a third question, which I didn't catch.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. So there's a few questions paired in there. I guess will you guys begin disclosing what those gross
revenues are as well the patients under management? Just help us model this going forward as well.

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So I don't think -- we're not going to disclose a number that we would call gross revenue. I think the
number that we will disclose would be what the revenue would be if we used gross revenue accounting,
which would be the medical cost under management. And we've seen this before. They're under DMG.
There were components of the business that were gross accounting and some were net, and we would
disclose medical costs under management or something like that, and that's the $2 billion number that we
-- that Javier talked about in the script.

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then a sort of quick follow-up here on just the treatment growth. Can you guys disclose the
number of patients you had at the end of 1Q and 2Q? I'm trying to understand what treatment growth is
in the back half of the year as the excess mortality and COVID hopefully is behind us. And if we assume it
remains at these current levels, is it fair to model treatment growth going positive in the fourth quarter?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So look, I think the right number to look at is not patients, but treatments per day. And the good
news, let me try and walk you through. First, the good news is treatments per day grew in Q2 over Q1.
And I think a sequential view of it will get you a better model than a year-over-year view. So sequentially,
treatments per day grew in Q2 over Q1 about 400 treatments per day. There's a bunch of things going on
in there. And so let me try and break it down for you.

First, the good news is the new-to-dialysis treatment starts remain strong. So the question that we've
gotten in the past about what has happened within the CKD population as a result of COVID, we continue
to see strong new-to-dialysis treatment -- admissions. So we don't feel any pressure there right now.

In terms of Q2 over Q1, Q2 did benefit from the storms in Q1. So you'll remember the storms in -- from
Uri led to lower treatment volume in Q1. And so the comparison in Q2 was a positive there. That said,
there are a few things weighing on the quarter. First, acute volumes are down, as you would expect, with
the pandemic getting better in Q2 over Q1. Second, excess mortality remained above normal. It was well
below what we saw in Q1. It came down from 3,000 approximately to less than 500, but it still remained
above normal. And finally, the mix of treatment days in Q2 was unfavorable. We do fewer treatments on
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturdays than we do on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays and that had about a 50
basis -- that was about a 50 basis point headwind in Q2 over Q1.

So just to summarize, the good news is we're back to a situation where treatments are growing quarter-
over-quarter. The new-to-dialysis admissions remain strong. That said, there continues to be a bit of noise
in the numbers.

Operator

Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to follow up on the value-based care. So to Pito's question, it would be great if you can give us
those numbers. And is that going to be just for the government programs? Or are you going to be able to
-- are you going to also put any kind of MA value-based contracting -- commercial value-based contracting
that you have in there that's above and beyond the dialysis side?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. That would include all of that, Justin. It would include MA, it would include traditional Medicare as well
as anything on the commercial side.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. So that number will be all profitability. I assume, does that include or exclude the spending on
dialysis? When you talk about a margin, are you talking about the $60,000 that's ex-dialysis? Are you
talking about the 90,000, 95,000 that includes dialysis when you gross up for the $2 billion?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

It includes the dialysis number. So the patient number would be more like 100,000 or 90,000, depending
on what time period.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Perfect. And in terms -- you mentioned on the call on the -- in the trend, the press release, I should say,
the -- that your payer mix changed a little bit to the positive. Can you talk a little bit about commercial
volume versus government?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Justin, the reality is there's not a lot to say. This is a bit of a numerator, denominator issue. You had more
mortality on the Medicare side. And the commercial side held strong as people really value their income
and their insurance. And so it's a lot more resilient than we anticipated. So that's the dynamic that we're
discussing here.

A couple of other things, Justin, while you were asking about the value-based care and how do we
calculate it with dialysis and non-dialysis. I think it's important to do the math you're doing. You subtract
the dialysis, and then you have to put in there that the payer/government have a participation in the
savings, the nephrologist then has a participation in the savings. And that's how you trickle down to the
percentage of the 1, 2 or 3 percentage roughly that Joel talked about.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And can you just give the -- can you help me with the commercial treatment growth in the quarter?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

I can tell you, commercial mix was up about 20 bps in Q2 over Q1.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. And then in terms of...

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

As a reminder, you don't get as much from that in COVID when your Medicare patients are passing away
as you would in a normal time.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then just last question on -- you mentioned 2022, I apologize if I missed this, but the tax
rate change for this year, do you expect that to continue in 2022? Or is this a reasonable new tax rate to
assume? Or should we go back to the original guidance and assume that's the tax rate for 2022?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

There's still a lot we don't know about how it will play out. I think it is reasonable to assume some, if not
all, of the benefit we're seeing this year will continue for another year, but not in perpetuity. So for 2022,
yes. 2023, I'd say no.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

All right. Great. I wanted to dig into this -- the investments that you're making around this value-based
care. I just want to make sure I had the numbers right. I think you said you said $120 million this year.
And then it sounded like you said $50 million. Did you say $50 million incremental, so like $170 million?
Or did you mean the $120 million goes to $50 million?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Incremental.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Incremental. Okay. Is there -- I guess, as we think about that number, is that a net number, if you start
to make a 2% margin on the value-based care, is that an offset to that? Or is that kind of inclusive of any
potential profitability?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

It's a net number.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Net number. Okay. And then it sounded like you were saying that the $120 million included the CKCC as
well. Is that true? And does that number -- I guess, just trying to think about the $120 million to $170
million and the roll off there. Is that all included?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So Kevin, the CKCC doesn't start until the beginning of 2022, but we will start investing in the back
half of the year in anticipation of that growth. So it's not -- it's expense that we are building in anticipation
of growth related to CKCC.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

9

Yes. Okay. And then as far as the sequential enrollment or treatment growth, I guess, to look like, of
course, it's a better way to look at is a lot of puts and takes into that number. I guess what -- once you
get back to normal, what should that number look like? I guess like 0.4%, I'm thinking that means 1.6%
annualized. Like what do you think when this all normalizes, what is the growth rate in volume? Is it a 2%
number? Is it a 3% number? What would it ultimately annualized to?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

I think at the end of the day, Kevin, one of the things is you heard from Joel, there's a lot of different
dynamics in interplay. For us, the positive is that we're seeing, let's call it, the new admits stabilized pre-
COVID. And so the best data we have right now is that we'll revert to the pre-COVID numbers. And so I
think that's the best assumption and we'll keep you posted if that changes.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

DAVITA INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Okay. And it sounds like you're not really seeing anything on the labor side. A number of companies are
complaining about labor pressure. I guess could you talk a little bit about what you're doing there? And
then it sounded like you talked about union issues, but I think you meant kind of ballot initiatives, right,
not actually labor costs but more ballot initiatives that might be a pressure next year?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. So let me grab a couple. We're not going to complain about the pressure, but it's absolutely there. It
is a very dynamic and competitive marketplace. We continue to invest in a differentiated workplace and
find that our teammates find great fulfillment in the purpose of the work that we do. That said, again, the
marketplace is quite dynamic. As it relates to the second question, yes, we were talking about the union
might come up with another ballot. And so we've now unfortunately, every other year, have had to deal
with it. We hope that they're a little more empathetic to the fact that we're in a pandemic and that it is not
a good use of the resources, but we just want to continue to talk about it so no one's surprise.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. Okay. And then last question. I guess as we think about the kind of growth in the value-based care
opportunity. Is what you're doing differentiated? Do you think that there's going to be share shifts as a
result of this? Are other smaller players or midsized players going to struggle to do what you're doing and
you're resting with the payers and so that you can actually see a volume lift from this? Or is this kind of
where the industry is going and your push into this is largely kind of the same so that you wouldn't expect
-- is this really more about the revenue and the margin than it is about gaining share?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

It's an interesting play. From our perspective, we believe that we're really well positioned. And of course,
there's a lot of dynamics on volume and mix, how a patient gets to us all the way from a patient choice to
a payer choice to physician. And so that dynamic has got a lot going on. Can the whole chain there really
see the value that we create?

I think that over time, the answer will be yes because the clinical outcomes will show it. And there'll be
transparency where people say, "Gosh, if I can live there longer, if I can get more transplant, if I can get
my CKD and not be hospitalized, I want to go there." But as you know, that takes time. And so from my
perspective, right now, I'm not assuming a change in sort of a shift in decision-making until this plays out
a bit more.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lisa Clive from Bernstein.

Elisabeth Decou Bedell Clive
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Apologies if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but what did you say your vaccination rate was for your
patients? And also what it is for your teammates? And second question, have you been giving third doses
for selected patients, given that the immunocompromise seem to not respond as well to the vaccines in
terms of the efficacy? And then lastly, are you still testing patients and teammates before every session?
And just wondering how that is going to evolve in the coming quarters.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

All right. Well, let me grab them and then if I miss any one of them, please come back at me. The patient
vaccinated complete with 2 doses is around 72% or so. Teammates is in the 68%. We're starting to
tracking those people that intend to get a vaccine, and we're tracking somewhere in the 1% or 2% that
are either thinking of getting in or in their first cycle. To my knowledge, there's nothing of significance in

the third dosage yet in our population. And so I know that the physician community is discussing it. So --
but I don't have any major numbers on that. And then what was your last question?

Elisabeth Decou Bedell Clive
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Just in terms of the testing.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

On the testing, we didn't test all the patients, I think that was in the assumed question. What we do is
we, of course, test anyone that has any symptoms. And then, of course, our patients get tested a lot
more because they're using so much health care that when they go to other physician offices or hospitals
or other things, they get tested. So they're disproportionately tested, but we just test when there's
symptoms.

Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Thanks for taking some follow-ups here. Let me go back to the IKC piece, as investors are a bit confused
on these disclosures. My understanding today is you collect $2 billion of sort of gross revenues. About half
of that is located in the dialysis costs and the other half are in medical costs -- or other medical costs. So
when you reference a 1% to 4% margin, that's on the full $2 billion? So should we think about instead as
a 2% to 8% margin on the $1 billion of non-dialysis costs?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Either way works. We've decided to standardize on the full cost, but it either way is perfectly a fine way to
do the math.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then let me actually hit one on patient care costs. There obviously was a lot of
vested concern around labor inflation sort of during 2Q. Obviously, your cost per treatment were down
sequentially driven by a number of areas. But as I think about sort of patient care costs over the next
couple of years, can you give us just some color on what can drive further efficiencies here, specifically
around center occupancy increasing and shifting home balances?

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Well, let me grab it. As it relates to the inflation, of course, we've been very good over time. If you do our
CAGR over the last 5 years or so, I believe we're right at 1% or so, slightly below. And so we view the
levers quite thoughtfully over time in there. We're managing in essence pharmaceuticals, we're managing
productivity and, of course, wage rate when there's other things like supplies and other miscellaneous
items, which we are very diligent on. So we don't think those dynamics will change much other than
during COVID. Of course, the PPE has gone up dramatically, and we hope that, that stabilizes over time.

As it relates to the wage inflation, we have nothing really particular to say about it. We are another player
in this really dynamic marketplace, and it feels like it's shifting quite aggressively right now. Is that a short
period or does that sustain itself? So I don't think I can comment on the multiyear. It is fair to say that
we are aggressively looking at all the pharmaceutical and all the options to make sure that our physicians
have the choice of their pharmaceutical, but at the best price possible. So I don't know if I got to all of
your questions.

I think the last part of it was around capacity utilization. And of course, we are watching it very
aggressively. We went from a time where we were very aggressive on the de novo build, too. As you can
see, we really tapered that back and we're building a lot more home centers, which are a lot more capital
efficient. We will keep that sort of balance in check because we know that patients need the interplay
between the home and the center. And so there needs to be that capacity available. And as we lost here,
roughly 5% of our patients during COVID, we are aggressively taking a look at our portfolio to make sure
that our patients have access and that we are not having centers that are not at the right capacity.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then sort of last follow-up question for you on the IKC, at least for now. Is it fair to think about
the operating income in the dialysis segment being unchanged as you increase your penetration with IKC
patients?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I think that's fair. We are trying to present this in a way that represents the fact that the business
is -- they're not independent and so far they are intricately -- they are linked. And that's why we think
and we're excited about our opportunity to win in IKC, but trying to present them as separate income
statements, if you will. So you can assess how is the core historical dialysis business doing and how is the
new IKC business doing.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And then last one here. Is it fair to think that kind of as you roll into sort of third quarter results that you'll
be able to give us additional disclosures in the press release around this sort of new segment or division?

Joel Ackerman
CFO & Treasurer

We're taking a careful look about what's the right level of disclosure as the IKC business grows and
making sure the shareholders have a good understanding of the economics of the business, the progress,
the investment, the spending, et cetera. So more to come on where we land on that.

Operator

There are no further questions in queue at this time.

Javier J. Rodriguez
CEO & Executive Director

Okay. Well, thank you, Missy. Let me make a couple of closing comments. Number one, our core business
is strong. Number two, we are entering an exciting and dynamic time with an opportunity to deliver a
lot of value for our patients by connecting and coordinating their care with payers, nephrologists and
providers. Point 3, the clinical and the economic prices are absolutely meaningful and like most value
prices, there is a lot to do to make the plan a reality. Point 4, if for whatever reason, we cannot accomplish
the desired outcomes, the economic risk is limited structurally because there are termination rights and
off-ramps.

So in summary, there's a big price with limited downside. So hopefully, that helps you think of how we're
thinking about -- sorry, that lets you understand a little of how we're thinking about it. We thank you for
your support. And we enter this new chapter together. Be well, everyone.

Operator
That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and thank you for joining.
