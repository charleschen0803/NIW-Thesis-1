Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AMETEK's First Quarter 2021
Earnings Call. Please note that today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President,
Investor Relations. Kevin, the floor is yours.

Kevin C. Coleman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Jay. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's First Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change
based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from
expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is
contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements.

Any references made on this call to 2020 or 2021 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after tax
acquisition-related intangible amortization and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in
the first quarter of 2020 and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020.

Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the
Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then
we'll open it up for your questions.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the first quarter
with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution, leading to earnings
above our expectations. We returned to organic sales growth earlier than expected, and as the economy
continues its recovery, we're experiencing strong orders growth resulting in a record backlog.

Operationally, our businesses are performing at a high level, delivering impressive margin expansion and
strong cash flows. Additionally, we started the year with a notable level of acquisition activity, deploying
a record $1.85 billion on 5 acquisitions thus far in 2021. These acquisitions, combined with our strong
first quarter results and solid orders momentum, led us to substantially increase our full year sales and
earnings guidance.

Before I get into the results for the quarter, I wanted to again thank all AMETEK colleagues for their
continued hard work and efforts over the last year as we managed through the pandemic. AMETEK's
success in navigating this difficult environment is a testament to the dedicated and highly talented
employees across the company. While we are encouraged with the acceleration of the vaccine rollout,
we remain focused on the health and well-being of our employees, and we'll remain vigilant in ensuring
proper safety protocols are being followed.

Now let me turn to the first quarter results. Overall sales in the quarter were up 1% versus the prior year
to $1.22 billion. Organic sales were up 1% with the divestiture of Reading Alloys being offset by a 2-
point foreign currency tailwind. Overall orders in the quarter were a record $1.4 billion, up 16% compared
to the same period last year, with organic orders up 9%. This led to a book-to-bill of 1.15 and a record

backlog of $2 billion. We are encouraged by the strong orders as many of our businesses are seeing
improved demand conditions across their markets, while some of our longer-cycle businesses have yet to
return to growth.

Operating income in the quarter was $293 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Operating
margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter was $356 million, up
4% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 29.2%. This outstanding operating performance led to
earnings of $1.07 per diluted share, up 5% versus the first quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range
of $0.97 to $1.02.

Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong, with operating cash flow up 5% to $284 million and free
cash flow conversion of 122% of net income.

Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group
and Electromechanical Group reported outstanding results in the first quarter, with both groups delivering
positive organic sales growth and impressive margin expansion. Sales for our Electronic Instruments
Group in the quarter were $791 million, up 2% over last year's first quarter, driven by modest organic
sales growth and a 1.5% foreign currency tailwind. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $207
million, up 7% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins expanded an impressive 110
basis points to 26.2%.

The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter with positive
organic sales growth driven by strong demand in our automation business. EMG's first quarter sales
were $425 million, down 1% versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, while the
divestiture of Reading Alloys was a 5-point headwind and foreign currency was a 2-point tailwind. EMG's
operating income was a record $105 million in the quarter, up 8% compared to the same quarter last year,
and EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 190 basis points to a record 24.7%.

Now turning to acquisitions. As we have discussed, acquisition activity slowed considerably in 2020 due to
the pandemic. During this time, we acted swiftly to appropriately align our cost structure with the demand
environment and to protect and further strengthen our balance sheet to support a meaningful return of
M&A in 2021. At the same time, we communicated that our business and acquisition teams remain very
active in managing our pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These actions positioned us to capitalize on an
improving acquisition environment in a significant manner, deploying $1.85 billion to acquire 5 excellent
businesses thus far this year.

Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on these deals. I'll start with AMETEK's largest
ever acquisition, Abaco Systems. Headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, Abaco is a leading provider
of mission-critical embedded computing systems used on key aerospace and defense platforms, along
with specialized industrial applications. Abaco's open architecture computing and electronic systems are
ruggedized to meet military standards and withstand harsh conditions, including extreme temperatures,
altitude and high vibration. As a leading provider of differentiated technology solutions serving attractive
high-growth applications, Abaco nicely complements and expands our existing aerospace and defense
platform. Abaco has approximately $325 million in annual sales, and we deployed $1.35 billion on the
acquisition.

Next, Magnetrol International. Based in Aurora, Illinois, Magnetrol is a leading provider of level and
flow control solutions for challenging process applications across a diverse set of end markets, including
medical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, food and beverage and general industrial markets. Magnetrol is
outstanding strategic fit with our sensors, test and calibration business. Combined, these businesses
form an industry-leading sensor platform with a broad range of level and flow measurement solutions.
Magnetrol has annual sales of approximately $100 million, and we deployed $230 million on the
acquisition.

Today, we announced the acquisition of NSI-MI Technologies, a leading provider of radiofrequency
and microwave test and measurement solutions based in Suwanee, Georgia. NSI-MI is an exciting
addition to our test and measurement platform given their deep expertise in advanced RF and microwave
technologies. Their highly differentiated test and measurement solutions are uniquely positioned to

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

support the continued development of advanced RF and microwave technologies for critical high-growth
applications, including 5G wireless communications, autonomous vehicles and specialized defense
systems. NSI-MI has annual sales of approximately $90 million, and we deployed $230 million on the
acquisition.

In addition to these acquisitions, AMETEK also acquired 2 smaller, yet highly strategic businesses in Crank
Software and EGS Automation. Crank Software, which is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, is a provider
of embedded graphical user interface software and services. Crank's award-winning Storyboard software
platform is ideally positioned to capitalize on the accelerating demand for smart, digitally enabled devices.

And EGS Automation is an attractive bolt-on acquisition for our Dunkermotoren business, expanding
our presence in the attractive automation market. Located near Dunker's German headquarters, EGS
designs and manufactures highly engineered and customized robotic solutions for niche medical, food and
beverage and general industrial markets.

We would like to welcome the Abaco, Magnetrol, NSI-MI, Crank Software and EGS teams to AMETEK,
and we look forward to working closely with them and supporting their continued growth. Combined,
these acquisitions add approximately $535 million in annual sales aligned with attractive secular growth
markets. Additionally, they provide AMETEK with excellent returns in line with our stated hurdle rates.
Each of these integrations is going very well in the early stages of our ownership. AMETEK's decentralized
operating structure and proven operating capability provides us the flexibility to successfully integrate the
businesses while continuing to pursue additional acquisitions.

We are still working through a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. And as Bill will discuss in
a moment, we have ample balance sheet capacity with approximately $1.8 billion available to support our
acquisition strategy.

In addition to continued capital deployment on acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in
our businesses. For all of 2021, we expect to invest approximately $95 million in incremental growth
investments. These investments are largely centered around our research and development and sales and
marketing functions, including targeted investments in support of our digital transformation strategy.

Our investments in RD&E continued to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, allowing us
to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. For all of 2021, we expect to spend
approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales on RD&E for our base businesses before adding in our recent
acquisitions. This level of spend is up 10% over last year's RD&E spend.

Now shifting to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the first quarter,
including solid orders growth and a record backlog, along with contributions from our recent acquisitions,
we have increased our full year sales and earnings guidance. For 2021, we now expect overall sales to
be up high teens on a percentage basis, while organic sales are expected to be up high single digits on a
percentage basis versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.48 to
$4.56, which is an increase of 13% to 15% over last year's comparable basis. This new range is a $0.28
midpoint increase from our previous adjusted earnings guidance of $4.18 to $4.30 per diluted share.

For the second quarter, overall sales are anticipated to be up in the low 30% range versus last year's
quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10,
up 29% to 31% over last year's second quarter. Our revised guidance includes each of the 5 completed
acquisitions.

To summarize, AMETEK delivered an excellent first quarter, with solid orders and sales growth, strong
margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and meaningful capital deployment. These outstanding
results speak to the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model along with the resilience of our
world-class workforce. With our differentiated technology solutions, serving a diverse set of niche end
markets aligned with attractive secular growth opportunities, we remain firmly positioned to deliver long-
term sustainable growth.

I will now turn it over to Bill, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be
glad to take your questions. Bill?

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

William Joseph Burke
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK began the year with outstanding results, highlighted by
strong sales and orders growth and a high quality of earnings. With that, I'll provide additional financial
highlights for the quarter.

First quarter general and administrative expenses were $18.6 million, up $3 million from the prior year,
largely due to the higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% in the
quarter. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be up approximately $12
million on a return of temporary costs, including compensation.

The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%, which was essentially in line with the adjusted
19.4% recorded in the same period last year. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be
between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically,
either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Our businesses continue to do an
outstanding job managing our working capital. For the quarter, operating working capital was 14.2%,
down 470 basis points from the 18.9% reported in the first quarter of 2020, just excellent work by our
teams on the working capital front.

Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $18 million. For the full year, we now expect capital
expenditures to be approximately $120 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter
was $65 million. For all of 2021, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300
million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $140 million or
$0.60 per diluted share.

As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash given our asset-light
business model and strong working capital management. In the first quarter, both operating cash flow
and free cash flow were up 5% over last year's first quarter to $284 million and $267 million, respectively.
Free cash flow conversion was very strong at 122% of net income in the quarter.

Total debt at quarter end was $2.35 billion, down from $2.41 billion at the end of 2020. Offsetting this
debt was cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-
EBITDA ratio was 1.7x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x.

As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we deployed
approximately $270 million on the acquisition of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS Automation.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisition of Abaco
Systems and NSI-MI, resulting in $1.85 billion in total capital deployed on strategic acquisitions thus far
this year.

Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced we entered into a 5-year, delayed draw
bank term loan for up to $800 million with existing lenders under our revolving credit facility. Proceeds
from the term loan will be used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility following the recent
acquisition activities and to provide capital to further support our acquisition growth strategy.

Following the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and net -- our net debt-to-
EBITDA ratio is expected to be 1.9x and 1.7x, respectively, at the end of the second quarter. We continue
to have excellent financial capacity with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to
support our growth initiatives.

To summarize, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter with high-quality results
that outpaced our expectations. We remain poised for significant growth in 2021 given our strong balance
sheet, outstanding cash flows and the efforts of our talented workforce. Kevin?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Dave, could you maybe parse out the $0.28 change in guidance for the year? How much of that is being
driven by a better-than-expected performance in the core business versus the M&A-driven accretion given
all the deals flow as of late?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, Matt, that's an excellent question, and it's really driven by a mix of different items. So we have the
stronger-than-expected organic growth that drove Q1 above our guide, and then we have an improved
guide for Q2. And both of those 2 together are about $0.10, $0.10 of the $0.28. Really, our second half is
unchanged on a core basis. It's too early to change that. So -- and then we have an additional $0.18 from
the deals. So the way to think about that is 10% (sic) [ $0.10 ] from the core business, $0.18 from the
deals, $0.28 in total.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Perfect. And then just in terms of price realization, maybe where you were at in Q1 and then where you
were at in terms of price/cost spread and what you expect for the balance of the year?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thanks, Matt. Very pleased with our pricing. It continues to offset inflation. We achieved a bit more than
1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation was a bit less than 1%. So we're maintaining a
positive spread between the 2, which is our intention. And when you look out for all of '21, we expect to
achieve slightly higher pricing than the 1.5%, with slightly higher inflation. So we see both our pricing and
inflation building a bit, and we'll strive to maintain a positive spread between price and inflation for the full
year.

And it's really, it's driven by the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio. We have
leadership positions in these markets around the globe and provide excellent value to our customers. So
when we get cost increases, more than likely we can pass them on.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Dave, I'd love to get some context of this, and I'm not sure I'm supposed to use the word, an M&A spree,
but it's just a logjam has been broken here. And maybe can you give us some context. Did the pricing
get reasonable? You probably had all these assets on your radar screen before we went into COVID, so
the lifting of COVID uncertainty certainly was a factor here. But just give us a context, because you don't
often see a volume of deals that look to be great fits, which is happening in such a short amount of time.

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Right. Right, it's a great question. And I'll try to give you an overlay of the way we think about it. We've
managed through many economic cycles and seeing the impact on M&A from the economic cycles. And
it was no surprise in this particular downturn, the deal activity dramatically slowed in 2020 and pent-up
demand would drive a quick recovery. We talked about that last year. So our focus in 2020 was to make
sure that we were well positioned for the rebound. And one of the ways we'll be well positioned is we
strengthen our balance sheet and we build up our cash balances during the worst of the pandemic, and we
exited the year with $1.2 billion in cash and a net debt to EBITDA of 0.9x.

Look, as we talked about last year, we also focused on expanding our pipeline of opportunities. And we
told you that our -- last year, we were busier than ever with pipeline development. And as you stated,
we've been working with these companies for over a year on these deals. And just through the first 4
months, the sellers wanted to sell the businesses like we thought and we have a dedicated team of people
that are working for them.

So we acquired 5 companies, deployed $1.85 billion in capital, and they're highly strategic, and we're
really excited for each of the companies we acquired. They fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy.
Each has strong differentiated technology positions. They allow us to expand in attractive growth
areas like embedded systems for Aerospace & Defense, testing for autonomous vehicles, 5G, satellite
communications, expanding our IoT capability, more capability in the Automation business, software for
embedded systems. So we're really happy with the set of companies that we acquired.

And importantly, each of these businesses are going to benefit from being part of AMETEK. We developed
a custom playbook for each of the businesses, and they're going to benefit from our global footprint to
help them accelerate the efficiencies. Importantly, for us, we were able to get the deals done. We're
meeting our traditional financial hurdles, which are return on invested capital of 10% and an IRR of 15%.
So these are important thresholds for us, and we want to ensure that we're providing level -- strong level
of returns on our capital deployed for shareholders.

And one of the benefits of AMETEK's distributed operating model is that we can handle a bunch of
acquisitions like this, to acquire and integrate multiple businesses while remaining active in acquiring other
businesses. There's a -- these are coming into different parts of AMETEK, and there's a senior AMETEK
leader responsible for the integration. And our pipeline of opportunities remains strong, and we have a
meaningful level of capacity, as Bill talked about, with strong cash flow.

So I hope we're talking to you before the end of the year about some other things. But we feel real good
about it. And it wasn't just it all happened at once, it's a lot of hard work over the course of the pandemic
and the course of greater than a year.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's really helpful. And you answered my question about the additional management capacity. Because I
can see you've got the capital to do more deals, and you did answer the question about the management
capacity. That was really helpful. And I may have missed this, but within the increased guidance, what is
the contribution -- earnings contribution from the deals?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. That was -- if you think about the $0.28 midpoint rise in our guidance, $0.18 is from the deals this
year and the other $0.10 is from the organic operations of the company.

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Dave, just to stick with the deals, I guess, here first. Abaco, I guess we're getting to the point now
where bolt-ons are starting to look a little bit less bolt-on and pretty large. Can you talk about maybe
the complexion of the pipeline or maybe your own appetite to kind of be in that range, maybe more
consistently going forward?

I think you've said yourself that needle-moving deals for AMETEK sort of have to get bigger over time.
Is that something that, as you look out over kind of the range of properties, that you think is possible,
achievable kind of consistent with the strategy here?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, good question. A few years ago, we let our investors know that we are expanding our deal pipeline
to include slightly bigger businesses. And we included businesses that will be in the $200 million to $400
million range, and we deploy $1 billion-plus capital on it. I mean Abaco is in that range. And we talked
about doing a deal like that every so often. That doesn't necessarily mean that's going to become our
core, but those businesses are still working in our pipeline. But there's still many businesses that are,
I'll call it, medium sized that are the $100 million deals, similar to NSI-MI and Magnetrol, probably most
businesses of that size. And then we also have some smaller deals that are really important strategically
to augment our internal growth.

So you're going to see a mix of deals of those sizes. I mean AMETEK is not going to buy a company our
size or buy a company half our size. We don't -- just don't think that you can create value like that. But
the size of the company now, I think those companies in the $200 million to $400 million revenue makes
sense, and you'll see those from us occasionally.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just pivoting over to the core business. It seems like order intake picked up
pretty nicely here. You talked about record backlog. I guess the perception out there or maybe the history
of AMETEK has been slightly longer cycle than maybe some of these book-and-turn only businesses and
orders that tend to develop along with a recovery, but not necessarily day 1. It seems like you've built up
a little bit of momentum here. Can you maybe talk about where is that backlog growth stemming from? Or
what out there fundamentally in the marketplace has maybe picked up a little quicker than you otherwise
would have expected?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Right. I'll first unpack the orders a bit. We've had 9% organic orders growth, and it was broad-based in
the company. And EIG organic orders was 10%, EMG organic orders was 8%. So it was good to see broad-
based orders. When you think about our portfolio, both EIG and EMG, we raised from mid-single digits to
high single digits. That's another indication of broad-based growth. I think that the overall company will
grow sales sequentially each quarter.

And when you look at our 4 market segments, Process improved high single digits, Power & Industrial
improved high single digits, Automation & Engineering improved high single digits, but the Aerospace &
Defense segment, we continued to expect low to mid-single digits. So defense -- with defense doing better
than commercial. So when you think about the entire business, it really is doing well. And I'd carve out the
2 long-cycle businesses. Oil and gas that, we think, will trend up in the second half of this year and the
commercial aerospace business, which will not trend up until 2023 maybe, 2022, 2023.

But the key point is we have properly sized that business for the current level of activity and any small
improvements along the way are going to be very profitable for us. So we look at it as really attractive.
We're going to have the long-cycle businesses kicking down the road, and we're already seeing the mid-
cycle pick up. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about the recovery.

Next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.

Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just sort of in line with that sort of the mid- and long-cycle businesses. Could you maybe talk about the
core operating leverage that you would expect to see this year based on some of the orders that are
coming in for you? Any color there?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, that's a good question. I mean we had excellent margin performance in the first quarter. Strong
margin improvements in both EIG and EMG, a strong execution, solid price inflation, excellent productivity.
We're going to see, for the year, core incrementals of 35%, and that includes bringing all the temporary
costs back into the business. And core operating margins will increase about 40 basis points.

So we'll grow margins. A key point, though, is the acquisitions are margin dilutive. So our reported
margins will be down a bit, and that's kind of what we do. We acquire businesses that are lower margin
than AMETEK, and over the course of a couple of years, 3 years, we bring them up to the AMETEK level.
And it's pretty hard to acquire businesses that are at the profitability level of AMETEK or at 29%, 30%
EBITDA. So -- and we have some room with all these businesses to improve profitability. So that's the way
I think about the -- the core operating leverage on the business will be positive. And then the reported
margins with the acquisitions will be margin dilutive.

Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then working capital, obviously, an impressive number at 14.2% of sales. Would we expect
that to maybe slip a little bit with the increase? Or is that sort of a sustainable level as you think about it?

William Joseph Burke
Executive VP & CFO

Allison, I would expect that -- we'd expect that to probably come back. We'd be adding some costs back to
the balance sheet. Particularly, as the sales grow, you're going to see some more receivables come on the
balance sheet. And we're going to be focused on making sure that we've got all the right inventory levels
in the business to support the growth and make sure we're good to go and can support our customers as
we move forward.

So I think we did really well in the first quarter. I think the -- while we did put receivables and inventories
back up on the balance sheet, our teams did a great job getting advanced payments from customers and
the like. So that was a good result, but I'd expect to see that trend up a bit over the course of the balance
of the year.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So I want to go back to deal flow because it's obviously -- by the way, congratulations on all the deals.
You source and buy a lot of private companies, family-held companies. And I've got to think there's going
to be an increased interest in selling businesses ahead of any cap gains tax rate changes and inheritance
tax changes. Are you seeing that yet? I mean are you seeing more interest in maybe pulling the trigger on
some disposals with these changes on the horizon?

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Yes, a little bit of that, Nigel. But I -- what I see is a lot of private owners, and there were some private
owners in this suite of businesses that we bought, they got through the pandemic and they're looking at
a world that's changed, and they're looking at someone larger to provide some stability and some capital
and some access to things that they didn't have access to.

So I think it's more the uncertainty in the macro environment, the uncertainty driven by the pandemic,
has certainly made private company owners more likely to consider the exit that they were maybe going
to do a couple of years from now. That's what I think is happening, and we're seeing a little bit of that.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That makes sense. And then EMG margins, moving notably higher. Pre-pandemic, we're sort of in
the high teens, maybe 20% range, and now we're moving into the mid-20s. Do you think that, that level
is sustainable? I understand Reading Alloys came out. But do you think mid-20s is sort of the range for
EMG from here?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

They were a record margin this quarter at 24.7% and up 190 basis points. And the margins have been
growing nicely for a period of time. And when you look at that part of the business and you dissect what
happened, the 2 very profitable parts of that business, the Automation -- our Automation business and
our Defense businesses, both are firing on all cylinders, and that drove the margins up. So it's really a mix
among businesses within the EMG Group that is driving the margins. And as long as those businesses stay
strong, I would expect the margins to be good.

Next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Rosenblatt Securities.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

So the -- what I think were about $50 million of temporary cost-outs last year. Bill, you touched on this a
little bit within SG&A. How do you see those layering in this year?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. I think it was $90 million actually, that was the temporary cost from last year. And we got the benefit
of $50 million into 2021 for the structural restructuring, Scott. But...

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. Sorry.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. But what I say is in the second half of the year, you're going to see those temporary costs come back
in. And a little bit came in, in the first quarter, a little more in the second quarter. But in the second half of
the year, you're going to have -- they're all back in. So that's how we've modeled the year and we look at
it.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

And I read your press release, I listened to your prepared remarks and really marry your people on supply
chain. And it's kind of like all the rage this quarter on conference calls and nothing from you guys. So
could you maybe give us sort of your view of what you're seeing, both internally and externally, things

that could maybe not happening in the first quarter but maybe could back up into you not -- again, not
internally about something, externally that could back up into you? And in fact, does that as a concern,
plus the add-backs of the costs, is that what's keeping the second half guidance in check?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

That's -- you're right on, Scott. I mean we -- the supply chain, there are certainly challenges in materials
and logistics right now. Specifically, the semiconductor shortages have our attention, and our supply chain
team are working this issue aggressively. Our guidance reflects all known risks. This is a serious issue and
one that will likely be with us for some period of time.

And we're managing this with our dedicated business unit supply chain personnel with an overlay of our
company-wide global sourcings. And they're an effective team, and we've done an effective job on it so
far. But it is a serious issue. Our guidance reflects the known risks, and we're confident we can deliver
it. But it really -- we just felt it was too early in the year to improve the second half earnings and sales
guidance because of that. We think it's a nice balance.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Makes sense. My last question is a question you've heard me ask before. I know you kind of went through
the 4 big segments on their organic. Could you also throw in your outlooks for those segments?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, sure. In Process, we talked about it. It was up mid-single digits in the quarter, and returned
to positive organic growth earlier than we expected. Our -- a little extra color there. Ultra Precision
Technologies and our Materials Analysis divisions really had good quarters, and they're seeing improving
demand across a broad set of end markets. They're in the research, semiconductor and industrial markets.

We're also seeing very strong growth in orders across our Process businesses. Organic quarters were up
low double digits, so a little bit higher than AMETEK's overall. And for the full year, we now expect those
organic sales for our Process businesses to be up high single digits versus the prior year. It was mid-single
digits in the original guide for the year, and we raised it to high single digits. So Process orders look good.
Process is doing very well in Asia. And certain divisions are starting to fire on all cylinders.

In our Aerospace & Defense business, our overall sales for A&D were down approximately 10% in the first
quarter, modestly ahead of our expectation. And really, there's a bifurcation going on there. The Defense
businesses remain robust with sales up low double digits on a percentage basis. Commercial Aerospace
are still feeling the effects of the pandemics. The year-on-year rates have declined or continuing to
improve, but in the first quarter, Commercial Aerospace sales were down approximately 25%. So for all
of '21, we -- like I said before, we haven't -- we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit organic sales
growth from our Aerospace & Defense business. We did not change the outlook on that segment as we did
the other 3.

Power & Industrial, overall sales were up slightly from the prior year's first quarter. Very strong orders,
up mid-teens on orders. We now expect organic sales for our Power & Industrial businesses to be up high
single digits, and we changed that from up mid-single digits in the first outlook for the year. And finally,
our Automation & Engineered Solutions, up modestly versus the prior year, where our organic sales were
up mid-single digits.

Overall sales were impacted by the divestiture of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of last year. Sales
across our Automation businesses, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, remain strong, and we're
seeing solid demand conditions across their international markets in Asia, and China, in particular. And
for all of 2021, we now expect Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses organic sales growth to be
up high single digits with stronger growth in our Automation businesses than our Engineered Solutions

single digits.

Next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Securities, Research Division

This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Qualitatively, do you think there was any pull forward or
precautionary orders there in the first quarter? And were those a bit of a tailwind for the 9% organic
orders growth you had in the quarter?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, good question. We have highly engineered products. So I don't think people are stocking them. But
certainly, in the current macro environment, people want to get their orders placed. Customers want to
get their orders placed to make sure they can get the products that they need. So we're seeing confident
customers concerned about the global supply chain and placing their orders earlier than expected.

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then the other question I have is on the trends by geography. I mean we've heard Europe has been
relatively slower. Interested in where you saw the largest inflection in your organic trends?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

All of the geographies showed improvements. The U.S. was down mid-single digits, improvements in
most areas, but the decline was driven by Commercial Aerospace and Oil and Gas. Really was the same
picture in Europe, where we were down mid-single digits with good improvement, but weaknesses in
Commercial Aero and Oil and Gas. And Asia was the star for us, broad-based strength, up mid-20s led by
our Automation business and our Process business.

Next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research.

Robert Cameron Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

My question, it's kind of a follow-up on the supply chain question that was asked earlier. I mean your
margin performance was quite good in the quarter on revenues that haven't come back yet. I'm
wondering how big, if any, you can quantify the supply chain drag? And maybe more importantly, do you
have a sense as to whether you've reached the kind of maximum disruption point in 1Q and 2Q? Are
things getting better? Or did folks pull out all the stocks in 1Q to get stuff done throughout the supply
chain and that leaves more risk out there? Just when can we sort of stop worrying about the issue?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. In Q1, we did an excellent job, and we didn't have any inability to ship because of supply chain. And
our teams are going to work on the full year. And there are certainly challenges, but we have a good
team working on them and they're going to solve them. I don't think we've seen the worst of it yet just
based on what's happening on semiconductors. I think the -- some of the logistics issues, we think, will
moderate during midyear, but the semiconductor shortages could continue into 2022.

And there are higher prices you're dealing with or issues with the global supply chain recovering from a
V-shape recovery. And we have a really good supply chain capability, we're dealing with it effectively. But

we're not immune to it. So we're doing our best to stay on top of it. In Q1, we didn't have any issues, and
our guidance reflects the known issues, and we're confident in our guidance.

Next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

My first question is just on the Defense business, continues to grow with these acquisitions. And it's been
an area that you've seen very strong growth. I'm just curious what that growth rate looks like over the
next 2 to 3 years. I know you're in a variety of platforms. And then also just if you can maybe parse out
U.S. versus international for Defense, specifically.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. Great question, Brett. I mean the first thing, Defense is about 12% of the sales of AMETEK. And
when we looked at Abaco, we wanted to make sure that -- we have a changing administration, we wanted
to make sure we will be able to grow through this. And if you look back at Abaco over the last 3 or 4
years, they grew about 16%. And that's very, very excellent. It's healthy. It's -- we feel that embedded
computing is among the most compelling growth opportunities in A&D to the substantial DoD focus
on modernization and upgrades of existing defense platforms, because there's a focus on processing-
intensive and data-intensive mission capabilities in the future.

We also got comfortable with -- they've amassed over $1 billion in design wins that underpin the
growth over the next several years. So that's all good. But we -- at the same time, we think they're well
positioned to offset any overall DoD funding headwinds because of those factors. And we modeled our
top line as a high single-digit grower versus the mid-teens in the recent past. So we think we've got a
conservative model there. The management team of the business is still driving to those higher growth
rates, but we modeled it conservatively.

And when you look at AMETEK's broader defense exposure beyond Abaco, right now, we're kind of in the
right areas. We -- there's a lot of electronics going in, and we're in cooling and heating electronics in terms
of the environmental controls, and it's been doing well for us. And we think this year, for 2021, outside of
Abaco, our core business will be up mid- to high single digits in the defense market. And we went into the
year saying mid-single digits, but we had a very strong first quarter. So we improved the defense business
to mid- to high single digits.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Great. And just back to M&A, Great to see the velocity deals pick back up. But given the potential tax
changes and the fact that interactions are improving here, is the $1.8 billion of available capital the
optimal range, but maybe you'd be comfortable flexing up even above that opportunistically as volumes
pick back up and the fact we're early in the recovery? Just curious on your flex-up capacity.

William Joseph Burke
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure. If you look at -- if we spent that $1.8 billion that we talked about, certainly there'd be more
capacity available. Our leverage would still only be below 2.5 at that point in time. So we'd have additional
room to flex up from there if the right deals came along. But -- so from a balance sheet capacity, that's
not an issue. And it's always, as we say, it's all about making sure that we have the management
capability to be able to bring in those deals effectively. And Dave touched on that earlier in his comments.

Yes. Our strategy is really not capacity constrained. Even at 2.5, we're well below our covenants. Our
strategy is constrained by finding good deals that are differentiated, that meet our requirements that we
can improve. So we're optimistic that we're going to be able to do that. And hopefully, we're talking to you
again later this year. And we have a good pipeline, but it's really finding those deals that we get confident
we can get a return. That's the key issue, Brett, not finding.

Next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So we touched on supply chain a couple of times, and you guys are doing a good job there. Just curious,
when you went through your diligence on all these deals, how did you get comfortable that you like
weren't bringing in potential problems? Like when I think about embedded computing and things like that,
how did you get comfortable that the supply chains and the requirements there of the new businesses are
things that you could pop into your existing framework and not stress it too much?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, that's a great question. And we obviously spend a lot of time on that. And based on our questions,
and Abaco in particular has -- they have all their -- they have committed order for their plan on 2021. So
we pushed it and they responded and it was an area of heavy focus on our diligence. You don't have full
access to the business, but it's understood by the Abaco team. They're very good. And I think that we're
well positioned to deal with the supply chain issues in that business.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And when I think about overall AMETEK now pro forma, I mean not to give you guys more work, but how
do we think about the segmentation structure? I mean we got 2 segments, they're getting pretty large.
Are they providing, in your opinion, like adequate transparency into the total company? Or maybe do you
have to think about a new structure?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, we're not thinking about a new structure. We got the 4 subsegments under the 2 reporting segments
externally. So we have EIG and EMG. EIG is about 2/3 of the size of the company, EMG is about 1/3. And
we provide insight in revenue disaggregation into Process, which is about 46% of the company pro forma,
Aerospace & Defense which was about 19% of the company pro forma, Power & Industrial, which is about
14% of the company, and Automation & Engineered Solutions is about 22%, and Power & Industrial is
14%, if I didn't say that. So we're comfortable with it, and we think this structure is going to let us go and
grow for the next few years.
