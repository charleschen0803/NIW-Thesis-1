Operator

Amy, you may begin.

Amy Wakeham
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Great. Thank you, everyone. Sorry for that. We were having a few audio issues. So we've redialed back
in. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's Second
Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy
of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor
Relations section of our corporate website later today.

Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results, our CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett
Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.

During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP
measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion
today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's
future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our
actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.

With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Great. Thanks, Amy, and I'll go a little faster in my prepared remarks. So we still have time for Q&A,
despite the phone difficulties. Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as
we review results for ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2020.

On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top-level financial results, some
business highlights from the quarter and a few key milestones. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who
will walk you through our financials in further detail.

Our team achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth across the portfolio, driven by superb
performance in the mask category, particularly in the U.S. market, with good performance across the 140

countries where we provide our solutions. We continue to take market share with our software solutions
that enable increased therapy adherence with resupply programs, providing support to those who need it
and with our innovative new products.

Customers are voting with their wallets and they are voting for ResMed. As the world's leading software-
driven medical device company, we are using digital health technology to transform the industry. We have
sold nearly 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market. And Air Solutions, our
cloud-based ecosystem, manages more than 12 million patients.

In the last 12 months, we have changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device
or complete ResMed mask system to help them breathe better and live better lives.

In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems, are helping to manage 90 million more
people outside the hospital. Digital health technology is an integrator across everything that ResMed does,
AirView, myAir, Propeller and a portfolio of other digital health solutions allow us to better engage with
our customers and partners, including patients, physicians, providers, payers and complete health care
systems.

We are investing in advanced analytics and expanding our capabilities in machine learning and machine
intelligence so that we can grow this digital health ecosystem at double digits on a volume basis. We will
grow from just over 100 million lives improved with our health care products and solutions as we ended
2019 to our ambitious forward-looking goal of improving 250 million lives in 2025.

We now have over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud, and we are analyzing
these data to derive actionable insights for the benefit of patients, physicians, providers and health care
systems. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our
competition. We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD, as well as in outside the
hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and health care systems save
money and to help achieve better management of chronic disease.

We believe that the future of health care is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today,
and that's where we are winning today. We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to
drive financial success as we provide market-leading value to customers.

Let's now briefly review our top-level financial results. We achieved another quarter of double-digit
revenue growth. We were up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio. This growth continues to be
well balanced across our domestic U.S. as well as our global product sales as well as from our Software as
a service businesses.

We continue to deliver operating leverage, with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year
and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21.

I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category, we
delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally, supported
by a strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies; as well as
by improving Europe, Asia and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device
category.

We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health-
related fleet upgrades. We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European
summer, and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021.

Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe, and we continue to benefit from strong
market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep
apnea.

Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter.
We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating
that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations.

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise
in the mid-teens.

Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20, continued their growth across global markets. The
success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent mask launches. We
have launched a steady rhythm of mask innovation over the past 15 months. We have just lapped the
successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter, and we will lap the launch of the N30, the N30i and
the P30i during the coming 12 months. The F30i was launched just over a week ago, combining the needs
for patients in the Freedom and the Minimalist mask segments.

With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient every
time. We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians
and home care providers and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, and that's the person who
suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved
customer needs. We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more
customized to each person's needs.

Through digital health technologies, such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement with our
therapy, so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep. We have well over
2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching
algorithms. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be
better managed by physicians, providers, payers and health care systems.

Our digital end-to-end solutions, combined with available 100% cloud connectivity as well as information
provided to patients on their own smartphones, are all leading to significant improvements in cost,
improvements in health care outcomes and improvements in quality of life. We believe cloud-based
software, combined with world-leading medical devices, can add value and improve both clinical outcomes
as well as the patient experience.

On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and
engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing. We have
commenced pilots in a handful of U.S. cities to improve awareness, identification and engagement with the
importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health.

Our philosophy is this: The more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night, and the
consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions.
At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business. Over
the longer-term and on a deeper level, this partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad
chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental
health and beyond.

I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care. There were nearly 400 million people suffering
from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, worldwide. We don't believe these people are well
served by global health care systems today, and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital
emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions.

We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end
solutions. Technology, such as our Propeller platform, helps how patients are communicated to, it helps
how they are encouraged in their medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual
person. We believe that technology, combined with world-leading medical equipment, can add substantial
value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience.

We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression. We will be there with
stage I and stage II COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy, managed by the
Propeller platform. We will be there with stage II and stage III COPD patients as they add portable oxygen
therapy to their care. We will also be there with stage III and stage IV COPD patients as they commence
noninvasive ventilation therapy and ultimately, life support ventilation therapy.

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health, COPD platform, helping the patient, helping
their caregivers and loved ones as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the
right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes.

Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to
commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and health care systems. The digital health
opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build, and we are making good
progress.

In December, Propeller was included as the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts first
formulary for digital health solutions. In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy
services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger and from Rite Aid. This was accessed directly from the
Propeller app via the My Pharmacy feature within that smartphone application. We will update you on the
milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as health care systems as we move forward
throughout 2020.

Finally, I'd like to focus on our Software-as-a-Service business. We continue to integrate and optimize
the out-of-hospital SaaS portfolio for long-term growth. We are focused on leveraging our competitive
advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions, focused on home
medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers.

Our SaaS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare
acquisition that we lapped during November. We estimate that the weighted average market growth rates
for these sectors we compete in is in the high single digits.

Excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SaaS portfolio
grew in line with market in Q2. Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long term.

As we reach the fourth anniversary of our Brightree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong

[Audio Gap]

in our home medical equipment, or HME, sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta. We just passed the 1-
year anniversary with our MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter, and we are increasing our investments in
our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis. This investment is focused on new module introduction for
our MatrixCare platform, so that we can ensure that we're able to grow and share skilled nursing facility as
well as home health hospice sectors as we move forward.

We are doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio, and
we have all the elements in place to do that. It took around 24 months to see strong, sustainable returns
from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree, we think we can meet or beat
that time line for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently
making.

Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as the new preferred partner for home health and
hospice software for Cerner's customers. It is early days in that partnership and things are going very
well. We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution.
Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team, with customers learning the benefits of our
MatrixCare, home health and hospice software. We are excited to drive growth from this partnership.

The rich interoperability between our 2 solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed customers
as well as their patients and residents.

I would like to take a moment to announce an exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in
the process of completing. Just this week, Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called
SnapWorx. SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and
workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply. The combination of Brightree's technology and live call
services with this SnapWorx's technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end
workflow automation.

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

For our HME customers, the combination of these 2 technologies, Brightree and SnapWorx will increase
patient adherence and increase operational efficiency. We expect the transaction to close very shortly. The
acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially,
however, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year
2021.

In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve software solutions across outside
the hospital health care sectors. We see a future where patients seamlessly transfer from HME to skilled
nursing facilities to home health providers to hospice providers and beyond with reduced costs and
increased efficiency, resulting in better system outcomes as well as a higher quality of life for the person in
out-of-hospital care.

Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. The first half of fiscal year 2020 was strong, and
we are well positioned to grow through the second half of fiscal 2020 and beyond. The continued success
of our mask and device portfolio, along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health
solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD and out-of-hospital software, gives us confidence in continued
growth as we move through the year. We have positioned ResMed for the long term as the global leader in
digital health, driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy.

We are focused on our triple aim: First, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall
health care system costs; and third, to improve quality of life for the ultimate customer, the patient.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett?

Brett A. Sandercock
Chief Financial Officer

Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter
of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter
was $736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue
increased by 14%.

Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis.

Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service
business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $408 million, an increase of 14%
over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $242 million, an increase of
5% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and
other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.

Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were
$204 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $204 million, an
increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. Revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were
$162 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of
6%.

Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $79 million, an increase of 8% over the
prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%.

Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased
by 16% over the prior year quarter. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was $87 million,
an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter.

During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures
adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustment
to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and acquisition-related expenses. We have
provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press
release.

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Note that this quarter, for GAAP reporting purposes, we are now reflecting the portion of amortization of
acquired intangibles attributable to developed technology in our cost of sales rather than being allocated
to operating expenses. We've made this change to align with the SEC disclosure guidance. This will mean
we will disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit measures going forward.

We have included a reconciliation of both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin in our press
release. Going forward, I will reference this non-GAAP metric, as I believe it is the best measure of our
underlying gross margin.

Our non-GAAP gross margin improved to 59.7% in the December quarter compared to 59.1% in the same
quarter last year. Compared to the prior year, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points.
This was predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially
offset by typical declines in average selling prices.

Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $171 million, an
increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 8%.
Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis.

SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 23.3% compared to 24.8% we reported in
the prior year quarter. Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account recent
acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the
remaining 2 quarters of fiscal year 2020.

R&D expenses for the quarter were $50 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or on a
constant currency basis, an increase of 18%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 4% on
a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 6.6% in the
prior year.

Looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to
be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020.

Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% over the
prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense
for the quarter was $14.1 million.

Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $218.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year
quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $176.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior
year quarter.

On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 10.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis,
our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.6%. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of
$20.3 million associated with the vesting of employee share-based compensation, in particular, the tax
deduction associated with the vesting of executive performance stock units in November.

Excluding the impact from this benefit, our GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.6% and our non-
GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.8%.

Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2020 will be in the
range of 19% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of
21% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.10.

Our diluted earnings per share were also favorably impacted by the tax benefit that I've just discussed.
Excluding the impact of this gain, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.07.

Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $69.9 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings,
partially offset by the timing of tax payments with $111 million in tax paid in our second quarter.
Additionally, we made the payment for our settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice of $40.6 million
this quarter.

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Capital expenditure for the quarter was $25.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December
quarter totaled $45.5 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $56.1 million.

We recorded equity losses of $6.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated
with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately $6 million of equity losses each quarter
for the balance of fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations.

Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. At December 31, we had
$1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.1 billion in net debt. Our total assets were $4.4 billion, and our balance
sheet remains strong with modest debt levels.

Finally, to recap, our top line revenue was strong this quarter, with growth across all major categories.
Gross margin expanded, and our operating costs remain well controlled. As a result, we are continuing
to drive operating leverage with Q2 non-GAAP operating profit up 21% year-on-year. We are focused
on driving operating results, integrating our SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our
strategic long-term opportunities.

And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.

Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.

Malgorzata Maria Kaczor
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Maybe the first one from me is on mask growth. Obviously, you guys continue to do very, very well from
that perspective. So as we look at the last maybe 12 to 18 months, can you give us a sense of the relative
impact of new product launches, especially in the white spaces, maybe that you weren't in before, the
resupply agreements that you kind of referenced a little bit at JPMorgan's, market growth and general
share taking?

And the idea is, as we look forward, how are the moving dynamics between those categories? And how do
you kind of adjust your strategy to keep performance high?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Yes, thanks for your question, Margaret. And as you noted, there's a number of factors contributing to
this very strong mask growth that we had, 16% constant currency on a global basis. And even taking
out some of the software just well up there in the mid-teens. You hit on pretty much all of them, there's
increased adherence that we're driving through our digital health solutions. When we're achieving 87%
adherence, when the doctor is using AirView and the patients using myAir and all the digital techs in play,
that drives up our mask growth.

Secondly, when there's resupply in patients have the opportunity if they want to, to participate in getting
a fresh mask as their old mask becomes used. And we are partnering with Brightree Connect and with
ResMed ReSupply to provide that. And the acquisition of SnapWorx will help.

And then thirdly, and really importantly, these last 15 months, the steady flow of 4 really exciting new
mask innovations. Interestingly, these mask innovations aren't to replace a previous product, but to go
after underserved or under met customer needs. And we call them Minimalist category and the Freedom
category, where people move through a different positions during sleep, front, left, right sleepers want
a Freedom a mask. And people who have some claustrophobia or want small lighter masks, go for the
Minimalist category. And the F30s that we just launched is right in the heart of both of those. So it's all of
the above contributing to this really strong growth.

We still think that the market growth rate is in the high single digits for masks. And we took really good
share during this December quarter. Our job and challenge is to keep driving all those things, resupply,
adherence and mask innovation, and we plan to do just that.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And just a follow-up on that, on the market share gains in masks. Are you winning new patients at a
higher market share clip, or you able to convert existing sleep apnea patients from competitors and
getting them to switch?

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Yes, Matthew, that's a really good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep
division to walk through that.

James R. Hollingshead
President of Sleep Business

Matthew, I'm down in Australia. So I hope you can all hear me as well.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I can hear you just fine.

James R. Hollingshead
President of Sleep Business

Yes, it's a combination of both. We feel very confident in our overall position with masks that -- we've
had so many masks launched. And as Mick referenced, we've had several mask launches in the last 15
months. All of them have been successful launches, and we now have a very wide portfolio. It's the widest
portfolio offering of masks on the market. So we continue to take new patient share across all 3 mask
categories. And I'm sure we're likely to also be getting competitors switching. And there's less market data
available on that dynamic, but we're very confident we're taking new patient share pretty successfully.

Your next question comes from the line of Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley.

Sean M. Laaman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My question relates to something you announced last quarter. I wonder if we could get bit of an update on
how this Novartis deal with Propeller, if there's any update there and how that might be tracking?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Thanks, Sean. Well, we don't talk in our core business or in our new software businesses about individual
customers or partners until things are public and moving along, but there was a public data last quarter
from our work with pilot trials with both GSK and Novartis in the Propeller area looking at inhaled
pharmaceutical medicines.

Look, the beauty of it -- as I sort of described in the opening remarks, the beauty of Propeller is it
provides an end-to-end platform to help us take care of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. And so Stage I/II, with Propeller we can take care of the patients, ensure they have the medicine
that their doctor prescribed for them, but also engage with that person because they're going to -- it's a
progressive disease, they're going to move from stage I to stage II and stage III and stage IV COPD.

And so our goal with Propeller is not just to have a partnership with pharma company A or B, but it's to
really create a platform where we help end-to-end management of a person as they move through disease
progression. And it helps us engage with that person to help them adhere to their therapy, whether that
therapy is a pharmaceutical inhaler, or that therapy is a portable oxygen concentrator or that therapy, as
they move forward is a noninvasive ventilator or a life support ventilator. And so that's our goal with these
partnerships.

As we hit milestones during 2020 on the pharma sale -- side, and as we hit milestones on the health care
system side, we'll give updates on that. But look, yes, we did talk to the MAGNIFY trial that we are still
enrolling patients for with Novartis. That's in its early days. So we'll give updates on the clinical data, but
also importantly, commercial partnerships as they move forward through 2020.

Your next question comes from the line of John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup.

John Deakin-Bell
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

My question just relates to the increase in the SG&A. Obviously, you've got fantastic leverage from that.
And I think we've talked about it previously, but the 2% underlying seems, I think, that's a record low
number for you? And just give us a sense perhaps of how that might look over the next 6 months and
maybe going forward? Or should it return back to the kind of mid-single digit levels?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

So I'll hand that to Brett Sandercock down in Sydney.

Brett A. Sandercock
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks. John, yes, it was low this quarter, and we did benefit certainly from much lower litigation-
related expenses this quarter relative to last year. So that did certainly moderate that growth rate.

In my guidance, I said I think we'll revert back to the range of 23% to 25% for the second half, which
would suggest that we will track higher in terms of growth rates for SG&A, at least in the back half, but
certainly helped by some reduction or significant reduction in litigation costs coming through this quarter
relative to last year. It was probably the single biggest driver, and that certainly moderated the growth
rate. And try to adjust for that in that kind of range that I've given as a percentage of revenue going
forward to be a better indicator, I think.

color on the underlying sleep and respiratory care business. So what the gross margin might have done ex
acquisition contribution and you usually provide an outlook for the rest of the fiscal year for gross margin
as well. Can you give us that -- some color there too?

Brett A. Sandercock
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, I think going forward, the second half, I think, broadly consistent with where we are, would
be an estimate on the gross margin. As you know, a lot of moving parts on that. So that would be our
expectation.

If you look at the acquisitions we did, MatrixCare coming halfway through the quarter. So fairly -- it's
kind of a fairly minimal impact this quarter. The big drivers of that year-on-year growth in expansion of
our gross margin around the product mix. And that's really being driven by that out-performance you're
seeing in mask growth. And that's typically higher margins, what you would see on devices. So that's the
biggest impact.

And then we're still seeing manufacturing efficiencies, some around logistics and so on as well. And they
continue to come through on gross margin. So they are the two 2 big drivers this quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Shane Storey from Wilson HTM Limited.

Shane A. Storey
Wilsons Advisory and Stockbroking Limited, Research Division

Just looking again back at the U.S. mask business, if I can, just from another angle. I mean you spoke
about the adherence and resupply. But have you measured the step-up in the number of masks per
patient per year, say, over the last 12 to 18 months? I mean the last reference point that I've got is maybe
a tick under 2 per patient per year. So any observations around that might be very useful?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Yes, Shane, thanks for your question. I think there's a whole portfolio of customers doing different
levels of resupply in different countries around the world. If you take the example of France, there's a
government-mandated requirement that you provide 2 masks -- 2 masks per patient per year. And it's
different in all the 140 countries.

You're focused on the U.S. growth, which was strong. And yes, the last public number we did talk about
that was 1.9 masks per patient per year. But look, over the 5,000 customers in the U.S., there's a broad
spectrum of adoption of Brightree ReSupply, Brightree Connect, ResMed ReSupply and technologies
like SnapWorx that we just acquired. And so there's a broad range, but Jim, do you want to -- Jim
Hollingshead, do you want to provide any further color as to what you'd want to share on mask resupply
metrics?

James R. Hollingshead
President of Sleep Business

Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Shane. I would just to add to what Mick, I'd just say a couple of things.
The first one is the trend -- we don't talk about that number publicly, obviously. But the trend in the U.S.
has been steadily -- slowly but steadily up over the last several years, and we attribute that both to -- to
the range of things Mick talked about earlier in the call.

So better adherence tools that we're providing on our platforms, better masks lead to better adherence
initially and therefore better long-term adherence and also the adoption of resupply platforms by our HME
customers. So the trend is slowly and steadily up. It's still well below Medicare and commercial payer
allowables. And so it's a good trend, and there's still a lot of opportunity.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wheen from Evans & Partners.

Steven David Wheen
Evans & Partners Pty. Ltd., Research Division

My question is just on your SaaS businesses and the growth rate there. I was wondering if you could
help us deconstruct that growth rate, particularly between MatrixCare and Brightree. And perhaps as
part of that to give us an update as to your understanding of how those businesses are performing since
they've been acquired, I guess, with reference to the EPS outlook that you provided at the time of the
acquisitions?

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Thanks for the question, Steve. That allows us to talk to our investment in SaaS. And in SaaS, this quarter
was 12% of our global revenue. And so it's a sector that we're calling out. And you'll see that in our
financials.

It's a very hyper-competitive sector. When you look at HME software, you look at skilled nursing facility
software and you look at home health and hospice software. So I'm going to be really hesitant to give
detailed market share and/or growth rates within each of those sectors. Look, what I said on the prepared
remarks is true that across -- if you look at ResMed's weighted average revenue across HME, skilled
nursing facility, home health and hospice as well as the others, private duty home care and life planned
communities, the weighted average market growth rate in those sectors is in that high single digits.

And during the December quarter, over that portfolio, we held share. We grew with the -- taking out the
acquisition benefit that gave us 37% growth, we grew in that high single digits on our weighted average
portfolio.

One thing I'll say is we've -- when we hit April here in 2020, we will have owned Brightree 4 years. And as
you guys remember, because you've followed the stock for a long time, the first 2 years with Brightree, we
were investing. We put some new management team, leaders in there. We brought in new CEO, new CTO
and some skill sets in R&D.

We're doing very similar things now in our MatrixCare journey. And so I'm not going to break it out in
detail, but qualitatively, I'll say that the investments that we put in those first 2 years into Brightree are
really starting to pay off. We've got new logos, new customers, new modules, and we're taking share and
that growth is picking up.

And at MatrixCare, we're making those investments today in more R&D, more management, skills and
capabilities and looking, obviously, back end synergies across our portfolio. So -- I think we can meet or
beat the timing of our Brightree investments and the strong and sustainable growth that we're now getting
out of that in our MatrixCare investments.

Yes, there's a little bit of that. I'll hand it to Brett to go through the financial details on that.

Brett A. Sandercock
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, Dave. Probably the bigger one there is the -- just through the software related to -- or the platform-
related to Propeller acquisition. So that's kind of -- that's probably the biggest single delta. There'd be a

Just obviously, looking at the current Coronavirus issue, and I think if we go way back to SARS, you made
sales of about $5 million of CPAP in bilevels into China. Just wondering if there's any flow-through effect to
yourself from the current Coronavirus?

Robert A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes. Thanks, Andrew. It's Rob Douglas speaking. It's a pretty dynamic situation going on at the moment
in China. And so tracking it is difficult, but we are tracking very closely. In terms of our China business, we
think, obviously, the hospital is going to be very busy on their respiratory. So there'll be a lot of focus on
that. We would expect to see increased demand for ventilators, whether it's of the same relative scale to
SARS or not, we don't know yet.

We're actually working hard on our local supply chain there. Remember, we've got a really good team
in China is building good ventilators in China for China. And so -- in fact, some of our team have been
working in some of these hospitals. And Jason Sun, our Head of China, said they're local heroes, who are
really staying on the ground there and helping look after patients in the face of this terrible disease. So a
-- I wouldn't be predicting exactly what the impact will be on an overall scale. There will be an offset as
well, likely the hospitals won't be looking at sleep patients for a while. So there maybe some impact to our
Sleep, in China. But it's unlikely all of that to be material.

Just one other point in terms of the overall business, we've mentioned many times. Our supply chain isn't
configured around China. Most of it's not in China, but there are some second and third tier suppliers in
there, and we are working closely with them at the moment. We wouldn't expect this to be a problem, but
we'll have to keep a close eye on them.

Your next question comes from the line of Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America.

Lyanne Harrison
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just to continue the discussion on the SaaS business and probably more specifically. Previously, we talked
about resupply expansion and that given you're over about 6 months in, can you share how the resupply
program outside of sleep apnea is tracking? And what your expectations are for the remainder of financial
year '20?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Thanks, Lyanne. Yes. So you're talking about our expansion of our resupply capabilities. We went into
some diabetic supplies and orthotics and urology products. And so those -- they're not a material part of
ResMed's overall business, but they were a good expansion of ResMed's capabilities to look after the HME
sector beyond just sleep apnea and CPAP supplies that we are very good at making sure that they work
through. And so it's not material to our overall business.

So I'm not going to break out the specifics, Lyanne, other than to say, they're going well, and customers
are adopting them. And I'd love them to become a material part of our overall business to be able to
break out like that. But it's early days, and it's a good strategic play of Brightree to sort of expand their
capability.

With workflow automization and, but it's a combination of live call and tech that we use on masks and
CPAP suppliers, it's the same technology used on diabetics and those other areas of HME. And so we're
just helping our customers grow their businesses and get appropriate resupply when customers are there
and requiring full authorization for it as well. So sorry, I can't get more specific than that, Lyanne.

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. Dave?

David B. Pendarvis
Chief Administrative Officer, Global General Counsel & Secretary

Yes, thanks, Gretel. We continue to be at the same place we were in the last quarter, and that is we're
awaiting along with everyone else in the industry what the results are, the competitive bids that are in. We
expect them at the end of the North American summer, so sometime around August or September, and
we'll know where the results are. We are pleased with the efforts that we made and others in the industry
made to educate bidders. So they understand the portfolio nature of the lead item pricing and the impact
of bidding on CPAP reimbursement on mask reimbursement. We're comfortable that we conduct business
with our customers now on a portfolio basis.

And however, reimbursement settles out in the Medicare space, we expect there will continue to be strong
demand for mask resupply. That will continue to be an important part of our customers' business, and
it will be an important part for patients' long-term adherence success. So we don't see any significant
changes in the trajectory going forward. But obviously, like with everyone else, we just have to wait and
see what the actual reimbursement amounts come out to be.

Your next question comes from the line of David Bailey from Macquarie.

David Bailey
Macquarie Research

Just from me, Brett, cash flow looked a bit weak this quarter. Just wondering if you could talk through
some of the moving parts there. You've called out the Department of Justice Litigation settlement. Just
talk us through what normalized tax cash payment would look like? And then also net interest on a cash
basis for the quarter would be great?

Brett A. Sandercock
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So yes, it was impacted by timing of tax payments as well. If you look at it underlying, excluding
those, I still think actually pretty strong on the cash flow front. Normalized, you'd probably -- you're
probably more like around the kind of $40 million a quarter. And I think going into Q3, it's going to be
more like that. So that just impacted for this quarter, expect Q3 and Q4 to be much better in terms of
cash flow performance.

Chris Cooper
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I just got a follow-up to one of the previous questions. So on competitive bidding. I know it's a bit early
to speculate on the particular outcome. I just guess I'm more interested in how you expect to manage
the discussion with the DME partners yourselves? Would you expect positive and negative changes to be
passed on to you one to one?

Or is there an outcome here where, I guess, you bear more of the downside than the upside, given there's
a possible outcome here where some category is going to increase and some would decrease? Just any
thoughts around how you're thinking about that would be helpful?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

So I'll hand that to David Pendarvis, because, if Jim, you want to add any color from the customer
perspective as well. But Dave, you first and then Jim.

David B. Pendarvis
Chief Administrative Officer, Global General Counsel & Secretary

Sure. I mean we already have ongoing discussions with our customers. We view them as good partners
with us, and we have robust discussions where they would like to get the best prices they can. And we
want to make sure that we serve them as best we can. That dynamic won't change with competitive
bidding or anything else. So we expect to continue to have good discussions with them.

The environment in the last 1.5 years and for the balance of FY -- balance calendar year '20 is that there's
been about a 2% increase each year in the Medicare reimbursement. And so that's obviously contributed
to a benign pricing environment that we've been experiencing for the last period of time.

But we didn't participate with our customers in their bidding. Obviously, they made their own decisions.
We're confident that the bidding process would be a more fair one this time, and we're hoping it will end
up with a process that will be able to be good for the overall industry. But in terms of individual customer
negotiations, Jim, you might want to comment on that.

James R. Hollingshead
President of Sleep Business

Thanks, Dave. I'll just add to that. I mean, I think that's very well put. We do have very good relationships
with our -- with all of our customers and with our key customers, and we'll work through it together. The
other thing I would just remind everybody is that Medicare fee-for-service is the minority part of the
market. So it's an important part of the market, but it's a small percentage of the market.

Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I just have, I guess, 1 more competitive bidding question. So with -- specifically with non-invasive
ventilation, that's the first time it's been included, I think. So could see a fairly steep decline. So can you
maybe comment on what you expect there? And then also, I don't know if you could quantify how much
of your sales are coming from non-invasive ventilation in the U.S. But just to help us understand what the
exposure is?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Dave and Jim, you have this.

David B. Pendarvis
Chief Administrative Officer, Global General Counsel & Secretary

Up again. So thanks, Mike. Noninvasive ventilation, obviously, is in 2 different categories. One, what we
would characterize as life support ventilation is the new category that's now going to be a competitive
bidding. Our AirCurve range, the bilevels have previously been in competitive bidding. So that's not
changing. It's more on the life support side.

And it is newly there, but there also have been reductions in that reimbursement over the past few years,
leading up to this. So it's not necessarily the case that you'll see the same kinds of reductions that you
saw in the round 2 kind of range previously for the sleep products.

Nevertheless, we think it's important that patients can benefit, particularly end-stage COPD patients
can benefit from these devices. They ought to get into the hands -- and that's -- of those patients and
it's certainly a device that requires a lot of service. A lot of people in the home making sure the device
is working appropriately. So you need to have a strong reimbursement for it. It's a smaller group of
customers who actually do this kind of business. And they're probably likely to be focused on what their
real cost of serving are.

So again, we're optimistic that our customers are sophisticated customers. They'll bid appropriately so
that they can make an adequate margin to be able to provide that service. That's really, particularly in this
area, very well needed. So we'll wait and see how it goes, but we don't break out specifically our sales of
life support anywhere in the U.S. or otherwise.

Michael Stephen Matson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just with SnapWorx, can you maybe just comment on what that brings to the table that
you didn't already have with Brightree?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Yes. So SnapWorx is a technology that adds to Brightree. There's some end-to-end capabilities that
SnapWorx has to partner with the HME. So it goes beyond just the live call and technology capability. They
have provided to a number of customers, an ability to further reach out the customers.

And we had observed this software that was partnering with our Brightree platform and performing really
well with those customers. And so we had a relationship with SnapWorx over the last 12, 24, 36 months,
and we've seen them really grow into a really good technology tuck-in and the Brightree team looked at
the technology from the team there in Nashville, Tennessee that created this tech and the entrepreneurs
that created it and we are really excited not only by what they're achieving in the market, which is better
adherence and better engagement with both the HME and really importantly with the end-user customer.

And what I bring it back -- which is the patient. What I bring it back to this, some data, some clinical data
that we presented from the 5.5 billion nights of data that show that as you increase adherence, and as

19

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

you engage with the patient and resupply, the 2 add to each other. And some data that we just released
last quarter shows that for every hour of sleep we reduced the total health care costs for inpatient by 8%.

So this is all tied together, right? So Brightree ReSupply, ResMed ReSupply and SnapWorx will increase
adherence, drive increased mask resupply, and that will also, through that increase adherence, lower the
costs of the total health care system by 8% and for every hour of sleep up to those 7 hours. And so I think
that combination is really powerful, of now Brightree plus SnapWorx.

Now it's early days. We're just literally going through the final sign-offs of this acquisition, but watch us
over the next 12, 24 months, and we'll give you updates, obviously, every quarter as to how well that
integration of that technology is going.

Your next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer.

Michael Joseph Ott
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

This is Mike Ott on for Suraj. We read recently that Fitbit is adding oxygen variation graph for select users
with an FDA submission for sleep apnea diagnosis somewhere in the near-term here. I'm just curious if
you see that as longer term, helping to increase the number of OSA patients treated?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And look, it's really interesting that tech companies are really getting
involved in the field of, I'd call it, health wellness and sleep wellness is a big part of that. Obviously, we
have our partnership with Verily, and they have the Google watch as part of their baseline study, and
they're doing some identification, I'd call it. You call it diagnosis, I call it, identification of potentially at-
risk people for sleep suffocation or sleep apnea. I think what Fitbit has is along those same lines and what
they're trying to do, and Fitbit is now part of the Google portfolio, I believe there's an acquisition in line
there.

It will probably add on to that capability of -- if you see desaturations in the oxygen, there's a higher
likelihood. There's other causes potentially of those desats but there's a higher likelihood of sleep apnea.
So I would call it more in the medical terms a screener that will then hopefully identify and engage a
person that maybe I have a sleep issue, maybe I have a breathing issue and indicate to them, they need
to get on to the true diagnostic pathway. And then we can sort of bring them into the identification,
engagement, enrollment, capability that we're trying to perform. But look, Jim, you run the global sleep
business, any further detail you think about some of these tech companies and the ability for them to
identify more patients?

James R. Hollingshead
President of Sleep Business

Sure. Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. I think it's an unreserved good, that companies like Fitbit are
putting in place technologies to help consumers understand how they're sleeping and whether they might
have a sleep disorder. And we know that there is 936 million people globally who suffer from sleep apnea
and the vast majority of them don't know it.

And forever in the industry, one of the bottlenecks has been driving awareness on the one hand and then
making objective screening and then diagnosis, on the other hand, easier. And so when companies like
Fitbit, there's a whole range of companies that are now doing something like that in the space. When they
decide to put that in consumers' hands, that's fantastic for us. And for those patients more importantly.

in the Sydney plant that does often focus on newer and more complex products, but we have full process
capability in both plants.

The fire season in Australia has been devastating however, it hasn't actually gone into the outskirts of

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

I'm sorry.

David B. Pendarvis
Chief Administrative Officer, Global General Counsel & Secretary

Let me just keep going here, just as to the bill. I mean we certainly support that bill. Again, we think it's
important that our customers receive the appropriate reimbursement and particularly in rural areas, it's
difficult to do that. So we certainly support 2771.

I think it's -- you may have noticed, there's a lot going on in Congress these days. So it's a little difficult
to get anything through. But there is an opportunity in the middle part of the year when I think some of
the Medicare extenders come up for renewal that there could be a push to get this along with some of the
other items, the industry supports in place. So we'll have to wait and see, but we certainly support that. At
a minimum, Congress indicating their support for the industry is positive.

RESMED INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Just following up on Saul's question actually. Just wondering if you're able to quantify the contribution
of those acquisitions to U.S. or Americas' mask and accessories revenues for the quarter, that would be
helpful?

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Yes, I said in the prepared -- thanks for the question, David. I said in the prepared remarks, it's the --
so if you take that sort of global mask growth rate of 16% and you take out Propeller software, you're
going to be in the mid-teens. So maybe 100 basis points or something on Global. And if you take the U.S.
growth, where all the -- pretty much most of the Propeller software, the U.S. growth on masks, was 19%
on a constant currency basis. If you take out Propeller and the software, you're about 200 basis points,
probably around 17% growth in the U.S. territory. So 16% becomes around 15% and 19% would become
around 17%.

David, I think that answers both of your questions. And thanks to everyone for spending an extra 8
minutes as we were 8 minutes delayed due to the phone lines there, but appreciate that all.

And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.

Michael J. Farrell
CEO & Director

Great. Thanks, Christine, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd also
like to take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for
their dedication and hard work. You produce these great numbers that we get to report. You help people
sleep better, you help people breathe better. You help people live better lives outside the hospital in 140
countries, which is pretty amazing.

Thanks for all that you do today and every day, and we'll talk to all of you again in around 90 days. Amy?

Amy Wakeham
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Great. Thank you all again for joining us today and to echo Mick, thanks for bearing with us through the
audio difficulties. If you do have any questions or additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
As previously mentioned, all the documents, along with the transcript and, hopefully, a clean replay of
today's call will be available on our website.

Christine, you can now close the call.
