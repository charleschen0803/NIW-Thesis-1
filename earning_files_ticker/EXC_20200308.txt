EXELON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to today's webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's webcast is being
recorded. [Operator Instructions]

It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate
Finance. The floor is yours.

Daniel L. Eggers
Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance

Thank you, Mary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings
conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer;
and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior
management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.

We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found
in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we
discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various
risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors
and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's
8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors, including uncertainties
surrounding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that may cause results to differ from management's
projections, forecasts and expectations.

Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP
measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings
release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.

I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everybody that's joined today. I'll first start off with the first quarter results.
We had a strong quarter even with one of the warmest winters we've seen in a long time. The GAAP basis
earned $0.60 per share. Non-GAAP basis earned $0.87 per share. Joe is going to cover all those details in
his remark.

We had very solid operations throughout the first quarter, first quartile outage frequency and duration and
record-setting nuclear refueling outages that I'll go into further as we continue.

Hearings and working groups in Illinois on Clean Energy legislation are -- which is very critical right now,
are meeting. The discussions going on. We still haven't determined how the legislature will get back into
session to resume work, but I think they all understand the priority of what needs to be done, not only
for energy, but the capital budgets and other issues in Illinois. So we'll work and continue to work on that
through May.

Our #1 focus throughout this pandemic has been focusing on the safety and well-being of our employees.
Our employees are on a mission. They know we're mission-critical and as many as possible working
remotely in supporting the critical infrastructure. We have approximately 17,000 people, employees and
another 8,000 contractors working remotely and being able to execute on their tasks without any faults.
So our frontline workers, the 17,000 frontline workers and the contractors that are maintaining the electric
gas system and the power plants. We're protecting with PPE, social distancing and prescreening. We have
not laid off or furloughed or reduced hours or pay as a result of the pandemic.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

We've done a couple of things. Employees diagnosed with COVID remain in pay status and no charge
to sick leave. Overall, we've had 102 employees have been diagnosed with COVID, plus 25 contractors.
82 of those total count have returned back to work. And so we're continuing to focus on the health
and safety and the well-being. We fully -- we give full pay to employees that are being quarantined. If
they've become in contact through our tracing mechanisms that we're providing at all of our facilities,
we quarantine them for the required amount of time, which allows us to keep not only them and their
families safe, but also other employees. We also expanded access to backup care for dependence. So
those frontline employees or supporting frontline employees that need to be in the workspace out in the
field do not have to worry about their children out of school or their elderly parents. So that's another
service we're providing to the employees to keep everybody focused on their own safety, the job one,
keeping the grid up and keeping the gas flowing and keeping the power plants running.

A big part -- on Slide 4 (sic) [ Slide 8 ], you'll see a big part of what we do, what we've always been doing
and what we will continue to do is support our customers and communities. As you know, and you've
heard, all the utilities suspended disconnects, waived new late fees, and we did reconnect or reach out to
customers that had been disconnected since the 1st of March and offered to reconnect those individuals
who had been disconnected. And this gives us the ability to -- for people that are laid off or people that
are in financially challenged times to have one of the most critical social and needed energy sources that
we can provide.

We also, at the Exelon Foundation and our companies, have contributed over more than $5.9 million to
relief organizations, ensuring food banks and other programs can be supported during this time of need,
and we'll continue to focus on that.

But at the core of everything, after safety in the community, is our operational excellence, which is even
more critical right now, keeping the lights on in this crisis, keeping the hospitals with power, health care
providers, grocery stores, medical food production facilities, you can see the list of the priorities that
are there. And we have to, as a company and an organization, continue to have reliable service, and
that is strong at the utilities. We've had spring storms already this year. We restored more than 350,000
customers across the service territories in late March and early April. We've been able to do that and test
ourselves on moving in resources and being able to adequately and safely shelter our employees, but
allow them to work safely in the field to restore the power.

On the power side, the nuclear group has completed 7 of 8 refueling outages, all better than planned.
There's 1 refueling outage left to go that we'll be closing up later in this month, a major rewind on
the Ginna station. But if you look at the majority of the plants, it's world-class -- it's been world-class
performance with the outages being performed between 16 and 18 days. If you look about these trying
times, we've only had 25 employees that have -- excuse me, 29 including contractors, 25 employees have
been infected with the COVID virus, and all but 4 have returned to work. So the work that we're doing
with PPE, social distancing and allowing the critical resources to come in and operate the facilities that are
needed has been very critical to us. And as I mentioned earlier, we've expanded our care to those families
that need extra resources. We've completed 26 maintenance outages at our power facilities readying for
summer readiness, and all done without issues.

So with that, that's the overall view of the operations and what we're focused on, and I'll turn it over to
Joe to go through the financial.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated
full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the
year.

Starting with Slide 10. We earned $0.60 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP
basis, which was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. We are particularly pleased with the
results considering we had one of the warmest winters on record. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic were
5 to 7 degrees higher than average in January through March, costing us $0.14 per share between Exelon

Generation and our non-decoupled utilities. This quarter was the most impacted by weather of any quarter
since the PHI merger.

Exelon Utilities delivered $0.55 per share net of holding company expenses. Our non-decoupled utilities,
PECO, Delmarva, Delaware and Atlantic City Electric, were impacted by the warm winter weather. Across
these territories, heating degree days were down 18% to 22% during the quarter. These impacts were
partially offset by O&M timing across the utility.

ExGen was also impacted by weather, earning $0.32 per share in the first quarter. The weather impact on
gross margin and unplanned outages at Salem and FitzPatrick were offset by favorable O&M and nuclear
decommissioning trust fund gains.

Turning to Slide 11. Efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders in our
states, have caused dramatic changes in electricity demand and the national economic outlook. Taking
into account the impact of COVID-19, unfavorable weather and lower ROEs at ComEd, we are revising our
2020 full year guidance range from $3 to $3.30 per share to $2.80 to $3.10 per share. While typically, we
would not change guidance so early in the year, we want to provide a complete picture of where we stand
at this point in the year and include our best estimates of the COVID-19 impact.

Let me start by saying that none of us has ever experienced anything like this before. The full impacts,
including the duration and structural changes to the economy continue to evolve. In developing our
revised guidance range, we looked at the load and economic data we were seeing in April, talked to our
customers about their expectations for the year and considered different economic outlooks. In Q2, we
expect commercial industrial load to decrease by 9% to 15% and residential load to increase by 4% to 7%
depending on the region. Over the remainder of the year, we expect commercial industrial unfavorability
and residential favorability to diminish as the economy recovers. We've taken a cautious view of the
world, and you can see the assumptions on this slide that underpin our new guidance range. We also
recognize that the situation is changing rapidly, so we show a number of sensitivities to our guidance on
the following pages so you can calibrate.

I also want to come back to a point on actions we are taking. We challenged the organization against the
current backdrop, identifying and pursuing initiatives across the company to lower our costs and improve
our profitability. These provide $250 million of offset to other pressures, which we reflect in this updated
forecast.

At the utilities, the $0.10 per share degradation from prior guidance can be split into a little over $0.05
for lower distribution ROEs at ComEd due to the drop in the 30-year treasury and a little less than $0.05
for the record mild first quarter weather. For COVID-19-related impacts, we expect to be able to offset the
impact of lower loads at our non-decoupled utilities through cost reductions and the assumption that our
regulators allow for timely recovery of expected bad -- higher bad debt.

At ExGen, the $0.10 per share degradation reflects $0.05 of drag from the very mild Q1 weather and
then $0.05 of COVID-19 impacts on load net of our cost and business initiatives. In addition to the O&M
savings, we remain focused on cash at ExGen and have lowered CapEx by $125 million in 2020. We expect
our earnings to be most impacted in the second quarter and have provided adjusted operating earnings
guidance of $0.35 to $0.45 per share.

Looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the utilities on Slide 12. As you can see, 70% of the Exelon Utilities
are decoupled, and the revenues are not subject to load fluctuations. The majority of volumes at our
nondecoupled utilities, PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware, are commercial industrial
customers. In the table at the bottom right, we provide sensitivities for load by customer class and
ComEd's distribution ROE for the remainder of the year. Each of our utilities is working with the regulators
on COVID-19 cost and bad debt recovery mechanisms where we do not have them. Atlantic City Electric
and ComEd have existing bad debt mechanisms -- recovery mechanisms that result in no earnings impact
with the cash being recovered in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

Last month, the PSCs in Maryland and DC issue orders to authorize a regulatory asset that tracks prudent
COVID-19-related costs incurred, which will allow for an assessment of recovery of incremental bad

debt or atypical costs related to the pandemic. We are currently engaged with our commissions and
stakeholders in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania regarding the potential recovery of costs. On Slide
27 of the appendix, we provide more detail on these efforts and current bad debt recovery mechanisms.

Turning to Slide 13, the impacts of the Constellation business are like those of a non-decoupled utility.
Constellation delivers around 210 terawatt hours annually of customer load through its wholesale and
retail channels. In retail, Constellation's 2019 customer breakdown was 90% commercial and industrial.
And of those customers, 70% of them were on fixed price contracts. When we look at volumes for the rest
of the year, and exclude index contracts, we have about 125 terawatt hours of normal annualized load
exposed to COVID-related demand destruction. For the last 9 months of the year, we assume Constellation
load is down 6% in total, with C&I down 9% and residential increasing 2%.

I know there have been questions about how constellation's fixed price load contracts are impacted by
COVID-19. So let me take a minute to explain. These fixed-price contracts assume that the customer will
use a certain amount of electricity and are impacted by fluctuations in customer usage in three ways: first,
margin; second, commodity value; and third, through collection of fixed price charges. We are seeing the
impacts of lower load on these in the current environment. When load is lower, Constellation loses the
original sales margin on those unconsumed megawatt hours. Customer contracts can become in and out of
the money over time. When a forward contract is signed, it assumes a price for electricity over the term of
the contract. If the power procured for the customer is at a higher price than the current market and then
the customer consumes less than forecasted, the generation must be sold into the open market at a lower
price, creating a gap in revenues. Finally, customers are billed for capacity and transmission charges that
are charged by the ISO. Although these are typically fixed charges, for many customers, we unitize them
over the expected quantity of electricity and collect them on a dollars-per-megawatt-hour basis. So when
the customer consumes less, we undercollect the fixed charge due to the ISO and are responsible for the
shortfall.

These fluctuations can be positive or negative to our bottom line. In a normal world where load
fluctuations are primarily driven by weather, the risk is priced in and assumed in the contract. That
assumption of risk could not have predicted the demand shocks and impacts that we're seeing due to the
pandemic.

In 2020, where C&I load is significantly displaced, we are seeing pressure on our gross margin, which is
reflected in our guidance. We also expect the drop in profits to be limited to the period in time that the
pandemic drives very wide differences in actual and assumed usage.

Looking to the future, the Constellation business will return to profitability levels similar to those under
normal conditions. And besides this highly unusual situation, having our load be primarily commercial
and industrial customers remains key to our strategy. First, C&I customer usage patterns align with our
baseload generation portfolio as C&I load is much more predictable and stable than residential load.
In normal circumstances, C&I customer load is less exposed to weather fluctuations due to its higher
load factors than residential customers. Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be
done with residential customers. Finally, across -- finally, although the gross margins may be higher on
residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are
higher than C&I.

You can see the impacts of weather and COVID-19 on our gross margin on Slide 14. In 2020, total gross
margin is down $300 million. $100 million is due to Q1 weather, which can be pretty evenly split between
lower volumes on our power and gas customer businesses. As a reminder, our gas business makes most
of its margin in the winter. We then are $200 million lower due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the balance
of the year. During the quarter, we expect -- we executed $100 million and $50 million in powered new
business and non-powered new business, respectively. In 2021, total gross margin's down $100 million,
primarily due to lower power prices in PJM in New York as well as some modest carryover of COVID-19-
related drag on the load business. Since the end of the quarter, we have seen power prices rebound to
levels above the start of the year, recovering most of the gross margin decline. We also executed $50
million of powered and non-powered new business during the quarter.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

We remain behind our ratable hedging program in both 2020 and '21. We ended the quarter slightly more
behind ratable in '20 than at year-end at 8% to 11% due to the reduction in load offsetting hedges made
during the quarter. 2021 is 2% to 5% behind ratable. We continue to see some upside in certain markets
but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility.

Slide 15 provides our 2020 projected sources and uses of cash. Our free cash flow is down $775 million
from our last disclosure. The utilities cash flow accounts for $600 million of the degradation, largely due
to timing of accounts receivable and bad debt, which we expect to reverse. ExGen's free cash flow is down
$100 million, reflecting the gross margin decline, but is mitigated by cost reductions and lower CapEx.

Our liquidity position is strong. As you know, in March, there were significant disruptions in the commercial
paper markets, and we temporarily drew down $1.5 billion on ExGen's $5.3 billion credit facility, which
we repaid in early April. Given the uncertainty in that market and a $900 million June holding company
refinancing, we issued $2 billion in April at Corporate, which gives us additional flexibility. We are confident
that we have ample liquidity to meet our needs.

We also remain committed to strong investment-grade credit ratings. Our FFO to debt is projected to fall
to 18% and is below our 19% to 21% target, which reflects the combination of lower FFO and higher debt
in 2020 due to the pressures I've previously disclosed. We expect to see improvement in our FFO in 2021,
as some of the cash timing issues at the utilities resolve next year and the impacts from COVID unwind.
If they were to persist, we have levers we can take to enhance our credit profile. We talked to the rating
agencies and their understanding of the current market environment.

I'll now turn the call back to Chris.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Joe. The pandemic has brought unexpected challenges to our business in 2020. We have found
ways to offset much of the financial impact of this unique challenge, but we're not done. We'll continue
to look for ways we can increase profitability and cash flow through the next 3 quarters. The impact on
the COVID-19 does not change the fact that Exelon's fundamental business is strong and our strategy
remains strong. Our utility rate base is growing over 7% annually for the next 4 years. In that time, we
will add more than $13 billion in rate base, nearly equivalent to adding a utility the size of ComEd. Our
utility operations are best-in-class. First quartile -- first quarter performance in reliability and customer
satisfaction are continuing the solid performance for the rest of the year. Constellation is a premier
integrator in their competitive platform. It's the most effective way to bring our generation to market
while providing customizable solutions to fit the needs of customers. Our generation fleet is the cleanest
in the nation. We are delivering 1 out of every 9 megawatts of clean energy in a significant portion of the
nation's clean energy. We continue to advocate for policies that will compensate our nuclear fleet for the
essential role it plays in reducing carbon and air pollution and ensure their continued operations.

If you look at our value proposition on Slide 18, I'll close with this. The value proposition is unchanged.
We're focused on our growth of our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% EPS growth
through 2023. We're confident in our rate base growth and the continued needs for these investments
for the customers that we serve. But we're also mindful of the impact that the current 30-year treasury
rate has on ComEd's distribution ROE and the impact on EPS and growth rates if that rate was to stay
this low. We will use the free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down ExGen debt and
support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of the Genco business by seeking
fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, monetizing assets
and maximizing their value through Constellation. We will sustain strong investment-grade credit rating
metrics throughout this period.
Operator, we can now open it up for questions. Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to just first talk to -- well, thanks for the thorough update and disclosure, very helpful. The
Illinois legislative process, we're trying to follow this as closely as we can. I guess the Illinois Department
of Public Health gave some guidance around sort of how the legislature might be able to -- under what
circumstance they could reconvene. Do you have a sense for sort of the process and sort of the potential
for the legislative session to go through the summer, just given the formal ending date in May, obviously,
does not coincide very well with the state's plan to sort of reopen. But it does look like there's some
potential that the legislature may be able to meet if they meet sort of these health department guidelines.
What is your sense in terms of the ability of the legislature to meet and do business?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

We have seen in other jurisdictions, legislative bodies be able to work through and convene. Kathleen, do
you want to talk specifically to the path forward here in Illinois?

Kathleen L. Barron
Senior Vice President of Governmental & Regulatory Affairs & Public Policy

Sure. And as you know, the stay-at-home order does extend through the end of May. So it is a good sign
to see the Department of Public Health guidance to the legislature on how they might bring people back to
the capital safely. That is good progress, but it just remains to be seen whether the leaders will decide to
bring folks back to Springfield this session. Even if they cannot come back in May, they can come back in
the summer by agreement of the Senate President and the Speaker. They could call a session after May 31
or the Governor himself could call a special session under the constitution. So we're glad to see that there
has been guidance provided. There's just not yet any indication about when exactly they will come back.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. A lot of uncertainties there. And then just, I guess, in a related matter, in terms of operational
decisions for your nuclear plants in Illinois, Chris, you had mentioned a lot of refueling has been completed
and quite quickly as well. But are there any operational considerations you all would have to make? For
example, if legislation is not passed in this, call it, summer session? Or do you have some flexibility
so that you can give the legislature a bit of time just given, obviously, they have a lot on their plate to
address in Illinois?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's tough to speculate with everything going on with the COVID, what the outcome of this legislative
session or being able to go into an extended session. What we've stressed to all the stakeholders is PJM
is committed to run the auctions, and their stated time was towards the end of the year. And that could
be extended. We haven't got any public statement that it was extended that I know of. So we're up
against a clock. And once those auctions are run, we're highly confident that minimal or any of our clean
megawatts will compare in that capacity auction, they'll be replaced by fossil units, which is detrimental to
the state's goal of being 100% clean by 2030. So the clock is ticking, and I wouldn't speculate on timing
of decisions right now, but we're just stressing the importance to the administration and the key legislative
stakeholders and others about not only the importance for the nuclear megawatts, but the importance
for the renewable megawatts that have been invested in, in the state of Illinois to continue to be able to

operate with a profitability that's reasonable. So that's where we're at right now. We're continuing the
dialogue. Kathleen, Bill Von Hoene are leading the conversations through the state legislators and the
stakeholders and we'll continue to push on that.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research, LLC.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just wanted to, I guess, just get a little more color on the comments on the 6% to 8% utility growth rate,
and you mentioned you'd be mindful, I think, you said of the Illinois ROE. And just can you maybe give a
little more color on how to think about -- it's obvious what you're embedding now for 2020, but how about
for the kind of broader growth rate? And if rates don't get better, are you still within that range? Or just
what you've been assuming in there?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We have continued to work our 5-year plan. I think we report out in some places a 4-year plan.
Another is a 5-year plan, but we're continuing on our long-range plan. And it has helped us significantly in
customer satisfaction and reliability. And it's also allowed us to maintain cash flow and profitability while
doing so. In the last 3 rate cases, we actually gave a rate reduction.

So as you can imagine, as you would expect, we look at multiple scenarios. And if the economy continues
to degrade, impact on customers, whatever it could be is out in the future, the plans can be adjusted.
But at this time, we don't plan on adjusting. We plan on continuing to do the much-needed reliability and
efficiency modifications and prepare the system for the onset of much more distributed and renewable
energy coming on. It won't be able to happen if we don't make the investments and facilitate it. If we see
a day that we're not getting that return or don't see a path to go back, I mean, we haven't seen that day,
and we haven't seen that in the near future. So we're continuing on with the investment and watching the
treasuries and watching the recovery mechanisms.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. So -- but just to clarify, the -- if we're in this kind of lower rate environment, I don't know exactly
where the whole forward curve of 30-year is, you're still expected to be within the 6% to 8% range?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Go ahead, Joe.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Steve, we're not changing the target of the 6% to 8%. As Chris said, we're moving forward with the
investment that we plan to make. We update that target once a year. We also show you sensitivities
related to the ComEd ROEs. Obviously, they've dropped some since the 1st of the year, which has an
impact. We also give you earnings bands that we gave you out through '23, and we're still well within the
bands that we gave you. And we'll continue to look for ways to challenge ourselves in this regard.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

At this point, it would be very shortsighted for us to start, stop, start, stop, depending on an interest rate.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. I see what you're saying. So you're saying, Chris, that you're not going to hold back on investment
in the state because of the temporary rates being lower. Got it.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Not.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Just one other question. Yes. One other question just for -- I guess for Joe, you mentioned levers on
your credit. You have levers on your credit profile if, I guess, things stay weaker there. Could you just give
some color on what those levers are?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

I think, Steve, I think we've got a track record of proving that we continue to challenge ourselves on our
cost structure. I mean we're reducing our cost by $250 million this year with actions we've taken, and
we're going to continue to challenge ourselves in the future in that regard. We've been clear that we have
some uneconomic power plants, and we're working hard to rectify that. We would have to address that.
Those would be 2 big levers that we would have to address.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So a couple of questions here. Realize with Illinois, there is significant uncertainty over '22 with PJM.
But can you speak a little bit at a high level to how gross margin is developing, maybe just directionally,
ignoring the upside or downside from capacity reform? And I realize this is secondary at this point to
everything going on. But do you still think something can get done in Illinois at the veto session?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

We're still working. We still have significant support on what we have to do. Where it gets done, we would
hope that it would get done before the end of the session. That's what we've stressed to give the IPA time
to be able to develop their own auction process. That will allow us to break away on capacity needs for the
state of Illinois from PJM. It's -- as I said earlier, it's a very tight time frame. If they were able to come in,
in a summer session and we had assurances, they were going to address this in a summer session. Under
the requirements by the Illinois Health, we would continue to work with them on that. But it's -- there's a
lot of things that have to get done in Springfield, but they also realize that this is a very important issue to
address and along with the state budget and some other large issues. So we know there's a will to get to
work. It's just the way to get to work and how fast we can get this done.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just what kind of C&I attrition are you guys expecting in your assumptions? And sort of
how do we sort of think about Constellation more broadly as we look at '21 and beyond? And does the
current situation present any strategic opportunities, in your view, maybe on the retail side? Or does sort
of some of the reprieves we've been seeing at the state level on the retail side push off any potential
acquisition opportunities as you guys look to tighten up that natural hedge?

EXELON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Jim, do you want to -- Jim McHugh, do you want to cover that one?

James McHugh
Executive VP & CEO of Costellation

Sure. Absolutely. I'll answer kind of 2 parts. I think what we expect from the low decreases we're seeing
now is as the states reopen and as things recover, we're seeing about a 15% reduction in that C&I on
average in these front-near months. By the end of the year, as Joe mentioned on the call, that's more in
the probably 4% to 6% range and coming back in through mid-next year. So from a load perspective, it's
temporary, and I think we expect that to bounce back.

I think from a strategic perspective, a couple of things. We definitely -- for acquisition space, we'll
continue to look for any value of books that come to the market. There could be some suppliers that
would need to let go of their books. We've talked about our strategy before will stay the same, which is
we would be looking to buy things, buy books of business that we could easily fit into our platform. We've
developed, I think, a world-class platform over the years that we can integrate easily, and we've shown
that before when we bought books of business.

And then lastly, I think strategically, it's just product development, where we'll look to either continue
to refine the products we sell now and look for demand charges that could be either [ faster ] or more
associated with the customers' fixed charges and look for other products that we can develop to give them
access to data analysis and sustainability targets that they have.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And just lastly, Joe, I know you obviously highlighted that the rating agencies understand
how transient in nature the cash flow dip is in 2020. Can you just remind us just from a perpetual or
ongoing perspective how to think about the $250 million cost savings and the ExGen CapEx reductions for
our modeling perspective?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. I would say right now, most of the $250 million we're viewing as a onetime item. And some of it's
being driven by the situation when you think about with things like reducing contractor spend, reducing
noncritical IT spend, when you look at reductions in travel spending, consulting spend, holding vacancy
rates in our organization, all of those things are contributing to the reduction in O&M. I will say, though,
when we go through our planning process, which begins here late in the second quarter and through the
end of the year, we've had a track record of continuing to challenge ourselves and find ways to reduce
costs. And given the environment we're in and some of the things, quite frankly, we've learned we may
be able to carry over some of these cost savings as we look at future periods. We just haven't made a
determination on that yet.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

This is obviously a little bit more of a granular question. But just looking on Slide 14, there was $100
million, I guess, change from December in the non-powered new business to go. I was just wondering if
you guys could talk a little bit about what's exactly in that bucket.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

EXELON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Yes. The $100 million non-powered new business to go is attributed partially to execution and partially, as
I said in my prepared remarks, in Q1, we've had -- we had impact both on power and non-power related
to weather, and we took a reduction for the balance of the year. That's all embedded in the total $300
million that you see in the gross margin change in the hedge disclosure.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. I was just wondering, was it a specific product that you guys are selling that where you saw the
weather impact? Or just trying to understand.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

What's embedded in that non-power to go is -- the bulk of it is our -- a big piece of it is our gas business.
And since that's so seasonal and related to the winter, you see the impact there.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just have a quick clarification question. You answered most of the things I had. In terms of just states
or territories where you don't have riders on COVID costs like bad debt, just want to clarify that you're
assuming recovery of those in the future, right? So the $250 million kind of targeted cost reductions don't
cover that.

Calvin G. Butler
Senior Executive VP & CEO of Exelon Utilities

No, they don't. This is Calvin. In all of our jurisdictions where we are not -- for our bad debt and we do
not have a rider, we are working in partnership with the commissions to sit back and establish regulatory
assets. As Chris alluded to in his opening comments, Maryland and D.C., both of their commissions
unanimously passed regulation allowing the utilities to set up regulatory assets and also set aside what
identify prudently incurred COVID-related costs. And we will operate under the same standard that
we used to operating on, showing that it's just and reasonable. We are working with the Pennsylvania
Commission and Delaware Commission, and we hope to have rulings from them in the next week to
10 days to drive that. So at the end of this, all of our jurisdictions, we believe will be operating under a
regulatory asset to show what those are bad debt costs and the COVID-related costs are.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Wanted to follow up, perhaps clean up a little bit on some of the questions, thus far. First, with respect to
the earnings CAGR and how you're thinking about that. Thus for the oscillations in the 30-year treasury,
anything else shifting your outlook? Obviously, the slide is slightly different here. So I just want to make
sure we're not missing anything, coming back to Steve's question.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Julien, there's nothing else shifting that CAGR other than the 30-year treasury.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Okay. All right. Glad we've set that one aside. Separately, if I can keep here on the Constellation business
and ExGen overall. When you think about the sensitivities to further -- you saw a faster or slower
improvement here. Can you give us a little bit of a sense? And I mean that more in the context of C&I
sales, degradation improvement as well as some of the portfolio optimization and volatility dynamics here
as well and how that could play out in '20 as well as what are you reflecting in '21? Just to be extra clear
about that.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Jim, you want to cover that? I'm not sure we've covered '21 yet, but we can cover

'20.

James McHugh
Executive VP & CEO of Costellation

Yes. Sure. Glad to do it. Thanks, Julien. The way we think about the balance for this year, and then I'll talk
about 2021, you see the sensitivity on the slide that for every 1% change in C&I load, you see about a
$15 million net income impact. And resi is about a $7 million impact. We've assumed, as we said, a slow
return through the balance for this year and into next year. So what the 1% sensitivity at least allow you
to do is, say, well, if any -- if across all those months, it moves up or down 1%, that's the number you
would expect. I think as far as the optimization activity with these gross margin estimates we've given
you, we see line of sight to being able to hit our normal optimization activity in the remainder of the new
business to go bucket. So we don't expect too much impact there. We've basically realigned these targets
now with these adjustments to have good line of sight to balance of the year.

For 2021, we've included about $50 million of impact for COVID, and that is more -- a little bit of an
impact on the load trickling into the year, but it also represents the fact that some of the new business
activity to sign customers up has slowed down just because of the status of work that people are in.
We've been tracking that, and we feel like that's a really good estimate right now, and we've been able to
maintain pretty good signing up of new customers, a little bit of dip in the win and renewal rates for the
month of April. As we get granular on really being able to understand which loads are impacted by how
much, those win rates and renew rates bounce back up to, I think, more on normal levels. And the $50
million we've included is a good estimate.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Excellent. Sorry, if I can just clarify your prior response very briefly? With respect to what's the
date as of for the 30-year treasury that you are assuming in that EPS CAGR? I just want to be extra clear.
Again, I don't know if you have a specific date or curve that you're using, but do you want to establish
that.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. 3/31 is the date we're using, the end of the first quarter.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

End of first quarter for the 30-year treasury so?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes.
