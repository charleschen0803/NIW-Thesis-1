MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Masco's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is
Maria, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded
for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may
begin.

David Chaika
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Maria, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2020 Third Quarter Conference
Call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer.

Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on
our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions.
[Operator Instructions] If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at (313) 792-5500.

Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-
looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks
and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial
metrics. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise
noted. We reconcile these adjusted metrics to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which
are available on our website under Investor Relations.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your
families are staying healthy and safe in these difficult times.

Please turn to Slide 4. During the third quarter, demand for our products was extremely strong as
consumers continued to reevaluate how they use their homes in the face of ever-changing responses
to the pandemic. With more time at home and more disposable income due to reduced discretionary
spending on leisure travel, entertainment, and gas for commuting, to name a few, consumers are
investing in their homes. I'm very proud of our strong execution as we met this increased demand and
served our customers while maintaining our top priority of employee safety. This resulted in tremendous
performance on both our top and bottom lines.

Sales for the quarter increased 15%, excluding the impact of currency. Operating profit increased
$127 million or 43%, and operating margins expanded 400 basis points to 21.4%. We delivered strong
incremental margins, 48%, as a result of our ability to profitably leverage the robust volume growth and
to pull the right cost reduction levers. Earnings per share grew 73% to $1.04 per share.

Turning to our segments, excluding currency. Plumbing sales increased 12%. North American plumbing
sales grew 14%, led by extremely strong performance at Delta, which drove greater than 20% growth
across each of its retail, e-commerce and trade channels. Trade sales in North America were particularly
strong in the second half of the quarter, with Delta achieving record trade sales in both August and
September. Delta was recently recognized as the Home Depot marketing partner of the year. This is an
annual award across all of Home Depot's suppliers, and speaks to our commitment to partner with our

customers to drive growth through innovation, omnichannel expertise and strategic thought partnership.
Our spa business also rebounded nicely in the third quarter and achieved growth despite still dealing with
government limitations on the number of employees in its factories.

Record levels of demand and backlog for our spas continued as consumers look for ways to enhance their
at-home living and backyard experience. Our international plumbing business also posted strong growth of
9%, excluding currency, led by growth in Germany and China. While Europe as a whole rebounded in the
third quarter, certain markets remain challenged, such as the U.K. and Spain.

In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew an exceptional 19% as we drove growth in all
product categories, including paint, bath and cabinet hardware and lighting. Our DIY paint sales remained
very strong in the quarter with growth in the upper 20% range. Pro paint declined mid-single digits, a
significant improvement from last quarter. Paint demand has remained robust as it is a simple, economical
project that homeowners can do themselves to improve the appearance of their home. Across all of our
business units, it was an exceptional quarter.

I would like to again thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts in serving our customers and
keeping each other safe.

Now moving into our fourth quarter outlook. We anticipate demand to remain strong and expect fourth
quarter sales growth, excluding currency, to be approximately 8% to 10% in both segments. Additionally,
we expect fourth quarter operating margins for our plumbing segment to be approximately 19% and
operating margins for our Decorative segment to be approximately 17%. Together, this would put Masco's
operating margin at over 17% for the quarter, a year-over-year expansion of approximately 150 basis
points.

As it relates to SG&A as a percent of sales, we anticipate further investment in our brands, innovation and
service to ensure we continue to deliver long-term sustainable value creation. This outlook assumes no
further shutdowns of facilities or points of distribution, which is obviously a concern as COVID cases spike
in many parts of the United States and the world.

Lastly, I'd like to update you on our capital allocation. While there remains uncertainty in the current
environment, based on our strong balance sheet and liquidity, we do plan on resuming our share
repurchase program in the fourth quarter. While the amount of repurchases will be subject to many
variables, our initial plan is to deploy approximately $100 million towards repurchases in the quarter.

And finally, there is no change to our thoughts on M&A. We remain active in the M&A market and have
the balance sheet and liquidity to execute transactions with the right strategic fit and return during these
uncertain times.

With that, I'll now turn it over to John for additional details on our fourth quarter -- excuse me, on our
third quarter results. John?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on
adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.

Turning to Slide 6. We had an outstanding quarter, as sales increased a robust 15%, excluding currency.
Foreign currency translation favorably impacted our third quarter revenue by approximately $13 million. In
local currency, North American sales in the third quarter increased 16%. This exceptional performance was
mainly driven by strong volume growth in our DIY paint and North American plumbing businesses.

In local currency, international sales rebounded nicely from last quarter and increased 9% over prior
year, driven by increased volume. Gross margin was 38% in the quarter, up 210 basis points, driven by
increased volume and cost leverage. Our SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 200 basis points to 16.5%
as a result of fixed cost leverage and our continued focus on cost containment.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Operating income was $425 million, up $127 million or 43% from last year, with operating margins
expanding 400 basis points to 21.4%. Our EPS was $1.04, an increase of 73% compared to the
third quarter of 2019. Company-wide incremental margins for the quarter were a strong 48% due to
operating leverage on the exceptional volume, our continued focus on cost control and a relatively
benign commodity environment. While this tremendous performance is a testament to Masco's operating
leverage and commitment to cost control, we also recognize the need to invest in our brands, service and
innovation to fuel our growth and plan to fund such investments in future quarters. While uncertainty
remains and precise forecasting is a challenge, we do anticipate continued solid consumer demand in the
fourth quarter. We expect sales growth, excluding currency, of 8% to 10%, with approximately 150 basis
points of margin expansion from Q4 of 2019.

Uncertainties such as the effect of government stimulus programs and the impact of the virus on the
overall health of the economy and consumer could impact demand in the market and our expected
results. Additionally, it is important to note that our Q4 expectations assume no further closures of our
manufacturing plants or points of distribution related to COVID-19.

Turning to Slide 7. Plumbing grew 12% excluding the impact of currency. Foreign currency translation
favorably impacted this segment's sales by approximately $13 million in the quarter. North American sales
increased 14% in local currency, led by Delta. The strong growth we experienced at the end of the second
quarter in our trade, retail and e-commerce channels continued in the third quarter, driven by robust
consumer demand and some inventory restocking. While manufacturing in our spa business improved
compared to the second quarter, Watkins continued to operate at less than 100% capacity due to ongoing
government-mandated employee limitations in our Mexican facilities. Despite these challenges, Watkins
grew in the third quarter, and they continue to experience very strong demand for their products, resulting
in a record backlog.

International plumbing sales increased 9% in local currency. Hansgrohe drove low double-digit growth in
both Germany and China, with lower growth in other European countries. This growth was partially offset
by continued declines in other countries, including the U.K. and Spain, where the economies have been
slower to recover.

Operating profit was $271 million, up $83 million or 44% from prior year, with margins expanding
510 basis points to 23.8%. The strong incremental margin of 61% was driven by higher volume, cost
productivity initiatives and a favorable price cost relationship.

Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales, excluding currency, to be up 8% to 10%, with margins
of approximately 19%, up 150 basis points from prior year.

Turning to Slide 8. Decorative Architectural grew 19% for the third quarter. This outstanding performance
was driven by high-teens growth in our paint business with strong high 20% growth in our DIY paint,
partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in pro paint. The continued resurgence in DIY paint and some
inventory restocking drove this performance. We remain well positioned with BEHR's compelling quality
and value proposition to capitalize on this shift in consumer behavior. While pro paint demand declined in
the third quarter, we saw a nice improvement from Q2 and sequential improvement through the quarter.
Our builders' hardware business also contributed to segment's results as they delivered exceptional
growth across product categories and benefited from strong consumer demand and new program wins.
Additionally, our lighting business continued to improve, achieving growth over prior year. Operating profit
increased in the quarter by 34%, driven by incremental volume and continued cost control, partially offset
by an unfavorable price cost relationship.

Turning to the fourth quarter, we expect a strong demand for paint to continue and anticipate segment
sales growth of 8% to 10%, with operating margins of approximately 17%, up approximately 70 basis
points from prior year. At the same time, we anticipate a price cost headwind in a more normalized level of
investment in the fourth quarter.

And turning to Slide 9. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.1x
as we ended the quarter, with approximately $2.3 billion of balance sheet liquidity which includes full
availability of our $1 billion revolver. Working capital as a percent of sales improved 70 basis points

versus prior year to 16.4% due to lower inventory levels and an improvement in accounts payable, largely
resulting from working capital improvements at Kichler. It is important to note that our GAAP reported net
cash from operations of $573 million to the 9 months ended September 30 reflects the cash taxes paid on
the sale of our cabinetry business. Excluding the impact of approximately $192 million of cash taxes paid
on the gain on the sale of our cabinetry business, our year-to-date adjusted net cash from operations is
approximately $765 million, with free cash flow of approximately $690 million. This is consistent with our
expectation of 100% free cash flow conversion this year. A reconciliation can be found in the appendix of
this deck.

During the third quarter, we also successfully refinanced our 2021 debt maturity at historically low rates,
which will result in approximately $4 million of annualized interest expense savings.

Lastly, as Keith mentioned, we plan to reinstate our share buyback activity in the fourth quarter. We
currently intend to deploy approximately $100 million to share repurchases in the fourth quarter, subject
to market conditions.

And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, John. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business as consumers reevaluate
their living environments. The house is no longer just a place for shelter. It has become the office, the
restaurant, the classroom, the gym and the entertainment center. And we are capitalizing on these
changing needs with our leading products by providing an affordable way for homeowners to discover
better living possibilities and to enhance how they interact with their homes.

At our Investor Day a little more than a year ago, we committed to between $2.80 and $3 earnings per
share in 2021. I'm very proud of the entire Masco team. I'm pleased to say that we will achieve and likely
exceed this range a full year earlier than planned. And while it is a bit early to provide a definitive outlook
for 2021, we believe that the strong consumer trend of increased investment in their homes will continue
in 2021 and support growth for our products. The changes we have made to Masco over the past few
years, our culture of execution and our commitment to continue to invest in brand, innovation and service
to support our customers positions us well to drive long-term growth and value creation in this ever-
changing market.
With that, I'll now open up the call for questions. Maria?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley of Barclays.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Congrats on the results. Wanted to start out with a question around the, I guess, longer-term margin.
Keith, you just mentioned the Investor Day and thinking about how to guide this year is kind of setting
up on the margin side to coming above the ranges you had given in both segments. And I also hear you
around some intentions around investing for growth. So as we think about 2021, is the idea that you're
going to sort of intentionally bring those margins back into the long-term range? Or is there a potential
that you can kind of remain above those long-term ranges for an extended period here?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Matthew, when you think about our margin targets for 2021 that we set up at the Investor Day, we need
to remember that, that was based on a significantly lower volume expectations for 2021. I think we had
plumbing in that 18% to 18.5% range, Deco was 17.5% to 18% and overall Masco just shy of 17%. And
as I said, this guidance was based on a low volume outlook. And as we've talked along in this call and in
other calls, we leverage volume very nicely. So there's lots of variables. And we'll continue to invest in our
brands, innovation and service, like we talked about. And that will certainly be somewhat of a headwind,
if you would, to margin expansion. But with strong R&R fundamentals and increased volume, I would
think that we would be able to exceed those targets and margins that we talk about at our Investor Day in
2021.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Understood. Secondly, maybe zeroing on the 4Q margin guide in plumbing, just given where you
kind of ended Q3, complying a bit of a step down sequentially that's larger than typical for Q4. So is there
anything in that Q3 plumbing margin that is, I don't know, I guess, unsustainable or onetime in nature
that might drive that type of step down?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

There's a couple of the things that are interacting as we think about plumbing in the fourth quarter. Recall
that once the pandemic hit, we very swiftly enacted significant cost-cutting measures as we were in the
throes of assessing what exactly the impact was going to be on liquidity, on cash flow, et cetera, and on
demand. And we demonstrated, I believe, with our third quarter results that our demand has remained
robust. So now as we move into the fourth quarter, we do expect to see some increased production costs.
Certainly, overtime, higher bonuses, higher volume rebates, probably we'll have some additional -- little
bit of additional air freight as we continue to balance out inventories in our supply chain and keep up with
strong demand. Commodities will be a little bit less favorable as we look forward. And we do anticipate,
as I talked about, bringing back some additional investment spend to make sure that we are going to
win in the recovery. We talked about investment in brands and advertising and marketing, continued
and increased investment in innovation. So that's the dynamic that we're looking at as we think about
margins. Q4, really pretty similar for the other segment as well, but definitely for plumbing.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo of Bank of America.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Maybe starting off just with Kichler. Just wondering if you can give us an update on how the performance
was in the quarter with very strong segment performance.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

They did a great job. Really impressed with the team down there. Continue to execute, I would say, better
than planned, at or better than planned. So we achieved growth. That was very solid. And the team is
doing a good job or on plan.

John Lovallo
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just going back to the plumbing margins, the 23.8% in the quarter. It sounds like
there's going to be some increased investment coming forward which makes a lot of sense. But how much
of that was constrained investment in the quarter? Was that a factor? Or was it just the other factors that
you talked about?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

You say constrained investments, John, how much did we have a reduction of the investment in Q2? Is
that what you're asking?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. John, maybe I'll take this one. In terms of -- yes, I mean, if you think about our performance in the
third quarter in plumbing, yes, as we exited Q2, one of the things that Keith mentioned, we really clamped
down on expenses at the start of the pandemic and we kept them constrained going into the third quarter.
And so as you think about typical expenses that we might be running, particularly in the SG&A area, right,
a lot less travel and entertainment, right? Because virtually, we're not having our teams travel very much.
Things like promotional expense were down significantly in the quarter. Things like trade shows that we
would typically attend were all down in the quarter. And so that led probably to a little bit better margin
expansion on top of the benefits we enjoyed for the operating leverage in Q3. And so as Keith mentioned,
as we roll from Q3 into Q4, we're watching -- we're going to try to contain our expenses as best we can,
but we have to appropriately reinvest to grow the business. And so we are viewing the fact that we may
need to layer some of those costs back in as we go into Q4.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Nice results. Keith, John, you mentioned in remarks and in response to one of the questions, some of
the input costs potentially creeping up and also freight. I think, as we think about global recovery and
also potential vaccine distribution next year, there's certainly some thought that we could see further
acceleration and some of the freight pressures and also some reacceleration in inputs. I guess, can you
give us any more color when you're thinking about that 4Q margin? How much of an impact are you
already seeing? And what are your thoughts as we head into '21 around inputs and freight?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, sure, Mike. It's John. In terms of commodity costs, yes -- and certainly, in Q3, we did have some
benefit. All of the drivers of our margin expansion in Q3, I'd say volume and cost productivity, were much
bigger drivers of our Q3 performance and obviously, commodity inputs. Looking forward, as you think of

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

plumbing and you think about the base metals, copper and zinc, they did help us and gave us -- provided
us a little bit of tailwind in the third quarter. But recall that we've seen copper and zinc start to increase,
particularly in the second quarter. And as I think -- as we've said before on other calls, it takes about 2
quarters for raw material inflation to flow through, particularly the base -- the copper and zinc before it
hits our P&L. And so that will be a little bit less of a tailwind and a little bit more of a headwind as we go
into Q4.

As it relates to the input costs for paint, our price commodity relationship, there was a bit of a headwind
in the quarter. And we expect that to increase a little bit as we go into the fourth quarter. Present prices
have started to rise up a little bit because oil has risen over the course of the year. So that's where we're
looking. TiO2, I would say, has remained relatively stable, not a lot of up or down movements there. So as
we go into the fourth quarter, we expect that to continue to be stable.

As part of your question, I think, Mike, you also mentioned freight. We haven't seen a lot of freight cost
pressure yet. And I would remind everyone that distribution and logistics costs as a percent of sales for
us is relatively low. So even though if we saw significant spikes in distribution logistics, that wouldn't be
much of an impact. So what we are seeing a little bit of tightness is on just supply of freight in trucks. And
so that's something we're keeping an eye on. That said, I think we and our teams have always done a
great job of handling inflation, whether it's our general inflation that we experience or commodity-based
inflation. And so we'll handle those accordingly. We'll do it like we've always done. We'll continue to drive
our cost productivity initiatives. We'll continue to work with our suppliers to push back on them, and we'll
also enact pricing if that's required.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. That's really helpful. My second question, it's clearly a great recovery in plumbing, both in
North America and in international. Just wondering, I think with Europe, some of the rising cases have
probably been at least a few weeks ahead of what we've seen in the U.S., and there have been some local
restrictions that have probably gotten a little bit tighter there. Can you talk about just whether you're
seeing any of those impact your European plumbing business at this point in the fourth quarter relative to
the recovery in the third quarter?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Well, I'll take this one. Mike, Germany, which, as you know, is Hansgrohe's largest market and China,
which is also a very large market for us, each drove low double-digit growth in the third quarter. So we
did see good growth. We also saw growth but to a lesser extent in other European countries, Italy, the
Netherlands, for example. But as I said in my remarks, there were also other countries such as the U.K.
and Spain that have been slower to recover. So when we think about Europe in the third quarter, it was
good. It was robust for us.

As it relates to the fourth quarter, we're watching very closely what happens. And yes, you're right,
there has been some tightening, and they're doing it in a little bit different way than we are here. They
tend to be more metropolitan area focused, meaning they're being more pinpointed in the types of
restrictions that they're employing, whether it's cutting the time in certain cities that restaurants can be
open or closing certain types of venues like cinemas, movie theaters, et cetera, on a city-by-city basis.
So they're being more surgical. And I think just like around the world, there's more experience on how
to work through this. So it remains to be seen what the ultimate impact will be. But I think what we've
demonstrated is that we have the ability to be agile, if you will, and to very closely monitor the situations
and pull the cost levers appropriately if needed. So right now, we're really watching, particularly over in
Europe.

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten of Crédit Suisse.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Can you give us a sense for how much customer restocking added to growth across both businesses? You
did mention that in both segments.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Adam, as you might expect, as we exited this second quarter because of the strong demand that
we were experiencing at the end of Q2, inventories were relatively low in the channels. And as you think
about the growth drivers for the third quarter being volume and inventory restocking, I would tell you that
volume was by far the much more significant driver of growth. Inventory restocking was a relatively light
impact in the quarter.

Adam Michael Baumgarten
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just looking at 4Q paint or Decorative guidance, what are you assuming for DIY and
pro growth in that guidance?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

As we look -- we think demand for paint will continue to be strong as we go into the fourth quarter.
We indicated we're forecasting 8% to 10% sales growth in Q4. And again, I think we are going to see
continued strong demand on the DIY side and muted, but more improving demand on the pro side of
our business. So I would remind everyone, though, we've got a bit of a tough comp going -- in paint as
we go into the fourth quarter. As you may recall, in our fourth quarter last year, we experienced about
$20 million of sales pulled forward in the fourth quarter of last year. And so that will be a bit of a comp
headwind for us as we go into Q4.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs.

David Chaika
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Susan, you may be on mute.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Susan, are you there? Operator, ...

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I'm sorry about that. It was -- that was my fault, sorry. My first question is just talking about -- you
obviously mentioned you're restarting the share repurchase program, which I think is a good sign of your
confidence in the outlook and what you're seeing. Can you talk a little bit about maybe any potential to
exceed that $100 million? Or how we should think about this starting to kind of layer back in and you
getting back to the levels that you've seen in the past couple of years?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Sure, Susan. As we indicated, both Keith and I indicated in our prepared remarks, we're right now
targeting around $100 million for share repurchases in the quarter. As you -- and I think as we both
indicated, there's a lot of variables that go into the decision to -- what drives our share repurchase
activity. It's going to be subject to market conditions to the extent that we see pullback in the shares.
We'll be probably a little bit more opportunistic like we were earlier this year. When we repurchased $600

million worth of our shares for less than $40 per share. So to the extent we see greater share pullback,
we'll probably be a little bit more aggressive to the extent we see the share price run high. We'll probably
continue to devote that $100 million but probably not much more than that. Again, it's going to be a bit of
a judgment call as we work our way through the quarter.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. All right. That sounds good. And then just following up there, you -- can you give us a little color on
Kichler and perhaps some of the trends that you're seeing there? And especially given some of those cost
cutting efforts, how we should expect that to start to come through as we look to 2021?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Lighting is a relatively less expensive purchase that you can create some pop and a new look in your
house. So much like of many of our products, which are in that sweet spot of the price point and bang for
the buck, if you will, we also saw that in lighting. So we saw good growth across our channels, and Kichler
participated in that growth. As we said, Kichler grew. And as I mentioned before to an earlier question,
we're on plan, maybe even a little bit ahead of plan, and I'm pleased with how the team is performing.
And our objective was to position Kichler for growth next year, and we had growth this past quarter. So I
like what I'm seeing.

Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson of Wells Fargo.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

First, among the 2 segments. How did -- could you just go through how demand trended throughout the
quarter? And how it either ended in September or October or even in -- just for clarity, the exit rate?
Seems like all of your businesses were positive on a year-over-year basis in 3Q, but do they -- are they
still trending that way?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

As we spoke a little bit, Truman, in the prepared remarks, Delta had a record last couple of months of the
quarter. So nice acceleration through the quarter, and that's fairly consistent with the plumbing segment
in general, had good solid, somewhat consistent growth over in Europe in plumbing. In the DIY space in --
excuse me, in paint and in Decorative, in general, pretty consistent. It was strong going in and remained
strong going through. So that gives you a little bit of color on the in-quarter kind of dynamics.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then not necessarily in paint or faucets, but in other building product categories, we've heard
of some supply chain issues or capacity issues in filling the robust demand. Are you all seeing that in paint
and faucets, specifically? Or you have any capacity issues? And then on the flip side, it seems like there's
a little bit of inventory build in your channels. Do you think that there's more to come, that your retailers
especially need to build additional inventory? And how are you thinking about your own inventory levels
over the winter? Are you looking to build up a little bit more than you normally do?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Right now, Truman, we're managing through with our current capacity. Typically, we would use the slower
months in the beginning of the year and early Q2 to build inventory. We didn't have that luxury due
to restrictions and uncertainty and everything that was going on at that point. Now we do have plans

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

to selectively add some capacity where we need it. We talked a little bit about the resurgence and the
increase in demand of 1 gallon filling -- 1 gallon paint due to the tremendous shift over to DIY, where the
DIYers tend to buy more 1s than 5s. So we had to buy and purchase some additional capacity in 1 gallon
filling lines, that sort of thing. So there's some spot capacity and certain types of machinery where we've
had to add. But really, there's been no significant capacity issues. At some point, we're likely going to
increase capacity in certain areas, but not in immediate horizon.

In terms of the inventory position in the channels, I would say that inventory is probably a little bit light
for where we would like to see it and where our channel partners would like to see it. So may see a little
bit of inventory fill as we move through the year.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. And one thing I'd add to Keith's comments is that I always like to take this time to acknowledge our
supply chain teams, they have done just a fantastic job of reacting to the increased robust demand that
we've been experiencing in the third quarter. And whether it's our supply chain teams internally, our folks
in our plants across the portfolio or whether it's our suppliers, everyone has acted in a coordinated fashion
to really drive this growth. And so we're really pleased with how the team has responded this quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes of Truist.

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

A question on Watkins. It sounds like you're still having some production issues. Do you have any sort of
feel for when that will get back to full production and alleviate some of the backlog you discussed earlier?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Keith, again, Watkins team is working day and night to deliver and fulfill the demand. When the Mexican
government releases the restrictions, it's tough to tell. I mean, we don't have any good insight as to when
that's going to take place. But the Watkins team is running hard and fulfilling as best they can. And they
-- like I said in my prepared remarks, they drove growth in the quarter despite some of these restrictions.
And so we're really pleased with how the Watkins team is delivering here in Q3 and Q4.

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And second question on pro paint. You talked about -- it sounds like in the fourth quarter, you expected to
get a little bit better than what we saw on the third. Why is that? Is that something to do with your retail
partner or is that something more in the market?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

I think, Keith, it's just continued progress in the trends that we've been seeing. As you might expect, in
Q2, we saw a lot of pullback on consumers not allowing paint contractors to come in their homes, and
we've seen a steady improvement since Q2 and actually through Q3, we saw sequential improvement each
month through the quarter in our pro paint sales. And so based on what we're experiencing, we think that,
that trend could continue here as we go into Q4.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

A lot of variabilities there, Keith. The -- what happens to the virus and what happens to the consumer
psyche as it relates to pros being allowed in your home. The fact that in the late year, it moves more
towards interior. So there's a lot of variables that we have to think about.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on the results. First question, I just wanted to circle back a little bit to understanding some of
the sequential trends that you're expecting in the businesses on the top line, on the sales side in plumbing
and Decorative. And when you think about the expected, still very strong growth rates, but a little bit
of a decel in plumbing from roughly 13% to 8% to 9%. Just trying to get a sense of what's driving that
if it's -- if all of that is perhaps the absence of the inventory restocking that you referred to earlier or if
there's other things at hand? And similarly, in Decorative, I believe you had said earlier that you observed
relatively consistent trends during 3Q. So again, just trying to understand the decel into 4Q. And I know,
John, you had referred to somewhat of a tougher comp, but I'm also looking at 3Q '19 growing at 5% --
6% in 4Q '19, down 3. So I just wanted to try and better understand what's driving that as well.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Mike, as you think about the transition of the growth from Q3 to Q4, that's sequential. First of all, we
had extremely strong demand in Q3, which drove really good results. We -- and as you said, we expect
demand to continue to be good as we go into Q4. But as you know, forecasting in this current environment
is a little bit of a challenge. And it's hard to say what impact the virus might have on our Q4 results. And
there may be a little bit of a dose of conservatism in that guide as well as we're trying to dial things into
the third quarter -- or the fourth quarter, I should say.

So from our perspective, we had 12% growth in plumbing in the third quarter. We're looking at 8% to
10% growth. I don't view that as significant deceleration as we go into the fourth quarter. That said, third
quarter did have some inventory restocking in it. And so we're probably thinking that there's probably a
little less inventory restocking as we go into Q4. We'll see how that plays out.

On the Decorative Architectural side, to the point made in your question, the pull forward definitely has
an impact, we think, on our Q4 revenue growth rates because we're currently not expecting that type
of activity to recur here in the fourth quarter of 2020. I'd also say that Liberty Hardware, which is a
smaller -- one of the smaller businesses in the segment, had a terrific quarter, full stop. I mean they had
a really, really strong quarter. And as we go -- and they also had a load-in here in the third quarter due
to a program win they had at one of their retail customers. And so we don't expect that activity to recur.
And similarly to the plumbing segment, Mike, we talked about a little bit of inventory restocking in Q3.
We don't expect that same level of inventory restocking to take place in Q4. So as we pull it all together,
yes, the transition or the growth rates from Q3 to Q4 are a little bit more muted in Q4. That said, we think
8% to 10% growth in this environment is still quite strong and translates with 150 basis points of margin
expansion, that we think represents a very good quarter.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

No, no, absolutely -- and -- no, appreciate that. I guess, secondly, on the margin side, obviously, it's
great to see the reinvestment in the business. And when you're talking about the margins that you're
generating, that strategy makes perfect sense in terms of trying to maintain those high margins and
reinvest for the top line. Obviously, that's baked into your 4Q guidance. How should we think about '21 in
this regard? And when Keith, you had talked about before perhaps being able to maintain a margin above
your long-term targets, is that with reinvestment spend kind of kicking up? Or how do you see that factor
impacting profitability? Is that something where it could be a 50 or 100 bps type of investment or the
levels could still stay above those long-term targets with a higher reinvestment rate?

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

My comment -- again, it's too early to call 2021, and we'll talk more about that next quarter. We do expect
growth in 2021. We think that the fundamentals of the consumer when you look at what really drives our
business, as it is configured now, it significantly swings on home price appreciation, housing turnover. And
you look at those numbers, we're looking at, let's call it, 5% home price appreciation and $6.5 million of
existing home sales. So those are big numbers. Now those aren't sustainable numbers, but that certainly
gives us a lot of confidence going into 2021. So we -- my comments about continuing to grow and driving
margin expansion, we all -- that's how we think here. We always want to grow above market and we
want to continue to expand margins. So our increased investments were factored into my thinking and
my comments that I made there. Now I will say that when you think about the optimum spend for value
creation, I'm not going to sit here and say that 16.5% SG&A is the optimum. It's more than that.

And we're going to continue to drive long-term -- mid- and long-term value creation. So there will be an
increase in SG&A. It's not sustainable at 16.5% because that's not the right thing to do to drive value
creation. So we're going to increase those investments, but we also are very carefully watching these cost
reduction levers we have and how much we increase because we don't know, no one knows, what's --
where this virus is going to go over the coming months. But as we learn more, we're going to maintain our
commitment to the future.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes, I had 2 questions for you, both kind of related to the virus because you've given a lot of good
information in other areas. And obviously, I'm not asking you to predict the future, but if we take it from
a negative perspective, I'm curious as to what you think -- what you're anticipating the effects might be
on your business if we were to go through another wave of shutdowns, kind of like what we did earlier
on? I would imagine it's going to be a little bit different this time. And you talked about some differences
between the U.S. and Europe in the terms of the way that we handled it the first time. What do you
imagine -- how do you imagine the effects may be a little different, in particular, as it relates to your
business? I'm thinking -- do you think inventories would hold more stable through a shutdown wave, for
instance? And are there other impacts that are important for us to consider for your business if we were to
tighten up again?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

That's a crystal ball kind of question, and I wish I had one. The way we think about what could happen,
either positive or negative, it kind of turns on a couple of things. One is the discretionary spend. So is
the discretionary spend of the consumer going to continue to be at a rather high level now as it relates to
reduction in spend in other areas like entertainment and going out, et cetera, and what could potentially
happen if there was a reduction or no stimulus if the virus got worse, those sorts of more downside
scenarios. So where does the discretionary spend go? Is there more or less discretionary spend? Then the
second component is what share of wallet of the consumer is going to be spent on the home. Obviously,
we've seen a significant spike in that share of wallet being spent on the home, and will that continue? I
don't think it's probably prudent to think that this is going to stay at these elevated levels in perpetuity,
probably would revert back to the mean. But at the same time, we do believe that there has been some
structural changes to the DIY market.

And we talked about last quarter some of our own research, and I've certainly talked to other people
in the industry and our channel partners in terms of some of their research and you simply can't deny
that the millennials have entered in and entered in big into DIY. And that is earlier than we expected. We
expected it, but it's earlier. So that could be -- could represent a structural expanding of the DIY pie, if you
will. So don't have a crystal ball answer for you, but those are 3 things that we're thinking about as we
evaluate positive and potentially negative scenarios.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

VP & CFO

And Stephen, I guess, maybe I add my own color on that. I mean, I think, like Keith said, I think
consumer demand will be there. I mean, as we saw what happened in the spring as we worked through
the pandemic, the consumer was there and they were spending and they were investing in their home.
And like Keith said, given the trends that we're seeing and given the research that we've seen, we think
consumer demand will be there. The thing that we've got to keep our eye on, like because we're still
contending with our Watkins operation is what happens to production, and if the shut down affects any of
our facilities. And so that's the one thing we've got to keep in the back of our mind as well.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. Fair point. Next question relates -- actually, it's kind of a flip scenario. Let's say, in -- sometime in the
next foreseeable future we actually get a vaccine and we get a more rapid reopening or reopening that's
more -- on a more rapid side, let's say, a more positive like bullish outcome. One of the foreseeable things
that a lot of folks are talking about now for your business, and of course, you've addressed it before, is
that you might see a slowdown in DIY paint because you had a little bit of pull forward, maybe. And so
in particular, I suppose, with Dec Arc, I'm curious if you could address what areas you think you might --
are there areas where you're doing some contingency planning today ahead of a potential slowdown in the
event of a vaccine? And what are the operational challenges that you could reasonably foresee? And what
would your action plan look like? I'm not asking for a lot of specifics here, but just generally, what are the
areas of your business that you're anticipating you may need to pull a lever for? If you could give us some
insight into how you're thinking about that.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I think it would probably be mainly on discretionary spending. I really wouldn't see significant structural
cost reductions. When you think about where our brick-and-mortar capacity is and how it's lined up, we're
in pretty good shape there. We were -- we had good utilization going into the pandemic and we have
outstanding utilization now. So I think on the upside scenario, we could see a potential investment and
some capacity down the road. We obviously work very hard to get more out of the assets that we have,
do better with what we have sort of thing in terms of efficiency and how we use our assets. And then the
downside, we would flex down on the discretionary. It's kind of how I would see it.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Stephen, maybe the way I would approach it is, we've got a great investment in our pro franchise.
And if a vaccine to your little description were to come true or come through faster, I think we could
double down on our pro investment and grow that business faster than we've been growing it in the last
several years. I mean, we've experienced double-digit growth in our pro paint business historically. And if
the consumer decides not to paint their homes anymore and they want pros to do it, we'll be right there
with our channel partner to meet that demand. So I think that's the way I would position a business going
forward, if that were -- if your scenario were to emerge.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Loop Capital.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

I just wanted to follow-up on the comment you just made just around capacity. Just with the step-up in
demand, and it sounds like there's a pretty solid outlook into 2021. And how far away are you from having
to perhaps add some capacity, whether it's in plumbing or paint?

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

We've been -- I'll talk first, maybe Keith can add some color afterwards. So our team has done a great
job of driving efficiency within our facilities such that, Garik, we don't need to add any brick-and-mortar
capacity in the near term. We are -- as Keith mentioned earlier, we are investing a little bit in our 1 gallon
capacity in the paint side because that's where the demand has been the strongest over the course of the
last couple of quarters. That said, if demand continues to go at the current pace at it is, I would estimate
that we might need to expand some of our facilities probably in the '22 or '23 time frame. It's not going to
definitely be a '21 investment. But that might be the soonest that we have to do it. We'll have to see how
the demand plays out over the course of the next couple of quarters.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. And just had a quick question on plumbing. You called out good growth across the board, retail e-
commerce. It sounded particularly bullish just on what you're seeing in trade in August and September.
So just kind of wondering what is driving the acceleration in the trade channel? And what the outlook is
there?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think consumers were becoming more comfortable and feeling more safe to go into plumbing
showrooms than to go into those areas of the trade channel that they really shut down for a while --
literally shut down and then we shut down in the sense of not being comfortable going in them. So I think
the consumer engaging with that part of the channel as it relates to showrooms was a big plus. And we're
very strong in the showroom. So that set right into our sweet spot. So I think that was a big component of
it also to a degree. The consumer is a little bit more comfortable with having plumbers in their home, and
there's a component of repair where when something like that breaks, it has to be fixed. So whether it's a
washer or dryer or, in our case, a faucet or a shower system. So I think those are the dynamics that drove
the trade.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs of Baird.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Nice job. I just had 1 question really about promotions and -- just curious kind of what you're hearing as
your customers think about '21 around promotions at this point? Do you think things revert back to maybe
a normal promotional type environment? Or do you think there's some incremental kind of investment or
catch-up investment that your customers might ask maybe next year?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Tim, it's a time of year where we're typically working through the promotional cadence for the subsequent
year. And as we think about it right now, and it's -- the promotional cadence is driven by our retail
partners. We don't necessarily drive that. We work with them and how our participation will play out. But
our guess at this point is they're going to be thoughtful about it like they were this year to the extent
that the virus is more muted. I would -- to your point, I would expect to see more normal cadence of
promotional activity to the extent that there's a more aggressive virus out there and they want to limit
consumers going into their stores, they may pull back on that. So it's hard to determine right now exactly
how it's going to play out for '21. But we're going to work very closely with our channel partners to figure
out how we can best and most effectively participate in whatever promotions they decide to run.

Operator, is there 1 more question?

tough comps on the DIY side. So I'm just curious, do you have enough momentum on the pro side in

a great channel partner. So we would, and we always do, invest and drive our teams for growth, and that's
