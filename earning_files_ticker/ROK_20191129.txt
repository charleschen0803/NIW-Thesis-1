Presentation

Operator

Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's quarterly conference call. I need to remind
everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms.
Kourakos, please go ahead.

Jessica Kourakos
Head of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings
Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our
CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted
to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP
measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A
webcast of this call will be available at the website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a
transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.

Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the
expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results
may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described
in our earnings release and detailed in our SEC filings.

So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Please turn to
Page 3 of the slide deck. I'll begin by saying that I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter and our
start to the year. Despite a tough manufacturing environment, both revenue and earnings were slightly
better than our expectations for Q1.

Total sales grew 3%, including over 4 points of contribution from inorganic investments primarily related
to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were down 1% compared to a strong quarter a year ago.
Backlog, however, was up year-over-year as well as sequentially. Organic sales performance continues to
include market share gains in core platforms. For instance, Independent Cart motion control technology
grew strong double digits for us in the quarter. It is becoming a game-changing solution across a broad
range of industries and applications.

Information Solutions and Connected Services, or ISCS for short, had another great quarter, also growing
strong double digits. We had notable wins in Life Sciences, Food and Beverage, our first MES win in
luxury goods, a significant MES win in mining, and our first-ever augmented reality project in oil and gas.
Our broader and more differentiated portfolio gives us more ways to win in a wide variety of industries,
including those where we are not the incumbent control platform.

Recurring revenue in the quarter grew double digits, led by an increase in software subscriptions. As I
mentioned, our earnings performance was slightly better than expected. Segment margins and adjusted
EPS include onetime items related to Sensia as well as investments we are making to increase our long-
term differentiation. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our organic sales and
adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2020. While there have been recent positive developments on global
trade and the macro environment is showing signs of stabilization, it is still too early to see that impact on
customer spending.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Let's now turn to Slide 4 and go a little deeper into our vertical sales performance for the quarter. Discrete
and hybrid end market segments did a little better than we expected this quarter, while Process was a
little weaker than we expected. Within our discrete segment, auto grew mid-single digits, largely related
to higher program spend in North America and Asia Pacific and stabilization in MRO, albeit at low levels.
While this higher program spend was better than anticipated, the overall auto market is still relatively
weak, and we think it is premature to change our flat full year outlook for this vertical. Semiconductor
sales were notably better in all regions, up high single digits. Historically, our exposure to semis has
been largely in facilities management, but we are also seeing new traction in material handling, IoT and
cybersecurity applications.

Turning now to our Hybrid market segment. Food and Beverage declined low single digits reflecting
some project delays. However, given what we are hearing from customers and the activity we have seen
at packaging OEMs, we still believe Food and Beverage will grow low single digits for the year. In Life
Sciences, we had another solid quarter with sales growing both year-over-year as well as sequentially. As
we've said before, this is an industry where our scalable architecture and our differentiation in ISCS are
well aligned and paying dividends.

Our Process market segment declined slightly, especially in chemicals and pulp and paper. Organically, oil
and gas grew mid-single digits this quarter, and we continue to expect low single-digit sales performance
for the year. Sensia, which had a good start to the year, is expected to grow double digits based on its
differentiation in the fast-growing digital oilfield segment of this vertical.

Turning to Slide 5 and our regional sales performance in the quarter. North America was down 3%
organically, reflecting weak manufacturing environment. The weakness in Process industries was partially
offset by auto, up double digits; and strength in semiconductor. EMEA was up 2% in the quarter, led
by oil and gas, Life Sciences and tire. Asia Pacific grew by 6%, led by strong demand for oil and gas,
Life Sciences and auto. Auto was up over 10% in the region and included strong gains at EV battery
manufacturers, where our readiness to serve is high. Our portfolio is demonstrating how well positioned
we are to benefit from the transition to EV. Latin America sales were down 1%, largely due to a tough
comparison from last year and weaker performance in Automotive and mining.

I'll now make a few additional comments on our other accomplishments in the quarter. Our annual
Automation Fair was held last November in Chicago, and I'm proud to say that we reached a new all-
time attendance record. Customers are focusing on outcomes, and sharply increased sales leads from
the event indicate we are demonstrating our increased value for a wide variety of industries. We also
had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. Here, we highlighted our execution plans to
accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our
business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner, more flexible cost structure. We also
had exciting new partners at the event, including Schlumberger, Accenture and ANSYS, which is a game-
changing technology partner for simulation and digital twin applications.

We're seeing our partnerships contribute to many strategic wins, and we had some great wins this quarter,
including in Life Sciences across all major geographies. In Europe, we signed a major agreement with
Roche. Roche will be implementing our pharma suite MES platform across 16 plants in their pharma
and diagnostics divisions. In North America, we entered into a new multisized, multiyear agreement
with a major pharmaceutical producer. They selected FactoryTalk innovation suite to drive their digital
transformation program for a connected plant and supply chain. It will provide a common platform to drive
real-time visibility of analytics to the operator, plant and enterprise levels; predict future events to avoid
unplanned downtime and improve energy efficiency; and accelerate knowledge transfer and improve ease
of use. Once implemented, this solution will eliminate hundreds of overlapping edge solutions, resulting
in significant operational savings. In China, Zhejiang pharma group, a large pharmaceutical company,
chose Rockwell to transform their factories to become smarter and more predictive, while at the same
time, assisting them to oversee quality management and ensuring that they comply with regulatory
requirements.

From regulatory compliance to safety and energy efficiency, Rockwell is becoming an increasingly
important partner of our customers' ESG initiatives. In addition to what we're doing in our own facilities,

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

everything we do for customers is about increasing efficiency, reducing energy usage, improving
workers' safety and ensuring regulatory compliance, all of which lowers business risk and is good for the
environment.

Now turning to Slide 6. Let's talk a little more about our inorganic investments, which are becoming an
increasingly important complement to our long-term organic growth strategy. Starting with Sensia. This
was our first quarter including Sensia as a fully operational joint venture consolidated in our results, and
I'm very pleased with its performance in Q1. Operationally, Sensia's top line grew double digits, with
strong traction at marquee oil and gas customers around the world. Our sales teams have been fully
integrated, and we are looking forward to the launch of new solutions and products that will contribute to
the double-digit sales performance we expect this year.

We also announced the acquisition of MESTECH at the beginning of Q1. MESTECH is an industrial software
consulting and delivery services company based in India, and they have already been instrumental in
winning key business for us in the quarter.

Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Avnet Data Security, a cybersecurity provider based in
Israel with over 20 years of experience. Cybersecurity is one of the fastest-growing parts of our services
business. The extensive knowledge and experience of the Avnet team will support our company's strategic
objective to achieve double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services by expanding
our IT/OT cyber and network expertise globally. Plus, this acquisition will establish a global cybersecurity
center of excellence for us in EMEA. This includes a remote managed service center and expands our
portfolio of capabilities, including a full training curriculum and labs.

As you can see, we're actively deploying capital to advance our strategic priorities to accelerate share
gains in our core business, continued growing double digits in ISCS, grow domain expertise in Process and
accelerate our market access in Europe and Asia. We're focused on driving value with more intensity than
ever before.

Let me now turn it over to Patrick, who will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance and fiscal
2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, first quarter key financial information.
First quarter reported sales were up 2.6% year-over-year. As expected, organic sales were down 1%.
Acquisitions, which mainly represent the impact of Sensia, contributed 4.5 points of growth, better than
expected. Currency translation decreased sales by 0.9 points, a higher headwind than we expected.
Segment operating margin was 20.1%, down 270 basis points compared to last year. About half of the
year-over-year decrease relates to the impact of acquisitions and related onetime costs, primarily Sensia.
The other half of the year-over-year margin decrease is about evenly split between higher investment
spending and unfavorable mix. General corporate net expense of $32.8 million was up $11 million
compared to last year. The increase is due to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our
deferred and nonqualified compensation plans and Sensia-related transaction fees. The adjusted effective
tax rate for the quarter was 7.9% compared to 18.7% last year. About half of the reduction in the year-
over-year tax rate is due to a Sensia $19 million onetime tax benefit. The remainder is due to other
discrete items, primarily tax benefits from option exercises. Adjusted EPS of $2.11 was a bit better than
we expected and down $0.10 compared to the first quarter of last year, a decrease of 5%. The year-over-
year decrease in adjusted EPS is primarily due to lower organic sales, particularly in some of our product
businesses leading to unfavorable mix, and higher investment spending. Partially offsetting that is a lower
tax rate, excluding the Sensia impacts and the net benefit of a lower share count and higher net interest
expense. The net year-over-year adjusted EPS contribution of Sensia in the quarter was $0.01. The Sensia
contribution of $0.01 includes a $0.07 larger-than-expected headwind related to onetime items. Free cash
flow was $194 million in the quarter or about 80% of adjusted income. During the quarter, we paid the
annual bonus that our employees earned in fiscal '19.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

A few additional items not shown on the slide. For adjusted EPS, average diluted shares outstanding in
the quarter were 116.6 million, down 4.9 million or about 4% from last year. We repurchased about 0.5
million shares in the quarter at a cost of $100 million. This is in line with our full year target of about $400
million. At December 31, we had $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

Slide 8 provides a sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. The Architecture &
Software segment had modest organic growth in the quarter. Segment margin was very strong at 29.8%
and a bit lower than the record margin last year, mainly due to increased investment spending. Organic
sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 2.5%. Inorganic investments increased sales
by 8.2% compared to last year. Sensia accounts for almost all of the inorganic growth. Organic sales
for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was down about 0.5 point year-over-year. The
higher-margin product businesses in this segment were down about 5% on an organic basis. First quarter
organic book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses was 1.12, typical for a first
quarter. Operating margin for this segment of 12.4% was down 310 basis points compared to Q1 last
year, primarily due to Sensia onetime items, lower organic sales and unfavorable mix. Segment margin,
excluding the year-over-year impact of Sensia, was about 14%.

In the appendix, you will find 2 slides with a more detailed overview of the year-over-year incremental
impact of Sensia for Q1 and for full year fiscal 2020 outlook. It is the same format we provided to you
at our Investor Day. As I mentioned earlier, from an operational viewpoint, Sensia's sales and earnings
were a bit better than we expected. Nonrecurring items, including the tax benefit, were $0.07 worse than
we expected in the first quarter, primarily due to larger purchase accounting adjustments and a lower
tax benefit. For full year fiscal 2020, we now expect the net year-over-year impact of Sensia to be about
neutral to adjusted EPS. The financial framework we shared with you at Investor Day last November
remains valid with Sensia. We continue to target 30% to 35% earnings conversion for Rockwell, assuming
mid-single-digit organic sales growth.

This takes us to Slide 9, guidance. Our outlook for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged compared to our
November guidance. We are maintaining our sales growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. For adjusted
EPS, in essence, compared to prior guidance, small headwinds due to Sensia onetime items, currency
and the higher share count are offset by a somewhat lower adjusted effective tax rate. The lower tax
rate is the result of a higher excess income tax benefit related to share-based compensation. General
corporate net is now expected to be closer to $105 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense
for the full year is expected to be about $40 million, up $20 million compared to last year. Net interest
expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about $100 million. We expect noncontrolling interest to be
about $10 million or a $0.10 charge to adjusted EPS. Average diluted share count is now expected to be
116.5 million for fiscal 2020, and our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be closer to 15.5%, which
includes about 150 basis point onetime benefit related to Sensia. We continue to project free cash flow
conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. Finally, we continue to project a weaker first half of the
year with organic sales down low single digits, followed by a stronger second half of the year. And as is
typical for us, we expect weaker second quarter adjusted EPS performance versus the first quarter.

With that, I'll hand it to Jessica to start Q&A.

Jessica Kourakos
Head of Investor Relations
Thanks, Patrick. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sharon, let's take our first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Jack Meehan
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Jack on for Julian. Maybe can we start with diving into backlog trends? Can you maybe just provide
some color on what drove the sequential rise and the year-over-year rise? And then maybe within that,
any more details on solutions and services?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I'm not sure how much more color we can provide, except that, as we mentioned, backlogs are up
both year-over-year and sequentially. And I would say it was broad-based, including in North America.

Jack Meehan
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And then at the end-market level, kind of on the mid-single-digit growth for oil and gas, was this on
kind of company-specific drivers, maybe share gains? Or are you seeing kind of more positives in the end
market as a whole?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

On the organic side, there obviously has been a flattish capital spending, and we do see a slower -- a
slowing of the oil and gas organically. However, on the Sensia joint venture, because the majority of that is
focused on producing wells and not drilling new wells, we see it less susceptible to CapEx reductions, and
that gives us confidence based on our first quarter results and the outlook that double digits in that part of
our overall oil and gas business can take share and grow fast.

Operator

Next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett.

Ka Wing Lau
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

It's Karen Lau dialing in for John. So thank you for all the details on Sensia in the appendix. I was just
wondering, in terms of the core margins, it looks like you guys were making 18% core margins, excluding
the onetime items in the first quarter. But then the full year, you're guiding to around 14% margins. What
is the driver of that?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The way you can think about it, Karen, what you see in the appendix is the year-over-year
incremental piece of Sensia. It's the impact of the contribution of Schlumberger, which was higher-margin
business than what we contributed. And so therefore, when we talk about overall margin profile of Sensia,
we do expect this to be a 20% EBITDA business going forward. But this year, we think it'll be closer to
mid-teens.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Okay. But is it -- I mean, am I reading correctly that the first quarter results were better than what you're
expecting for the full year? Or is that like some...

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

So the fee that was contributed by Schlumberger and the synergy, the answer to that is yes. I would
also say that our spend increase in Sensia because we are making some investments in technology and
commercial resources. They were a little bit lighter in the first quarter than we expected. That's why you
see that margin in Q1 being a little bit better as well than what you see for the full year outlook.

Ka Wing Lau
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Got it. And then just quickly, can you remind us what's your expectation for investment spending for the
year and kind of the cadence throughout the year?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The way you can think about it, Karen, is consistent with what I mentioned to you in November, we
think the year-over-year increase will be a little bit less than 2%, and it will be first half weighted. And so
we expect it to be more than that in the first half. And in the second half, the increase year-over-year will
be minimal in terms of year-over-year spend.

Operator

Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.

Robert Paul McCarthy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

It's Robert McCarthy on for Robert McCarthy. So in any event, just wanted to -- first -- I mean, obviously,
listen, it's a very dynamic situation right now. You've had the trade deal. You've had a very encouraging
quarter. But obviously, you've had this rising potential of a pandemic, and I don't want to get too much of
a debbie downer, but how do you think about kind of your supply chain in China? How do you think about
kind of the trends and the spillover? I know it's very early, and we don't have a lot of information yet,
but could you just give us some factors to think about and what sensitivities you're looking at in terms of
exposures as you manage through the situation?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Well, first of all, Rob, the overwhelming first priority for us is to ensure that we're looking after our
people in the region. And so we're paying close attention to that to make sure that we can reduce, to the
very extent possible, their exposure. Second, and on a parallel path, we're undergoing a detailed review of
our own manufacturing footprint as well as our supply base to gauge the potential impacts. At this point,
we don't expect an impact to the quarter's performance. But as you said, it's a very dynamic situation,
and we're monitoring it hourly and looking for new inputs to help inform how we feel about the business
impact. But it's the safety and well-being of our employees first.

Robert Paul McCarthy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And then I guess the follow-up would be, just -- maybe just a little more color around Information
Solutions and Connected Services, the continued double-digit growth there. Can you talk about kind of
the continued development and collaboration with PTC, some of the wins? And maybe expand on your
comments around augmented reality, and I don't know, track and trace is something that's that started to
pick up there or is looking to be encouraging.

Blake D. Moret

9

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Rob, it's a great story for us. And with our own offerings that we've developed ourselves, plus with
partners like PTC, the Information Solutions and Connected Services as part of our offering continues
to grow strong double digits, and we're seeing it as a true differentiator in some of the fastest-growing
parts of the overall automation market like electric vehicles and life sciences. So it works perfectly
to complement the basic automation that we're providing in those industries, whether it's discrete
automotive assembly or it's process control for pharma. But as they're looking for more traceability,
as they're looking for adding the ability to transfer knowledge from older workers to newer workers,
augmented reality is a great part of that. We've mentioned before, about 1/3 of our sales of the software
in this space include augmented reality. So it all works together. It's increasing the hit rate for our MES
software because we have a broader portfolio, and it works together well. So there's a lot of positives in
this respect. And I should mention, it's not just for end users, it's also for OEMs because they're looking
for increasing the value of what they're providing. And as they look for ways to increase their flexibility,
getting closer to that 0 changeover time for packaging that is hot in the industry today, then this has a lot
of benefit for them as well. We had a win in the quarter with Harpak, who you heard from at the Investor
Day in November, as they're adding that software to the basic logics control and variable speed drives and
so on, as part of the basic automation of those systems. And then the final point, we have seen probably
a higher degree of adoption of this software on top of competitive control platforms than we originally
thought would happen.

Operator

Next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Blake, could you kind of speak maybe to the geographic mix, the organic growth by geography in the
quarter? And it just -- it seems a bit scattered here. I presume Asia was probably better than expected,
U.S. maybe a little bit weaker. But how does -- the incoming backlog being up quarter-to-quarter and
year-over-year, how does that filter into maybe the geographic growth that you expect for the full year
against kind of that midpoint of flat expectation for the -- for all of Rock?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Let me start with a couple of comments, and then Patrick may have some additional color on that.
But as you said, Asia was better than expected. Latin America, a little worse than expected. North America
and EMEA were pretty much in line with expectations. In North America, as we mentioned, we were down
about 3%, and that was largely due to declines in more Process-oriented verticals, with the exception of
oil and gas. So we saw chemical, pulp and paper and metals, and then that was offset by the growth we
mentioned in automotive, power and semiconductor. EMEA was up and oil and gas was a contributor there,
along with the recurring theme of Life Sciences. Water and wastewater was a good area for us in EMEA.
And in Asia, we were up with growth in oil and gas, Life Sciences, auto, tire and mass transit. And then
Lat Am was down a little bit, where weakness in auto and mining was partially offset by growth in power,
oil and gas and Life Sciences. So that was kind of a rundown of what we saw in Q1. In terms of how the
backlog feathers into that, obviously, mainly project, but also with some of the higher-value services as
well, particularly those included with the Connected Services part of ISCS.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Rick, maybe a little bit of color as to our assumptions by region for the full year. And so organic growth at
the midpoint is flat year-over-year. We expect both the -- both North America and EMEA to look to be a
little bit below that, and we expect both Latin America and Asia to be up a little less than 5%, about mid-
single digits. So what that implies is that we expect -- and that's embedded in our guidance, we expect
second half of the year, as I mentioned, improvement, and that includes the U.S. -- I would say, North
America.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And is -- was there any noticeable impact on the backlog and order flow around passage of the
USMCA, when you're talking about Latin America and Mexico? Was there any noteworthy improvement in
bookings or anything once that uncertainty was more or less lifted?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Not yet is the short answer. I mean it's a positive step and supporting the concept of free and fair trade
that we've talked a lot about in the past. So we think it's a good thing, but we haven't seen the results on
our performance yet.

Operator

Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I was intrigued, Blake, because you call out ESG as a potential driving force for your customers to
implement your suite of offerings. Conceptually, I think we can understand that there's just a basic
efficiency play here that plays into ESG. Could you maybe provide some examples of where you're seeing
that make a material difference in customers' decisions?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, as you said, everything we do is about productivity, and a huge part of that productivity is efficiency.
So you take our power control offering, variable speed drives, which reduce dramatically the amount
of energy that's required to run industrial processes. A tremendous amount of the world's energy is
consumed in factories, and simply not running full across the line when you don't need it, it saves a ton of
energy, and variable speed drives, low voltage and medium voltage, continue to be a very strong part of
our offering. Specifically, in the new eco-industrial segment that we introduced in November, talking about
our support of renewables, of water and wastewater treatment and mass transit, those are all industries
that reduce the amount of energy that are required. And there was no coincidence that we created
that new segment because we're going to be doing more in that space. And then finally, safety. That's
something we've talked a lot about in the past. And in terms of the technology to be able to automate
safety, but also the services that we've provided, that's an important part of ESG. We think that we're #1
in the world when you pull all the discrete and Process safety technology together, and that remains a
really important area for us.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe drilling into auto a little bit. As you said, it surprised to the upside, and you
gave some good color around some regional patterns there in your prepared remarks. But just the outlook
for kind of soft overall light vehicle demand, is that having any impact, as far as you can tell, on kind of
the backlog of the longer-cycle business in terms of OEM plans to bring new models to market or planned
model changeovers? How are you thinking about that?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we are guiding to about flat currently with the auto -- overall Automotive segment for the year. I'd
say the growth is highest in the specific EV drivetrain portion of this segment. As people are bringing that
capacity online, whether it's the brand owner or it's the tier supplier of -- and by the way, that contributed
a lot to our performance. That was a little better than expectations in Q1. It was battery assembly that
was a specific bright spot for us there. That's offset to some extent by the reality of a weaker SAAR count

for fewer vehicles than we saw a couple of years ago being bought. Certainly, a lot of the brand owners
are reducing their sedan portfolio, but there's still a fair bit of project spend there and in the -- particularly
in the SUV side of things. And the growth that we saw in the quarter was primarily due to project spend,
MRO stabilized, but we didn't see any real growth in MRO in the quarter.

Next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Can you just talk about -- a little bit more about what you're seeing on the Food and Beverage side and
OEM? And then maybe just a bit of color on how you see kind of quarterly organic progressing as you
move through the rest of the year?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I'll start with the Food and Beverage. We did see some delays in food. But one of the bright spots,
and I mentioned it, is we actually saw mid-single-digit growth in packaging OEMs. And it's early, but that's
sometimes a leading indicator as people are putting packaging in place, and we did see that across the
regions. We also heard anecdotally from the packaging OEMs that their backlog is fairly good, and so
those are encouraging signs. One area of particular strength for us, it's small but it's still noteworthy,
India packaging OEMs. And I say it's noteworthy because India may be the most competitive market
in the world. And for us to have success there is a really good testament to the functionality and the
ability to get to competitive levels there. I was actually there and visited with some customers, including
some packaging OEMs, in December. And I think there's some great opportunities there, and we're going
to continue to look at what we can do to grow our presence even faster in the Indian market. But in
general, packaging OEMs were up. We also saw some strength specifically in beverage. We had a real nice
conversion at a beverage OEM that's going to a well-known beverage user, and so that was also good in
the quarter.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then just the quarterly, yes, progression on organic?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So see, for the full year, we remain at 0% organic growth. The -- obviously, Q1, we did minus 1%. I
think Q2, low single digits, meaning it's close to what we did in Q1. We don't expect it to get worse than
what we did in Q1. And then for the balance of the year, I'd say Q4 organic growth, a little bit better than
Q3.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. So it seems to me that like -- how do you get to kind of the low of the range then if that's the case?
I mean...

Patrick P. Goris

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Yes. Okay. Got it. Got it. I guess, just with the start to the year, it seemed to be kind of trending better on
that front.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

It's still early. The -- what we see in our backlog is encouraging. But with 1 quarter to go, we think our
current range remains appropriate.

Operator

Next, we have Joe Giordano with Cowen.

Robert G. Jamieson
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Rob on for Joe. I just wonder if you could talk about Process a little bit and the weakness you saw
in chemicals. If you could just give us some color there, that would be great.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Chemical, we've continued a trend that I think we had seen in the past with chemical, and we did see
that as the single largest contributor in the quarter. That was primarily in North America. We actually saw
an increase in chemical in EMEA, down in Asia and slightly down in Latin America. So it's offset -- as we
mentioned, we actually saw growth in oil and gas, but the chemical was down in the quarter, and most of
that was concentrated in North America.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

As we said on the earlier -- within Process, oil and gas was up, but generally, process industries were weak
in the quarter.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

I would also mention -- I would mention just for background that in chemical, a lot of our exposure is
in specialty chemical, it's not as much in the bulk chemical. That's our traditional focus. There's some
overcapacity that we're currently seeing in chemical and some effects from some of the consolidation
that's been going on in the industry over the last couple of years as well. So that's some additional color
that would certainly apply to North America.

Robert G. Jamieson
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's great, very helpful. And then just a quick one. Just on EV, I know you said you had strong gains
there during the quarter. Just wondered if you could talk about China EV specifically and what you've been
seeing there? Any changes?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So China, auto in China has been down Q3, Q4 of last year, and we saw that continue into the first
quarter of fiscal '20, and that includes EVS. And so we've seen some of these support or these subsidies
go away in China. And generally -- and obviously, it's still a little bit lumpy because it's relatively small,
but EV and auto in general, we've certainly seen some weakness in China. Interestingly, auto in Asia was
up for us quite a bit. And the reason there is we're making some progress with some of the EV companies
outside of China, including some companies in Korea, for example.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Yes. In that specific application that Patrick is mentioning in Korea was the battery assembly, which is
a great application for us. We've mentioned before that in comparison to the subtractive manufacturing
processes for internal combustion engines, for boring cylinders and things like that, that require a lot of
C&C content, battery assembly and motor winding and EV drive train, we have a high readiness to serve
there. And that's why we think that long term, EV is a great market for us to be in.

Next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So apologies if I missed it earlier on the call. But Blake, one thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day
that I want to see how that is playing out is kind of the lower cyclicality of Rockwell maybe versus what
folks would have been accustomed to 5 or 10 years ago or even more. That it does seem like at a point
in time when other folks are seeing kind of a more depressed outlook that Rockwell's hanging in there a
bit more stable. I guess, one, is that consistent with the way you guys are seeing the world? And two, is
there kind of a coiled spring on the back end, where you can see customers have a willingness to spend on
projects, but they're maybe not executing yet? So have we lost some of that upward mobility in exchange
for lower cyclicality?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I wouldn't draw the causality between the 2. But as we've talked about a lot in November, that
greater resiliency to economic cycles is something that we're making very explicit steps to address. And so
in addition to things like Information Solutions and Connected Services providing a lot of increased value
to customers and pulling through some of our traditional products, it does have an impact that we think
is already being felt in terms of kind of clipping the trough of some of the normal volatility. Now it's still
a relatively small part of our business, right? But that compounding of strong double-digit growth, plus
what we do with acquisitions having more recurring revenue, makes it more important each year. And last
year, we think, for instance, Information Solutions and Connected Services added about 1 point of organic
growth to what we did. And in a relatively low growth year overall, that's meaningful. So we're going to
continue to work on that in terms of both our organic development, the products and the environment to
be able to manage recurring revenue, but it's also a consideration as we look for companies to acquire and
the percentage of recurring revenue.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on investment. Again, apologies if you covered already. It
seems like some of that got pulled forward into the first quarter as maybe demand was a little bit better
than expected. How should we think about the sensitivity from here on kind of that full year investment
budget? Is it at a healthy level to where if you're at the top end of the revenue range that the overall
bucket doesn't increase? Or how are you thinking about the sensitivity over the remaining 3 quarters?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Josh. So what we mentioned was that the spending in -- the year-over-year increase in the first half
will be higher than in the second half. Actually, the second half, the way we have it dialed in now is flattish
from a year-over-year spend point of view. However, if -- depending on what happens with our outlook
for the year and if we end up doing better what we do at the midpoint, clearly, we could decide to release
more investments. There is a very long list of attractive investments that we are looking through all the
time, and we could decide to do more.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

I know you've covered a lot of ground already, but -- and I know we tend to focus more on the end market
outlooks, but I'm just wondering about the geographics. And thinking about how geographically things
are playing out relative to your initial kind of guidance in November. In particular, North America, down
3.3% this quarter. And I know North America has been trending weak for some time now, but with ISM
where it is and IP negative, how does that look in North America specifically compared to your initial kind
of outlook? And kind of what's balancing against that if it is weaker than you expected?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So as you said, the macro can generally be characterized as weak and there were some downward
revisions. In opposition to that is some of the backlog that was built in the first quarter. And some of the
things, again, like the IS and CS, the Information Solutions and Connected Services, that aren't going to
be as coupled directly to some of the broader indicators. If in those areas, we can demonstrate a relatively
quick return on that investment, which is often from OpEx, then we think that, that's going to be more
resilient than some of the other more capital-related spending.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And then, Nigel, for Q1, we would say that North America and EMEA came in basically in line with our
expectations. Asia Pacific came in better, and Latin America came in weaker. And for the full year compare
at the midpoint, we think that North America and EMEA will be down a bit, and we think that Asia Pacific
and Latin America will be up mid-single digits, a little less than 5%.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's helpful. And then a quick one on -- obviously, A&S is holding up a lot better through the soft
patch than we've seen historically. And I know dollars are flowing to the IS layer. But can you just maybe
-- is there any way to quantify kind of the relationship with PTC and how that's helping to maybe improve
the top performance of A&S? And any color there would be helpful.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I'll make a general comment to that, and that is manufacturing -- advanced manufacturing is
becoming a much more noteworthy part of a company's overall digital transformation plans. So we see
companies like Stanley Black & Decker, as they talk about fairly significant reductions in cost, they're
being asked to go a little deeper and explain how they're going to get there. And we're finding ourselves
a part of those explanations as to how we're going to be able to reduce OpEx for these companies. By
having the relationship with PTC and having the increasingly important ISCS offering, we're going to
have those broad discussions at a higher level than if we were just talking about programmable controller
performance or some of the other elements of basic automation. So it allows us to get higher in the
organization and to play a more meaningful part of those overall discussions, whereas if we didn't have
that kind of breadth, then we might find ourselves playing a little more defense in some of the core
components. So that's, at a high level, how a partnership with a company like PTC will pull through
some performance in the core products because they all go together, that basic automation and then the
information that sits on top of it to draw insights from the data that's born in our products.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

We have a question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Blake, you might have talked about this earlier, but on Sensia, you mentioned that operating performance
was better than expected. Maybe you could just talk about -- give a little more color on what that means.
Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces with Sensia in the guide that you gave last quarter for the year. I
think you talked about $0.05, excluding interest. Could it be better than that in 2020?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean, we're pushing the team, obviously, to perform as if they're in an open field because we
think they are. We think that what they're offering is somewhat unique in the market. And our original
hypothesis that there was a relatively low level of basic automation in the oil field, particularly the onshore
oilfield, is proving to be true. And so the things that we're talking about as we're selling the traditional
offerings into that space are things like measurement devices as well as artificial lift and so on. The ability
to come in and to weave that together is really meeting with a lot of interest. And some of these are our
existing customers, with customers that in the past have bought products as needed from us. But now
they're seeing that we can play a much more significant part in their overall strategy. And I had a chance
to talk with some of these customers over the last year in Latin America and in Europe, and we're excited
and even more excited after the first quarter's results because these companies are voting with their
wallets. And again, it's a solutions-based approach. It's the measurement devices, it's the artificial lift, it's
the software, and then it's the delivery capability to bring this all together to reduce their cost to produce
a barrel of oil.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And Blake, I just wanted to follow up on your comment on Latin America. Is the incremental weakness
or the moderation that you saw really focused on mining and/or just tough comparisons? There's been a
little bit of unrest down there. You just mentioned oil and gas pretty strong. So what are you seeing down
there?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So mechanically, we still have some tough comps against that big Codelco project in mining that
we've talked about over the last year or so. And that project is going very well, by the way. In general,
in Latin America, we saw modest growth in Mexico and Brazil, but it was offset by weakness in Argentina
and Chile, and of course, a good component of that would be would be mining related. Mexico was up low
single digits, and Brazil was also up low single digits. So I think you're right that some of it is comps. We
expect mining to be about flat for the year for us in Latin America.
