Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Wabtec quarterly earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please
note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Kristine Elizabeth Kubacki
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, Pat Dugan; and Senior VP of Finance, John
Mastalerz.

Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures, were posted on
our website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com. Some
statements we're making are forward-looking and best -- based on the best view of the world and our
business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking
statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentations.

We will also discuss non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and
reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics.

And now I will turn the call over to Rafael.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. I hope you and your
families remain healthy and safe.

Turning to Slide 3. While we continue to see the impact of COVID globally, a gradual recovery across
the global freight and transit rail markets is continuing. North America freight volumes and equipment
utilization sequentially improved in the third quarter, and transit ridership is also slowly resuming. These
directional trends, along with the focused performance of our teams, are reflected in our third quarter
results.

Total sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion, driven largely by international freight markets and a recovery
in transit, but offset by global disruption due to the COVID pandemic. Total adjusted operating income was
$293 million, impacted primarily by the drop in freight sales, but somewhat offset by a more than 20%
increase in Transit segment income.

Adjusted operating margin was 15.7%, driven by cost actions and execution on our synergies as well as
margin improvement in Transit, which was up 270 basis points for the quarter due to synergies, improved
productivity and better project execution.

In third quarter, we had a solid cash conversion, with cash flow from operations of $230 million, driven by
good working capital management. This allowed us to further strengthen the balance sheet by reducing
debt by over $200 million in the quarter. Our liquidity position remained strong at $1.9 billion. Total
multiyear backlog was over $21 billion despite current market conditions.

Finally, we ended up the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.95, further reinforcing that our teams are
continuing to take the necessary steps to control what we can, protect the long-term growth of the
company and deliver shareholder value.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

In the area of synergies, we are accelerating our progress, and we are on track to deliver $150 million of
net synergies in 2020 as well as deliver on the full run rate of $250 million in synergies before the end of
2022.

To achieve these goals, we continue to take actions on structural cost. And in the third quarter, we further
reduced headcount by another 3%, taking our total reductions to roughly 13% year-over-year. We also
have reduced our operational footprint year-over-year, and we are actively driving cost reductions through
our lean initiatives. To date, we have exited about 75% of the shared services from GE Transportation
merger, ahead of the schedule, and we are on track to exit over 90% of these activities by year-end.

Overall, our team delivered a strong quarter in a challenging and dynamic environment and won several
orders, including a significant deal with New York City Transit to extend battery technology to passenger
transit and drive down emissions. This is a key win that directly aligns with our own sustainability strategy,
as we outlined in our 2020 sustainability report issued earlier this week. We also closed a $160 million
multiyear mining order for advanced dry systems, our single largest mining order to date.

In digital electronics, we won our first order with the Class I railroads for our Advanced Trip Optimizer
zero-to-zero solution. This deal will reduce emissions and will drive increased fuel savings, and is another
significant step towards autonomous rail.

Finally, we had a solid quarter in Transit, winning new brakes, doors and HVAC contracts in Australia,
Germany, France and the U.K. as well as our first order for the Metro Industries most advanced braking
system, the MetropFlexx, in Asia.

Looking ahead, the rail transportation market continues to recover from trough levels in the second
quarter. We are encouraged by the evidence of a recovery, as noted by the ongoing improvement in our
international freight markets, the sequential improvement in North America rail volumes and increasing
global transit activity.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat who will share more on the quarter, segment performance and our
overall financial position. Pat?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Rafael, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4, sales for the third quarter were $1.9
billion, which reflects a 7% decrease versus the prior year. The decline in year-over-year sales was mainly
due to the ongoing disruption across our Freight and Transit segments caused by COVID-19. For the
quarter, operating income was $207 million and adjusted operating income was $293 million, which was
down 12% year-over-year, mainly driven by lower sales and disruption in our operations as a result of the
pandemic, offset somewhat by variable cost actions and the continued realization of synergies.

In the third quarter, adjusted operating income excluded pre-tax expenses of $87 million, of which $70
million was for noncash amortization and $16 million of restructuring and transaction costs. Please see
Appendix D in our press release for the reconciliation of these details.

Now looking at some of the detailed line items. Adjusted SG&A declined 4% year-over-year to $241
million, which is excluding $12 million of the restructuring and transaction expenses I just discussed.
SG&A expense benefited from structural cost actions across the business and the realization of synergies.
As expected, we did see a resumption of certain discretionary and compensation expenses that we
eliminated during the depths of the pandemic. For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A to be around
$900 million.

Engineering expenses decreased to $37 million or down 38% from last year. This was largely due to the
lower volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. Amortization expenses were $70 million.
For 2020, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $285 million and depreciation expense to
be about $180 million.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

In the third quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.67 and adjusted earnings per diluted
share of $0.95. The details which bridge GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.95
can be found attached to our press release.

As of September 30, our multiyear backlog was $21.4 billion. Backlog is about flat quarter-over-quarter.
Our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multiyear backlog, was $5.2 billion and continues to
provide good visibility across both Freight and Transit segments.

Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 5. Across the Freight segment, total sales decreased
7% to $1.2 billion in the third quarter. In terms of product lines, equipment sales were up 35% year-over-
year as a result of higher locomotive deliveries, which, as we have discussed, can often vary quarter-to-
quarter due to timing. In the fourth quarter, we expect locomotive deliveries to be slightly higher when
compared to the third quarter, but down versus last year.

In line with improving freight traffic from the second quarter, our services sales improved sequentially,
but were down 19% from a seasonally strong period last year. This was largely driven by lower part sales
due to continued record high locomotive parkings as well as the timing of mods, deliveries and overhauls.
We expect our parts sales to continue to improve with the gradual recovery in the freight volumes and
unparking of locomotives.

Digital electronics sales were down 13% year-over-year as orders shifted to the right in North America
due to COVID disruption. Overall, we continue to see a significant pipeline of opportunities in our digital
electronics product line, providing productivity and improved safety for our customers.

Component sales were down 16% year-over-year on a 45% lower railcar build versus the prior year,
demonstrating the diversification within our components business. Since September, we have seen early
signs of improvement in demand for aftermarket railcar components as more railcars are beginning to
come out of storage.

Despite the top line headwinds and higher mix of OE locomotives during the quarter, our execution on
synergies continued to drive positive impact as reflected in our segment adjusted operating income of
$234 million and adjusted margin of 18.9%. Finally, segment backlog was $17.8 billion, down just slightly
from the prior quarter.

Turning to Slide 6. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased 6% year-over-year to $628 million,
driven largely by disruptions stemming from the COVID-19. OE sales were down 2% year-over-year.
It's important to note that this is a strong improvement from the second quarter due in large part to
improving transit ridership and service levels around the globe. Aftermarket sales were down 10% from
last year. We remain positive on the aftermarket and expect sales to continue to improve as transit
services increase globally.

Adjusted segment operating income was $75 million, which was up 21% year-over-year for an adjusted
operating margin of 12%. Across the segment, we continued to drive down cost and improve project
execution, as noted by our strong operating performance. While early days, we are pleased with the
momentum underway, and we'll continue to execute on more actions to drive increased profitability for the
segment. Finally, Transit segment backlog was $3.5 billion, which was up slightly versus last quarter.

Now let's turn to our financial position on Slide 7. Cash flow generation during the quarter was strong
at $230 million, driven largely by working capital management, including improved inventory levels and
higher customer deposits. I'd also note that there was no material change from the AR securitization in
the quarter. We had about $15 million of onetime impacts on cash flow during the quarter and about $170
million for the full year, mainly due to prior year restructuring, transaction and litigation charges.

Throughout the quarter, we continued to strengthen our financial position and reduced net debt by
approximately $460 million since the same quarter a year ago. Our adjusted leverage ratio at the end
of the third quarter was 2.6x, down slightly from the last quarter. And our liquidity is still robust at $1.9
billion.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

In summary, our balance sheet is strong, and we are confident we can drive solid cash flow generation,
giving us the liquidity and flexibility to execute our strategic plans.

With that, let's move to Slide 8, and I will turn the call back over to Rafael.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Pat. Looking ahead, we are seeing a gradual recovery across most Freight and Transit end
markets as global economic activity and commuter travel improves. In North America, rail volumes
increased dramatically from the second quarter due to a broad recovery in agricultural, intermodal, metals
and automotive volumes. Locomotive parkings after peaking to a record high in the second quarter have
improved, but are still more than 20% higher than pre-COVID levels. As railroads enter into recovery and
we accelerate technology improvements, we expect demand for reliability and productivity to be even
greater, putting us in a position of strength for modernizations, overhauls and parts demand.

In terms of North America railcar builds, railcars are slowly moving out of storage. However, more than
25% of the North American railcar fleet still remains in storage. Builders are taking continued step to slow
production lines. The industry forecast currently indicates that the railcar build for 2020 will be less than
30,000 cars.

Internationally, where economies have started to open, we continue to see encouraging signs. In Brazil,
demand remained steady with greater dependency on agriculture products following a record harvest. In
Australia, rail activity has shown good momentum following the COVID lockdown. In Kazakhstan, year-
to-date, car volumes are up, driven by growth in volumes from China. And in India, after long lockdowns,
activity has recently improved with the gradual reopening of the region. Overall, we have a strong order
pipeline internationally in places like Brazil, Russia, CIS, Africa and Australia. And we expect revenue
growth in several of these markets throughout 2021.

In mining, end markets remain stable, and we remain optimistic that the mining market conditions are
improving.

Transitioning to the Transit sector, ridership is continuing to recover from historic lows, particularly in
Europe and Asia and in line with an operational recovery in Transit globally.

Looking forward, the long-term market drivers for the passenger transport remain strong. Infrastructure
spending and support for green initiatives continues to be a focus, especially as governments globally look
to rail for clean, safe and efficient transport.

Turning to guidance for the year. We are updating our sales guidance to $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, which
is the higher end of our previous range. And we are updating adjusted EPS guidance to the range of $3.75
to $3.85, due largely to our operational execution to date, ongoing actions to align variable and fixed
costs to the volume realities we face and visibility to our backlog. Finally, we remain confident in delivering
strong cash generation for the year.

Turning to Slide 9 and to conclude, I'm proud of the strong execution by the team in the third quarter,
despite a challenging environment. Our team remains vigilant on monitoring COVID-19 globally and is
laser-focused on keeping our employees safe, while executing through today's volatile environment to
deliver for our customers.

As we go forward, we remain committed to executing on our strategic plan, reducing costs, aggressively
managing cash, delivering on our synergy targets and focusing on what we can control. We will continue
to lean into the strong long-term fundamentals of this company and invest in technologies that advance
our competitive advantage, help us successfully manage today's market headwinds over the long term and
emerge as a more resilient company.

Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to personally thank each and every member of the
Wabtec team for all that they are doing. This year has been a significant stress test for our organization
as we have navigated a complex integration, an industrial recession, a market reset in addition to the

pandemic. Yet, despite all these headwinds, we are performing well, and we have continued to deliver as
demonstrated by our synergy execution, strong cash flow and overall performance.

Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the constructive trends we are seeing across the global transit and
freight market. Demand should continue to improve sequentially across most of the portfolio. Recovery will
remain somewhat mixed, but our business is uniquely positioned to drive long-term profitable growth.

With that, I'll turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of our discussion. Kristine?

Kristine Elizabeth Kubacki
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, we are

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Could we talk to Transit a little bit? I think the performance in that segment was quite a bit more resilient
than folks, including myself, would have thought. Is there a way just -- given the backdrop of COVID, it
sounds like Europe and Asia are starting to recover quite a bit faster. Is there a way to kind of quantify the
headwind that you're seeing from North America? And then just how do you think that segment evolves in
terms of the future just with COVID and the concern folks will never get back on a commuter rail again?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Let me start first with the following. I mean we're working, of course, very closely with our customers. I
think while transit authorities around the globe, they are seeing operating budget constraints, I think there
is really a strong support in terms of the government stimulus for them to navigate through this. At this
point, we haven't seen any project cancellations. We're continuing to work with customers. And I think the
dynamics at this point, I mean, they remain positive. I think there's still going to be volatility in terms of
all -- some of the measures that you see being taking place in places like Europe. But we don't feel that,
that's going to go back to, what I'll call, the worst trough levels of COVID. So overall, positive trends.

Well, a couple of lot of comments here. If you think about Transit, I think it's been slower in the U.S.
versus other markets. I call out that the U.S. market represents only 15% of what we do in the Transit
market. So I think that's also not an important element. And with that, I think I'm really proud to see
how the team has embraced change. They are driving improvement. We see that coming into our orders
backlog, I think I've said it before, and the trend continues. Our backlog today has got margins that are
100%, at least higher than they were a year ago. We see improved execution. And I think we're moving in
the right direction with that business. So we're committed to continue to improve margins over time.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just a question on margins within Freight. If I recall, the equipment margins were a little
bit -- could be a little bit lower just in terms of the mix. Can you help quantify if there's a way to do that,
sort of, the mix impact from sort of the product dynamics in the quarter within Freight in terms of could it
-- would it have been better, I guess, if the equipments weren't so strong?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

You got it. So I mean, margins were primarily impacted by mix. And Allison, I mean, just very
straightforward, right? So when I've got equipment growing at 35% in the quarter, and at the same time,
I've got services, which is a much larger business with digital electronics, I mean, services was down 19%,
with digital electronics at 13%, that's really what drove that. I mean we can have those variation issues
based on mix. I just -- we remain focused on improving margins. I think we're taking a lot of the right
actions in different areas. We're delivering on synergies. We've been taking action on SG&A and indirect
costs. And we're going to continue to move in that direction.

Operator

Your next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

So I wanted to start with the question on the North American freight aftermarket business. I'm curious
how that trended sequentially in the third quarter and your expectations going forward? And maybe within
that business, it would be helpful to hear about the cadence of mods, 2Q to 3Q, and maybe even 3Q to 4Q
as well, just because I know that can move things around a good bit?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So let me take a step back first with the second quarter on services because I think it's important
just to understand, I mean, think of carloads in the second quarter were down close to 20%. We saw on
the other side, our revenues came down about 9%. Now when you come into the third quarter, so there's
clearly a lag there. When you come into the third quarter, while carloads were down, I think, 7.5%, we've
seen, I'll call it, improvement in about 1%. Here's some things to keep in mind, right? I think there is
naturally a lag there. What I'll tell you, what we're seeing from a services perspective, there's clearly
a pickup in terms of, I'll call it, recovery. It started first in our international markets. And we saw fleets
getting unparked. And I think we're seeing volumes continue to move in the right direction. There was
a lag into North America. But we've also seen that improving as things continue to move forward. It's
a shorter cycle business, but the trends that I look at right now, Justin, they're positive for the services
business.

And you asked specifically on mods. I think there is pent-up demand being created in terms of fleets that
didn't run. So overhauls that have pushed to the right; potential investments in the fleets that have not
been done in the course of the last couple of years, that have also pushed to the right; and that pent-
up demand is going to come. So we do expect growth in mods moving forward. I will keep away from
providing you any specifics in quarter-over-quarter because we can have variation on that, but I think
positive dynamics there in the services business.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. And secondly, I wanted to ask about your thoughts on buybacks, just given where the valuation
metrics for the stock are today? And as you think about closing that valuation gap to the market and
peers, were there any major takeaways from the investor perception study that you recently completed?
Just curious if there are any actions you're planning to take after completing that exercise?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So let me start with the last part. Yes, we have done that study, really great churn out. So I think the
amount of feedback was great, very specific, very candor answers. So we're continuing to work on that.
With that, a couple of things in mind. Number one, I think there is an element of providing, I'll call, a little
more details in terms of some of our segments, which we're going to work with you to make sure that
we're looking to those as we go into next year.

On capital allocation, what I'd like to tell you is, number one, we are committed to drive organic growth
and continue the R&D investments that really drive differentiation and innovation for our customers.
That's top of minds. And of course, we're looking reprioritizing it as we look at current environment,
very committed there. We're also confident about our ability to drive cash and to reduce debt. Just think
about -- of just last 12 months. We have paid down $490 million of debt. And at the same time, we were
driving over $190 million of both stock buybacks and dividend. Right now and as I look at it, our current
stock price presents significant opportunity to return value to shareholders. We currently have a share
repurchase authorization for $400 million, and we are intensifying buybacks. That's a focus now.

Operator

Your next question is from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

I was wondering about sort of the resource -- the return of resources in the Freight segment as we see
volumes continue to improve in 4Q, and potentially, first half of next year and beyond. Specifically, on the
headcount side, what are the learnings that you've had from sort of this downturn or the ability to -- is
there the ability to hold off on bringing folks back to try to drive maybe stronger sequential incremental
margins than what we saw just initially here in the third quarter?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

The answer is yes. Number one, I think if you look at our headcount numbers, we reduced 3% quarter-
over-quarter, 13% versus a year ago. I think there's a lot of learnings that came from just the COVID
period. I mean we've looked at different areas. And I got to tell you, I mean, there is an opportunity here
to win even more productivity for certain areas of the company if you work remotely. There's some other
ones that, that's not the case. But we do see the opportunity to drive, I'll call, increased leverage, and we
will be growing margins as a result of volume growth ahead.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a bigger picture question on sort of synergies. So I think
you talked about achieving full run rate out -- some time during 2022. Can you talk about some of the
sort of puts and takes that might influence that timing a little bit? Sort of maybe forgetting about sort of
the macro to some degree, I think, with what's in your control, are there any potential drivers that could
maybe pull that forward a little bit? What could they be? And sort of what's the risk to kind of pushing that
out a little bit?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I'll tell you what's pushing that out a little bit right now, and it's just the function of volume. But with the
guidance of what we provided of the $150 million for the year, we're committed to that, and we're going
to deliver on that. We're tracking to that. We have not broken down that on the quarter, but we're tracking
to be north of $150 million for the year. And we will deliver the $250 million before end of next year. So
moving in that direction, what I'll say is, of course, if volume conditions improve, it can only help us there.

Operator

Your next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.

Robert Cameron Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

So my question is just on Transit. You had another quarter of good progress on margin. And I wonder if
you would just give a general update on what sort of workflows are left to come? I mean you've rolled off
some of the unprofitable business. Just -- could you just give us an update on your strategy for continued
improvement there?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'd say just this is ongoing work, right? You have a backlog that you've got to work through. I think
the comments I'd make is, I think for more than a year now, we have been really disciplined about the
quality of that backlog and the orders we take, and so the specific terms and conditions that come with
those orders. And that's where I say that we've got over 100 basis points of margin improvement on that
backlog. So it's a continuation.

I think execution is a lot better. I think we've got improvement in terms of on-time delivery. The team has
really embraced the principles of lean across our operations. We're going through a significant exercise on
making sure that we've got, what I'll call a more -- just a more efficient footprint. I mean I -- and without
mentioning the business here, I run sometimes into businesses where you have 8 locations, different

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

groups of engineers in each one of those locations designing things to, a lot of times, different spec,
sometimes to support like similar customers. We have the opportunity here to have, what I'll call, centers
of excellence when it comes down to engineering. We have some of those established in places like India.
So we have the opportunity to significantly reduce costs.

In reality, I really don't need those 8 sites. I can do that with maybe 4 or 5. And I think that's something
that we're going to continue to pursue. We're being very disciplined about it. But we're going to continue
to drive margins up. So we're committed to the framework that we've highlighted before, which is over
100 basis points in average per year. I think we see the opportunity to do better this year. And we're not
going to be pushing for anything less than another 100 next year.

Robert Cameron Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

That's very helpful. And I'm sorry for the clarification. But how much is left of unfavorable contracts and
backlog that will flow through to positive margin at this point?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think the one contract that we've been more open about it was the U.K. project. That runs out
fundamentally by the end of this year. So there's very minimal left, I think, for the first quarter of next
year. But we've gotten -- I mean there's a backlog of contracts that will continue to work. I think the
important to say is, we're committed to drive margin improvement with all the levers we have. But Pat, I
don't know if you want to comment on it?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

No, I just think that it's worth mentioning that we're still a run rate of about $25 million of revenue
each quarter. It's flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and it's at a margin that's right around
breakeven. So that -- there's no kind of element of that, that has made this margin better than in other
quarters. This is really -- the margin improvement has come from the things that Rafael talked about, cost
actions, efficiencies, synergies, all those items and things that we outlined earlier and are executing on
now.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So the headcount reductions are really coming across the business. I mean this is not in one specific area.

Your next question is from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

If you can just maybe comment high level at your thoughts for Freight in 2021. I think the cadence of OE
versus your services and your digital business went a little bit differently than we would have expected
this quarter, but it sounds like there's some pent-up demand and you're expecting growth in mods going
forward. You talked about orders shifting to the right in digital electronics. So do you think that there's
pent-up demand there?

And then you had obviously mentioned a mining service -- or a mining contract or a multiyear order. Is
that going to start to flow through next year? And kind of help us think about how locos are shaping up?

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

So let me give you a sense of our end markets. Of course, I'm not going to get into the elements here of
giving guidance into 2021. But the way I look at our end markets, let me just start with maybe the Transit
piece of it. I think we're continuing to see positive signs of recovery. If you look at our backlog right now,
it's larger than it was a year ago. And I think we're continuing to see good trends there.

The second piece would probably come down to really, I'll call, the Freight side. I think we're positive on
services. As I mentioned before, I think we've seen the pickup on services from the trough levels in the
second quarter start first in the international markets. Then we saw that a little bit of a lag that then came
into North America. And I think we see positive trends there. I think there's of course -- there is a shorter
nature of the cycle of that business. So things tend to pick up faster.

Now when you go to the equipment side, I think we're kind of, well, seeing similar dynamics, meaning,
if you think about the pipeline of opportunities that we were working versus 6 months ago, we see
significant improvement. It started once again in the international markets. I think there is positive signs
on some of these pipeline actually converting into the fourth quarter, which means even on a possibility,
and specifically, in one of those markets to already deliver sort of being revenues into 2021. But we've got
to see that taking, I'll call, a broader impact across international markets.

I think, ultimately, you're going to see that happening in North America, but there's, of course, a lag
there. And when you look at our equipment business, there's an element of, I'll call, longer cycle into that
perspective. But as you highlighted, I think there's pent-up demand in terms of just digitalization that
didn't happen of fleets during this year and that has pushed out many elements of maintenance to the
right. So there's pent-up demand in that regard.

With that being said, there's, of course, a lot of volatility still. We're working hard. There's a lot of focus
in working very closely with our customers because I think we can provide them significant opportunities
here to accelerate some of this, I'll call, investment in the fleet. Keep in mind, I think there's been an
underinvestment in the fleets, and the fleet is aging. And the good news is, we are accelerating a lot of the
investments we've done in terms of technology to improve, I'll call, efficiency in those fleets.

So if you think about those mods and those overhauls, I expect to be able to deliver to the customer
increased fuel efficiency. I expect to increase reliability on those fleets. And with our digital electronics
portfolio, we do expect to have an opportunity there to also increase technology. We've just talked about
an order we got on zero-to-zero with a Class I in North America. That's another building block towards
automation. The significance of that, that opens up really room for me to introduce that into all auto Class
Is. Think of like -- products like Trip Optimizer, this is like something that builds on the top of that. So I
think we've got some good dynamics here to work from.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then just on Freight margins for the fourth quarter. I think you've historically talked about a 20% to
25% decremental margin framework in Freight. Obviously, it was a little higher this quarter given the mix.
But would you expect it, given that you're expecting OE to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter,
to go back to that framework or potentially be a little bit better as the mix improves?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So again, staying away from commenting on mix and specifics on the quarter, what I'd say is we're
confident with the guidance we've provided, and we're committed to hit that guidance. And with that, I
think there's also an element of cash flows. And I think we're seeing all of our teams working through
that. There's of course, headwinds into the quarter, but we feel strong about the guidance we're providing
at this point.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Rafael, I was pleasantly surprised by the booking strength in Freight, really strong book-to-bill, even as
you had really strong deliveries in the quarter. Can you just expand on your prepared remarks in terms
of where you're seeing pockets of strength from orders? And I think you alluded to building international
locomotive project pipeline as well. Would you mind just expanding on those 2 areas, please?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So when I talk about the pipeline of opportunities and the option to convert those into orders, I think
we're seeing some positive signs in places like Latin America, and we have the opportunity here to convert
some of these orders already in the fourth quarter. The team feels strong about it. We're seeing similar
trends in places like Kazakhstan. And well, there's picked up the activity in some other markets, which I'd
rather not open up at this point, as, I mean we're certainly -- we face strong competition wherever we go,
and we want to make sure that we continue to progress in that direction.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And the bookings in the quarter, can you just expand on what drove such a strong bookings quarter
in a really tough environment?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think a piece of it was the order that we announced on New York City Transit. That was certainly a
significant element of that. It's a big opportunity for us here to continue to expand on the, I'll call,
electrification of our markets. So this battery, electric, locomotive, we see this as a great solution for our
customers. There has been a great degree of interest. And we're moving into, what I'll call, the Phase 2 of
that with a couple of different customers. So we expect that to continue.

And the other piece I would mention to you is mining. I think mining has demonstrated resilience. And
even as we go forward here, I think there's really an element of resilience, especially when we look at iron
ore, copper and some specific commodities. So that's also another resilient part of the business.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And can you talk about how the productivity ramp has gone on the facilities in India, in particular?
Are you getting the productivity that you're targeting?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So 2 things. There has been a significant improvement in productivity and in efficiency. I look at the last 2
years, which significantly improved the product -- the profitability of the contracts that we are executing.
So it's a positive there. When you talk about the last quarter, I mean, it's, of course -- it's been very
disruptive. I mean between COVID hit, between monsoon season, I can't say things have been necessarily
easy. But I think the team is continuing to progress. We have delivered more than 130 locomotives at this
point. And I'd say the team is very much committed to deliver the minimum of 100 locomotives per year.
So we feel positive about the dynamics. But very tough dynamics in the course of the last 90-plus days.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

So Rafael, can you just talk directionally how you see the loco and railcar markets for next year,
directionally just sort of up or down or flattish? And then I'm wondering, can you talk at all about some of
the things you're doing with electric or alternative locos on the Freight side?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So a couple of things. I mean on the freight cars side, I think you all look at the same, I'll call, reports
we do. I think for this year, the number for freight cars is probably around 30,000. As you look into next
year, there is an expectation for that to drop down to potentially mid-20s. I guess the question here
is there's potentially some stimulus incentive that could improve those numbers. But right now, I'll be
thinking about numbers around 25,000 to 30,000 depending on how that plays out.

When I think about locomotives, I think you got to break out the elements of North America and
international. I think international, we continue to see a robust pipeline and good opportunities here for
us. I think North America, as I had mentioned, there is a lag here, so -- and keep in mind, the longer cycle
nature of these orders in order to be fulfilled. So those are, maybe, I think -- hopefully, that answers a
part of your question. I think mining, which is another element here, I think we see mining resilience at
this point.

On electrification, which you asked about it. We see the opportunity here to enter into some areas
of electrification with differentiation, which would mean driving value for both our customers and for
ourselves. I'll talk to you more about it in the first quarter of next year, but that's an exciting area that will
also help us, I think, accelerate growth in the business. So I think there's an element of pent-up demand
that I talked to you about it. There's an element of, for me, accelerating technology into our fleets, which
will ultimately accelerate just the investments. So you have more reliable and more efficient fleets. And
there's an element here of it stepping into new areas. So we're really working hard to build on the right
set of dynamics to drive growth. And on mods, we do see positive trends going into next year.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Helpful. And then just lastly, one of the opportunities with the GE deal was, I think, improving the
content per loco on the legacy Wabtec side. Can you just give us an update on where we stand on that
front? Are we seeing that yet? Is that still on the come? Any thoughts there?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think we've seen a little bit, but it's -- I mean in the scheme of things, I could call it immaterial. I think
what's been important is we see an element of -- the opportunity is real. It takes sometimes a little bit
longer just in terms of our customers wanting to test it before they fully adopt it. But we're doing that
across the board. I think broader than that, we've seen the fact that we're so penetrated in so many
different regions, we see now teams polling, I'll call, different products that before we couldn't even think
about selling. I mean we're selling our heat exchanger business here in the U.S. would have never been
able to reach the kind of businesses we're getting now in Russia.

We just signed about a $5 million deal. While it's small, it just gives you the sense of how we can really
take these products into a broader sense. We're educating our teams through it. I think there is a sense
of really having a broader product portfolio that we can win share out there. And the fact that we're
improving now profitability in Transit, it also allows us to be a lot more aggressive on going after market
share in some areas and drive profitable growth. So just stronger team together.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Rafael, I think you highlighted some pockets of revenue growth opportunities in -- for next year. But did
you say if you guys expect to grow revenue -- total revenue next year?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So a couple of things. I -- we're not giving guidance into next year. I think what I provided was
just a perspective on how do I see the recovery taking place. I think there's an element of our business,
which is tied to services, with shorter cycle, and we're seeing the recovery there. So with shorter cycle,
you're able to deliver most of the time in, what I'll call, less than 6 months. Right? There's an element of
equipment, which is longer cycle. And say, in a lot of cases, you're looking at deliveries above 12 months.
And I think the signs we're seeing is of order recovery. We've started to see that, as I described to you,
with the pipeline. That started first internationally, and we do expect some of those conversions to already
start here in the fourth quarter, but that North America has been lagging behind.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe switching over to the Transit side. Does this -- I mean the New
York City Transit hybrid locomotive order is very encouraging. But can you help us understand how this is
happening at a time when -- if this is with the -- with actually the MTA, I mean, I think they're expecting
a deficit of $16 billion through 2024, if there is not a federal emergency funding. So is this order basically
contingent upon a blue wave scenario next week?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Well, a couple of things. Number one, we're not going to comment on any specific customers and
customer orders or transactions. But I'd say, transit authorities around the globe, they're really seeing
operating budget constraints. We haven't seen, as I told you before, project cancellations at this point.
I think there's a significant opportunity for those transit authorities to also drive, what I call, a shift to
green. And we're seeing significant investments on that, and that helps a lot of these elements. So that's
maybe where I'll finish.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And you did mention that you're having more of these conversations with different customers
around the world about the transit hybrid locomotive?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think there's a huge interest on it. There's clearly an opportunity to already apply some of these in some
specific routes. So we've got -- well, we're going to start a pilot here very soon in California. And we've
started some of the elements of, what I call, the next phase. And I think there's some real interest, I
mean, if you think about the elements of fuel efficiency that could be gained from this significantly. And
due to all the dynamics you see in the automotive industry, we're seeing really a significant progress in
terms of just the power density on those batteries, life continues to improve and cost continues to come
down. And that's really, I think, accelerating some of the opportunity here that we see.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then you mentioned California was kind of reminded me of something that's probably much,
much longer term, and it's probably contingent on energy -- more aggressive energy policies. But I think
California, a few years ago, we're talking about Tier 5 locomotive, this is on the Freight side. Do you think
-- if we have a more aggressive push to implement green policies in the U.S., do you think we could start
talking about the next generation of locomotives some time in the next 5 years?

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Well, a couple of comments there. Number one, let's just talk about from Tier 4, right? And how much has
been adopted and how much has become a significant part of the installed base? And I think -- I mean if
I look at it, I think still under -- it's maybe 1,200 units of Tier 4 installed. And if you consider the installed
base, I mean it's minimum at this point.

So before we jump into the next wave, I think it's important to look at what is available out there and
make sure that, I think, ultimately, taking advantage of the products that have been developed. Now when
it comes down to Tier 5, I think a battery, electric as I described to you, can really potentially drive, I
think, even more benefits than simply thinking about like whatever Tier 5 would mean. So we're talking
here 15% to 30-plus percent reduction on fuel on routes. And that's like massive, right? That's probably
not been obtained through any of the other programs that have been done in the past. So that's why we
look at battery or electric as really a leap forward.

Your next question is from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies.

Saree Emily Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Could you just talk about the margin profile on international locomotives? And as you target international
locomotive growth, would you expect to see any margin headwinds?

And then for my follow-up question, could you just provide the impact on the contract adjustment on
Freight margins in the quarter? And how should we think about that impact going into 2021 as the Egypt
contract rolls off?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Saree, yes. So in the quarter, the impact of that -- below market intangibles is $12.5 million, so
lower than previous quarters. And we expect for the full year that, as we've talked in with -- is that it's
about flat year-over-year. And then from a profile standpoint, we definitely see that coming down. Those
specific accounting that you're referring to is -- those locomotive units will have been falling off, and we'll
see the number decline into next year.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Well, let me be very specific. As we go into next year, we're going to see that number to be less than 50,
and it's going to be limited to the India contracts. So I just want to remove any sense that there is, I'm
going to call, a lack of profitability associated with the international contracts.

Saree Emily Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And just could you -- I mean could you provide any color on what is the margin profile in international
locomotives? And maybe how the India contract differs from the contracts that you're looking to gain
going forward?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

So yes, Saree. So the margin on international projects for locomotives is good. It's obviously higher.
These specific accounting item that we're -- that you're asking about, which is really related to 2 new
markets with -- where we -- where costs were incurred and it's part of localization of initial engineering,
that's nonrecurring and very typical with brand new, new product development and business development
opportunities.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

But on a go-forward basis, we have pockets of international projects where the profitability level is really
good. It can be higher than average. It can be -- it just -- it's not really appropriate to kind of look at it as
international projects are less profitable in locomotives than kind of the average. It's just -- it really comes
down to how long we've been established and have been operating in those locations.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Let me give you more color here. When you look at countries that we've had, I'll call, established
presence, that's been mature with a product that's also being mature, good profitability. And I can speak
of places like Brazil. I can speak of places like Kazakhstan, right? I can speak of places like Australia, of
course, the U.S. market now. And as you go into new markets, as Pat described, which was the case of
India, investing on a brand new platform. So you're designing a product for the first time, you're investing
in infrastructure, and that's where you'll see those be on the lower end side. Even in Africa, I mean, we
went through that in the beginning. And I mean today is a mature market. We have established a mature
presence there. So that's maybe the way to think about it.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

And these decisions to enter into these markets, they really are because there's a strategic opportunity.
And so you get yourself established. You have a long-lived contract with opportunity for lean activities and
variable cost productivity improvements. And so when you get into -- and the initial cost is behind you,
you end up with add-on orders and additional units that really enjoy a good margin.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

And ultimately, installed base that it's going to be there for the next 30 years that you're going to be
serving on the aftermarket side.

Operator

Next question is from Ari Rosa from Bank of America.

Ariel Luis Rosa
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

You've touched on the demand side quite a bit, but I just wanted to see if we could dig into that a little bit
more. Mentioning strength in Latin America, Kazakhstan, some other regions, maybe you could give us an
indication of -- is that enough to support the backlog -- or growth in the backlog? Or should we expect this
kind of secular decline in the backlog until we see kind of a pickup in demand from North America? Maybe
if you could just give us a little more color on the magnitude of the demand that you're seeing and where
there are pockets of strength?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So I'll just take your question being very focused on the locomotive side. I mean we are like at trough
levels here on the locomotive side, right? So -- and by the time you get pretty close to 0, I mean, I tend
to think things go up, right? So the question for me here is more on the pacing. So it's more on the pace
of recovery. And that's where I started with the elements of the international. I think we see a robust
pipeline versus what we saw 6 months ago. And we're starting to see some good indications of potentially
converting that. North America was lagging behind.

Ariel Luis Rosa
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. Makes sense. Can't go below 0? That's for sure.

Exactly.

Ariel Luis Rosa
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And on the -- just on the Transit side, maybe if you could give a little more color. You had mentioned that
municipal budgets and transit authorities are seeing some pressure. Maybe if you could give some color
on how that's changing the nature of the discussions with those organizations? Are they looking for more
price concessions or that sort of thing? Just -- how do you see contracts kind of evolving in that space,
given that budget pressure that they're facing?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So we were -- we had a meeting just 2 days ago with one of those authorities in Europe. And what I'll tell
you right now is they're maintaining their budgets at this point. So of course, there is a lot of volatility, as
he would have described it in terms of what happens here on this Wave 2. But they're committed to keep
the fleets running at this point. And they do not, at this point, pin down to any project cancellations. So
I'm just trying to give you here our perspective one customer. And of course, we're working with various
customers very closely. So I think something to continue to watch. I think the commitment to have trains
running and operating, I think, it's there.

Could we have a risk that if this thing delays further that at a certain point, there's delay in projects? I
guess that could be a possibility. I wouldn't be speculating at this time. So right now I think the trends and
even as you look into some of the, I'll call, industry reports, those point out to, I'll call, growth adds. So I
think we've got some good indications there at this point.
