Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our fourth quarter and full
year 2020 results. Fourth quarter billing increased 20% to $961 million, our secure SD-WAN offering
accounted for over 13% of fourth quarter billing. Product revenue accelerated quarter-over-quarter to
21%, contributing to a total revenue growth of 21%.

Operation margin benefit from solid revenue performance, we achieved an all-time company record non-
GAAP operating margin of 29.4% for the fourth quarter. Given the many opportunities ahead, we plan to
shift our focus more to growth for the -- at least to next few quarters.

Today, we announced FortiOS 7.0, with 300 new feature and updates. With this release, Fortinet is the
only leading cybersecurity vendor to offer firewall-based Zero Trust Network Access, enabling remote
access to replace the traditional VPN.

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

This reduced our tech surface while improving the user experience. Fortinet's Zero Trust Network Access
solution also simplify management by using the same access policy whether on or off network.

Prior to integration of our SASE solution with the FortiOS 7.0 give enterprise the flexibility they need to
enable their workforce to work from home with consistent enterprise-grade security delivered on-premise
or now more cloud-based SASE consumption for security as a service.

The FortiOS 7.0 extend network connectivity and security beyond the WAN Edge with the innovation in 5G
and LTE that improved the wireless network performance and increased resilience.

Our 5G offering enable organization to achieve secure, scalable and highly available network connectivity
anywhere. The release of FortiOS 7.0 expand the Fortinet security fabric delivering on our mission to
provide broad, integrated and automated security to any device, any application everywhere.

Cybersecurity is an inflection point and increasingly, organizations are consolidating towards a platform
approach and in not just a separate platform for endpoint, network security or cloud security, but a holistic
platform that is integrated, automated across all this area.

The Fortinet Security Fabric is a cybersecurity platform built on a broad and a deep set of networking and
security technology from endpoint to network to cloud, organically built to seamlessly communicate and
operate together.

This consolidation with our secure driven networking

Approach will be key drivers going forward. Today, Fortinet is recognized in 8 Gartner Magic Quadrant. Our
FortiGate product is a leading -- is a leader in both SD-WAN and the next-gen Firewall Magic Quadrant.
We continue to experience excellent adoption of secure SD-WAN and expect our unique solution to
become a market share leader within a few years. In addition to our growth drivers, we estimate our total
addressable market will grow at an annual compound rate of 10% over the next 4 years to reach $93
billion by 2024.

The recent SolarWinds security incident and the pandemic elevated the need for a broad, integrated and
automated platform, and we expect company to reach the percentage of IT spending used for security as
they work to secure their entire infrastructure across multiple edge in a zero trust environment. Before
turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers and the partners worldwide
for their continued support to manage our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keith?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you, Ken. Let's start the fourth quarter review with revenue. Total revenue of $748 million was up
21%. Product revenue was up 21%. Service revenue was up 21%. Product revenue of $288 million saw
a substantial sequential acceleration in growth relating from strong demand for fabric, the Security Fabric
platform and FortiGates across all form factors, hardware, software and virtual machine.

While secure SD-WAN use cases continued their dramatic growth, the majority of product revenue was
driven by the wide range of other operating system capabilities embedded in FortiGates in their related
use cases. Service revenue of $460 million benefited from strong demand for fabric and cloud security
solutions. Support and professional services revenue increased 21% to $210 million. The revenue mix shift
from 8/5 to 24/7 support was 12 points, with 24/7 now representing 66% of the mix.

Security subscription services and cloud provider revenue increased 21% to $249 million. Moving to the
mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate revenue, network security revenue increased 18%, driven by the high
end and entry-level FortiGate product families. Non-FortiGate products and service revenue increased 29%
driven by a 34% increase in revenue for fabric and cloud security solutions.

Before continuing with the fourth quarter results, I'd like to highlight our 2020 full year revenue
performance. In the midst of a pandemic-induced recession, total revenue for the year grew 20% to $2.6
billion. We take great pride in our focus on organic growth. And 2020 represents the third consecutive
year with revenue growth of 20%.

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

This consistent performance speaks to our geographic and customer diversity, the continued success of
the integrated platform strategy, and our proprietary ASIC Advantage that enables a shared operating
system across the platform, drives our cost for performance advantage, increase the capacity to add
features and functions while maintaining price points.

Total non-FortiGate revenue for the year grew over 25% to more than $725 million. In other words, our
fabric, cloud and other security products and services are on pace to be a $1 billion business as we exit
2021. Our non-FortiGate and FortiGate products and solutions include a complete range of form factors
and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud, SaaS and perpetual software, as
well as hosted and non-hosted solutions.

Together, they provide a range of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection
for hybrid environments, and their expanding digital attack surface and edges. Pivoting back to our Q4
results. Let's turn to revenue by geo. Our geographic revenue performance continued to align with the
pandemic's economic path and with it, highlighted the geographic diversification of our business.

As summarized on Slide 7, revenue in Asia Pacific increased 23% as many Asian countries and economies
continue to remain largely open. EMEA revenue increased 22%, and the Americas posted revenue growth
of 20%.

Let's shift to billings. Total fourth quarter billings were $961 million, up 20%. FortiGate's billings
increased 16% and accounted for 71% of total billings. As shown on Slide 9, high end and entry-level
FortiGates posted strong billings growth for the quarter. Non-FortiGate billings increased 29 -- to 29%
of total billings, driven by demand for fabric and cloud security solutions. As with revenue, geo billings
performance aligns with the economic path of the pandemic.

In terms of growth, APAC billings outperformed all geos, followed by Europe and the Americas. The
Americas reflect the continuing impact of the pandemic, especially in Latin America. Moving to billings by
customer segments. The small enterprise segment posted solid growth across all geos, illustrating the
strength of our engaged channel partner program. This segment is driven by new customer acquisitions,
customer security fabric expansions, solid execution by our channel partners and the large diverse make
up this multinational customer segment.

Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. The worldwide government sector topped all verticals at
17% of total billings and grew 28% with another strong performance from our international team. Service
providers and MSSPs accounted for 16% of total billings. Retail accounted for 10% of total billings, up 2
percentage points quarter-over-quarter. And education continued to rebound with donors growth up 26%
year-over-year.

Looking now at deals by dollar size. We had 68 deals over $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to
64 deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. Secure SD-WAN accounted for 16 deals over $1 million versus 11
deals in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a full year basis, SD-WAN accounted for approximately 11% of
our total billings and doubled year-over-year. Moving back to the income statement. As shown on Slide 4,
gross margin improved 40 basis points to 78.5%. The strong 29% quarter-over-quarter product revenue
growth created a mix shift from services to product revenue.

The mix shift was a headwind for quarter-over-quarter gross margin comparisons. Product gross margin
improved 130 basis points to 63.2%. Product gross margin continued to benefit from a higher mix of
software products and the lower direct cost of our newer generation of FortiGate products.

Operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 210 basis points to 29.4%, benefiting from the gross
margin improvement and continued lower travel and marketing program expenses, offset by the addition
of new sales team members as we continue to prepare for additional growth.

At the end of the year, the total headcount was 8,238, an increase of 16%. Moving to the statement of
cash flow summarized on Slides 10, 11 and 12. Cash flow for the fourth quarter came in at $264 million.
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost
of $34 million. For the full year, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for a total cost of $1.1 billion.

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

At the end of the fourth quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was $1 billion, with the
authorization set to expire at the end of February in 2022. Throughout the pandemic, we have leveraged
the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive advantage to support our partners and customers
because they experience geo-specific economic challenges.

As a result, average days sales outstanding increased 8 days to 87 days, in line with our expectations
and reflecting our decision to provide geographically targeted extended payment plans. Inventory turns
improved to 2.7x from 2.1x in the third quarter and was relatively flat year-over-year.

We expect extended payment terms and higher inventory balances to be in effect as we move through
at least the first half of 2021. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $32 million, including $22
million related to construction and other real estate activity.

We estimate capital expenditures for the first quarter to between $50 million and $60 million and for all
of 2021 to be between $150 million and $170 million. 2021 CapEx projects include expanding our data
center footprint and spending that was moved from 2020 due to delays in the new campus building.

The average contract term in the fourth quarter was approximately 28 months, up less than 2 months
from the fourth quarter of 2019. The growth in SD-WAN and other large enterprise deals contributed to
the increase.

As we look forward, I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021, summarized on
Slide 13, which is subject to disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the
beginning of the call.

For the first quarter, we expect billings in the range of $765 million to $780 million. Revenue in the range
of $670 million to $685 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78.5% to 79.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin
of 22.5% to 23.5%, reflecting the typical revenue seasonality associated with the first quarter. Non-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.75, which assumes a share count of between 167 million and 169
million.

We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. Before providing our 2021 guidance, I'd like to congratulate every
member of the Fortinet team, for the truly outstanding execution in 2020 in the face of unprecedented
challenges and rapidly changing and unpredictable dynamics. The effort and results have been
outstanding.

And this is on top of now several years of consistent, predictable performance and continuing
improvements in key growth and profitability metrics. Today, we reported our third consecutive year of
total revenue growth of 20%, while increasing our non-GAAP operating margin, an average of over 200
basis points a year for the same period.

Our goal remains to balance growth and profitability within the framework we have provided. As Ken
mentioned, given the many growth opportunities that lie ahead, we currently plan to tilt our bias within
this framework, more towards growth for at least the next several quarters.

The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline heading into 2021, increased sales capacity
and our development efforts, which include the NP7 chip and our new FortiOS 7.0 operating system. With
that, for 2021, we expect billings in the range of $3.560 billion to $3.640 billion, which at the midpoint
represents growth of approximately 17%.

Revenue in the range of $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of
18%. Total service revenue in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.45 billion, which represents growth of
approximately 21% and implies product revenue growth of approximately 11% and $1 billion in product
revenue for 2021, quite the milestones for Fortinet.

Non-GAAP gross margin of 78% to 80%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 27%. When backing out
the 2020 T&E benefit, the midpoint of guidance represents a 50 to 100 basis point increase in operating
margin for 2021. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.75, which assumes a share count of
between 170 million and 172 million.

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $80 million. Along
with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their support and hard
work during these difficult and unique times.

I'd also like to offer a special welcome to the Panopta team.

And I'll now hand the call back over to Peter to begin a Q&A session.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.

Brian Lee Essex
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a great set of results. Maybe, Ken, if I could ask, you've got a number of different product
cycles ahead of you this year, you've got NP7, you've already talked about SD-WAN. You've got hyperscale
penetration and potential exposure to 5G. Can you maybe talk about the contribution from each of those
that's embedded in your guidance? And what are you seeing currently in the market and what's yet to
come?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I think for NP7, it's still in the ramp-up stage. We continue to build a new -- our platform using NP7
is better for the high end and middle range. The FortiOS 7.0 is also a growth driver, but we are in the
bittersweet process right now of what we did in this quarter. That's what helping contribute to the
additional growth, especially in the Zero Trust and SASE environment. And also this infrastructure security
later this year, but it's -- so far, I see the product growth, like 21% is a lot of contribution from whether
the SD-WAN or security-driven networking and also in the probably like 1 to 2 years ago, when we
released the SoC4. So that's a little bit towards the low end side of the FortiGate, which you can see nicely
growth over there.

And also the team doing a great job in the sales and marketing.

[indiscernible]?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think the guidance process is not so much about individual products or even in some cases,
individual use cases. We identified 15 to 27 different use cases for firewalls. It's more about what we see
in terms of market opportunity, what we see in pipeline, then maybe by geography or deal opportunity or
what have you as some of the key inputs that go into it.

But I wouldn't really think of it as that -- I certainly would not want you to walk away from the
conversation thinking that the guidance that we provided is dependent upon some degree of 5G or SASE
or something that's above and beyond.

Brian Lee Essex
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Nice large deal activity, certainly more than we picked
up in the channel. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics on the large end of
your market scale. Where you're seeing that business come from? How much is displacement? And how
much is expansion of I guess, existing customer opportunity?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes, definitely, whether from our customer or our partner is deciding to get a much better, more
competitive and a lot of advantage using the Fortinet product. Whether the FortiGate leverage new ASIC,
the new OS with much more additional function compared to competitor, so that's where like increase the

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

gap we have ahead of competitor now. And that's actually helping to drive -- to accelerate the product
revenue growth. And on the other side, we have a little bit different approach for whether the SASE or
cloud or endpoint. So we more emphasize it, integrate together, automate together, especially in the OS
level, though that's -- none of our competitors have that.

And also most of this also organically are internal developed, designed to work together, automate
together from day 1. That's also different from competitor come from acquisition, which is more difficult to
integrate and also difficult to manage long term. So we do feel we have a more and more advantage in the
marketplace right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.

Shaul Eyal
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the ongoing strong execution levels. I want to start with a gross margin related question.
So gross margins guidance for '21 indicates an improvement, 1 to 2 basis points on average. And I'd like
to understand whether it is driven by the ongoing shift to more cloud activities, i.e., more subscription
services? Or is it driven by some improvement with your ASIC-driven strategy?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think the last part is probably the headline, which is that each successive generation of the ASIC
in addition to creating more speed, more capacity, if you will, more throughput. It also creates capacity
to consolidate features of the BOM that were previously separate. And the success of generation has
shown the benefit of that. I think over the last year or 2, we've done a very good job of retaining that cost
benefit in terms of the structure. You can look back and see what's happened with the gross margin on the
product gross margin line. Obviously, you do then also get the benefit in total, when you add into 2/3 of
the business that are services, that are coming at a much more attractive margin.

So the combination of those 2, I think, are working very, very well for us as we exit 2020 and move into
2021.

Shaul Eyal
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Got it. Got it, Keith. And maybe high level on the SUNBURST breach. Have you seen any incremental
interest starting in mid-December, maybe building into year-end, again, just aside from the typical healthy
year-end seasonality trends?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I'd say probably -- we do see a lot of need interest, especially to secure the whole infrastructure, including
supply chain with all different third-party kind of product or the things. But it's still -- I'd say it's definitely
more people starting interest in this area, but it's -- the business side is probably not changing that much
yet. But we do see going forward, probably later this year will be -- because this definitely raise security
concern. Like I mentioned, the security spending among our IT spending probably will keep increase.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

I have 2 questions. The first one is, Ken, in your prepared remarks, you said that this year is going to be
a year of focus on growth. What does it mean? Does it mean that you're going to increase expenses and

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

the margin increases will moderate? Can you elaborate on the meaning behind your statement that you're
going to focus on growth this year? And how does it different from previous year, for example?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

We do see like whether some investment we made in the sales and marketing, like we said, we have
increased sales capacity and also -- we also have a better visibility, we increase the marketing. And at
the same time, from the product, from infrastructure side, we also will keeping invest, especially the
organic internal development, like building the new infrastructure and whether address the cloud and the
networking endpoint and also working with service provider. So basically, we do see -- the market itself
also starting kind of accelerating, especially in some new areas, whether the security-driven networking
including both SD-WAN and 5G, and that's have the new infrastructure, but also some kind of a service
model, leverage the infrastructure, which we will keeping invest more in there.

So that's what we feel. So this will give us a much more growth opportunity and both internally like
whether the NP7 or the FortiOS 7.0 is off timing quite well. So it will help us drive the faster growth.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

And does it have any impact on the margins?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Tal, I'll just add to that, that I think the -- sorry to interrupt you. Look, I think we were very
successful throughout 2020, even during the pandemic of maintaining our -- and growing our operating
margins very dramatically. But at the same time, adding sales capacity. And I think when we sat down to
build the guidance out in the plan for 2021, coming into the year with the capacity levels that we have,
together with the increase in tenure that we're seeing as well as the pipeline.

I think we feel very good about this opportunity to take advantage of the growth. And I think we're still --
I think the margin guidance at the midpoint of 26% is very much within the framework and actually up a
little bit.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. My second question is about the needed investment in infrastructure to accommodate SASE and
similar business models. What is the company doing in order to address it? Can you just elaborate on
what's happening behind the scene?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes, the SASE approach from Fortinet is different than some other competitors. We do want to have a
more integrated automate approach. And also, we are the only one in the OS level, both the SASE and
also Zero Trust Network Access. So that's making whether working with Fortinet service provider or even
customer enterprise themselves to develop their own kind of SASE approach, which will be much better
fit for their own kind of privacy, whether it's GDPR, some other requirement, it's much better secure
compared to some other approach.

So that's where we feel -- we do have some investment, but some investment like infrastructure, we're
also working with our service provider together.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.

Benjamin David Schmidt

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

This is Ben Schmidt on for Rob. As much of the attention in the space begins to shift towards cloud and
SASE, how do you think about your longer-term strategy from a remote connectivity perspective? And
what do you think -- and what do you expect for the branch office?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I think for our technology, we can support in both the thin branch and the thick branch office approach.
And also even for the SASE, so we leave the flexibility to enterprise, which they can whether leverage the
vendor or they can leverage their service provider or carrier or they can build themselves. So that's what
we say, we put in the OS level, it's much more integrated, automated compared to some other approach,
which have to let vendor the infrastructure.

So for us, like this OS level integration of a SASE do leave a lot of flexibility and gradually for the customer
to transition, whether they're more service-based or they still want to like have a, we call security
infrastructure approach. So that's where we have the flexibility to have customers select their own
approach based on own need. And at the same time, we'll make the whole infrastructure secure, like we
say. Whether the security-driven networking with SD-WAN 5G or internal segmentation, whether in the
data center or with their enterprise campus environment.

So that's where we feel even we take a little bit more time to build this kind of highly integrated OS level
approach, but the result is much better and more advanced than some other loosely -- other approach.

Benjamin David Schmidt
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And on the growth investment, can you guys add just a little bit more to how much of the capacity
has already been added? And how much you're expecting to add, I guess, how much more needs to be
added for this year? And can you remind us what the normal ramp time period is for new reps?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

For the new reps, probably a little bit different for each second vertical. Like the channel probably
within a few months, like 3 months time frame. And then the enterprise probably like 6 to 12 months.
[indiscernible] may take like 1 to 2 years like carry all the things. So we're going to also like different geo,
I think based on how the pandemic, how the other progress going on and also the market opportunity
there.

But I'd say we do kind of planning to increase more capacity when we see more opportunity there and try
to match the investment with the -- I think whether the internal, like the new product and also the market
opportunities, which definitely will help us keep in driving the fast approach.

Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS.

Fatima Aslam Boolani
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Ken, maybe I'll start with you. Just drilling into your vertical-based performance. You talked about the
global government vertical being -- comprising 1/5 of your billings in the quarter and that some of the
highest levels we've seen. And so I'm wondering if you can remind us what your U.S. public sector
exposure is within that government exposure?

And then more specifically, how is Fortinet position, both from a product and go-to-market perspective in
the U.S. Federal especially as we sort of think about the $10 billion cybersecurity spending protocol from
the new Biden administration? And then I have a quick follow-up for Keith.

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes, the government business for Fortinet is a global base. It's about 17% of our total business for us right
now. And compared to like a few years ago, the carrier service provider, the #1, is over 20%.

Now they are like 16%. For the U.S. government, we still see a lot of opportunity and the same thing for
the U.S. market. And so we're going to keep in building the team and increased capacity and to take this
opportunity and grow faster, larger. What's the second question?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Well, I think we've talked before that the U.S. Fed is low single digits of our government business --
around our business time at the time. Yes. And I think we kind of leave that at that.

Fatima Aslam Boolani
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got you. Very helpful. Keith, just sticking to Americas. We saw a very nice acceleration in 4Q in the
Americas theater. And against what was maybe an uneven geographical performance for the U.S. over the
course of 2020.

So I'm wondering if you can just put a finer point on the types of things that went right and the types of
things that really went on in the quarter and the key drivers of the strength, particularly in the Americas.
And that's it for me.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. So I think a good question, but a lot of ways a different answer. If you look at geographically, Latin
America continues to be, by far, the most challenged, if you will. Canada probably did the best of the 3,
and I would put the U.S. right in the middle. I do think that we're very pleased with how the U.S. has
come back. The second quarter, now that we all are pandemic experts about what to expect out of the
business and looking at Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.

It's pretty obvious that -- and we kind of felt this coming out of the second quarter, that Q2 was a low
watermark, both for the company in total, but also for the U.S. And I think you've picked up on -- since
that point, there's been a steady progression of, for the lack of a better term, recovery in that part of the
business.

Brad Alan Zelnick
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations to the entire Fortinet team on a great end to a great year. My first question for you, Ken.
In your comments, you basically said that you aspire to be the market share leader in SD-WAN, which I
think is a really important goal that you have. And I just was curious from your perspective, what needs to
happen to get there? How do you take share from your 2 largest competitors that have significant installed
base relationships?

And over what time can this play out?

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Founder, Chairman & CEO

I think for us, we have a unique advantage of we build SD-WAN with security together. And we also
leverage ASIC to like increase competing power, lower competing the cost a lot. So that's none of our
competitor have not. And also the other 2 big leaders, they come for acquisition, that's where going
forward, they probably will be slower on whether the innovation of the market change dynamic there. So
that's what you can see from the FortiOS 7.0 release, we do keep increased additional function, whether
the SD-WAN, the 5G and other parts.

So we do also believe going forward, like half or majority of the SD-WAN market will need a security. So
it will be -- we have a huge advantage there. So that's where -- even have a bigger installation base, but
the advantage we have from the product from a function, from the cost side, I think will be huge. And will
have us keep improving the market share.

And so far, like year-over-year, we almost doubled SD-WAN business compared to the 2019 -- in the 2020.

Brad Alan Zelnick
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And maybe just quickly for Keith. Keith, what are the levers to think about in light of sales
headcount and the plans for this year?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

The levers to think about, well, I'm not quite sure I fully understand the question, but maybe I'll give it a
shot in that to share one data point of coming into this year, if I look at the level of sales capacity we have
versus what the plan is that we're talking about. I don't think I've -- this is as well positioned as we have
been coming into a year to pivot towards this growth model that Ken has talked about.

And I think that -- the pipeline feels very good. The tenure feels very good. The use cases, the TAM feels
very, very good to us. The new FortiOS, the NP7 shift is coming out, the platform advantage, the cost
advantage that we have for performance.

I think that we are in a very good position to execute this. And again, we're maintaining it within the
framework that we've talked about previously.

Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just one question from my side. Ken, in your prepared remarks, I think you talked about that the
industry is finally raised the customers move to consolidation on fewer vendors, more of a broad platform
approach. With that in mind, where would you gauge the Fortinet platform and what are the areas that
you would like to bolster to improve your position moving forward?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

You can see the -- like we call the security fabric has a pretty nice growth, almost double compared to the
FortiGate growth there. That's also because customer want to have all these whole infrastructure secure
integrated automated solution. So that's where we're continuing to see -- we'll keep gaining share there.
So that's involving probably 20, 30 different products. And on the other side, on the FortiGate part, we call
the security-driven networking, that's whether the SD-WAN, the 5G and now with integrated SASE and
some other part working closely with service provider carrier, we also see a lot of opportunity within the
FortiGate side.

So that's where we see -- so far, we are keeping like -- if the market itself grow like 10%, we do see we
can grow much faster than the market keeping gaining share. And both on the FortiGate and also on the
-- we call it the broad fabric approach, which is involved in both the endpoint and the networking and
the cloud all together. And all this integrated together based on the FortiOS and some under connectivity
related to the FortiOS.

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James.

Adam Tyler Tindle
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Ken, I just wanted to start on the focus more on growth comment and how you're investing some of
your healthy margin and some sales and marketing initiatives. We also heard a similar message from a
competitor yesterday. And just thinking about the broader industry implications of that, an outsider could
maybe make the case that we enter a period of greater industry competition and pricing pressure as major
competitors are investing heavily in sales and marketing.

Certainly doesn't seem to be the case based on your full year margin guide so maybe some thoughts on
why that scenario does not play out?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Ken, can I jump in and answer on your behalf? I think the reference probably is a company that has a
very, very different business model, whether you're looking at growth rates or you're looking at product
service mix or what have you. So I don't know that, that would draw that straight line comparison.

I think the business model that we're executing here has been extremely successful, and I expect it will
continue to be so. In terms of discounting, I think that there's days that I don't like hearing it, but we're
viewed as being the price for performance leader. That our pricing is really -- we're oftentimes, I think,
brought into RFPs and opportunities to set the milestone that the competitors are forced to react to as
opposed to the other way around.

If you go back and look at the comments that we've offered throughout 2020 even in the pandemic, more
often than not, discounting, if you will, has been a tailwind for us in our ability to execute against it as
opposed to a headwind.

And by that, I define discounting, I mean lower discounting pressure in that quarter than the prior period.
So I don't think we have the concerns that may have been described there.

Adam Tyler Tindle
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, Keith. And sorry, a little bit in the weeds on this
one. But the billings guidance for Q1, it's down about 20% sequentially at the midpoint and typically down
low double digits or so, mid-teens in that range.

Last year, at the start of COVID, it was down 17%. So part of the question is why would the sequential
decline in billings be worse than the environment when we entered COVID during Q1 of last year?

You talked about having a strong pipeline, supporting the desire to invest. Maybe just some help with the
color on the disconnect between those 2 items.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think one of -- which you're -- we should talk about is just a tremendous performance in the fourth
quarter of 2020. I know that 20 -- fourth quarter of 2019 was a good quarter, but Q4 2020 on top of
that '19 performance, I think is part of it. And this is typically the smallest quarter for us in the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.

Keith Frances Bachman
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Ken, I wanted to ask my first question of you. You've talked about 5G, why is that an opportunity? Who's
your customer? And what -- why does Fortinet win in that instance of the deployment of 5G? And if you
could just talk a little bit about when do you think that you'll get some benefits from this?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I think we do see 5G connect a lot of devices to the Internet, which also increased a lot of security risk.
We call this a new attack service, a new edge need to be covered. So that's where especially, we're
working with a lot of service provider for the 5G service to a lot of enterprise and connect all these
different devices in the IoT space.

So that we do see is a huge opportunity. And so with our position, with the carrier service provider, and
we do see the 5G can be one of the driving -- growth drive factor for us this year and it could be material
towards the end of the year. It's like going forward is also -- is a huge, huge opportunity, even secure
whether it's part of the whole infrastructure, which grow very, very fast and a lot of our carrier service
providers starting to have investment in this area also.

Keith Frances Bachman
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Interesting. Okay. And then, Keith, one for you. For the guidance of '21, you talked about CapEx.
Any other puts and takes you want us to think about as it relates to OCF or operating cash flow?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

No, not really. I mean, I made the point about inventory. Returns came in for us, pretty strong in the
fourth quarter, but I think that's a direct reflection of the success that we had in the product revenue line
in the fourth quarter. So that was probably a little bit better than we expected.

I do think during this pandemic era that we'll continue to maintain somewhat higher levels of inventory.
I think that's in our best interest. The extended payment term program, I think that every CFO wants to
wind that down, fastest possible and every distributor wants to hold on to it for dear life. So that will be an
ongoing battle for us throughout 2021, I think.

Keith Frances Bachman

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.

My first question, you've made your aspirations pretty clear in SD-WAN. Could you share with us a little bit
about aspirations, intentions as you move into SASE and Zero Trust, how you see yourself positioned?

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. SD-WAN is a part of the SASE offering. What we do is a little bit different than competitor. We build
within the FortiGate FortiOS, which also can be offered, whether based on the physical appliance or the
virtual software or kind of cloud delivering. And that's where the new FortiOS 7.0 give all this flexibility
and connect a lot of other part of infrastructure security service together.

So that's where we'll continue to see SD-WAN and keeping growing probably -- by market study, it
probably was keeping growth like 30%, 40% year-over-year this year. We do believe we're also keeping
gaining market share. And at the same time, the 5G -- the other opportunity come up, we already offered
the new FortiOS 7.0, which also could be a pretty good driver for the additional growth we have.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

Could you also talk a little bit about how you envision FortiOS 7.0 rolling out once available? How
backwards compatible will it be for legacy appliances? And if you've looked at some of the historical OS
refreshes, how long does it take the footprint to roll over as this rolls through the base?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

It's really depend on customer. Some, I have to say, the channel probably react a little bit faster and
then there's enterprise, then the service providers sometimes take a little bit time. Because some service
provider, they also have to supporting some of that. But we do see this enable a lot of new opportunity.

And they also like this tightly integrated approach, whether the SD-WAN, SASE, we called secure driven
networking, which do enable them to offer the additional service, additional kind of business and protect
additional edge. That's where we say, you need to protect all different edge together and automate,
integrate together instead of have a different product, different kind of a vendor for each part, which is
difficult to integrate automate.

So that's where we see the response from like -- there's like 300 new feature and update in this OS to
cover quite a broad area.

And that we do see customers do need some time to gradually like trend pick up or this a new function,
but a lot of them, they see the huge benefit of this new function. And that's where we see it's a huge
opportunity for us. But probably towards the second half of the year, we'll see a lot of benefit of it.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Keybanc Capital Markets.

Eric Michael Heath
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

This is Eric Heath on for Michael. Just one for me, Keith, it seemed like you guided billings for 4Q,
assuming some macro headwinds. How did that play out differently than you expected, especially on the
product side? And in the end, did you see deferrals of hardware refreshes in 2020 that might snap back in
2021?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I don't -- yes, we have such a long product list. I don't think that we really saw deferrals of refreshes.
The sweat the asset concept. I think the -- any -- I don't think Q4 was unusual in terms of what you
normally see with other years.

And by that, I mean, I think there was probably some element of the typical budget flush flowing through.
I think there was probably some element of salespeople working really hard to hit accelerators. And I think
there was also some element of deals that's simply pushed.

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

I don't think that -- Ken kind of made a good point earlier to build on a little bit. I think the SolarWinds
event happened so late in the quarter, at least for us and probably for many other security companies.
It seems doubtful that activity really had much impact on the last 2 weeks of December in the quarter.
I do think, and Ken made this point, that it certainly raises awareness of security and events like that,
unfortunately, for the world at large, create -- focus on security matters and the importance of it that
people are going to suffer because of it.

So I don't know that in terms of learning to be cautious, if you will, going back to the beginning of your
question and the guidance setting, I do think there was an element of caution, once we came out of the
second quarter and saw how the pandemic impact close rates. And you saw that come through in the
guidance setting process in both Q3 and Q4.

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Also, we see a pretty nice growth in SMB, but overall, the SMBs still have very low percentage leverage,
whether the network security or cybersecurity. That's -- where including retail. So that's why we see
there's a -- still have a huge growth opportunity over there.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson.

Andrew James Nowinski
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Great. Congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe just starting with a high-level question. So as we think about
the mix of your revenue, do you think the SolarWinds attack will create a positive tailwind for more
spending in the firewall market?

Or do you think it will pressure your product growth as customers perhaps shift spending towards some of
your cloud-based and subscription solutions?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I said probably we would like to have a more integrated and bigger infrastructure security. So that's where
probably -- definitely, it's sort of when it's more like kind of come from the network side.

On the other side, they are also trying to like cover what the pandemic is whether it's work from home.
There's a lot of other like business trying to digitalize during this process, which also increased the security
need. That's why I say the security spending kind on the overall IT spending probably will keep increase
this year, and that's what's also helping drive the SolarWinds? Just like a few years ago, there's a case
where the target and some other things definitely reach the awareness of the importance of cybersecurity.

Andrew James Nowinski
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Great. Thanks, Ken. And then just a follow-up. As we think about the growth phase you're entering here
this year and your go-to-market strategy to drive that growth. If you look back over the last few years,
your playbook has certainly been the lead with the firewall. I'm just wondering in this new growth phase,
are you using the same playbook to accelerate your growth?

Or are you seeing more deals come to you via your SIM products and your virtual solutions and your other
subscriptions and perhaps changing your go-to-market strategy to drive that growth?

FORTINET, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

That's a few. In the next few years, the network security market is still the biggest market, also probably
the fast-growing market, not just because there's some more connectivity, like 5G, SD-WAN and some
other part work from home.

But also that's the center of the whole infrastructure security. But also, you cannot just -- to network
security only, you also need to have network security working closely with endpoint, with some other
infrastructure cloud and some other parts together. That's what we call the integrated automated solution
to respond to any of this quick changing dynamic industry here.

That's where it's important. We keep the organic growth, and we also keep -- develop the product on
day 1 to make it integrate, automate together. It's a little bit different compared to the competitor, which
whether come from acquisition or some other [ parties ] is more challenging to integrate and also keep the
innovation going forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG.

Gray Wilson Powell
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Great. Congratulations on the good results. So maybe circling back on the 5G questions. In past telecom
upgrade cycles, maybe 3G was too long ago, but looking back at like the 4G upgrade cycle, how did that
play through to Fortinet?

What kind of tailwinds did you see then and then how does the 5G cycle feel in comparison?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. The -- compared to 3G, 4G, is more connect people, whether the phone whatever, together, the 5G is
more connect to the device. And that's also the number of connection probably will increase as it may be
10x at least because there's much more device to be connected, and that also kind of more address a lot
of industry need, whether certain smart city or auto drive or a lot of bigger infrastructure.

So that's -- we do see a lot of a business opportunity because so far, the network security will be more
towards B2B, towards the business side compared towards the consumer part. That's we do see huge
opportunity going forward.

It's just like a couple of years ago, the SD-WAN, right? So SD-WAN can help in drive a lot of smart
connection with the application and more dynamic based on application, have a different connection there.

So that's where the 5G definitely have a lot of additional opportunity, but also bring a lot of risk to the
business there, which need to be protected. And also service provider, we see play quite an important role
there, which is we have probably the best service provider carrier relation among all the cybersecurity
vendor there. So we do see a lot of potential in this area.

1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And then you have to explain it a little bit of MSSP gets allocated between them, one. But
you end up with something that's very, very much like that. Small business, small enterprise 1/3, mid 1/3,
enterprise, 1/3.

I think the thing that has been a very pleasant surprise to us throughout 2020 in the pandemic was how
well the enterprise -- and the small enterprise segment of the business held up. It really did very well.

Jyhhaw Liu
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And for my follow-up, we're now 1 year into the current pandemic. And assuming things normalize
in the back half of calendar '21, do you anticipate any changes or shifts in demand or customer buying
patterns, assuming a return to normal environment?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I think during the pandemic, the customer, especially enterprise customer turned to hold down to the
current vendor, especially in the developed country. And -- but it's -- for us, like whether in the U.S. or
some Europe country, we're keeping gaining market share. So we do get into a lot of new customer, which
will probably take more effort during the pandemic because it's difficult to meet people or do certain
testing there.

Once it's open, we do see there's more opportunity, more window open for us, especially with the new
hardware, new OS and the new infrastructure. So that also lead us to kind of a little bit towards the
investing in the growth for us going forward in the next few quarters at least.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think, Ken, spot on with that. I think the "nice thing" about the pandemic is I think we have a lot of
understanding about our business and what to expect in pandemic quarters.

And I think that all of us here at Fortinet, and I think throughout the country are looking forward to, at
some point in time. We just heard immunity, there's vaccine. And then the other gross drivers kick in, and
that seems destined to be sometimes towards the second half of this year.

I think we're all very aware of some of those GDP numbers in the year-over-year swings that we're seeing
from negative 3% to positive 6% or 7%. Those are pretty dramatic numbers, but I think most people's
expectations are that, that's really going to come when the economies and the country start opening up
further.
