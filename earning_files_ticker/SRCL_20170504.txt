Thanks, Charlie
The results for the first quarter are as follows
Global revenues were $892.4 million, up 2.1% from $874.2 million in Q1 2016. And internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures and manufacturing and industrial service, was 3.6%
Domestic and Canada revenues were $710.8 million
Internal growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, was 2.2%
International revenues were $181.6 million
Internal growth, when adjusted for foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures was 1.8%
As anticipated, internal growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts and manufacturing and industrial services
Acquisitions contributed $10 million to growth in the quarter and divestitures reduced revenues by $0.7 million
Gross profit was $368.7 million, or 41.3% of revenues
Gross profit was reduced by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter due to a reclassification of certain expenses from SG&A to cost of revenues
This reclassification impacts historic and future reporting
SG&A, excluding amortization, was $198.3 million, or 22.2% of revenues
Adjusted income from operations, or EBITA, was $170.4 million, or 19.1% of revenues
Net interest expense was $23.3 million
The as-reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.7%
Net income, attributable to Stericycle was $53.4 million, or $0.62 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.09 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments
Now for the balance sheet
Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.38 at the end of the quarter
The unused portion of the revolver was approximately $715 million
In the quarter, we repurchased 145,700 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $9.6 million
At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 2.9 million shares
Our CapEx was $33.1 million, or 3.7% of revenues
Our DSO was 62 days
Year-to-date, as reported cash from operations was $175.3 million and when adjusted for recall reimbursements and other items, cash from operations was $197.7 million
I will now turn it over to Brent
Yeah
The recall revenue in the quarter, Michael, when we give the Communication and Related Services now, the global recall number we use there is $125 million to $150 million globally
We came in slightly better from a global standpoint than Q1 of 2016. I don't have the number because we don't break it out anymore, but with respect to global recalls, we're still in that range for the year, about $125 million to $150 million
Great
Yeah
From an international perspective, more specifically, with Latin America, we did see price pressure come in as expected, Scott, in Q1. We are starting to exit some contracts where we just can't make the margin that we expect in that business
So part of the bridge to the previous guidance on revenue and the new guidance, we did take down some revenue with respect to Latin America, but from a pricing pressure, it came in as expected
Overall though, I'm happy to report that from a margin perspective year over year, we had a slight improvement in EBITDA margins and we continue to focus on integration, route density and introducing additional services to help drive growth and profit in the International business
No
I think when you look at the headline number for International growth, it was at 2% approximately, but I think when you take out the negative impact, which is the patient transport contract exit and M&I, it comes into about a 5.4%
So I'd say that's normal
As you know, I mean, you've followed the company for a long time, that's about a normal growth rate
We continue to add additional service, like I said, shredding
In the international markets outside of Canada and the US, that falls into the international growth number and they're doing really well in the markets where we have secure information disruption
So that's one of the things that I think is driving some good growth in the international market
Sure
They are – the four international were one, secure information destruction, and three, regulated waste
They were in two in the Netherlands, one in Spain and one in Portugal
Thanks, Scott
Yes, Kevin, it was mostly acquisitions and some favorability on FX going forward
Yes, it went up to slightly less than that
We raised it about $12 million for the acquisitions and the 2017 effect of those
And then we had a combination in our international business of raising foreign exchange by about $14 million, offset by about $10 million reduction, largely due to what Charlie shared, which is exiting certain contracts in Latin America that just aren't meeting our profitability levels, and as well as exiting one more patient transportation contract
As we talked about, I mean, we've done a great job of generating cash
If you looked at Q1, it was an incredible cash quarter
Just to caution you for Q2, obviously we make two tax payments in Q2, so to temper your expectations just for Q2. But we are able to take that cash, continue to pay down debt
I think over the course of about a year we have paid about – close to $250 million of debt down
We still anticipate that through normal operations, that we can be approaching and maybe even slightly below three times debt to EBITDA by the end of the year
For interest expense, our guidance has been in the range of $100 million to $104 million
That includes certain expectations for a couple of rate hikes within the year
Well, now it's domestic and Canada, so there were nine total, there were eight shredding, or secure information destruction acquisitions, and one consult
And the split, Larry, to the overall bucket of acquisitions, about 88% falls in the US and Canada, and about 12% falls international
