Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to Alliant Energy's Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020
Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the
call over to your host, Susan Gille, Investor Relations Manager at Alliant Energy. Please go ahead.

Susan Trapp Gille
Manager of Investor Relations

Good afternoon. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We
appreciate your participation.

Joining me on this call are John Larsen, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Robert
Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO.

Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will take time for questions from the investment
community. We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's fourth quarter and year-
end 2020 financial results and affirmed our 2021 earnings guidance. This release as well as supplemental
slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at
alliantenergy.com.

Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your
questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that
could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed
in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation
between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and our 10-K, which are
available on our website.

At this point, I'll turn the call over to John.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Susan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2020 was a year we will all remember.
It was also another successful year of growth and solid operations for Alliant Energy. We continue to
consistently deliver on our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities. I'm proud of what
our team accomplished and how we delivered on our purpose. An year with many challenges from the
ongoing global pandemic to racial injustice and a disruptive derecho windstorm.

In the face of these challenges, we finished near the top of our original earnings guidance range with the
2020 consolidated earnings per share of $2.47. Our non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings grew
more than 7% over 2019. This was the tenth year in a row of achieving our 5% to 7% growth objective.
This consistent growth, solid execution and operational results showcases the resiliency and flexibility of
our company.

I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements from the year, then I'll turn it
over to Robert, who will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes. I'd like
to start by mentioning a few of our recognitions from 2020. I mentioned earlier the August derecho
windstorm. I'm proud that our efforts to restore electricity to our customers was recognized by receiving
the Edison Electric Institute's Emergency Response Award. Alliant Energy was also included in Bloomberg's
Gender Equality Index, highlighting just 380 companies from around the world who are committed
to supporting gender equality in the workplace. And we were recently named to Newsweek's Most
Responsible Companies list, where we rank 12 overall for our social responsibility efforts. And to top it

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

off, for the fourth year in a row, Alliant Energy has earned a perfect score in the Corporate Equality Index
issued by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.

As I reflect on these achievements, they each showcase how we live our values as we care for others, do
the right thing and act for tomorrow. I'm proud of our Alliant Energy team and thankful for all they do.

From an ESG perspective, we made incredible progress on our goals and objectives. We ended 2020 with
42% less carbon emissions than our 2005 levels, well on our way to our goal of a 50% reduction by 2030.
This result is largely driven by the completion of our major wind expansion, making us the third largest
owner-operator of regulated wind in the U.S. It was also achieved by building our highly efficient West
Riverside generating station.

To further support our efforts to advance a clean energy future, we joined the Low-Carbon Resources
Initiative through the Electric Power Research Institute. This initiative is designed to identify, test and
develop technologies to enable a low carbon future. The results of this important work will help guide
our company and our industry as we look towards our aspirational goal of net 0 carbon dioxide emissions
through the electricity we generate by 2050.

2020 was another great year in advancing our clean energy blueprints, which serve as our guide to create
a cleaner energy future for our customers and communities. Last fall, we advanced our Iowa Clean Energy
Blueprint with our announcement to add approximately 400 megawatts of new solar energy by 2023.
This follows our very successful 1 gigawatt wind energy expansion in Iowa, all delivered on time and on
budget.

When the 400 megawatts of planned new solar is combined with our 1,300 megawatts of own wind, our
existing solar farms and purchased renewable resources, we're on a path to have more than 50% of
Alliant Energy's Iowa generation to come from renewables by 2030. We also continue to advance battery
storage in the state, with plans to add 100 megawatts of distributed energy resources in the next several
years. The additional distributed energy resources follows the successful completion of battery storage
systems near Marshalltown in Wellman, Iowa, and a storage facility in Decorah, Iowa, that includes a
partnership with the United States Department of Energy and the Iowa Economic Development Authority.

Turning to Wisconsin. Our clean energy blueprint helps advance the badger state to a clean energy future.
Our plans to add at least 1,000 megawatts of new solar power is on schedule. Last spring, we announced
our first phase of this effort, identifying 6 future solar sites totaling 675 megawatts. That's enough to
power 175,000 homes. Later this spring, we plan to announce the second phase of our solar expansion,
which will include 3 projects we purchased in the last 5 months as well as our self-developed sites. As we
carefully plan the closure of our remaining coal powered units in Wisconsin, our plans will include ways to
support our employees and our communities.

Our clean energy blueprints are comprehensive and transparent and designed to follow our proven track
record of a thoughtful energy transition. Our solar story in Wisconsin doesn't stop there. We recently
announced a community solar project in Fond du Lac County, where a portion of the energy generated
from the 1 megawatt site will be donated to have a tap for humanity to reduce electric bills of residents.
We're also partnering with Dane County on a 17-megawatt solar development, which will help bring the
county to 100% renewable offset to the electricity consumed at their own facilities. And we're partnering
with the city of Sheboygan to install a 1 megawatt solar facility in the Sheboygan business center.

As we advance our clean energy blueprints, we'll continue to seek solutions that serve our customers'
growing demand for sustainable solutions to help build stronger communities. We also remain focused on
our continued investments in our connected energy network across Iowa and Wisconsin. By advancing the
deployment of an advanced distribution management system, a fiber optic network, and expanding the
use of smart energy systems and automated metering. In addition, our customer-focused investments in
the energy grid will result in more of our electric lines placed underground, a major part of our efforts to
improve grid resiliency, energy efficiency and reliability.

Speaking of reliability, I'm proud of the efforts by our team during the extended polar vortex that gripped
much of the country these past 2 weeks. Our customer-focused investments are designed to ensure that

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

we will continue to provide our customers with safe, reliable and affordable energy for decades to come.
We remain committed to advancing our clean energy vision through this balanced approach.

In summary, 2020 was an excellent year for our company, and we look forward to building on that
momentum in 2021 as we focus on continuing our role as a leader in advancing renewable energy,
completing customer-focused investments on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors
and living our values.

Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert.

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2020 GAAP earnings of $2.47 per
share compared to $2.33 per share in 2019. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts,
earnings per share were up more than 7% year-over-year, driven by higher revenue requirements due to
increasing rate base, partially offset by the higher depreciation and financing expenses from these rate
base additions.

As John noted earlier, our dedicated employees rose to the challenge in 2020 by reducing O&M expenses
to offset the impact of lower sales caused by the pandemic and Derecho storm. These efforts allowed us
to finish the year in the upper half of our earnings guidance range. We provided additional details on the
earnings variance drivers on Slides 4 and 5.

Our temperature normalized retail electric sales declined 2% in 2020 when compared to 2019, primarily
driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the August Derecho storm in our Iowa
service territory. While the pandemic related sales impacts were heaviest in the second quarter, sales
recovered quickly and were roughly flat to 2019 levels in the second half of the year. The sales recovery
we experienced is a direct result of the strength and resiliency of the economies in the states we serve.

Wisconsin's unemployment rate is 4% less than the U.S. unemployment rate, and the state is experiencing
population growth as neighboring states residents are moving to Wisconsin. And in Iowa, the economy has
been recovering even faster with an unemployment rate that is second lowest in the country as well as
strengthening grain prices due to increasing demand from foreign countries.

Turning to our future year's earnings. We see a solid path to delivering our earnings guidance for 2021.
And as we look further into the future, we believe our strong capital investment plan will allow us to
continue to deliver solid returns for our shareowners, including an expected 5% to 7% annual EPS growth
rate to at least 2024. The key drivers of the 6% growth in our 2021 EPS guidance over 2020 are related
to investments in our core utility business, including our recently completed wind projects for Iowa and
Wisconsin customers. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2021 and IPL's
Renewable Energy Rider approved with its test year 2020 rate review.

Currently, renewables make up approximately 20% of our total rate base, which is one of the highest
percentages of renewable rate base among all U.S. utilities. We expect renewables will make up an even
larger portion of our rate base as we invest in solar projects for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers over
the next 3 years. A walk from our 2020 non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings to the midpoint of our
2021 earnings guidance range is provided on Slide 6.

The 2021 earnings guidance assumed a 1% growth in retail electric sales over 2020 levels. This forecast
assumes continued economic improvement and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally,
our employees have been working to add new customers and load to our system. One recent example
of success is our new wholesale customer in Wisconsin, Consolidated Water Power Company. This new
customer came online at the beginning of this year and brings up to 60 megawatts of new load to our
system. Alliant Energy's strategy focused on providing affordable energy to our customers while continuing
our decade-long track record of growing earnings 5% to 7%.

As a reminder, we reached settlements in our Wisconsin jurisdiction to hold rates flat in 2021 by using
excess deferred taxes and fuel savings to offset a higher revenue requirement due to growth in rate base.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

This settlement enables us to earn a return on our investments we've made on behalf of our Wisconsin
customers without increasing their base rates in 2021.

In our Iowa jurisdiction, we expect to manage our business to allow us to stay out of rate cases for
the next couple of years. This has been made possible through collaboration with our regulators and
stakeholders in Iowa, on key items such as deferring costs associated with the August Derecho storm and
the addition of the Renewable Energy Rider. Renewable Energy Rider will allow IPL to recover costs of the
incremental rate base from our recently completed 1 gigawatt of wind, while also passing on significant
incremental production tax credits and fuel cost savings to our customers.

Additionally, our Iowa customers began seeing savings in the fall of 2020 as a result of our decision to
terminate the purchase power agreement related to the Duane Arnold Energy Center 5 years early. IPL
forecasting to get recovery of and return on the buyout payment associated with this termination through
a rider over the next 5 years, while customers benefit from tens of millions of dollars in energy savings
each year.

Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our
consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 20% for 2021. The primary
drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional production tax credits from the new wind projects that
were placed in service throughout 2020 and the return of excess deferred taxes for federal tax reform to
our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers
resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral.

Turning to our financing plans. In November 2020, we accelerated a $200 million debt offering at our
Alliant Energy Finance subsidiary, originally planned for 2021 to capture historically low interest rates. As
a result, our 2021 financing plan is currently limited to 1 long-term debt issuance of up to $300 million in
our Wisconsin utility. And the only common equity activity we are expecting in 2021 is approximately $25
million to be issued ratably during the year through our Shareowner Direct Plan.

And lastly, some key regulatory developments in our key states. In Iowa, current Chair, Geri Huser, was
recently appointed for additional 6 year term. And Josh Byrnes was recently appointed as a new member
to the Iowa Utilities Board. We welcome board member Byrnes, and congratulate Geri Huser on her
additional term.

And in Wisconsin, the PSCW recently issued its final written order approving WPL's rate stabilization plan
in December. The PSCW also issued a procedural schedule for our first solar certificate authority filing in
late 2020, as shown on Slide 8. The docket for our solar CA filing is proceeding as expected, including the
constructive public hearing held yesterday. We anticipate a decision on this first 675 megawatts of solar
from the PSCW in April. Our 2021 key regulatory initiatives are listed on Slide 9. In the first half of this
year, we expect to make an advanced rate-making principles filing in Iowa for our planned 400 megawatts
of solar generation for IPL. As a reminder, the key benefit for the advanced rate-making principles process
in Iowa is the certainty it provides for the authorized returns of earnings on these assets.

In our 3 most recent advanced rate-making filings, we were authorizing an 11% ROE for new generation
assets. The ROE decided with each filing are fixed for the life of the assets. In Wisconsin, we expect to file
our second certificate of authority request in the first half of this year, for the remainder of our announced
solar generation at WPL. In addition, we expect to file a retail electric and gas rate review in Wisconsin
in the second quarter for either 1, 2 or 3 years, beginning in 2022. We are thankful for the privilege to
work in 2 states that are well-known for constructive regulatory outcomes and plan to continue our long-
standing practice of working collaboratively with stakeholders towards constructive regulatory outcomes
on these key regulatory initiatives in 2021.

As we conclude another successful year, I'm excited about our flexible and thoughtful strategy of Alliant
Energy. As John described earlier, we are a leading utility in renewable energy and environmental
stewardship, and we look forward to maintaining that leadership status into the future. We will continue
to deliver on a clean energy vision that will best serve our customers and shareowners as well as our
environment.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Bank.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

My first question is, can you repeat that stat? I think I heard you say that Iowa will reach 50% of
generation from renewables by 2030. I know you have the overall target of 53% from renewables. So
does that include both Iowa and Wisconsin? And does that include owned and PPA?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

I think you've got all that right on there, Andrew. So the first one, the 50% was Iowa. I think you've got
all the rest, so spot on.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Great. Are you able to break out how much of that is owned or said differently, what percent of your
owned capacity will be renewables?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

I'll give you, I think, rough numbers, around 70% is owned and 30% purchased. Of course, that's going to
change a bit as we're bringing units online and we renew, but that's a high level split for you, Andrew.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Great. Next on O&M's impressive year after several other previously impressive years. Am I right,
what's your outlook for 2021 and beyond? And how much of the savings you identified in 2020 would you
consider to be sustainable versus one time?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Andrew, great question. This is Robert. First off, it's a key component to providing affordable
energy for our customers. So we're very focused on that. And we're currently targeting sustainable O&M
reductions of approximately 3% to 5% on an annual basis off of a 2019 baseline. We need to support
that just for affordability. Our employees did an excellent job in 2020 as we captured some additional
savings largely to offset the COVID and the Derecho impacts. And I'd say it's a pretty even mix between
sustainable savings and temporary savings that we saw in 2020. Some of the temporary items with things
like travel, health care and insurance. But we also saw some great progress with sustainable savings,
largely I'll put it probably into 3 main areas. One is technology. We continue to advance technology,
including things like the AMI that we put into service in early 2020 that really helped reduce some of the
meter reading costs. Saw great improvements with automation and self-service that helped us reduce
some of our call center costs. And then we also obviously had some enhanced connectivity through the
pandemic here that we think we'll be able to leverage into the future. So that's one category.

Second is probably on the generation side, where we received some pretty strong efficiency gains with
some more existing coal plants that allows us to operate with fewer employees. And then lastly, on the
distribution side, as we talked about with our strategy, we continue to focus on trying to move from
overhead to underground, and that's really going to position us well there with fewer O&M costs in the
future. So back to your specific question, I'd say it's probably a pretty even mix between the 2. But think

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

of it on a longer-term basis, we're really trying to achieve maybe a 3% to 5% reduction in sustainable
savings over the long term.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Great color. That's very helpful and a very impressive target. Last question is, you've had a very good
track record in Wisconsin of keeping rates stable, and you mentioned you're planning to file again in the
second quarter. Is there any potential to further delay that or find creative ways to keep rates stable? And
then you mentioned that the case could cover 1, 2 or 3 years, what would determine that? What would
that depend on?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Andrew, great question. We entered last year, as you recall, well positioned for a rate filing, which
we have some CapEx and other things that we have to put forward and found a path for stabilization and
executed quite well under that. We're well positioned again, but we have a very clear opportunity to put a
filing in front of the commission, I guess I'd say that will it cover 1, 2 or 3 years, that's still an area that
we're continuing to evaluate. We'll share more as we get closer to the second quarter call. So I appreciate
that. Robert, anything you'd like to add?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

And maybe one thing to note, Andrew, one of the components of this case would be the expiration of
some of the larger amounts of excess deferred taxes that we're giving back to customers currently. And
those are pretty well set in stone. So we don't have a lot of flexibility with those and fairly straightforward.
So I don't think it will be anything that will be controversial with the case itself.

And then as John indicated, the other key component is the solar projects that we will be advancing. So
we'll have more insight to that when we get the decision back from the PSCW in that April time frame for
inclusion of that most likely, like we talked about in second quarter filing. So -- but the third and probably
the last piece of that rate filing is willing to address the anticipated recovery for the Edgewater coal facility
that will be retired by the end of 2022. So we think this is the appropriate time for us to come in for a rate
filing, and we'll give you some more indication of the 1, 2 or 3 years, most likely when we get to the next
earnings call in May.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Certainly a lot of issues to discuss there.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

So perhaps if I can jump in here, on the Columbia announcement, obviously, a fairly large unit here. Can
you talk about the recovery of unappreciated plants, securitization prospects and whether or not you see
legislation as being part of that conversation. It's not obvious. Obviously, some of your peers haven't
necessarily pursued that route, but I'm curious on how you think about that avenue specifically. And then
also the timing and resource planning as part of the replacement, whatever that may eventually be around
it.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

Sure. Great to hear from you, Julien. Good afternoon. So that's -- clearly with the announced retirement,
we look at the flexibility that we have in our CapEx plan. So we do have some opportunity as we think
about between distribution and generation. But there's no question there'll be some additional need. We
don't have the details of the size and timing of that quite yet. That's probably an area for later in the year.
But we do have an opportunity for additional renewables likely to be coupled with storage.

We've been working on our development plans, anticipating that we'll need additional renewables. So as
you know, we've got lot of development efforts in place for what we did on wind in Iowa and then our
solar efforts plus storage in Wisconsin. So we're going to lean heavily on a lot of the great work we've
done over the last few years on that.

As it relates to securitization, there is a provision that currently exists. And I'm sure there's going to be
discussion about the securitization and the potential for that to be another tool, if you will, in the process.
But as we think about it, Julien, it's really about having the right balance between investor outcomes
and customer cost and affordability. Our path forward with our tax equity, we see our solar projects to
be perhaps the lowest, if not among the very lowest cost projects that you're going to see on solar and
renewables. So we feel very good about having that right balance with our tax equity.

Certainly, the process going forward, I'm sure all of that will be in discussion relative to what's the best
path for that balance between customers and share owners. So we expect reasonable outcomes, we have
for many, many years. We're very confident in the filings we put forward, but certainly, more work to come
on that. Robert, anything you'd like to add on to those 2 items?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Maybe just 1 brief item to help with the clarification on the timing. So we have obviously announced
the timing for the Edgewater facility retirement by the end of 2022 and now the Colombia by the end of
2024. The other piece of the puzzle is the West Riverside options. And we're still working through the
exact timing on those. So once we have that, like John said, we expect to have better clarity by the end
of the year. And so like I said, should get some more updates on the CapEx implications, the timings and
resources sometime in the second half of 2021 here.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. So maybe to clarify that. Would the start line effectively to get that to the next 4Q '21 call,
if you have all these elections through the course of the back half of this year? And then secondly, if you
can clarify, sort of related to the long-term outlook, the 5% to 7% is off what base here? Just what's the
baseline for that, again, sorry for the nuance here.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. First one, you've got that spot on with the timing. And the second question was?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'll take that one, Julien. For the base rate for 2020 normalized at $2.42. So the 5% to 7% is off that
base.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Hope you're all doing well. First question, just following on, on the Wisconsin rate filing there. I think you
alluded to one of the potential rate offsets that you may have and taxes, which has been consistent with

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

the past. Is there anything else in the form of regulatory liabilities? And can you help quantify those at all
in terms of rate offsets?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Michael, good to hear from you. So yes, we do still have some regulatory liabilities remaining for the
excess deferred taxes. They're just not at the same level that we're experiencing here in refunds for 2021.
We do have some other, I'll call them regulatory liabilities that were actually approved as part of the rate
stabilization plan that we received approval from the WPL jurisdiction in December. One more notable one
was some liquidated damages that we received as part of the West Riverside facility. I think that is roughly
$35 million to $40 million. So there are some various other benefits that we've been accumulating over
time, whether it was from excess earnings above our authorized returns. So we have a sharing mechanism
for it, but think of it, is probably in the neighborhood of somewhere between probably $60 million and $80
million of total regulatory liabilities that are available to us to be able to use over the next several years to
help offset some of the rate implications.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. And then switching over to Iowa, I just wanted to check-in. I thought in
your last deck you had on the calendar there a filing related to the 2020 test period that was going to be
made in Q2 of this year, and I didn't see that in the updated deck. So just wondering where that kind of
stands?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think what you're referring to is, there is a subsequent proceeding process. So as part of the 2020
rate filing, there are rules that are still being drafted, so they're not completely filling it. But the IUB
recently decided that we will be coming in for what they call a subsequent proceeding. And really what
that's intended to do is to make sure that the rates that we put in effect into 2020 were reasonable and
just. And we believe they were. We don't expect any refunds or any potential changes in the future. And
it's largely going to be based on where our earned ROEs came out for the end of 2020. We actually under-
earned in 2020 below the 10% authorized level. So we don't expect any impacts of that. But we'll still be
working through the process with the Iowa Utilities Board over the next several months. And then there'll
also be some processes to finalize those rules and exactly what needs to be found over the next several
months.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. And my last one was just you gave that data point of, I think, 20% renewables in rate base
right now. Any parameters you can help give on where that could potentially go over the next 4 to 5 years
given the plan that you've laid out?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

We don't give you a directional area of north, Michael, but probably no additional specifics for right now,
but it's certainly growing.

Operator

And we have one last question on the phone line, and we'll take it from Andrew Levi with HITE Hedge.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

Just a couple of questions. So first, just in both Iowa and Wisconsin, as you go through the 2 regulatory
processes there, what's the opportunity and timing, if the answer is, there is one potential settlement in
both cases.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Maybe think of Iowa as we're probably a couple of years away from a rate filing, a formal rate filing,
if you will, in Iowa. So that's a little bit out there. In Wisconsin, we've had a good track record of working
very collaboratively, and we'll put a very solid case together. So there's always that potential. I don't want
to handicap it beyond that, but we've had some very recent success in achieving that type of settlement
outcome. But other than that, I'd say it's -- as we have been in the past years, I think that opportunity
exists.

Andrew Levi

Okay. And then just focusing on the clean energy blueprint, the focus always on investor calls or just in
sell-side reports details the fleet transition, which obviously is a great opportunity. But then you talk to
some of my peers and they like well, then what happens after that? And I guess, conversations I've had
with you guys in the past, there seems to be a lot of runway beyond the key transition I think on the team
B side that needs to be done to long help the fleet transition but also help your service territory both in
Wisconsin and Iowa convert to a clean energy world. Can you kind of talk about the runway opportunities
there? And what is in the CapEx already and what is not in the longer-term opportunities there?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Sure. Happy to. I'll probably have -- if Robert wants to add any of the numbers there. But if you think
about the clean energy future, it's really got to make sure that we think about how that fits transmission,
generation, and it really doesn't happen unless the distribution grid is also moving that way. So we've
got, as I noted, opportunities for resiliency to put our systems for more overhead to underground. We're
starting that out, and there's opportunity to grow that area as well as having a stronger distribution grid
at a voltage that allows for more distributed energy resources to connect. So that's also an opportunity
for us. It's in our current, but there's certainly an opportunity as we get more efficient for that, those 2
areas to grow. So we do see the distribution areas having plenty of growth potential for us. But as we do,
in many cases, we start kind of walk before we run and make sure that we get very efficient as we deploy
capital. Maybe if there's anything on categories and growth numbers, Robert, I'll ask you to weigh in.

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Andy. Good to hear from you. Yes, I'd characterize our rate base growth is much in line with our
earnings growth. We're not expecting any new common equity for the foreseeable future. So we think
we can manage the business appropriately to achieve our 5% to 7% EPS targets without having much
of an impact on customer bills over the long run. And maybe just to add a couple more categories to the
information John shared. We still have repowering opportunities on our sites that I'd say is probably more
in the second half of this decade. And then we really don't have much of any storage built into our CapEx
plans at this point. We do have some smaller, I would say, pilot programs that we're using, but there's also
some further opportunities there. And then lastly is we have got a series of coal plants still in Iowa that we
haven't announced the timing of any potential retirements. So if we think of that over the next 10 or 15
years, that will likely create some capacity needs for us that could provide some additional growth for us.

Andrew Levi

I have 2 more questions. Actually, the storage thing, I'm glad that you actually brought up because I
didn't see when I was discussing that a few weeks ago, actually debating it as far as timing. But I guess,
what is your thinking on storage? Because, obviously, based on what you're installing as far as solar
and wind, storage would be a good incremental addition to those assets. And if you kind of look at what
NextEra is already doing with storage, there's a great opportunity as software for storage evolves, it has

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

evolved, it's really a benefit to your customers. So why have you guys not kind of rolled out a storage plan
yet, an easier way to put it?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Great question on that, Andy. And certainly, as I had shared, we do have storage facilities, I'll
call them small. Again, we'll kind of prove those technologies out and then scale them up. We've done
some grid deferral storage work up to this point and tied it in with some of our community efforts and
community solar size. So think of that as a little bit smaller size. We do have development work going on
right now to size that up. And so that -- think of that as grid deferral. But as we're putting larger scale
wind and solar out there, we also have development plans to look at adding larger scale storage to help
with the front and back-end of how those units introduce into the market. So completely agree. We're
making sure that it always got to make sense to our customers. So we're eager to add those when it
makes sense for our customers, and we're in heavy development work right now.

Andrew Levi

So what's, I guess, maybe in the third quarter when you roll out your new CapEx plan, we may see the
numbers regarding storage, is that possible?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. You know us well, Andy.

Andrew Levi

Okay. And then the other thing just on the -- focusing on the line, the T&D line. Isn't there a large
opportunity that maybe you can talk about it. Does not want to generalize these as you begin to increase
like 3 kV to a much higher kV. Can you maybe talk about that and kind of where you are? Because I think
you've gotten the process on that. And maybe some numbers around how much -- I mean, I don't know
if you want to do miles, but how much of your system needs to be converted? And if there's any type of
measurement that you can give us as far as CapEx per conversion, whether its mileage, whatever it may
be.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Certainly, as we think about that, Andy, I think you're referring to our efforts to put a 25 kV backbone
system out there. And that's what I had referred to earlier that allows us to put more distributed energy
resources or customer connected resources to our grid. We're in the beginning stages of that. I think
we're roughly up. I'll use numbers around 5% of our system, but think of it as that's something you
want to have condensed to certain areas where you convert smartly in certain areas as you're doing
other work, it makes sense. And as we look for areas that have higher growth, for some of those DER
penetration. The cost per unit and CapEx, I don't have those readily available, but that would refer back to
our opportunities for additional distribution grid spend as we think about getting more and more efficient
in that space. So think about it as the tail end of our current CapEx. And I think you'll see more of that as
we refresh our CapEx going forward.

Andrew Levi

Let me ask it this way, maybe Robert would now provide. So you said, right now, it's just 5% of your
system that you're kind of doing work on for the upgrade. Robert, do you have any clue how much you're
spending on that? Just that one, whether it's a project. I don't know if it's one big project that equals 5%
or any type of kind of numbers around that?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

I mean, right now, we're probably replacing our system at the normal replacement rate of maybe 2%
of the total system on an annual basis. We have roughly about 43,000 miles of line about a 1/4 of it is
underground and about 3/4 of its overhead at this point. And like John said, only about 5% of it is at the
25 kV level at this point in time. So when you think about costs, including stuff, example, underground,
you're probably talking a couple of hundred thousand dollars a mile, at least depending on whether it's
in town or in the country. So a lot of opportunity for us. We don't have specific quantification of the exact
dollars that you'll see in the future, but that's really part of the functional plan that we have. But as we
have all these generation opportunities in the near term, we pushed some of that out. But we see a
great opportunity maybe in the second half of this decade into the following decade for those types of
expenditures and a good long runway to the growth that we're targeting.

Operator

And it does look like we have an additional question on the phone line from Andrew Weisel with Scotia
Bank.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Thanks for the followup after Andy just tried to send everyone to Happy Hours, I feel kind of guilty for
having one more question here, but if I may, so you've got in the slide that your carbon emissions were
down 42% in 2020 versus 2005. Do you have any way to quantify how much of that was due to the
impact of the pandemic? Volumes, obviously, dispatch was a bit abnormal last year to say the least. Are
you expecting that number to go up a little bit before it resumes the downward trend?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Andrew, when you think of that, it's one of those numbers that will cycle up and down a bit. We look
at overall trajectory of that getting to our stated goal when we reach 2030. So we like the path that we're
on. I'm sure there's a contributor from a number of those factors, but we also look at the transitions we're
making with some of our planned retirements of coal facilities, the high efficient West Riverside. So don't
have the specifics. That number will bounce around a bit, but we look at kind of the overall trend line, and
it's really on track with what our stated objectives are.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. So on target for the 50% reduction by 2030 and net 0 by 2050, right? On target, not necessarily
better?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes, I'd stay on target for right now, but I appreciate the question.

And it does appear that there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Gille, I'd like to turn the
