STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. And welcome to the STERIS plc Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Julie Winter
Senior Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. As usual, on today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our
President and CEO; and Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO.

I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast
contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission
or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some

Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The
company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new
information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and
on our website.

In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share,
segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow, will be used.
Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available on today's release,
including reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures
are presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplement all financial
information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational
decision-making.

With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to
review the highlights of our third quarter performance.

For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue growth was 12%, driven by volume and 60 basis
points of price. We continue to experience strong underlying growth from our customers and success with
new products. A total of $13 million or 180 basis points is included in constant currency organic revenue
growth for the quarter from the 8 tuck-in acquisitions we completed this fiscal year.

Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 43.1%and was impacted favorably by
productivity, price and mix, somewhat offset by higher labor costs. EBIT margin for the quarter was
21.1% of revenue, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter last year, despite an increase in
expenses relating to higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance and a 9% increase in
R&D expenses.

The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20%. Net income in the quarter grew 16% to $124
million, and earnings increased to $1.45 per diluted share, benefiting from revenue growth and margin
expansion.

STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

In terms of the balance sheet, we ended December with $199.2 million of cash and $1.1 billion in
total debt. During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $55.5 million while depreciation and
amortization was $49.6 million.

Free cash flow for the first 9 months declined as anticipated to $231 million -- sorry, $238.1 million,
primarily due to the planned increase in capital spending. Our capital expenditures have been lower
through the first 3 quarters of the year due to the timing of capital projects. As a result, we are
decreasing our full year expectations for capital spending to $240 million and increasing our free cash flow
expectations to $340 million.

With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you've already heard, our third quarter continued the
trend of outperformance we've seen in the last several quarters. We experienced solid growth across all
of our segments and in total delivered double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth for the third
consecutive quarter, exceeding our expectations.

Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment had a significantly stronger quarter than we anticipated,
driven by double-digit growth in the repair business and continued contributions from new outsourced
reprocessing centers coming online. Margins in this segment were impacted somewhat by start-up costs
for outsourced reprocessing centers and personnel costs to support future growth.

Life Science also outperformed in the quarter with good growth in consumables and a record level of
capital equipment shipments. Even with the strong shipments, our increased capital orders allowed us to
end the quarter with record backlog levels in Life Science.

AST continued its outstanding revenue performance this year, growing 15% on a constant currency
organic revenue basis for the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from our core medical device
customers around the world.

And lastly, Healthcare Products delivered a solid quarter with particular strength in consumables. We
continue to benefit from our new consumable products as well as recently acquired businesses. Our
service maintenance revenue has grown, too, and was augmented by installation revenue due to the
strong capital shipments in the first half of the year.

Based on our performance year-to-date and expectations for the rest of the fiscal year, we are once again
revising our full year outlook. Starting with revenue, we now expect constant currency organic revenue
growth of approximately 9% for fiscal 2020, up from the prior 7.5% to 8.5% range. This increase is due
to outperformance in the third quarter. Our expectations for the fourth quarter reflect difficult year-over-
year comparisons. Recall that our prior year Q4 constant currency organic revenue growth was 9%. In
particular, we expect capital equipment to be roughly flat across the businesses in Q4.

In Healthcare Products, which makes up the bulk of our capital equipment revenue, we have very difficult
comparisons against the strong fourth quarter last year. As we mentioned in the past, we continue our
effort to level our capital shipments and avoid fourth quarter spikes.

Given the strength we have seen so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now
anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share to be at the high end of our $5.50 to $5.65 range. As a
result, we continue to expect another year of record performance in 2020. We believe the short-term and
long-term future for STERIS is bright, and we appreciate your ongoing support.

Now, before we open the Q&A, I would like to comment on coronavirus. As you probably know, China is
a relatively small piece of STERIS' global revenue. So we don't anticipate any material impact to revenue
from the coronavirus as a result of China sales this fiscal year.

STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

On the supply chain side, although the situation is fluid, we are in regular communication with our Chinese
suppliers. At this time, we believe we should be able to mitigate any issues that may arise, so there are no
material impacts to revenue due to the supply chain issues this fiscal year as well.

We are in contact with our customers to understand how the situation is impacting NIM and what we can
do to help. We're also in contact with our people and are deeply concerned for their health and safety.
Our China operations have been closed since the Lunar New Year, except for limited operations to support
critical products, and we will continue to follow the guidance of the government and do what is best for
our people. Like most businesses, we have restricted travel to and from China across the company.

With that, we are happy to take any questions you may have. Julie, can you open the call for Q&A, please?

Julie Winter
Senior Director of Investor Relations
Thank you, Walt and Mike, for your comments. Gary, if you would please give the instructions, we can get
started with Q&A.

STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities.

David Louis Turkaly
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

Walt, one for you off the bat here. If 1Q was a hot quarter, I'd love to ask you what you call this quarter.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Pretty darned.

David Louis Turkaly
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

To get into a serious question here. But, I guess, there was no onetime impact here, right? There was no
extra days or anything like that. You called out the pricing. But -- and I think the M&A side had a little
contribution, but overall, no other onetime impacts in the quarter, correct?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

I wouldn't characterize any of the impacts of the quarter being abnormal.

David Louis Turkaly
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

Great. And I guess, if we look at those deals that you mentioned, I think you said 8. I guess, any color on
them, where they fall? And you mentioned the contribution. But I guess, it might be nice to know what
things you've added, even though they're relatively small versus your base.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Dave. We're not going to get into the details of that. As we mentioned, the bulk of the revenue
this year is coming in, in the hospital products business or Healthcare Products business. It's actually
smattered around the various units in that business, none of which are consequential. It does add up 0.5
or so of revenue in the quarter. And our best estimate is about 1 point for the year over time. So again,
there's nothing here that's particularly material in the short run. There's a couple of them, we think,
maybe, for instance, in the long run, but we'll hold that until we see how they work out.

Operator

The next question is from Chris Cooley with Stephens.

Christopher Cook Cooley
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on a great quarter. Just 2 for me. Really solid from top to bottom, both in terms of growth
and the leverage. I guess, just a couple of things we wanted to get our hands a little bit better around.
And specifically, when we look at Healthcare Products, you had a really strong year-over-year increase in
consumables. I'd like a little -- understand a little bit more about what drove that and then why -- I guess,
to offset that, why we didn't see more margin expansion with that level of growth and that percentage of
contribution in Healthcare Products coming from consumables within the broader category there from the
segment margin? I've just got one more follow-up after that.

STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Chris, it's Mike. In the consumables, a portion of that growth is actually from some of the acquisitions
that we just completed. It's about $8 million to $10 million of that -- something of that nature, Julie,
right?

Julie Winter
Senior Director of Investor Relations

Yes.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So for the quarter, $8 million to $10 million of impact -- favorable impact, obviously, on the revenue
side from some of the acquisitions we just completed.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

The other point, Chris, is as we mentioned, our service had a strong -- service as product consumables as
we look at it and service profitability is not as strong on an ROS basis as is the chemistry-type products
and endoscopy-type products. And so that had more of an averaging effect. It looks more like capital.
Obviously, on an ROE basis, it's pretty good because there's very little capital. But on an ROS basis, it's
not as strong.

Christopher Cook Cooley
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Certainly. And then, I guess, just lastly for me. As we look ahead beyond the remainder of this fiscal year,
it seems to be a hot topic out there right now about capacity at AST. Could you just kind of maybe walk us
through where you are in general terms from a capacity perspective, thoughts on incremental CapEx and
just how you can see that business growing from a longer-term perspective?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Chris. I'll let Mike talk about CapEx. But at a high level, obviously, our ethylene oxide plants are
pretty full right now. And they've had increased pressure, if you will, or fullness. It has moved from the
U.S. to overseas as we're now processing some things that would normally have processed in Americas
overseas. So they're getting more full. Having said that, we continue to add capacity. And so there's
2 ways we add; one, is by adding facilities or growing the number of chambers inside the facilities.
The other is being more efficient with lean approaches inside those facilities. And we're doing both. So
although we are more full than normal on the ethylene oxide type facilities, we continue to grow the ability
to grow, if you will. This -- and by the same token, on the radiation side, we can also continue to grow
our ability to grow. And there, we've talked about a number of plants that are being built or added or
opened across our global network. And we're doing so in a very technology-neutral approach. That is,
we're adding e-beam technology, we're adding x-ray technology, and we're adding capacity in the Cobalt
facility. So we do see that as the approach. We clearly see greater growth in the e-beam and x-ray type
facilities than in the -- in any of the others, actually. And so that's where we're placing our money. Mike, I
don't know if you want to talk about CapEx.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Chris. So at the beginning of the year, our view was we're going to spend about $100 million in
growth CapEx in AST alone. Obviously, that number has come down a little bit because of just the timing
of projects, and I think we have about 8 recent projects that are being worked on that we've announced.
Our view would be it's just a timing issue. So next year, I would look at CapEx being probably at that
elevated level once again and maybe even for the next year or 2 after that. Obviously, with the growth

STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

that we're seeing from our customers from a medical device industry, we need to continue to add capacity
to maintain the current growth.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

And I would say -- I mean, as I've talked about a lot, we see the medical device business growing. We're
in the middle of the baby boom right now, and the baby boomers are largely entering -- the biggest part
of the baby boom is entering the high health care spending years. And things like orthopedic implants and
stents and all those good medical devices to improve our lives get used a lot more when you're 65 and
70 and 75 than when you're 45 and 50 and 55. So we see sustained growth for our customers on the unit
volume, at least for the foreseeable future. And that creates sustained growth for our AST business as
well as our hospital business or Healthcare Business. But I would add that given our global network, it is, I
think, easier and easier for global-type companies to work with someone like us who has broad coverage.
We can move from plant A to plant B if they need to for whatever reason. And also, they can count on a
single quality system and single regulatory system. So I do think that is helpful for us to grow a bit faster
than the market.

Operator

Our next question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

You mentioned that results were ahead of expectations. You've had 2 straight quarters that are consistent
like this. Just curious, what in particular is surprising to you about the sustainability of these trends?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Well, I guess, Matt, I'll answer in 4, 5 years if they sustain, then I'll feel even more strongly about the
sustainability. But a lot of the things that we have been working on seem to be coming together right
now. So if you walk through it, we talked about the nice growth in the healthcare services business, both
the equipment and repair business is growing nicely as we've added and continue to add capacity. The
outsourced solutions, as I mentioned before, we think it's going to look a bit different in the Americas than
it looks in the U.K. And I think we're getting better at understanding that model and providing what our
customers want and need. So that business has a pretty good growth rate, we think. The Life Science
business has continued kind of its long-term growth rate on the chemistry side, maybe slightly off of some
of the faster years but still solid growth in that business. And vaccines and biologics, we think, is a good
space to be in, and that's where we are.

On the AST side, I think I've already talked about that. But we think that is a good grower. And on the
healthcare side of the business, again, we continue to add product to our portfolio. We continue to refine
our sales approaches. And, again, particularly in the -- I'll call it industrialized countries, we're facing the
middle of the baby boom coming through, and that's going to be like a pig through a python in my opinion
for the next 10 to 15 years. So the underlying market demand is good, and we're doing our jobs to pick up
at least our fair share of that.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

All right. And then how have your conversations evolved with the like major health care systems,
especially with your scale? I'm just trying to understand how interconnected some of the growth is across
businesses like Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty Services? Are they looking at you differently
and trying to consolidate more business with you?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Matt, that's an excellent question. The answer to your question is, yes, yes. We are clearly seeing more
interconnection between the healthcare service business and the Healthcare Products business. In some
respects, one is the customer of the other. And so, oftentimes, when we're looking at things, we're able
to talk to the hospitals about what their needs are, our healthcare systems and what their needs are. And
for one, it might be, "I add a little more to the CSD that I have." The other one may say, "Gee, I'll add
some more, but can you take over some?" Another might say, "Gee, we'd like you to run our ORC, but we
still need to have centers in -- turn centers in our ambulatory surgery centers." I mean, it is a -- they are
evolving their business model in this space. And having the full spectrum of products and services across
that space does put us in a different position to give them what they want independent of what we might
think is the best thing. And so it's like most of the things we do, we work hard to be technology neutral,
approach neutral, have a broad spectrum of things that we could offer our customer and let them choose
which piece of the spectrum they want.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's really helpful color. Could you also give us an update on the ORC model? You're talking about
that a little bit more now? I think you previously quoted like $50 million in business on 3 contracts. Have
those at least launch and are running as expected?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Again, we don't talk about specific ones. We have now more centers up. I don't know that we're going to
give those numbers, but we have more centers out. I know we're not going to give locations to talk about
our customers, but we have more centers up. Some of them are more like micro centers, some of them
are more like larger centers. But the numbers we have quoted for our growth forecast for the ORCs, we
continue to exceed those, which is a part of the reason HSS is beating our expectations.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then last question, and it's a multipart question. So just warning you in advance. I thought you
guys did -- at the FDA panel, I thought you did an excellent job. I thought you guys were clearly the --
on EO were clearly the adults in the room. So -- because I wanted to ask some follow-up questions on
sustainable EO. I think how long would it take to switch practices from traditional EO to sustainable EO to
facility? What is the incremental cost of implementing that at a medium-sized facility? Does it require new
equipment? And like what would be the cost savings of using less EO?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

I'm going to work backwards on your question, Matt. It costs nothing to the facilities and does not
require any consequential change to equipment, gas, whatever. So that is a non-cost item. It does cost
our customers and us working together. We have to revalidate the fact that the process, which uses,
oftentimes, half the gas that the traditional process has used, it does -- we have to make sure -- we know
we're using less gas, so we know have to validate that part of the question. We know there will be less
effluent. So we know that's not an issue. But -- and we also know the FDA pays particular attention to how
much residual gas stays in the product. So if it gets implanted into the patient, that's okay. But we know
that's better because we're starting out with less gas. So all those things are known. We just need to be
absolutely positively sure that we are sterilizing the device when we do that. And that requires validation
by the customers and us. We are working with the -- and also currently or historically requires the agency
to look at it and approve it. We are working with the agency to lay out templates to make that far simpler
for our customers and far less of a regulatory burden for our customers to be able to do that. So I'll call it
the switching -- the cost for the switching costs is all around validation than any other, I'll call it, material
cost. Now obviously, it uses a little less gas. That cost is largely immaterial in the process. So as -- the
delta in the gas usage is relatively immaterial. And frankly, in most cases, our total cost is immaterial
relative to the transportation cost in the process. So this is not a big cost issue. It is a get-it-right issue,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

and both we and our customers are very serious to make sure that in enhancing what's potentially in the
environment that we do not take any risk that the product is not sterile. Right now, we're -- I'm going to
use the word that's an oxymoron. Today, in many cases, we're over sterilizing. Now, once you kill all the
bugs, you can't kill them again. So we're over gassing and not really over sterilizing. And to the extent
we're over gassing, we don't need to do that. It does -- it takes time, but it's not -- it's measured in
months for any specific customer and any specific product, but there's awful lot of customers and awful lot
of products out there. So it will take a series of years, we believe. But we do think -- and Mr. Carestio, our
Chief Operating Officer, who grew up in that business absolutely believes in the set of target for his team
to get down 50% using half the gas we used to use for the same level of requirements at -- and do that
inside of 5 years. And we think we can hit those targets.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Walt, just wanted to start with you. Obviously, this fiscal year-to-date has been really outstanding, both
in revenue generation and margin expansion. I'm just wondering, as we all start to think about fiscal '21,
and I recognize you're not providing guidance, but can you help us just think about any sort of puts and
takes that we should be considering for both -- as we sort of look at revenues and margins for next year?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Larry, as you have said, we're not giving guidance right now. And I know, in some respects, that could
be frustrating for you guys because most companies are calendar-year companies, and we're a quarter
behind the calendar year. So as a result, we're a quarter late versus calendar year kind of projections. So
we have not -- we're in our planning processes. We have not concluded those processes. As I mentioned
the Chinese thing, there's a little fluidity there. But I will say a couple of things to think about, a, we are
starting from very nice growth rates, right? I mean, we're approaching double digits for the year at 9%.
That gives us tough comps. But the flip side is, last year, we started out with uncertainties in device tax,
uncertainties in labor rates, uncertainties in trade. And for us, trade is North America, more than China. So
the trade uncertainties in terms of NAFTA and then -- and Brexit. And last year, we did have some tough
comps in Q4, which, again, we have tough comps this year in Q4. So if you look all through that, at a high
level, we think about this business for the markets we're in to be in kind of a 4% to 6% constant currency
grower. And hopefully, we get a point or so of share. You never know exactly when and how that's going
to happen. Hopefully, we get a little price. Hopefully, we get a couple of acquisitions. And the next thing
you know, we're in those high single digits. We're pretty comfortable right now with where we sit, that will
be toward the high end of that 4% to 6% rates in our constant currency growth rates. Again, we haven't
done our final analysis. We will obviously talk more about that in 3 months, but we're feeling pretty good
about the high side.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And I would assume, again, similar thoughts around margin. So I mean there's no reason to think that
margins wouldn't expand going forward?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

As you know, Larry, I'm not the margin expansion guy, I'm the margin growing guy. I like to grow profit
dollars, but I don't have any reason to believe. I am absolutely confident we will be working to improve
our cost position. We will choose on what to do in terms of how that -- how we handle that in terms of
lack of price increase or price increase. We definitely are facing a little headwind on the labor side. Labor
rates are clearly going up. But when we put all that together, we don't see any reason to be off our normal
paths.

STERIS PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. One more bigger picture on that. I just have a couple of quick ones for -- perhaps for Mike. But as
you think about the next steps within the sterilization regulatory pathway, could you bring us up to speed
sort of what do you think the EPA will ultimately wind up doing as it comes out with its recommendations?
And then, look, clearly, the states of Georgia and Illinois have been challenging, really more from a local
government perspective. And I guess that's always the concern. But how do you think about -- are there
any states where you guys are operating where local government could start to become more of an issue
and in operation of these types of facilities?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Larry, forecasting what governments are going to do is a little like forecasting elections. And I don't
really think we have any great knowledge on that. I will say and I mentioned it last time, we have been
impressed with the way the FDA has taken this bull by the horns, knowing that there is 50-some-odd
percent of the devices are sterilized by ethylene oxide that need to be sterile. And so that -- it's very
important to them to keep those supply chains moving. And we -- I think they're doing a superb job of
working on that. The EPA and particularly because the FDA and the Secretary of Health have made it clear
the risks that the country takes on if we cannot sterilize with ethylene oxide in the intermediate term. I
think they would have done a nice job, but I think they are doing -- taking a nice methodical approach. It
would be very easy for them to make a snap judgment. But from what we see, the way they've requested
information, the way they're asking all types of players in the space, the manufacturers of the devices,
those who sterilize and those who are concerned about those issues in the environment. By the way,
we're in 2 of those -- we're in all 3 of those 3 buckets. So we're concerned about the environment,
we're concerned about sterilization, we're concerned about a device manufacturer -- being a device
manufacturer. So it seems to me they're taking a very balanced approach to this process. We do feel --
our own opinion is we feel that we're at the high end of the industry in terms of the way we handle things.
Our move toward sustainable EO a couple of years ago now certainly led the industry, and we're clearly
seeing people being very interested in that approach now. We also know about -- know the design of our
facilities and the way we handle the gas and the way we remediate the gas is at the high end of the -- I'll
call it, the good end of the industry. So we are very comfortable that we have been and are safe for our
people and our communities. But that doesn't mean we can rest on our laurels. We intend to get safer
and safer, which is why we do this 50% reduction. And we're always looking at the way that we handle
the gas inside and outside our facilities, and we'll continue to do so. And by the way, that's not just a
comment about the United States. That's a comment about the world. We are not assuming that the only
people that care about ethylene oxide gas are Americans. And so that's our approach. We're comfortable
-- as comfortable one can get, I guess, because you can always have something occur. You are correct in
my own view, the bigger risk in the short run at least is the -- is local and state governments. But I do
think now that it's very clear that both the FDA and the EPA are engaged that there's more likelihood that
people will wait and see what that result is. And then based on that result, we'll take appropriate actions.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay, very good. And then for Mike, just wanted to think a little bit about the investments within HSS. The
operating margin of that business unit has trended down over the past 3 quarters. I think it's 10.7% this
quarter on an operating margin basis from 14.6% in the fourth quarter of '19. So, just again, I want to
make sure I'm understanding the investments. It seems pretty straightforward, but I just want to make
sure we're understanding that. And then, what's the right way to think about, again, margins for this
business going forward?

And then the second question, Mike, is you talked about 100 basis points or so of growth being added by
M&A this quarter -- this year. What is the threshold for when you kind of pull that out of organic growth?
Because you still characterize as organic constant currency growth, but there's 100 basis points in there
from M&A. So just trying to understand what the threshold is.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, certainly, Larry, I'll answer the second question first. Typically, what we do is when we do any type
of, I'll call it, material acquisition, we would separate that out and actually disclose that separately, so
that we are not in this -- the boat that we're in today where we're trying to call out constant currency
organic revenue growth and then also note at the same point in time what the acquisitions added. So,
unfortunately, this year, doing 8 acquisitions that were all individually immaterial, but if you aggregate
them all together, they become material. So that's the reason we chose our -- the way we want to disclose
that this year is make sure that everybody understands the impact. And there is a pretty significant
impact in the third quarter, 180 basis points in the quarter for constant currency organic revenue growth,
that it is understood and we're being as transparent as possible. We don't like going down that path,
obviously. We would prefer to do an acquisition and separate that out and go back to our historical
reporting, but this year is an anomaly, hopefully. But again, with 8 acquisitions combined being -- in the
combination of all being relative, we have to do something so that we're, again, truly being transparent.
Your first -- you want to say something?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

And just to be clear on that. When Mike says we don't like that, he's talking the accounting issues, not the
businesses.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Right, yes.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

We like those businesses. We love tuck-in businesses. If I can do 10 more next year -- it looks like these
8 will do 10 more next year, we'll be talking about this again, I suspect. But, it's not that we don't like the
businesses.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

We just don't like the reporting of...

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

We don't want to be changing our constant currency growth rate every month because of some small
businesses. Really that's the point.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

And then your first question regarding the HSS business, obviously, as Walt mentioned in his script that
we did have start-up costs for the new ORCs. And in addition to that, we are continuing to have people
costs to support the future growth in HSS. I mean, our long-term view of this business is still mid-teens.
We haven't come off of that. Obviously, you are seeing the benefit of the revenue, the top line growth. But
it does come with a little bit of start-up cost, which we've talked about for 2 years now in a row. And as
we bring facilities online, it probably takes roughly 12, maybe 18 months, depending on the size of the
facility to get to breakeven and then start actually adding profit to that business. So it's not unusual, and
it's not a surprise to us by any means.
