MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Presentation

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this
webinar is being recorded and will be archived for 1 year on our Investor Relations page at
www.monolithicpower.com.

My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are
Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO.

During this webinar, we will discuss our Q2 2021 financial results and guidance for Q3 2021, followed by a
Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]

In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve
risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and
expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.
Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe
harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-
K filed on March 1, 2021, and our Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2021, which are accessible through our
website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on
today's call.

We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income,
interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-
GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a
substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table
that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is
included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2020,
Q1 2021 and Q2 2021 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $293.3 million, 15.3% higher than the first
quarter of 2021 and 57.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020. This broad-based year-over-year
revenue growth was the result of our diversified growth strategy, technological innovation and investment
in production capacity.

Turning now to our second quarter 2021 revenue by market. Computing and storage revenue of $87.7
million increased 30.0% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential revenue improvement reflected
increased demand and market share gains for servers and data centers and notebooks. Computing and
storage revenue represented 29.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 34.4% in the
second quarter of 2020.

Second quarter consumer revenue of $76.1 million increased 14.9% from the first quarter of 2021. The
sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected earlier than normal sales of gaming console products.
Consumer revenue represented 25.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 25.6% in the
second quarter of 2020. Second quarter automotive revenue of $48.7 million increased 8.5% from the first
quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased sales of infotainment products. Second quarter 2021 revenue
was up 173.9% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 16.6% of MPS' second quarter 2021
revenue compared with 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020.

Second quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $43.3 million increased 8.9% from the first quarter of 2021,
reflecting increased sales of products for power source applications. Industrial revenue represented

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

14.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.3% in the second quarter of 2020.
Second quarter 2021 communications revenue of $37.5 million was up 3.9% from the first quarter
of 2021. Most of the sequential revenue increase was due to higher product sales for networking and
wireless applications. Communications sales represented 12.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue
compared with 16.2% in the second quarter of 2020.

Our sustainable above-market growth is based on the following: We have and are continuously investing
in the expansion and diversification of our supply chain; we accelerated the release of advanced products
and solutions based on our new technologies; three, we have gained increased acceptance of our solutions
with first tier customers globally; and four, we continue to diversify and support a wider number of end
product applications. With our planned capacity expansion in place and as we release more parts into
production, we are well positioned to accelerate our future revenue growth.

Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 56.0%, 60 basis points higher
than the first quarter of 2021 and 90 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2020. Our GAAP
operating income was $60.6 million compared to $46.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2021 and
$28.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of
2021 was 56.3%, up 50 basis points from the gross margin reported for the first quarter of 2021, and 60
basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin as
a percent of revenue reflected lower proportional overhead costs. Our non-GAAP operating income was
$94.9 million compared to $75.8 million reported in the prior quarter and $53.0 million reported in the
second quarter of 2020, representing a 79% year-over-year increase in operating income.

Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $103.6 million in the second
quarter of 2021 compared with $95.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $74.6 million in the second
quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2021 operating expenses were $70.3 million, up from the
$66.2 million we spent in the first quarter of 2021, and up from the $50.7 million recorded in the second
quarter of 2020. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for
the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred
compensation plan.

For the second quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $885,000
charged to cost of goods sold, was $32.1 million compared with $28.6 million recorded in the first quarter
of 2021.

Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $55.2 million or $1.16 per fully
diluted share compared with $45.4 million or $0.95 per share in the first quarter of 2021 and $30.2 million
or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2020.

Q2 non-GAAP net income was $86.5 million or $1.81 per fully diluted share compared with $69.5 million
or $1.46 per share in the first quarter of 2021 and $50.6 million or $1.08 per share in the second quarter
of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2021 were 47.8 million.

Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $672.9 million at the
end of the second quarter of 2021 compared to $641.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021. For
the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $96.9 million compared with Q1 2021 operating
cash flow of $77.1 million. Second quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $39.3 million.

Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2021 at $77.6 million, representing 24 days of sales
outstanding, which was 6 days lower than the 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2021 and
3 days lower than the 27 days reported in the second quarter of 2020.

Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2021 were $177.3 million, up from $175.2
million at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Days of inventory of 125 days at the end of the second
quarter of 2021 or 16 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2021.

Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue.
We believe comparing current inventory levels with following quarters revenue provides a better economic
match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory of 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021

or 7 days lower than the 124 days at the end of the first quarter of 2021 and 2 days lower than the 119
days at the end of the second quarter of 2020.

I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in
the range of $309 million to $321 million. Gross margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected
to include a onetime benefit from a $4 million litigation settler. Including this benefit, GAAP gross margin
will be in the range of 57.3% to 57.9% and non-GAAP gross margin will be in a range of 57.6% to 58.2%.
Excluding this onetime event, non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%.

Total stock-based compensation expense should be in the range of $31.2 million to $33.2 million, including
approximately $950,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses
should be between $104.1 million and $108.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will be in the
range of $73.9 million to $75.9 million. Litigation expense should range between $2.3 million and $2.7
million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in
the range of 47.4 million to 48.4 million shares.
In conclusion, with our planned capacity expansion in place and as we release more parts into production,
we are well positioned to accelerate our future revenue growth. I'll now open up the webinar for questions.

Question and Answer

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Congrats again on another strong and record quarter. I was hoping you could update us on your capacity
plans. I know you've done a pretty good job here in the last 18 months. Your inventories seem to be in
good shape, perhaps a bit at the lower end. But maybe you could help us understand a little bit more what
you specifically are doing on the capacity side.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

On the -- thanks, Tore. Our capacity is, as always, in the past 3 or 4 years, and we keep expanding and
now we continue that. However, we do have capacities and have over $2 billion before the middle of next
year. So we have enough capacity for us to grow. And then now we have just qualified more product and
release to production and ultimately, in our customers' hands.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

And at the expense of repeating ourselves, Tore, you recall that last year, we brought up a 12-inch fab.
And this year, we've brought up an 8-inch fab, which is already contributing to inventory. So in both cases,
what we're continuing to do is expand out by qualifying more parts so that we will be able to meet the $2
billion level by the middle of next year.

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Very good. And your cash balance has doubled here in the last couple of years, and it's now at $670
million. Obviously, it's is a luxury issue to have. But what do you intend to do with that cash? Because
obviously, you don't need that much. So do you plan to return it more back to shareholders? Or are you
potentially looking at M&A? And the reason I'm asking this is because it's so high now, right? I mean I
know historically, you've grown your business organically, but it's so high now that I just have to ask the
question what you intend to do with it?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

That's a good question. As a company, I keep saying that we're transforming the company from a
semiconductor to more a solution providers. And so we can utilize the cash much better than we can in the
past. And the strategy is still -- again, we will buy in a tuck-in technology companies, which is comparable
to MPS revenues, MPS as a general market coverage. So on the other hand, we are also consistently
raising dividend. And that's our strategy, but we are not excluding buyback shares.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Hope you can hear me, but let me echo my congratulations on the strong revenue and a very nice gross
and operating margins. Bernie, I guess you teased us there at the end of your script, saying that you've
got the capacity now to support an acceleration in revenue growth. If I look at revenue last year, you did
about 35% growth. Looks like this year, you might do better than that. I'm just trying to interpret when
you talk about an acceleration in revenue growth, what should we read into that?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. I think that you're familiar with our model, which is to outperform the industry by 10 to 15
percentage points. And obviously, that's a model. That's a guideline. And there are certain periods where
we have the right factors, both strategically as well as from a market perspective that have allowed us
to do better and sometimes, not as well as that model. So for example, if you look at last year's results,
you could argue that at 34.5% growth that we exceeded the market, which was right about 5% to 8%,
depending on what you're looking at, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 15, 17 percentage points.

And so we look at that as well above our model. In the current year, obviously, we only guide Q3, but it's
not unrealistic to expect that within the range of possibilities that we could match that performance or in
fact do just a little bit better. So what we're trying to observe here is that in this 2-, 3-year period, we're
actually benefiting from a lot of factors that have us exceeding what our normal model is.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. Bernie, I also wanted to ask on the compute and storage business up 30% sequentially. I think
you mentioned that it was share gains in both servers as well as notebooks. On the notebook side, I
thought you already had pretty high share at the high end of the notebook market. So I'm wondering if
you could comment, are you starting to see share gains in maybe more mainstream or even low end or
chromebooks on the notebook side? And is there any notable areas of share gains on servers?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we do have some share gain in -- across the board in the notebook market segment. As our
technologies advance and which lower the cost, our size became much smaller. So the cost -- the lower
cost allow MPS enters more notebook segment.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

And then as far as server, we've been fairly consistent in articulating our strategy as far as being able to
grow our market position with each succeeding next generation, particularly Intel and AMD products. Not
limited to that, though, but also on 48 volt and GPUs. So it really expresses the point that we're branching
up in share gains within the Intel family, but also branching out into these other opportunities.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great, and congrats again.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer.

Richard Ewing Schafer
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I'll add my congratulations. It's just kind of keep amazing everybody. And I think I'll ask one more
capacity question if that's okay, and it's coming from a spending kind of standpoint. Can you, Bernie,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

maybe remind us what the outlook for kind of spending? Just as a general rule as a percent of revenue,
maybe starting next year once all the new capacity is installed.

And I mean, I think you get so many questions because everybody sees the kind of growth you guys are
putting up. And it's awesome that you have $2 billion in capacity on board by this time next year. But at
this rate, it's only -- in a couple of years, right, where you're going to be bumping your head on. So I'm
curious because how soon would you have to look to begin ramping incremental capacity again, and what
might the impact be on spending? I'm curious, what like -- just hypothetically, in 2 years, 3 years' time, if
you're at $2 billion top line, like what would gross margins look like, for instance?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Rick, thank you, and good question. Something that's really important to comment on here is that a lot of
companies and a lot of analysts and a lot of investors who focused on capacity as if this is a new aspect of
the semiconductor business. In fact, capacity is something that we have been managing for the 10 years
that I've been here and before that. It's an integral component to our growth strategy.

And so the way that we've been doing it is sequentially adding new fabs and also assembly houses and
testing capacity alongside of that to accommodate to be in front of what our expected revenue growth.
So while we have made a public comment on the fabs that we've invested in to date, we're still continuing
on with ongoing relationships in order to secure more fab capacity for the future in order to accommodate
that growth beyond $2 billion.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. As I said earlier, we keep expanding, we will never stop. But sometimes faster, other ones slow --
other times slower, okay? Other than the capacities, physical capacity itself, we have to increase a lot of
headcounts. And MPS is very, very lean. And so we will hire now. We are hiring a lot of people.

Richard Ewing Schafer
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Sorry, I was having some trouble on my end. A quick question on auto, if I could. I mean, by my math,
it's on track to maybe grow sort of in the 80% or better range this year for you guys. I mean I'm curious
how much of that is being either directly or indirectly limited by supply. And if you could give a sense of
what growth could be or talk about maybe demand that's pushed, and how that ultimately would show up
in the model, say, next year? I don't know if you could maybe quantify or talk about your auto backlog and
maybe where it is today.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I -- maybe Bernie can. This year, you said that -- you mentioned that whether the automotive product
is limited by the capacities. And the answer is, it's not as much as other segment because automotive
company, they give us a long lead times. And so we prepared last year. The last year didn't -- our
customers didn't consume that many of our products and so all translated to this year. And so we'll be able
to ship them now.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

One of the aspects of automotive that's getting a lot of attention in the press has to deal with the fact of
electronic component shortages that are shutting down plants or limiting their ability in order to kit a car
and put it to assemble it. And as Michael just said, we're actually not capacity constrained there. We are
meeting all demand from them. And what's been interesting is one of the reasons that automotive got
into this bind is because they were working with a just-in-time inventory model. And I think that they've
learned from that, that when the parts, the electronic components are available that they will stock them,
even though they don't have a complete kit to build the car.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Now in our conversations and feedback that we're getting is, they're not actually only trying to satisfy
real demand, but that is the timing of when the build plan when they'll have the complete kit that they
can then build the cars. So it's something that we want to monitor because there's been no change in
the ordering pattern or our shipment schedule versus expectations because of the other limitations in
automotive.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I might as well add, okay? About 1.5 year ago, our inventory were at all-time high. And that was one of
the reasons that why we do that because we are a newcomer in automotive industries. Even though with
this type of current revenue, we're still in a very, very little on the market percentage of the market. And
so it's clear, as a newcomer, you don't want to upset the customers and you don't have a product. So as
all these -- like what we do to all these key customers, we have inventory, even though don't have a clear
forecast. And so now it's really benefited us, and we gain a lot more design win activities and -- because
our competitors cannot ship a product.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.

Our next question is from William Stein of Truist.

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I hope you can hear me. With regard to -- first, sort of a maintenance question, with regard to your
capacity and inventory, which you've already explained quite a bit about on this call, are you supply-
constrained at this time? Are you able to meet all the demand, whether it's upside or maybe customers
stretching and trying to build a bit of inventory? Or are you, in fact, capacity constrained and are lead
times extended as you're communicating them to customers? And then I have a bigger -- a more sort of
strategic question after that.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Let me explain it that way again. We have less capacity constrained compared like half a year ago
also. And however, as the customers -- when you -- after you qualify all these new fabs. And we have a
month or a couple of months delay of qualifying these products. And to qualify in a fab, it's not exactly
science, okay? I mean you use different supply, different equipment and different materials and all the
problem -- all these issue comes to have an effect on how you qualify products in the end.

So -- and at this time, okay, we just have to release a lot of new product -- a lot of existing product from
different fabs. And so it's kind of a -- to answer your question, yes, it is that kind of a constraint. We have
a lot more orders, and we couldn't fulfill and that gave me -- but just only a couple of months of late.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

And again, what we're trying to do here is make sure that we're servicing real demand and not building
up inventory either in the channel or on our customer shelves. So what we've done is, we've actually have
very transparent relationships with our customers so that we make sure that we're in touch with their
business, sufficient to be able to make those trade-offs.

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then the follow-up, if I can, or the more strategic question. Michael, you referred to this
transition from a semi company to a technology solutions company, and it's something I've written about,

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

specifically the transition from semi devices to modules. Any quantification around this? And perhaps, it
relates to the e-commerce strategy as well, any update in that area would be very helpful.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, thanks for asking for that question. Now is overwhelming by the revenue growth and the company
-- not only from analysts, from our side. The company -- inside company is overwhelming by the
revenue growth, the allocations and the product allocations and a lot of strategic things, like always less
pronounced than now. But the module, you're absolutely right. Module business is for a solutions -- as a
solution, transforming to a module company as we're transforming or transitioning from semiconductor
to a solution company. And the e-commerce will have teams, and we -- finally, we have organized like a
product line. And I know the activities. And in the last quarter or so, it's quadrupled. And so the revenue
is still small, but it's in the millions of dollars, okay? I mean it's more than $1 million, somewhere $30
million, $40 million.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

With the modules.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, with the module in the service, and it's growing. As you recall, in about 5 years ago -- 3 years ago,
it's almost 0, yes. And -- 4 years ago, almost 0, and okay we started that. And so we will continue to focus
on that. And so I truly believe that that's all the future.

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Congrats.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen.

Joshua Louis Buchalter
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the results. Gross margins in both the print and the guide were meaningfully higher than
your usual 10 to 20 basis point trajectory. Can you elaborate on the key drivers of the leverage there? And
I guess, speak to the sustainability, was it driven by mix or something on the cost side, getting wafers
through your recently ran fabs?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Sure. I think that we've discussed in the past that, again, it's -- our model is that we want to be able to
grow gross margin at 10 to 20 basis points sequentially over the long haul. And we've demonstrated very
good consistency in being able to do that. But much like I was describing before, this is an unusual period
of growth for the company, both in terms of how fast the revenue is growing. And then, obviously, as we
described in the narrative, it was that the overhead is not which would be like direct spending or inventory
provisions or anything like that. It's not growing at the same rate as the revenue growth. And that's where
we're getting the near-term leverage.

As we look out, obviously, we don't want to create an expectation that we're going to be able to grow
at the same rate, but by the same token, we have established another floor level for what we expect
sustainable gross margin to be.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Joshua Louis Buchalter
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then also on the model, I guess, you mentioned that consumer in consoles was a bit
accelerated versus your normal seasonality. Can you remind us what you would expect the shape of the
console business to look like in the second half? And maybe just give us some clues on revenue growth by
segment.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Sure. Go ahead.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I don't know if we call it normal. I don't -- I can't think of it normal anymore, okay. Regarding to our
console business, yes, we win a lot of design, and we're the next design. I mean I think the business
continues. I think you have a better judgment than us what's the seasonality now for the console.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

I think that Michael makes a very strong point there is that we've had so many puts and takes in different
lines of businesses that have been added that the rule of thumb is not as applicable as it might have been
back in 2018 or 2019. What I would comment on is that we believe that we are optimizing across all of
our different end markets. And again, it's really the strength of the model is in the diversification. And
whereas a lot of the traditional seasonality would have been tied to consumer, for example. Now we have
a much higher percentage our business that is tied to computing, automotive and industrial, and they
don't necessarily recognize the same level of seasonality.

But then to sort of complete the question, I think if you look at the near-term growth, obviously, the
current year has benefited significantly from automotive and compute storage, in particular. And we
believe that going forward, automotive along with communications should be our longer-term drivers.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I just have a few follow-up questions. First of all, I have a question on your ASPs, which is obviously tied
to your revenue growth. So now that you are sort of growing in the 50% range, how much of that is units
versus ASPs?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. I would say, if you look at last year, and last year is representative of what we're doing in 2021, is of
the 34.5% growth. 25%, that was tied to volume, 10% was tied to price. And I think when Michael talks
about the solutions business, you're looking at previously selling an individual piece of silicon for $0.20 to
$0.25. And now depending on the module, we can get between $1 to $3. And what we're looking to be
able to do is design complete, integrated solutions for different end applications where those will be able
to achieve for the total cost for that solution can be somewhere between $60 to $100. So there is the ASP
on the individual component, but it's more importantly, it's having that attach rate with the total solution.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Very good. And talking about systems, how is your motor business doing? I know that's probably the
highest a few products you have. So how is that business going?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

It's doing well, but the rest of the companies grow much faster. So it's still small. And you can't break
out a percentage yet, but I think there was -- we will more -- have given more category of our product
growth, okay, as we divide it into a more finer product line. Yes, we will give that number later, okay?

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Sounds good, Michael. And last one, about a year ago, you talked about getting into the medical end
market. Any updates there? I mean, I know it's still probably very, very small as a percentage of revenue,
but just trying to understand how fast your traction is in the medical end market.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we have our product now. And that's -- well, we have several things. We have ultrasound, and the
ultrasound, we do generate revenue. We see revenue now. The other one is X-ray machines, okay? X-
rays and we have -- we're evaluating the first silicon in -- from our design side is a forest, but we have
some issue with that. And -- but that's a very minor issue. I mean we'll be able to solve that problem and
it is outstanding. Thank you for bringing it up. And the performance is like a 5, 6x better than existing
solutions. So the image is a lot more cleaner now, and we could deliver. And so I think the customers are
waiting, and we're very excited.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

One other comment to add here is, the technology that we're referring to here is related to our high
performance or precision analog.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Data converters.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Converters, yes, right? And this has been something that we've been working on for, I think, about 2.5, 3
years now.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

2.5 years.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

2.5 years. And I think what is really exciting is that this is an incredible opportunity, and we're very close
to being able to declare that it's commercially viable in the market. So it's not just the medical, which is
the first end market that we're going after with this technology, but the other opportunities this opens up
for us.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. But same technologies -- similar technology that we'll be able to use in the telecommunications side.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Sounds good. Congrats again on the results.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt.

Kevin Garrigan
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one for me. I was wondering if you could tell us what percentage of
your business or percentage of backlog is based on 3-year newer products. I think last quarter, Bernie,
you had said new products introduced in the last 3 years were about 37% of sales. So just kind of
wondering if this was in the same range this quarter.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. The reason that we use that step on sort of a onetime basis was to really give an order of magnitude
to just how dynamic this new product introduction is as a component to our growth. So right now,
obviously, in such a short one quarter term, it hasn't changed a whole lot up or down. But it's really not
anything that we want to be reporting on, on an ongoing basis.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think at the last time we reported, is that 37%?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I actually went back and look at it, and we actually cannibalize ourselves. And I think that's a better way
rather than the big guys eats us alive. And nothing so we cannibalize quite a bit. I think it's somewhere as
the 10% range, okay? These new products, we cannibalize it. And that's why the number is so high.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

But I would say that when there's cannibalization involved, you can bet that from market share gains
against our peer companies, that's really the leverageable part of this story.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to follow up on Joshua's question on gross margins. I know in the near term, better overhead
absorption is driving the better margins. But if you guys have access to capacity and most of your
competitors get strained, I'm wondering, is there any room for you to get a little bit more to raise pricing
in certain segments to take advantage of that capacity support? Or will you just continue to kind of put

your foot on the pedal and try to drive as much revenue through that additional capacity to support rather
than trying to do it through pricing.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, yes, MPS is still smaller -- as a smallest analog semiconductor business. And we -- okay, at the
same time, we want to have delivered a consistent result. And so now you see the margin even in this
period, we don't fluctuate a lot. And because we don't -- we just pass on our cost to our customers. And
we don't randomly just raise because we can -- now the shortage, we can gauge a price, okay? And then
that will affect the long-term relationship with our customers. And so we just maintain that and maintain
the margins, okay? I think this strategy is for saving things for us.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

[Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over
to Bernie.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar and look forward to talking with you again during
our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you, and have a nice day.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Have a nice day.
