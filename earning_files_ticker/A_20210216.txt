Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator
Instructions] And now I'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice
President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Jason, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's first quarter conference call for fiscal year 2021.
With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice
President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's
Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics
Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of Agilent Crosslab Group.

This presentation is being webcast live. The news release, investor presentation and information to
supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are made available on our
website at investor.agilent.com.

Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most
directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all
references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue
growth are on a core basis.

Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed
within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of January 31.

We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are valid as of today. The company assumes no
obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of
our risks and other factors.

And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Ankur, and thank you to everyone for joining us today on our call. I'm very pleased to be on the
call with you today.

We are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. The Agilent team delivered outstanding results in the
first quarter. The momentum in our business continues. Revenues for the quarter are $1.55 billion. This
is up 14% on a reported basis and 11% core, exceeding our mid-January revised expectations. Also, as
expected, COVID-19 tailwinds added roughly 2.5 points of our overall growth.

Operating margins are healthy, 25.5%. EPS of $1.06 is up 31% year-over-year. Overall, a very impressive
start to 2021.

Our growth is broad-based. All 3 of our business groups delivered double-digit growth. All regions grew,
with the 2 largest leading the way. China grew 25%, and the Americas posted 13% growth. We continue
to see strength in most of our end markets, led by pharma growing 20%. These results are a testament
to our build and buy growth strategy and the Agilent team's relentless customer focus. Demand remains
strong for the full breadth of our offerings. We have been gaining market share in key areas. We are
clearly keeping our foot on the gas.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Now let's take a look at our performance by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group
generated $722 million in revenue, up 13% on a reported basis and up 11% core. LSAG's growth is broad-
based across end markets and geographies.

We are particularly pleased with our cell analysis business. Cell analysis grew in the high teens, led by
biotech, which grew 26%. Growth is also strong at liquid chromatography and mass spec product lines,
with both growing in the teens. Overall, our LSAG business saw very strong demand as many customers
utilized their end-of-year CapEx budgets and our market share gains continued. From an end market
perspective, food and pharma led the way for LSAG.

Continuing our biopharma investment focus, we introduced new updates to our LCMS software. This
new software enables data integrity, consists with important regulatory requirements for our biopharma
customers. As we continue to build our digital lab, we introduced the Agilent 7850 ICPMS system, which
provides new smart digital tools to improve workflows. LSAG's broad and continually strengthening
portfolio is well positioned and continues to outperform the industry. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted
revenues of $532 million. This is up a reported 13% and up 10% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based
across end markets and geographies. Growth is strong in both services and consumables.

Our digital investments and scale are adding significant value. We continue to drive improved attach rates
to Agilent's large installed base of instruments. Annual service contract renewal rates and growth were
strong in the quarter as we continue to build a more resilient and higher growth business.

The Diagnostic and Genomics Group, revenues are $294 million, up 18% reported and up 15% core.
Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo business. Our genomics product portfolio grew double digit,
aided by COVID-19-related QPCR demand. We also achieved strong growth in our core NGS sample prep
business.

As mentioned earlier, overall company growth is broad-based across most of our end markets. The
pharmaceutical and food businesses led the way, both growing strong double digits. We also posted 10%
growth in the environmental and forensics market.

Chemical and energy grew 2%, and we've seen increased business activity in the C&E space. The [ acute ]
end market is down 1%, with many university labs still operating in a constrained environment.

We are also continuing our efforts in the battle against COVID-19. We have completed our development
and clinical validation for a serology assay to detect COVID-19 antibodies. We plan to submit to the U.S.
FDA for Emergency Use Authorization within the next month.

In addition, we're making progress on our QPCR-based test for COVID-19 detection and plan to launch in
Europe in the next couple of months and submit for merger use authorization in the U.S. within the same
time frame.

I'm also pleased to share that Barron's again recently named Agilent one of America's most sustainable
companies. This marks the third year in a row we have been included among the top 3 companies in this
ranking.

We've also been a leader in our industry all 4 years that Barron's list has been published. We're very proud
of this honor. Sustainability is a key priority for our company.

When I look back on the uncertainty we faced this time last year, I'm so proud of what the Agilent team
accomplished: all-time high customer satisfaction ratings, building momentum in all our businesses and
delivering excellent results.

Our first quarter results are another compelling proof point that we are building an even stronger company
and market position during the pandemic. As we discussed at our December investor event, our diverse
industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy with a
focus on high-growth markets continue to deliver.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Our M&A fund is robust and remains focused on growth-accretive M&A opportunities. We are targeting
companies in markets where we see potential for significant long-term growth, and Agilent is in a strong
position to win.

As we look ahead, we have a sense of realistic optimism. We have solid momentum. We're winning in the
market, and we can have the right team to continue to succeed.

As a result, we are raising our core growth guidance range to 6.5% to 8% for the year. As you may recall,
we recently guided to a long-term core growth rate of between 5% and 7%, so we are certainly off to a
good start in 2021, and we have no intention of slowing down.

We have also raised our earnings guidance for the year. In December, I shared Agilent's long-range plan
and margin expansion at 50 to 100 basis points a year. We are now guiding towards the top end of that
range for 2021. Bob will share more details on this in his remarks.

I couldn't be more pleased with how we have started the year. We have momentum. Our team is strong
and energized. We are gaining market share in key areas, and we have an even more promising outlook
for the full year.

Thanks for being on the call today, and look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob.
Bob?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details
on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial
metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter.

Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.

We are very pleased with our first quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth exceeding our
revised expectations. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.55 billion, reflecting reported growth of 14.1%.
Core revenue growth was 11.3% while currency contributed 2.8 points of growth.

Now before I get into the end markets, Mike's earlier comments bear repeating. All 3 business groups
delivered double-digit growth -- core growth in the quarter. Our superior value proposition continues to
resonate with our customers and our team executed well, capitalizing on recovering demand in our end
markets.

Pharma, our largest market, was strong across all regions, delivering 20% growth. Growth was led by
NASD, which experienced significant growth in the quarter albeit against the easiest comp of the year.
NASD contributed 4 points to the overall pharma growth rate. We continue to be very pleased about the
ramp of the Frederick oligo facility, and the recently announced capacity expansion in Frederick is on track.
Small molecule grew mid-teens while biopharma, excluding NASD, delivered 20% growth driven in part by
strong demand for LC and mass spec instrumentation.

We saw strong year-end demand from pharma customers. They're also seeing increased business related
to the characterization of oligo-based therapies and vaccines. The food market also experienced strong
double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 22% increase in revenue. Our business grew in all
geographies, driven by increased demand for food safety and quality testing.

China is leading the way, driven by investments in both commercial and government entities.

Environmental and forensics grew double digits, coming in at 10% core growth. Broad regional growth
reflected strong tech refresh or replacement demand from contract labs.

Our diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 9% during the quarter and has benefited from growth in
COVID-related applications primarily in the Americas and Europe. Our pathology business grew slightly
as non-COVID testing continues to improve but has not yet recovered to pre pandemic levels globally.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

While our diagnostics and clinical end market in China is still small, it experienced strong growth due to
improvements in non-COVID testing and the uptake of our clinical LCMS.

The chemical and energy end market continued the recovery we saw last quarter and grew 2% in Q1. We
continue to see signs of increased business activity, particularly in specialty chemicals and engineered
materials along with encouraging improvements in the macro environment. And while we are optimistic,
we are not yet reflecting a change in our forecast for the rest of the year.

And as expected, the academia and government market recovery has lagged the other end markets, down
1% year-on-year as research labs are still not operating at full capacity. We continue to expect a slow but
steady recovery throughout 2021.

On a geographic basis, all regions grew. China grew 25%, leading all geographies, led by the food and
pharma markets. The Americas delivered a strong double-digit performance during the quarter with 13%
growth while Europe was up 6%, both also led by pharma and food.

Now turning to the rest of the P&L. The first quarter gross margin was 55.8%, up 10 basis points year-on-
year. Adjusting for the exchange rates, gross margins improved 50 basis points.

Our operating margin for the first quarter came in at 25.5%. This is up an impressive 260 basis points
from last year, driven by volume and spending discipline. And this result includes the impact of increased
strategic investments we started last quarter. Our top line growth, coupled with our operating leverage,
helped deliver EPS of $1.06 per share, up 31% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and our share
count was 309 million shares, as expected.

Now onto the cash flow and the balance sheet. Our operating cash flow continues to be very strong. In
Q1, we had operating cash flow of $238 million, a 43% increase over last year after adjusting for last
year's 1 year -- onetime tax payment. This performance shows the strength of our business model and
provides financial flexibility going forward. We continued the balanced capital deployment strategy we
highlighted at our annual investor event in December. In the quarter, we invested $41 million in capital
expenditures, paid out $59 million in dividends and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $344 million.
And as we announced earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase
program replacing the current program.

We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt.

Now moving on to the outlook. We have had a strong start to the year. And while there are still
uncertainties in front of us and the business environment remains fluid, we have solid momentum, and we
see continued recovery in our end markets, albeit at different rates. And as a result, we're increasing our
full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.

For revenue, we are increasing our full year to a range of $5.825 billion to $5.9 billion, up over $200
million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 9% to 11% and core growth of 6.5% to 8%.
This increase reflects strong Q1 results and some improvement in our outlook for the remainder of the
year. The increased guide assumes stronger performance in most of our end markets. The academia
market continues to track as expected in our initial plans. And while business activity in the chemical and
energy has picked up, we have not yet included any improvement in that market in this updated outlook.
In addition, we have not included any revenue associated with either the serology or QPCR COVID assay in
the outlook.

As Mike mentioned, we also feel very good about expanding our margins. During the investor event in
December, we provided long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 to 100 basis
points. Given the volatility in results during 2020, our margin expansion profile will vary each quarter.
However, we feel confident about our full year margin expansion being towards the top end of that range
while also investing for future growth. The higher sales and margin expansion coupled with maintaining
our tax rate at 14.75% and a lower share count of roughly 307 million shares, increases our fiscal 2021
non-GAAP EPS to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This is growth of 16% to 19% for the year.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Now for the second fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion,
representing reported growth of 11% to 12% and core growth of 7% to 9%. We expect second quarter
2021 non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 per share, with growth of 10% to 13% as
we approach the 1-year anniversary of the significant reduction in expenses in Q2 of last year.

Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say I couldn't be more proud of the Agilent team in
driving such strong performance. We have gotten off to a great start this year, and I'm personally very
excited to know what this company is capable of moving forward. We have very strong momentum, the
right approach that leads me to believe that we're on a very solid path for Q2 and the rest of 2021.

With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A.

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Bob. Jason, if you can provide the instructions for Q&A, please.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats here on the preannouncement. On that note, Mike, actually, I'm wondering if you can talk a
little bit about what drove the delta to the preannouncement. And then importantly, on sustainability, it
sounds like you're not really calling out any kind of pull forward here. Curious, as we think about it, and
particularly that biopharma strength and the mid-teens growth you [indiscernible] on LCMS, how are you
thinking about the sustainability there?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Well, first of all, Tycho, thanks for the recognition. Really proud of the performance to even top our earlier
revised expectations for the quarter. And I'd say that as we got into January, business in January was
stronger than we had anticipated. And I think it was on a geographic perspective. You saw the strength
in China. Obviously, that was higher than we had -- we're thinking as long as very strength -- very good
strength in the Americas, led by pharma in the food market. I'm sure we'll dial in today on the call about
the food market, which is both growth in China as well as in Americas. And then no pull forward.

So it was a clean quarter with January being stronger than we had anticipated when we already had
announced an increase in our revenue outlook for the quarter. Bob, I don't know if I missed anything on
the...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

No. You got it.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So thanks...

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And on the LCMS strength, up mid-teens, certainly better numbers than we're seeing from a lot of your
peers. Can you just talk to that?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I think that it's a continuation of a story that's been underway for several quarters. We've continued
to innovate and provide value to the customers really see in our offerings, coupled with our approach
to our field engagement and really maintaining our field force when our customer needs us most. We're
getting the business. And it's very clear that not only is it a -- was there -- we saw, particularly in some of
the pharma and non-COVID areas where they were basically making sure that they spent the capital had
allocated for 2020, we got all that business, but it's more than that. It was a market share gain story as
well for us. So I think it was a combination of a backdrop of investment by the pharma world but also our
ability to gain share.

And Bob, I know you've taken a close look at this and...

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I think, Tycho, to Mike's point, I think one of the things we feel really good about is just our portfolio
and our offerings to our customers. And I think one of the things that we've seen is our responsiveness
continues to improve, and that's been evidenced by the increased customer satisfaction that we've seen.

And as Mike said, as the year-end CapEx spending happened, we were there, and I think we took more
than our fair share. And we do think that this is an area that we continue to invest behind. Mike talked
about the investment in the mass hunter software, which I think is going to really help continue this
momentum that we have going forward from a compliance standpoint. And it's an area of focus, and we're
very excited about the biopharma business going forward.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And there's a real holistic story here as well. You know the story already, Tycho, with our ACG
business, complementing on the service of the consumer most complementing what we can do on leading
innovative instrument solutions.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And before I hop off, just one on ACG. You grew mid-20s in China off a low-teens comp. So it's not like the
bar was low. Are you doing anything there structurally to kind of drive that acceleration?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

What -- I'm going to let Padraig talk a little bit about that. Padraig, why don't you share your thoughts on
that?

Padraig McDonnell
Senior Vice President

Yes. Thanks, Mike. I think it's a combination of our scale on our service business in China and our
connection with customers. And also, we've been investing in a number of years in our digital capabilities
in China, which is really seeing a lot of pull-through from the customers in all markets are really driving
the business forward, and we see it sustaining over the next period.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Tycho, just to build on what Padraig is saying, I mean, this is an area where we've also increased our
investments in people on the street.

And as we think about, Mike mentioned this in his script, actually our focus on actually turning ongoing
revenue into service contracts, this is an area where we've had a specific focus in China there, and it's
really helped us. And so we're -- that productivity aspect continues to play out in China.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe, Mike, could you elaborate on your comment as far as beginning to see some improved activity
in the CME market? And maybe, Bob, could you give us some color on instruments versus aftermarket
growth in the first quarter?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Yes, we're really talking about order activity, right? So we're seeing a lot of discussion with our field
teams, particularly in the area what I would call high-value chemicals, specialty chemicals. So there's a
lot more discussion going on with our field teams right now. And I think our customers are feeling more
confident about the economic outlook and the end market demand that they can anticipate in the coming
quarters.

And as you know, this is against a backdrop of a lot of pent-up demand where investments have been
deferred. And we're seeing -- continue to see strong PMIs.

But as you heard me share the story for, Brandon, I'm always reluctant to call the turn until we actually
see a couple of quarters. So while we're optimistic about what we're seeing so far, we're not ready to yet
to put it into the formal guide for the year.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And just on the second part of your question, Brandon, our instrumentation was roughly flat, and ACG
was up mid-single digits.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Then one follow-up for you, Bob. Gross margins in the first quarter were a little better than we expected.
Are you still thinking that the full year is still relatively flat to down? And any chance you could quantify
the impact of the NASD capacity built on gross margin in the first quarter?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It was a little lower than -- we would expect that to be higher in the back half of the year as we
continue to ramp up. So it didn't really have a material impact on the first quarter.

If you recall, we talked about that being roughly about 20 basis points for the full year, and that really
didn't have an impact in the first quarter.

And in terms of the overall year, I would say we're slightly more optimistic kind of given where, certainly,
the first quarter came in. And that's part of the increasing our top end, I would say, the margin expansion.
It's a combination of a little more in gross margin, but most of it actually will be in the operating
expenses.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a really solid start to the year. I guess for my first one, Mike. The guidance here, I guess Q2,
your comps are pretty easy. You just hit 11 in Q1. Could you perhaps comment on the Q2 and why that
should step down?

And when you look at the annual from an end market perspective, if C&E didn't change, I guess, is this
biopharma that's changing for the annual outlook?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, let me take a shot at it, and then I'll turn it over to Mike, Vijay. Thanks for the acknowledgment. Yes,
I'll take the second question first and then go back to the first -- second quarter.

If we think about where the full year is, it's mainly in that pharma and food markets across all of the
regions that we see the uptake. And we are optimistic about chemical and energy, but we're not yet

11

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

putting it into the forecast. It's still at the end of the quarter. As Mike said, we're seeing a lot of business
activity. We're seeing the order funnel build and so forth, but we want to actually see those translate into
orders and then ultimately into revenue. So everything there is moving in the right direction, and we
would expect that to continue to play out throughout the course of the year.

If I look at Q2, we did have a higher-than-expected budget, year-end budget dynamic that helped,
obviously, the 11%. That doesn't repeat itself in Q2. And -- but if you looked at -- we feel very confident
about the continued momentum of the business going forward.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And that was probably a couple of points of growth maybe.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's hard to estimate, but that's the best guess that we have, yes.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. And then I guess, just for my follow-up. Is the guidance assuming those [ co ] retailment
that you mentioned 200 basis points in Q1, is that going to sustain? And I'm curious, what is driving the
margin strength here, I guess, relative to your prior guide?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So I'll take the first one. Yes. So we're still in that 2 percentage kind of revenue range for COVID. So
that's a good number to lock into.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I think the growth on the margin expansion has been just really the strength in our volume. And
I think that, that -- when we have that strong growth, you actually see it going to the bottom line.

When you look at last year, our spending profile changed pretty dramatically quarter-on-quarter as we
were reflecting the pandemic and so forth.

If we think about Q1 to Q2 this year, our spending, think about it as roughly flat sequentially.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And Vijay, I'm sure you had a chance to look at Jacob's margins for the first quarter, but LSAG had
very strong margins. And that's -- when you have double-digit growth in LC, the strength in the cell
analysis business, we had indicated when we acquired biotech to be not only high growth, but also a high-
margin company, I think you're seeing it in the numbers.

Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from SVBL.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Mike, congrats on the quarter. Really strong year.

So my first question is on China, which you alluded to a little bit before. Obviously, a strong quarter, but
just walk us through where do we stand today in China food and where the products are resonating?
What's your outlook here? Obviously, this has been a market that has been improving for you after some

disruptions a while ago. And just want to get a sense of where it stands and how should we think about it
going forward?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Puneet, thanks for your kind comments. And I'll make some initial introduction comments here about
China food, and I'll invite Jacob and his conversation as his solutions are a big part of the story here.

So this is a quick reminder to the audience. You may recall that we saw a slowdown for the better part of
over 2 years in the China food market as a result of the reorganization of the China food ministries, and
we always have been pointing to the fact that there had been really deferred investment at the national
level. And now that situation has completely changed, which are there's reinvestment going into new
technologies at the national level. In addition to the testing volumes continue to grow for the contract
testing lab side, picking up that volume.

And Jacob, I think we've got a pretty good position here in the marketplace with our mass spec portfolio.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes, certainly, Mike. So you're right that we are seeing a broad-based interest from our portfolio. But
particularly, what stands out is our triple core, both the LCMS and the GCMS, which is sought after,
especially for pesticide testing where both technologies are used. And what we have developed here is
one workflow, one sample press they can be used for both technologies. So that is very much better
performance versus many others where you have to have 2 different kinds of setups.

So we see a lot of interest in that. And so the triple core is really paving the way right now.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And Jacob invested in a China solution center as well. So we actually, again, based on these leading
technology platforms, able to tailor our solutions for that China food market. So we're really excited about
the change in the business volume there, as you can imagine.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

That's great. And if I could also ask in terms of pharma in China, could you maybe just elaborate your
positioning there? You had really strong growth here in terms of both small molecules and biomolecules as
well. Maybe just if you could characterize that, is that biomarker largely coming from NASD? Is that what's
driving that part of the component? And the small molecules, you had really strong growth, too, so maybe
if you could parse that out.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Specific to China, there's no NASD volume at all. It's 0 in China. So that's purely on the -- on what we
call the LSS side, which is ACG and LSAG business.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I was going to say, Puneet, as we said in the call, our -- if you stripped out NASD, biopharma in
total, so this would be our ACG and LSAG businesses together along with some contribution at DGG, grew
20%. And that was really broad-based across all regions. Actually, it was faster than that in China. But if
you look across, they were all kind of neck and neck in terms of the performance across the regions.

Hey, Bob, I'd just add one thing. Although we don't have direct NASD business in China, as Bob
highlighted in his script, we're seeing a lot of demand for LCMS based solution for oligo-based R&D
research. And the fact that we're in this business ourselves with our own API business and that we have
a state-of-the-art facility in our Frederick, Colorado site really helps us be able to sell solutions to our
customers doing research in this area as well. So I do think there's a linkage of the oligo business into
China, albeit on what we're seen on the research side.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And that small molecule in China was very strong.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Oh, yes, sorry about that. I missed that one. Yes. How can I miss that one?

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So first question. Still trying to think of how to interpret your chemical and energy comments. The comps
get pretty easy for that end market. And it doesn't sound like the 2% you reported in the quarter reflects
what you're currently seeing on the order side. Are you still expecting kind of flattish chemical and energy
performance through the balance of the year? Or could you help me with that?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

I think the headline here is potential upside to our guide. And then, Bob, maybe you can answer the...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Mike mentioned the headline quite well. And as we think about the chemical and energy, we've built
in some slight improvement in Q1 and Q2, but have not made any changes to the back half.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And by the way, Dan, I'm not trying to be coy here or cute. We've just seen this market can easily -- can
turn on the dime. And I've had experience where I've called it too soon. So once we feel confident about
the book of business we have inside Agilent, we will be sure to give you an updated view of the outlook for
the year.

Padraig McDonnell
Senior Vice President

Mike, I think it's worth mentioning again that our competitive positioning is very strong here. And as you
know, we have invested very heavily into our portfolio, both from an instrumentation, but also from an
informatics point of view. So when the market comes back, we will certainly see a lion's share of that.

Yes. That should have been part 2 of my headline. When the business is there, we're going to get it.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And I appreciate that. And Mike, you've seen a lot of budget cycles. Could you maybe put what we
just saw in the quarter in context, you had a strong quarter, and I know share gain is part of that. All your
peers had a really strong quarter. Are we going to look back at this period a couple of years from [ your ]
flush, particularly in pharma. Was this one for the history books? Or was this just a good flush? Like how
would you characterize that?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

I sure hope that it's for the history books because it had a backdrop of a pandemic, and what we saw was
some deferred capital investment that had been -- normally would have maybe been invested in the --
our Q2, Q3 because of COVID-19 concerns. And just the fact that customers weren't working deferred the
capital. But again, I would have to say there's more to the story in our Q1 than just that budget flush. So
-- and -- but...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I was going to say, I would say it certainly was bigger than the last several years. I don't know and
-- but I think as we think about the momentum that we've seen, when you look at where we were in Q4
as well, we started seeing the turnaround. And we saw it continue through Q1, and we're expecting that
to continue into the rest of this year as well. So it's not just a one-quarter phenomenon. Certainly, it was
stronger than we anticipated. But we have higher expectations going forward for growth in pharma.

Y our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen.

Doug Schenkel
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So my first question is on share gains. In your prepared remarks, and actually, I think in -- even in the
press release, you highlighted market share several times in the context of the strong revenue growth
you delivered in the fiscal first quarter. I'm curious if you could opine on where you think you're taking the
most share and how sustainable this is? So that's the first topic.

The second is on M&A. And the balance sheet is clean. You're re-upping on the share buybacks. I'm just
wondering how you're thinking about M&A and more specifically, the parameters that you are using to
evaluate potential acquisitions moving forward.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Doug, thanks a lot for that. Happy to opine on both questions. So yes, we really wanted to make sure the
story came through that we had just a great start to 2021, and it wasn't just about a year-end budget
flush. There's some really good things that have been going for several quarters, and it just continues in
the first quarter. And we very specifically chose the language in key areas.

So we're gaining share in some of our biggest product line areas. I would point to liquid chromatography.
I would point to mass spectrometry, both gas phase, liquid phase and the inorganic side. I'd point to our
services business. And Bob, what else might you add to that? I mean, I think it's pretty much broad-
based.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Yes, and in our oligos businesses.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, oligos because it always comes in 3, the oligos. I mean, we had outstanding growth in Q1.

So we're getting market share gains in the product lines where they really are collectively needle movers
for the entire company.

And then relative to the M&A, yes, we were in the market repurchasing shares this quarter -- this past
quarter, I should say, on anti-dilutive. But our priority remains, as we communicated, our December
Investor and Analyst Day, which is we want to invest in the business, not only in terms of capital
expansion building down NASD, for example, but also growth accretive M&A. And that remains our priority.

You may have picked up in my comments, prepared comments, that the discussions with potential targets,
the deal activity is picking up. And I think -- and we've seen a number of other deals announced in our
space. But I'd say the volume of discussion is much increased over the last quarter or 2.

So nothing to announce, but that remains our area of focus for utilization of our strong balance sheet. And
Bob, anything else?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, the only thing I would say is, Doug, as we think about the markets that we compete in, our
framework really hasn't changed. We're looking at markets that are faster growing than the markets that
we are in or subsegments of those markets. We think the last couple of acquisitions have really borne
that out with ACEA as well as biotech in the cell analysis space, and it's really helped continue that shift to
higher-growth markets, and that's the area that I would think -- and there's really opportunities across all
of our -- both in instrumentation as well as in kind of consumables area or that recurring revenue stream
as well. So that's the way I would think about it.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And Doug, we continue to look for companies that also are not only going to meet that criteria, but
also we think there are strong cultural fit that really would be part -- could really be a key part of the
overall Agilent family, so to speak. And also a business where we think we can make that business even
better.

Nice solid quarter, guys. I just wanted to focus on if you -- when you look at the DGG operating margin

growth on the bottom line. As we mentioned in an earlier call, we haven't had the start-up costs really
start showing up yet there. But I think that -- and then some of the QPCR activities and related have really
helped us drive this. Sam?

Samraat S. Raha
Senior VP and President of Diagnostics & Genomics Group

Yes, Bob, great lead-in. I'll just add. As you said, NASD, that business, we are in a place where we are
getting -- giving more and more our capacity. And that's a good thing as it relates to margin.

On the genomics and pathology side as well, we have high-value products, such as our SureSelect NGS
target enrichment platform, which had a good quarter, and we anticipate that continuing to grow. That's
high margin. We have leadership and NGS quality control. And it's not just instruments there, there's
ongoing consumables that go along standards. So we expect a leadership position for that to grow. And
we haven't talked about it in a little while. But this past quarter, we also announced our seventh indication
for PD-L1 to go along with KEYTRUDA for triple-negative breast cancer, and that's another place where we
have leadership and drives good margin for us.

Matthew Carlisle Sykes
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And just one quick follow-up. Just more of a high level. As you continue to grow your ACG
franchise, could you just talk about how that impacts some of the divisions? And as you expand your
reach, does that really help drive the LSG division and other types of segments that you have, just given
that it just continues your reach within the market and deeper customer penetration?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Matt, you're on the right theme here. So in fact, when I've talked about this most recently inside
Agilent, I talked about this is where our LSAG and ACG business has come together. And there really is a
very symbiotic relationship here, which is both businesses help out one another, right?

So I pointed earlier to some of the strength we saw in the pharmaceutical industry in LC LCMS in Q1, but
also was tied to the enterprise services story, we've been talking about for a number of years, and you
start to get yourself into a different relationship with customers. They truly see you as that valued partner.
And for example, when they've had several years of an enterprise service arrangement with you, and you
show them collectively -- or I should say, actually, objectively, what's been going on the lab with various
different vendors in terms of equipment, it will point to, for our case, a decision to let's move more of
our business to [ engagement ] management side. Also, I think as Bob mentioned, we were there on a
responsiveness standpoint. On our services, digital capabilities, we were able to respond to customers
even in the midst of the pandemic, and they remember that, that we were there for them.

And that translates into instrument business when they're doing their the next round of capital purchase.
So I think there really is a very close symbiotic relationship. And although we run them as we show the
outside world 2 separate business group results, they work very, very closely together, not only inside the
company, but most importantly, with customers.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ryskin from Bank of America.

Michael Leonidovich Ryskin
BofA Securities, Research Division

This is Mike on here. On a follow-up you touched on it earlier, I mean, we've already hit on LC and just
broader pharma markets a little bit. You had a comment of higher growth and pharma expected going
forward. I just want to go a little deeper and try to get a sense for what are the key drivers here because
there's so many moving pieces. You've got the end of your flush, maybe some catch-up in COVID early in

the year. NASD obviously doing very well. Cell analysis is becoming a bigger part of the picture. You've got
the share gains.

So I'm just wondering, as you strip some of those out, are we seeing broader -- higher levels of spend in
pharma? Are we at the start of another LC replacement cycle?

If you taper off some of those individual drivers, are we just seeing a better environment in pharma going
forward for the next couple of years that would give you confidence that that's a little more sustainable? I
have a follow-up to that.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So maybe just kind of parse out a couple of thoughts here, and then, Bob, we'll welcome your
commentary here as well. So some of the things that you mentioned are clearly areas of higher growth
today and expect to be higher growth for years to come. And that was part of our story back at the
December Analyst Day, where we talked about, hey, we think RNA-based therapeutics are an area of very,
very strong growth for years to come. And that's why you're seeing this growth in NASD happening right
now as well as our continued investments to capture more of that future growth. Even oncology is an area
of major investment right now, and that's why we went after the cell analysis business several years ago.
So we expect those segments of the market to be really strong double-digit growers for many years to
come. So I think that's part of the story there, which is to really have focused our investments and our
portfolio towards those segments of the marketplace, which we expect to have even higher growth in the
overall pharma market space. I think in general, we expect the biopharma R&D investments to continue
the move to large molecule.

When I get the question around LC replacements, the replacement cycle is always going on. And -- but
what I do think is going to happen is it's going to be a stable, strong funding environment for pharma.
So we're very optimistic about the long-term outlook for pharma. And I think it's a market I know we're
betting on right now at Agilent.

Michael Leonidovich Ryskin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. That's really helpful. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up on that is, by our math, if you take
the magnitude of the 1QB and then also the stronger FX tailwind for the rest of the year, that accounts
for roughly $175 million of the raise fiscal year guide. And you have these other items coming in. You
mentioned the COVID test. You've got the -- all your comments on the strength in the client market. So
where exactly is the downside risk? I mean, especially given the comps over the next couple of quarters,
what are the areas we should be keeping an eye on that would keep you from doing something closer to
10%-plus quarter the year.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's a great question. And I think one of the things, we still are in the midst of the pandemic, right?
There's still the variance out there. We haven't seen any impact of that to date, but those are some things
that we're watching. And we haven't built any of the COVID testing that you just talked about into the
numbers.

So that would definitely be something that when we get those approved, that would be upside to this. And
that's not all within our control. The development and those timings are within our control. But ultimately,
that's a bet that both on the serology side as well as the QPCR side that we feel confident about, and that
would be on top of these.

And then as we talked about before, the variability potentially in the C&E market is more biased towards
the upside as we think about the forecast going forward.

And so we feel good about where we are. We're early in the year and...

your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan from UBS.

Daniel Gregory Brennan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I guess first question is maybe on China first, just I don't know if I missed it. Did you give what number or
what growth rate you're assuming for the full year? And then within that, could you just discuss a bit more
detail on the components of that, in particular, food, obviously, very strong this quarter. But how much
more catch up potential is there in food, given how weak that business has been?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Let me take -- I'll take the first one, and then we can jump on and we can tag team, Mike, on the
second one.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, absolutely.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

In China, we had forecasted roughly high single digits at the beginning of the year. It certainly started
much stronger than that. So we're expecting it be double digits for the full year, really driven by both
pharma and food. Those would be the 2 -- the upside drivers to our initial guide.

And then I think on food, we've seen -- we saw stabilization really in the first half of 2020, saw an
improvement in Q4. And that improvement continued here into Q1. And we would expect that to continue,
given kind of the overall environment and sensitivity around food testing and so forth. But we're not
quantifying how long or how much is left to catch up, so to speak.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think also with food, I'm not sure I would really would use catch up to describe this because, clearly,
where you had some of the pharma companies just weren't having the research in and didn't work -- had
deferred investment. I think this has been part of the coming together of the new 5-year plan for China,
and that's what's really driving this.

So we would expect to see sustained investments, albeit not at this double-digit level. I think it's hard to
not -- we've always felt this thing was not a market that was shrinking, wouldn't shrink long term, which
it had been for a few years, but it's more like a high single-digit longer term. And I think that's probably
where we'd land on your question, although I think we'll do double-digit for sure this year in '21.

Daniel Gregory Brennan

Great. And then maybe just one follow-up on the NASD. Just what was the dollar contribution this quarter?
What's kind of assumed in the full year? I don't know if you've changed that at all. And I know you've
touched upon this, but in terms of other modalities besides interference, I guess, is that still -- it sounds
like it's something that could possibly come, but we're still going to wait to hear from you guys on that.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. What I would say, Dan, is we're at our full run rate capacity, which is, as we've talked in the past,
$200 million a year. We hit that kind of where we expected to in Q1.

Michael R. McMullen

Yes. We're really happy with how that business is ramping.

Robert W. McMahon

And we're not done yet.

Jacob Thaysen

Hey, Bob, I'd just add to that, that as I mentioned before, RNAi interference is our primary focus, but we
are doing programs on guide RNA for CRISPR, and we are at full tilt with that. But we are always looking
to be in tune with new modalities. And if they're relevant, if they're sufficiently meaningful, we're definitely
apprised of that as well. Great.

Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Mike, maybe one for you. Just on the chemical and energy side, certainly appreciate the conservatism
baked in here. Can you just talk a little bit? I know in the past, you've talked about kind of the shift from
in-sourcing to outsourcing from customers and how that should play nicely into your strengths. Can you
just talk about, I guess, where we are in that process and how big an opportunity that is for you guys?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I think we're still early days on that. I think it's -- that's part of the discussion. I think the
investments that are going to happen this year, if they drop, are going to be more tied to deferred tech
refresh. But I think it's probably more of a 2023 kind of -- excuse me, '22 event from the onshore and
insourcing that we've been talking about. And I think this probably points to us being able to be able to
stay in a mid-single-digit kind of end market. So it's -- I mean, it points to the fact that chemical and
energy with these kind of longer-term outlooks coming from our customers, will not be a drag on the
overall growth rate, any material extended off. So I think it's an adder to the thesis that there is growth
in the C&E market as well, albeit it can be a little bit -- it can move a little bit, depending on what's
happening in the overall economy.

I like what you said, I should have used durability. That was the short way to answer your question.

Citigroup Inc., Research Division

All good. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one on the academic side. Obviously, that's been
lingering a little bit on the soft side, not only for you guys, but for much of the industry. I guess, where do
you think we are there in terms of whatever metrics you guys look at, whether it's customers in the lab or
whatever it may be? Maybe just kind of dive in on that a little bit.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Great question. So when we were talking to our team and our customers, here's our view of it right
now. We think about -- if you think about 30% of the research labs are fully operational now, we think
about 60% are working at reduced capacity. We think about 10% are closed. And we really think it's going
to be -- all this is really tied to ability to get the infection rates down, to get the vacillations out. I think
until that changes significantly, we're expecting kind of more of the same, I'd say, Bob, for the -- until we
actually see a change in the overall...

Robert W. McMahon

I had a follow-up question to Mike Ryskin's question as it relates to guidance, Bob. Maybe trying to ask it
a different way. Have you really changed your organic or core growth assumptions over the remainder of
the year? Because even in the first quarter here, you back out a couple hundred basis points from sort of
end-of-year budget spending. The first quarter still did, basically, twice what you were initially expecting
for growth in the first quarter. And just looking to your guidance and doing some math, it looks like you
really haven't made too much of a change for the organic growth over the remainder of the year. Is that
fair to assume?

Yes. I would say we took Q1. We also upgraded Q2 and made some modest changes to the back half
of the year, but most of that would be in the areas. Once we get further into the year, that would be an
opportunity to revisit the forecast going forward. So I think bottom line, you're in the ballpark.

Stephen Barr Willoughby
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. And then just a follow-up question on diagnostics. I guess 2 things to it. One, do you think we
return to 2019 or normal levels in your non-COVID Diagnostics business this year? And then also, could
you just provide a reminder on where you see your PCR test potentially fitting once it does come to
market?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

You want to take the first one and Sam on the second one?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The short answer is yes, we expect it to get back. But again, latter half of this year. We're starting to
see improvement. If you look at it by region, China is back. Certain pockets in Europe are back and certain
places in the U.S. or back as well. But I think overall, it's probably going to be a few more months at least
before it gets back to pre-COVID levels.

Samraat S. Raha
Senior VP and President of Diagnostics & Genomics Group

Yes. With regards to your second question on QPCR, for COVID-19, our master mixes, our instruments
are already being leveraged as part of other testing systems by customers around the world. When our
own test comes to market, we see the opportunity. There's still a dearth of robust testing solutions that
are available. So we'll have the right performance going after the right fragments or looking at the right
elements of COVID-19. And it's really about our broad ability to distribute, make it available and also
something that could be automatable on multiple platforms. So we think we'll have a play.

Your final question today comes from the line of Paul Knight from KeyBanc.

Paul Richard Knight
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

So obviously, you've got a full array of products in the analytical instrument marketplace. And it goes back
to, I think, Doug's question in terms of M&A an opportunity. Where do you think you are in the full solution
and cell analysis? Is there a lot to build? Is there a lot to buy in that particular market?

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

CEO, President & Director

We think so. In fact -- thanks for the question, Paul. You may recall -- and Jacob, feel free to jump in on
this question as well. We teed up a fairly large -- although we're fully, really proud of the business we've
built so far, we think we have scale at a $300 million-plus business. We're playing in a much larger SAM.
And we think there's both opportunities to further build out but also buy here as well.

Jacob, your thoughts there?

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes, absolutely. We've been very intention about how we build out our portfolio. First, with instrument
platforms that we ensure we can get some footprint and a scale in the market. And the next thing that
would be the logic next step is to look at content, how do we actually get content on our instrument
portfolio. So that's clearly an area we're looking into.

But I actually think with the footprint, there's also opportunity to add other technique modalities into that.
So we are -- we have open eyes. We follow what we call the turn of [ string approach ]. And -- but --
and we wait to put another pearl on that string. And so we are -- keep our eyes open and then see what
happens.

Paul Richard Knight
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And then the last question would be you had mentioned your cost-cutting program that had started in the
second quarter of last year. Where you are -- where are you in that process? And what happens to cost
cutting when travel and entertainment might come back in kind of post-COVID?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We're seeing some of that. And some of that is lapping this quarter because we saw a significant
drop, and so you're not seeing the year-over-year changes.

We're not seeing it go back. And our goal is to not have it go back. So we think we're at a new watermark
here in terms of spending, particularly in travel and some of these other areas. Now we are increasing
investments in places like digital and some of these other places that are driving demand as well as some
of the capacity that we talked about before. But certainly, in those types of things, travel and so forth,
we're not looking for that to go back. It will go back some, but certainly not back to the way we have been
doing business before.

Customers don't want it, and we are not going to let it happen.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Absolutely. To Bob's point, I spoke the other day to our global field team, and we're talking about
embracing our new ways of working. And of course, a lot of people on the road were -- and love to be
back on the road. But not everybody feels that way. And the customers certainly don't feel that way
because we're much more responsive and attentive to their needs by using digital platforms. There is a
place for face-to-face, but it has to be based on a customer need, not because we want to be in the road
to be out there doing things in a very traditional way.

So we're keenly aware of the question you posed, Paul. We're really challenging ourselves to make sure
that we really continue forward with these new ways of working. And this allows us to put money into
areas that really do matter to customers. So I'd rather invest there rather than travel and entertainment.
