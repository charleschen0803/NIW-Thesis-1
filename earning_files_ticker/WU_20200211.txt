ISI, where he was an equity research analyst. You'll be hearing more from Brendan in the near future.
Hikmet?

Hikmet Ersek
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to say that our business delivered
solid results in the fourth quarter driven by continued strong performance in our digital offerings. Fourth
quarter revenue increased 3% on an adjusted constant currency basis, and adjusted EPS was $0.38. For
the full year, our adjusted results were in line with the financial outlook we provided with third quarter
results.

Returning cash to shareholders remained a priority as we returned over $880 million to shareholders
in 2019. I am pleased that today, we also announced a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend, which
reflects the strength of our business and strong profit expectations for 2020 and confidence in our new
global strategy.

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

2019 was a pivotal year for Western Union, as we made significant progress towards our vision of being
the leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement and payments and delivered strong financial
results. So I would like to take a moment to review some of the key strategic accomplishments from 2019.

First, we simplified and created a sharper focus for the business, largely completing our exit from noncore
operations with the sale of Speedpay U.S. domestic bill payment service and the U.S. payment mortgage
service in the second quarter. The $750 million in proceeds funded enhanced cash returns to shareholders.
With the divestitures and smaller domestic money transfers, our business is now primarily focused on
cross-border services for consumers, financial institutions, banks and other businesses. Our focus aligns
with our core competencies in foreign exchange, cross-border settlement, compliance and global retail and
account payout network.

Second accomplishment in 2019 was we continued to expand our digital business. The westernunion.com
service now accounts for 15% for consumer revenues, and cross-border revenue increased 26% in
the fourth quarter. We also began unlocking the value of our leading global physical and digital cross-
border, cross-currency platform, opening into third-party partners. For example, we added 2 significant
customers, among others, STC Pay and Sberbank. Our total digital money transfer revenues increased
24% reported or 25% constant currency in the fourth quarter.

Today, we operate one of the most extensive digital platforms for cross-border, cross-currency money
movement, whether branded, direct offerings like westernunion.com or digital offerings like -- that
enable our partners like TD Bank, Sberbank or STC Pay. Both westernunion.com and white-label offerings
continue to have very strong growth potential.

We have recently integrated digital services with 3 of Europe's largest postal institutions: France's La
Banque Postale, Italy's Postepay and the U.K. Post. We also recently announced a new partnership with
Bharti Airtel, a global telecommunications company with operations across Asia and Africa. We will soon
offer real-time payments into millions of Airtel Payments at bank accounts in India and mobile wallets
across 14 countries in Africa.

We have established nonremittance white-label payment use cases, such as our partnership with Amazon
for global e-commerce payments, further expanding our addressable market to consumer-to-business
payments.

And in business payments, we're seeing Business Solutions continue its growth trend, led by a strong
performance in the education and financial institution verticals, which translated into solid revenue growth
of 4% on a constant currency basis for 2019.

So it was a quite good year. While we made significant progress in 2019, we are not content, and
we'll continue to drive our business forward in 2020. We laid out our strategic vision at our September
Investors Day, and I would like to highlight 3 key strategic objectives we will focus on in 2020: enhancing
our global network, driving our digital growth and optimizing our organization. We will work to enhance
our global payments network, improving the cost coverage and quality and further leverage it with
additional third-party partnership. Today, our vast platform capabilities include both digital and physical
money movement networks with over 550,000 locations across more than 200 countries and territories,
digital send capabilities in over 70 countries and bank account payout capabilities in over 100 markets,
offering across to billions of accounts.

We will continue to grow our network, and we'll also improve the quality by adding new value-added
services like real-time account payout, which we expanded during 2019. We now offer customers the
ability to transfer funds into an account in real-time in over 20 countries with plans to expand it to over
100 countries this year. The value-added payout services should help us gain new customer segments,
such as e-commerce and financial institutions.

We will drive our digital strategy forward to serve consumers whenever, wherever and however they
desire and expand aggressively over the next few years, including large opportunities like the $120 billion
outbound market in the Gulf states or the $25 billion outbound market in China and India. Our goal is to
evolve in the world's ultimate agnostic network for payments and cross-border money movements.

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

We are also transitioning our Western Union branded consumer business from a transaction-based model
to a lifetime value model, optimizing the customer experience and improving retention. To achieve this
goal, we have further developing and applying strong data analytic capabilities to our rich pool of global
data over 200 countries, allowing us to price dynamically, market more precisely and ultimately, enhance
our ability to drive revenue growth.

Our third strategic objective is to strengthen and optimize our organization. Western Union has
tremendous talent, building on the foundation of WU Way Lean capabilities and the transformation office,
we will leverage internal resources more effectively to improve execution, enhance profitability and drive
margin expansion. In addition to that, we will continue to selectively add new team members who can
impact our business. A great example is the recent addition of Shelly Swanback, our new President of
Product and Platform. Shelly comes to us as a senior from Accenture, where she was instrumental in
building the firm's digital services. Shelly reports directly to me and play a critical role in enhancing our
global platform.

Finally, while we will continue to focus on driving shareholder value with strong financial results, we will
also focus on delivering value for all stakeholders to our environmental, social and governance efforts. The
details of these efforts can be found in our 2018 ESG report. We plan to issue our 2019 ESG report later
this spring.

And one more thing. During the past month, we have also achieved a significant milestone in our U.S.
joint settlement agreements. The term of the deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of
Justice expired on January 19. Under the DPA, to close our -- to close out this matter, the DOJ has 90 days
from the expiration to file for dismissal of the charges. We understand that DOJ will make a motion to
dismiss the DPA promptly. We will continue to work to protect our customers and partners by maintaining
strong compliance programs, which we believe give us a competitive advantage.

In closing, we made significant progress in 2019, and we begin 2020 better positioned than ever before
to capitalize on the significant opportunity in the large and growing money transfer and global payments
market. I am confident in our ability to deliver the 2022 margin and EPS targets, and our outlook this year
reflects our expectations for a strong start to achieve our goals.

Raj will discuss our financial outlook and long-term targets in more detail. I remain excited about our long-
term prospects and would like to thank to all our team members for their hard work and commitment. And
a big thank you to our business partners, agents, consumers and shareholders from all over the world for
your trust and loyalty.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Raj.

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Hikmet. I will focus my comments primarily on the fourth quarter. The similar information for
the full year can be found in our press release and the attached financial schedules. Given the impact of
the divestiture on prior period comparison and restructuring costs from our productivity program, there
are a number of puts and takes in our fourth quarter results. Our adjusted results remove most of the
impact of the factors, which will not affect our future results.

Fourth quarter revenue of $1.3 billion declined 7% compared to the prior year period, while adjusted
constant currency revenue, which excludes our divested businesses in the prior year period, increased 3%.

Currency translation, net of the impact of hedges, reduced fourth quarter revenue by approximately
$42 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the depreciation of the Argentine peso. The
decline in peso negatively impacted reported revenue by 2%, while the effect of inflation on our Argentina
businesses is estimated to have positively impacted both reported and constant currency revenue by
approximately 1%.

In the consumer-to-consumer segment, reported revenue was flat or increased 1% constant currency,
while transactions declined 1%, primarily due to some civil unrest, macroeconomic and market-specific

issues in a few countries. Total C2C cross-border principal increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency
basis. Principal per transaction was flat or increased 1% constant currency. The spread between C2C
transaction and revenue growth in the quarter was 1%, with a negative 1% impact from currency.

Pricing was higher in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and was largely offset by mix. The net
impact was positive on revenue in the quarter.

Turning to the regional results. North America revenue grew 1% on a reported and constant currency
basis, while transactions declined 4%. Revenue growth in the region was led by the U.S. to Mexico corridor
and other U.S. outbound businesses, which was partially offset by continued declines in U.S. domestic
money transfer. U.S. DMT trends were similar to last quarter, and we expect declines will continue this
year as we manage the business for cash flow.

Revenue in the Europe and CIS region increased 1% or 2% on a constant currency basis, driven by Spain,
Russia and France. Transactions in the region increased 5%, aided again by the Sberbank white-label
business.

Revenue in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region was flat on both a reported and constant
currency basis. Revenue trends in the region reflected slower growth in Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the
quarter, civil unrest in Lebanon and continued hard currency limitations in certain African markets.

Transactions declined 1% as strong growth in digital transactions was offset by declines in retail. Sends
from the region to India were negatively impacted by cash tax implemented in September that impacted
our agents' ability to make cash payments. It was subsequently removed, but it may take some time to
return to previous transaction levels. We are also making adjustments to marketing, pricing and other
incentives in the region to improve growth.

The Latin America and Caribbean region delivered strong constant currency revenue growth, led by Chile
and Mexico outbound, despite civil unrest in multiple South American countries. Revenue in the region
declined 2% on a reported basis or increased 6% constant currency, while transactions grew 4%.

In the APAC region, revenue declined 10% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Revenue
trends improved compared to last quarter's rate partially due to pricing actions in certain markets.
Transactions were down 7% in the region driven primarily by the Philippine domestic business, which has
limited impact on profits.

Digital money transfer revenues increased 25% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, including
westernunion.com and third-party white-label services. westernunion.com revenue grew 17% or 18%
constant currency. wu.com now represents 15% of total C2C revenue in the quarter. Cross-border,
westernunion.com revenue increased approximately 26%, which was partially offset by declines in
domestic money transfer.

Business Solutions revenue was flat on a reported basis or increased 1% constant currency and
represented 7% of company revenues in the quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was driven by
strong performance in Europe as well as strong growth in the education and financial institution verticals,
which were offset by slower growth in hedging services.

Other revenues, which consists primarily of our retail bill payments businesses in the U.S. and Argentina,
decreased 52% in the quarter, which reflects the impact of the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures in May.
The Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina posted good increases in transactions and local currency
revenue growth. Other revenues represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter.

Turning to margins and profitability, we will focus on consolidated margins as segment margins are not
comparable with the prior year period due to reallocation of corporate costs following the divestiture of the
Speedpay business. We are also providing adjusted metrics to exclude restructuring expenses, merger and
acquisition costs and related tax effects.

The consolidated GAAP operating margin was 17.3% in the quarter compared to 19.3% in the prior year
period. The decline was primarily due to higher marketing investment compared to the prior year period,

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

the impact of restructuring expenses in the current quarter and the divestiture of the Speedpay in May of
2019.

We incurred $17 million of restructuring expense in the fourth quarter and $115 million for the full year,
which was slightly higher than we expected in 2019 due to the timing of some items, but we continue to
expect a total of approximately $150 million of restructuring expense, with the remainder to be incurred
this year.

Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 18.7% compared to 19.9% in the prior year period,
with the decrease primarily due to higher marketing investment and the Speedpay divestiture. Speedpay
contributed about 60 basis points to last year's fourth quarter margin, while foreign exchange hedges
provided a benefit of $7 million in the current quarter and a benefit of $4 million in the prior year period.

The GAAP effective tax rate was 31.4% in the quarter compared to 9.8% in the prior year period, while
the adjusted tax rate of 24.5% compared to 6.8% in the prior year period. The increase in the GAAP and
adjusted tax rates was primarily due to certain discrete benefits in the prior year period. Also, while we
expected the fourth quarter to have the highest tax rate of the year, it was further increased by onetime
settlements in certain geographies. The GAAP rate also included additional taxes associated with the May
2019 divestitures.

GAAP earnings per share in the quarter was $0.32 compared to $0.48 in the prior year period, and
adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.38 compared to $0.51 in the prior year. The year-
over-year decrease in both GAAP and adjusted EPS was primarily due to a higher effective tax rate, the
divestitures and higher marketing investment partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.

Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. GAAP cash flow from operating activities was $915 million
for the full year, which exceeded our outlook, primarily due to favorable working capital items. Adjusted
cash flow from operating activities was $1.1 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures were approximately $34
million in the quarter and $128 million for the full year. At the end of the year, we had cash of $1.5 billion
and debt of $3.2 billion.

During the fourth quarter, we issued $500 million in 2.85% notes. We redeemed $325 million in notes due
this year and reduced commercial paper. We returned $149 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter,
including $84 million in dividends and $65 million of share repurchases, which represented approximately
2.5 million shares.

The outstanding share count at quarter end was 418 million shares, and we had $1 billion remaining under
our share repurchase authorization, which expires December 2021.

As Hikmet noted, we're off to a good start to deliver our -- on our strategic initiatives and restructuring
plans, which is reflected in our strong operating margin and EPS growth outlook for 2020. Our outlook
assumes no material change from current macroeconomic conditions. We expect GAAP revenues for
the full year to be a flat to low single-digit decline primarily due to the divestiture of Speedpay in May
2019. On an adjusted constant currency basis, we expect low single-digit revenue growth this year, which
excludes the Speedpay revenues and any benefit related to Argentina inflation.

Operating margin on a GAAP basis is expected to be approximately 20%, while adjusted operating margin
is expected to be approximately 21% as we continue to focus on generating efficiencies, and we will begin
to benefit from restructuring savings weighted toward the second half.

We continue to expect to realize approximately $50 million of annual savings from restructuring in 2020,
increasing to $100 million in 2021. In addition to this, we expect to realize other efficiency savings of $50
million by 2022 for a total of $150 million of annual savings in 2022.

We expect the GAAP and adjusted effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range this year. GAAP EPS for
the year is expected to be in the range of $1.87 to $1.97, while adjusted earnings per share is expected to
be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05, which represents growth in the teens.

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Cash flow from operating activities is expected to be approximately $900 million, while adjusted cash flow
from operating activities is expected to be approximately $1 billion. We expect to spend approximately
$500 million on share repurchases for the full year.

In summary, we delivered our full year adjusted financial outlook in 2019. We made good progress on
our restructuring activities and our new global strategy designed to drive profitability, efficiency and long-
term growth. We generated strong cash flow and continue to return significant funds to shareholders.
We look forward to delivering on our strategy and our long-term financial targets of operating margin of
approximately 23% in 2022 and a low double-digit earnings per share CAGR for the 3 years ending 2022
off of adjusted 2019 EPS.
Thanks for joining the call today. And operator, we are now ready to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.

Korey A. Marcello
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

This is Korey Marcello, on for Bryan Keane. I wanted to ask, I guess, first, on the guidance. I know the 3-
year outlook is calling for 2% to 3% growth in consumer, but any color just for next year in terms of how
you think Business Solutions and maybe other revenue will shape up? I guess, in particular, you're going
to have some lapping impacts from the divestitures, so I didn't know if you had any comments on sort of
the quarterly cadence of revenue growth for the year.

Hikmet Ersek
President, CEO & Director

Well, I can let Raj jump in, but let me start. Look, in the fundamentals, nothing has changed. We really
assume that our business will perform, especially our digital expansion will perform. The digital expansion
for us, either branded or white labeling, will going to go, and that you saw the recent numbers on our
growth numbers are quite impressive. And that's from a different base than the competitors have, right?
We have been investing here for a long time and growing very strong in digital expansion. That continues
to go.

The other part is that dropping money on real time on accounts, that will going to continue to go. And
offering retail cash payout and dropping money in real time, it's a huge competitive advantage within our
capabilities.

And look, we also started to drop money for businesses, right? I mean we are collecting for Amazon --
from consumer in different countries' businesses. We are doing transactions for third parties. And our
business-to-business has had a good year, growing by 4%.

So generally, I would say that nothing has changed from our Investors Day. We are in a good momentum.
We like our business. We like how we are performing. Especially also, our transformational activities and
our efficiency activities are very promising, and we are still in target with our 2022 goals.

Anyone, do you want to add something?

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

I think you've covered it. I mean, yes, so I think we're good.

Korey A. Marcello
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, great. I guess just as a follow-up, you mentioned, obviously, Amazon and third parties there, I
guess, can you give maybe a broader update on kind of what the pipeline looks like for those third parties?
And in particular, maybe the Amazon partnership, any update there in terms of like plans for the year and
market go-live? And is there anything kind of baked into the guidance from some of this stuff that you've
called out as more longer term, I guess, for next year?

Hikmet Ersek
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I think it's -- as you said, it's a longer term. We started in a very good stronger digital growth.
Definitely, our partnership helps on our strong growth, right? Look, we go to market. We are talking.
And in some countries, we're offering our dot-com business; in some countries, on our digital white

labeling part, depending on our partner, depending on the legal environment, depending on the consumer
relationship. But the good news is that the partners are choosing our capabilities to move cross-border,
cross-currency money. And that capability, having 2 -- countries and capable of operating in 200 countries
is unique.

And so I mean, it's still small but growing very, very strong and has good potential. And we will definitely
update with additional partners. I mean we recently signed 3 big postal offices, like the La Banque Postale,
U.K. Post and the Italy post. Italy post is, for instance, having access to 7 million consumers, Italian
consumers, with their mobile phones, right? And they will go -- they do transaction cross-border by using
our platform. So it's quite impressive, and we drop money in real-time for them, and that's going to
continue. It depends really on the partnership how they choose, if they choose Western Union brand or
being a partner like Amazon, which Amazon uses their own codes. We are for them a service provider to
collect money for their online services.

Operator

Our next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research.

Andrew Thomas Bauch
Wolfe Research, LLC

This is Andrew, on behalf of Darrin. I wanted to drill into North America for a little bit. It looks like the
delta between transactions and revenues has -- was relatively stable over the last couple of quarters and
widened a little bit this quarter. I was wondering, is there any impact of the digital transactions in that
number? Is that largely all domestic? And if you can provide any other additional color on what you saw on
domestic in the quarter and further into the outlook for 2020.

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. North America, I would say that one of the key driver was really declines in our domestic money
transfer transactions in the U.S. We also have a very small Philippine intrabusiness that has a heavy
number of transactions, which was also declining. So that has an impact on overall mix. The U.S. to
Mexico market also was just softer from a market standpoint, although we continue to gain share there.
And then we also put new principal limits in place for U.S. to Cuba.

So some of these things had an impact in the quarter. But overall, I would say, the digital part of the
business, if you look at the cross-border part of wu.com, again, which North America is a contributor
there, obviously, that grew at 26%. So the digital part continues to do well. The domestic part of digital,
certainly, was a little bit worse in the quarter than it was in the previous quarter.

Andrew Thomas Bauch
Wolfe Research, LLC

And then that new metric, the digital revenues that you called out, how should we think about that mix
across all the different regions that you have? I mean I think it's the first time that you've really been able
to separate them like that. So maybe just letting us get a better sense of how we should think about that
across the segment.

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, right now, the digital, which grew 25% in the quarter, includes wu.com and as well as the
digital white-label partners, and we only have a handful of those right now. And the 2 primary ones are
Saudi Telecom in Saudi Arabia and Sberbank in Russia. So those are the 2 primary ones that are driving
a lot of the additional growth. So there's not much to cut in terms of where it is globally. It's in those
2 regions, if you will, in the Middle East as well as in Europe. And so we're -- certainly, we want to sign
more partners and more opportunities. We really look at the total digital as being one type of offering with
branded and nonbranded offerings, and they're both leveraging our platform capabilities, right?

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Hikmet Ersek
President, CEO & Director

They basically use our same platform. You go to market, and it's the partner's decision if they use their
brand. In that case, in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi Telecom, did use. But it's the westernunion.com platform.
And our platform, Western Union platform and our network, we drop money over our network. So it's
really a digital transaction with different brands.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.

Benjamin Elliot Budish
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is actually Ben Budish, on for Ramsey. I wanted to kind of follow up on the white-label wallets you
guys talked about and just kind of looking at the growth in Europe versus the Middle East. I know you
called out some onetime factors impacting the Middle East growth, but is there anything to read through
there, like maybe the growth in transaction, that Sberbank are growing better than those of STC? Or is
that really all related to kind of those onetime factors that you called out?

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would say most of it is related to the onetime factors, and we'll see how long the Lebanon civil
unrest, we called out, there's some in Syria. And then obviously, the India tax is also the other factor,
which the issue was reversed. So that tax came into play late in the third quarter, but then it was reversed
in the fourth quarter. But we did have some customer attrition, and that's what we're working through
right now. So we've assumed that in the first part of this year, we'll see some of that. But we should be
able to work through that as the months come along here. So it's really related to those factors rather
than any shift in mix, if you will.

Benjamin Elliot Budish
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just kind of following up on, again, on the white labels. Would you say that performance
has been kind of in line with expectations? I mean we got like a little hint of it back at the Analyst Day,
and it looked like things were going quite nicely. Is there any change to that? Or does it seem like things
are kind of moving along according to plan?

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I would say things are moving along very much according to plan. They're doing quite well, and we're
very excited about them, and we want to continue to add more and more partners to the mix.

Our next question comes from Vasu Govil of KBW.

Vasundhara Govil
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I guess the first one on the pricing front. It seems like, clearly, that's been a tailwind for a couple of
quarters now. Can you talk about whether you're starting to see an impact from your dynamic pricing
initiative? Or it's just the underlying trends are better? And then if you could also comment on what's
enabling the stability in the pricing environment because it doesn't seem like the competitive environment
is necessarily abated.

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Well, pricing environment, obviously, as we said earlier, partly impacted by mix, partly with the strong
pricing environment. We feel comfortable with our dynamic pricing activities. As you know, we adjust our
pricing corridor by corridor, even ZIP Code by ZIP Code, customer behavior by customer behavior. And
this effort started, and we start in few corridors, and we will expand that globally. And that's something
that we are very excited about, that you can compare like a big airliner, you fly one direction, you have
different customers with different needs with different price payments. That's going to happen, and that's
what we are aiming to, and we started in some corridors, and we see good return on that. And that's just
the beginning of the story, though, and we are quite excited about that.

Vasundhara Govil
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Great. And just a quick follow-up on the transaction growth trends, Raj. I think you mentioned on previous
question that you're assuming that, that will kind of continue to be weak in the first half. Is that true for
just the India piece or all the various onetimers that you saw this quarter? And then just to confirm, does
coronavirus have any impact on your business, positive or negative?

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. In terms of the onetime items that we called out for Q4, obviously, the ones that are under our
control, we're actioning those. There are some things that are more country-specific issues. Civil unrest is
not really under our control. But we've assumed that some of these things will continue for the first part
of this year. We don't expect them to continue for the entire year, but certainly, we'll update you as we see
more.

From a coronavirus standpoint, we have not assumed any material impact for coronavirus. China, for us, is
about 2% of our total revenues, and it's mostly inbound in nature. And that, obviously, the conditions are
evolving every single day, so we need to see how that plays out.

Hikmet Ersek
President, CEO & Director

Yes. On China, I mean, first of all, we support our employees and look after them. And it's very important,
also, agent locations. But most of the agent locations are active. And as you said, it's only 2% of our
business. But at the same time, I want to mention that, also, we can drop money in minutes on an
account in China. So if people don't feel to go to the location and have a physical payout, they could also
do it online. And this is one of the growing parts of our business.

And so we do really -- don't see a big impact from coronavirus yet. Now I can't judge it generally what will
have that do to general global economy, but in specific areas, we don't see a big impact on our business.

Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.

Andrew William Jeffrey
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Conceptually, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the business, Raj, because I think you made a
comment about the domestic business increasingly being a source of free cash and presumably, return of
capital. It would appear that, strictly looking at wu.com, it's 100% of your C2C growth today. Should we
think about that as sort of the future and the balance of the business as really being a cash cow, for lack
of a better term, and fueling investments to support digital and returning capital to shareholders? Is that a
reasonable framework?

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Yes. I think, Andrew, as we laid out at Investor Day, we -- our -- we said that our assumption was for 2%
to 3% overall growth over the next 3 years, and that has not changed. And the composition of that was
a flattish type retail business. Obviously, we'd like to get a little bit of growth out of it. But we do believe
that can be the case. And then we expected digital to grow in the 20% range. And off of a base of $600
million last year, that's quite a bit of contribution. And then we also expected and continue to expect that
the B2B business will grow in the mid-single-digit range. So those are the components we're thinking
about. Obviously, we want to drive to more than just 2% to 3% growth. That's not satisfactory, and that's
where, really, our platform strategy comes into play and signing more and more partners as we move
along.

But just the last point on the domestic business, it was about 6% of our total revenues last year. So it's
becoming a smaller and smaller piece overall of the company, and that's probably a trend we're going to
see for a little while. So -- and that's what we've assumed in our outlook for this year as well.

Andrew William Jeffrey
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. So still hoping that, that retail business, I guess, can turn the corner for you.

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes because -- yes, go ahead.

Hikmet Ersek
President, CEO & Director

Oh, yes. I mean we assume a flat business, but nobody has the strength of retail mix compared with our
global coverage. And most importantly, you connect digital with retail that we can pay out in different
economical environment, different -- we serve different customer segments on the send side. We do serve
different customers segment on the receive side. And combining that, it's a big advantage for us that
drives the growth of digital, paying out in cash or paying out in an account or paying out in a wallet. And
that in real time, it's huge. And that's definitely going to continue happening in the retail business.

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And I think as you saw at Investor Day, and it continues to be the case, the opportunity on the retail
side is to drive more dynamic pricing capabilities. So time of day, day of week, location density, those
kinds of things give us confidence that we can keep the retail business in the flattish type range because
there's more opportunity there that we haven't fully maximized yet.

Andrew William Jeffrey
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I apologize if I missed it, but it looks like yields on wu.com improved again this quarter. What's
driving that?

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean there was certainly some mix impacts from the domestic business and things -- because we're
running the domestic parts of our business for cash, if you will. And so that certainly has a positive mix on
the revenue side. There was also some pricing that we did. As we mentioned, net pricing was beneficial,
net of the mix in the quarter. And so we feel good about where the overall digital business is. We had 25%
revenue growth in digital but over 30% transaction growth in that digital business. So we're doing quite
well overall on the digital side.

Okay. So that's pricing specifically at wu.com or across...

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

On the branded wu.com offering, yes.

Our next question comes from Tim Chiodo of Crédit Suisse.

Timothy Edward Chiodo
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wanted to talk a little bit about the unit economics of some of the digital white labeling programs. I know
we've talked about in the past that the revenue per transaction is obviously a little bit lower, but maybe
you can talk about the absolute EBIT dollars per transaction and how that might compare to a traditional
Western Union transaction?

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. First of all, I would say it's still early stages on the white-label partners, and we're going to continue
to learn on what kind of economics they can provide. But you're absolutely right. Typically, we'll have a
lower starting point from a revenue per transaction standpoint, but we also don't have much cost in that
transaction either as we do in our branded offerings.

The -- in a wu.com transaction, we are paying -- we're investing heavily in marketing to acquire
customers. We also have fraud losses and other things that we're paying for. But in a white-label
transaction, we are being delivered a customer who wants to do a transaction with us and has good funds,
right? So we don't spend the marketing dollars there, and we really have the processing cost. So the
margins in the white-label offerings can be quite high, actually. And we're going to learn more as we
launch more of these partners.

But based on our early experience, it can be a very profitable business. And last thing I would say is that
we see it largely as an incremental business, so incremental revenues and incremental profits.

Timothy Edward Chiodo
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Right on. And to get a little bit more at the absolute dollars. So I understand that the revenue is lower and
the margin percentage could be higher. But could the absolute dollar actually be similar?

Rajesh K. Agrawal
Executive VP & CFO

It depends. It depends. I can tell you one of the examples we have that's currently going on is very
profitable. The other one is not as profitable, but we're getting, again, incremental revenues and
incremental profits. So it's not -- obviously, it's important that how much money we're making per
transaction. But as long as we're getting incremental business for the company and it's within our overall
framework, that's the most important thing for us. So we'll learn more over time, and we wouldn't be
doing this if it wasn't profitable for us.

Hikmet Ersek
President, CEO & Director

It's both our -- sorry, both are profitable, and -- but it depends on the partner. I mean also the new
additions of our -- the post offices will be very profitable, but it depends on the partner and the geography
and which corridor you are placing that. And it's like started our westernunion.com business. As you know,
as we started, it was only -- as we start to report, it was only 1% of our revenue. Now it's about 15%
of our consumer revenue. It's a huge part of that. And same approach, we think, also could be done by
