Thanks very much and good morning everyone
Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call
Joining me here today is our CFO, Christa Davies
Before beginning the discussion on our Q3 and year-to-date results, I would like to pause for a moment to reflect on the recent catastrophic events that have impacted various communities and millions of individuals around the world
Our sincere condolences go out to families who are enduring this trauma, to business owners forced to rebuild, and to those remain at risk or without sufficient resources
We are very fortunate that our 3,000 colleagues and their families across 30 Aon offices directly affected by the series of events were safe
During times of tragedy and devastation, it is heartening to see my colleagues from across the firm rise up and unite to help their neighbors, fellow collogues and clients
Aon is also a partner of Red Cross investing in their disaster relief efforts to respond in times of need and offering volunteer work on the ground to aid the millions of individuals personally affected
I can’t begin to express enough gratitude to my Aon collogues and partners who put forth tremendous effort during the time of such human need
With all hands on deck, we are fully focused on supporting our clients and our colleagues through the continued aftermath of these events
Now, referencing back to the specific topic of this call, we’d like to highlight that there are slides available on our website for you to follow along with our commentary today
As we discussed on prior calls, Aon’s current position is a result of a proven decade-long strategy that focuses on aligning our portfolio solutions around our clients’ highest priorities in the arenas of risk, retirement and health
We’ve taken significant steps to get here
Earlier this year, we completed the divestiture of our outsourcing platform, which provides a further catalyst for our strategy and actions to deliver substantial shareholder value
With approximately $3 billion of additional capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs and in our Aon United operating model, we expect to substantially strengthen our firm even further
We’re already seeing improvement in our growth profile driven by investments in high-growth, high-margin areas across our portfolio
For example, our organic growth has accelerated year-to-date from 2% in 2015 to 3% in both 2016 and now 2017. And we’re taking further steps to unit Aon with investments to progress toward a single global business services operating model, increasing Aon’s efficiency and connectivity, and through one global P&L encompassing all of Aon’s industry-leading capabilities, helping us deliver all of global Aon to their clients in their local markets
Now turning to the quarter on page five of the presentation
Consistent with previous quarters, I would like to cover two areas before turning the call over to Christa for further financial review
First is our performance against key metrics we communicate to shareholders; second, overall growth performance including continued areas of strategic investment
On the first topic, our performance versus key metrics
Each quarter, we measure our performance against the key metrics we focus on achieving over the course of the year, grow organically, expand margins, increase earnings per share and deliver free cash flow growth
In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 2%, highlighted by strong growth in Reinsurance and Retirement Solutions
Operating margin increased by 170 basis points, primarily reflecting savings from investments in our Aon United operating model and core operational improvement
EPS increased 18% to $1.29, reflecting both strong operating performance and effective capital management
Finally, free cash flow decreased $881 million year-to-date, primarily reflecting tax payments related to the divestiture
Overall, Q3 was a quarter of continued progress with year-to-date results reflecting 3% organic revenue growth, 170 basis points of margin improvement and 17% EPS growth heading into our seasonally strongest quarter of the year
Turning to slide seven, on the second topic of organic growth and strategic investments
Organic revenue growth was 2% overall in the third quarter
And as I mentioned earlier, on a year-to-date basis, organic revenue growth was 3%, reflecting growth across all five revenue lines with particular strength in Health and Reinsurance Solutions
Reflecting now on each of our core growth platforms
In Commercial Risk Solutions, organic revenue declined 1% against the strong comparable of 4% growth in the prior year quarter
The prior year quarter included a benefit from certain onetime items
On average, globally, exposures are modestly positive and the impact from pricing was modestly negative, resulting in a relatively stable market impact overall
Our results in the quarter reflect modest growth internationally across EMEA, Asia and the Pacific, driven by strong new business generation and management of our renewable portfolio
, results faced headwind from the timing of certain items
Given recent catastrophic events and significant industry challenges, our global teams prioritize helping clients with immediate action plans, claims processing and recovery efforts in the quarter
Overall, we believe our results in Commercial Risk Solutions for the third quarter reflect the confluence of unfavorable timing and events in our seasonally smallest quarter, against the strong comparable in the prior year
We believe the underlying results are better viewed on a year-to-date basis and we would expect the fourth quarter to show growth in our seasonally strongest quarter
In Reinsurance Solutions, organic revenue growth was 7%, an acceleration from flat in the prior-year quarter
I would note, this is the second consecutive quarter of the highest level of organic revenue growth achieved in our reinsurance business in five years
Results reflect growth across every major area including treaty placements, capital markets transactions and facultative placements
We saw a particular strength in treaty placements, driven by record new business generation including several new clients to Aon and a modest benefit from reinstatement premiums following the recent events
Results were partially offset by modest, unfavorable market impact, primarily in the Americas
In Retirement Solutions, organic revenue growth was 5%, an acceleration from 4% in the prior year quarter
We saw a continued strong growth in investment consulting, including double-digit growth in delegated investment management solutions, reflecting an increase in client demand for Aon’s tailored solutions, independent [ph] advice, as well as increase in performance fees for outperforming benchmark returns
Assets under management and delegated investment management continue to trend upward, reaching a $118 billion in the third quarter
We also saw a solid growth in our talent practice, primarily from compensation survey and benchmarking services
In Health Solutions, organic revenue growth was 2%
We saw strong growth in health and benefits brokerage including double-digit new business generation with particular strength in the U.S
and Latin America
Results were partially offset by a decline in project-related work in the healthcare exchange business
On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue growth was 7%, an acceleration from 4% in the prior year
In Data & Analytic Services, organic revenue growth was 3%
Results primarily reflect growth in our Affinity business, with particular strength in the U.S
Affinity was highlighted by continued strong performance in pet and financial solutions as well as the modest increase in claims processing in our employed business following the recent activity
Now, turning to slide eight to discuss areas of strategic investment
Clients are navigating an increasingly volatile world where economic, demographic and geopolitical forces combined with the exponential pace of technology change are all converging to create a challenging new reality for businesses
Aon has a strong track record of allocating capital for developing innovative, first-to-market solutions to help solve problems and create differentiated value in response to specific client needs
We’re investing organically and through M&A across our portfolio in areas such as Data & Analytics, in our InPoint and Re/View businesses; cyber risk advisory through the recent acquisition of Stroz Friedberg; Affinity, in multiple areas across the business; health and elective benefits brokerage through the recent acquisitions of Admix in Latin America and Univers; healthcare exchanges, where we offer the broadest set of solutions in health; geographically with the pending acquisition of UMG, reinforcing our industry-leading position in the Netherlands; and finally, in delegated investment management solutions, a business with rapidly growing client demand
In the third quarter, we announced the pending acquisition of the Townsend Group, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services, primarily focused on real estate
Townsend significantly expands our investment capabilities by bringing greater depth of expertise in real estate and real estate assets to Aon’s distribution scale and furthers our ability to provide more attractive, alternative, pilot market asset capabilities to our clients
Overall, our strategic investments in high growth areas and in Data & Analytics are improving the firm’s long-term growth profile, driven by new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio
In summary, during the quarter, where client and colleague needs were our immediate priority, we delivered strong operational improvement and double-digit earnings growth, reflecting increased operating leverage and performance on new initiatives, in addition to the year-to-date return of approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends
Looking forward, we expect a strong finish to the year with continued momentum amplified by an unmatched level of investment driving the next wave of innovation for clients and substantial value creation for our shareholders
I’m now pleased to turn the call over to Christa for further financial review
Sure, happy to do that, Sarah
As we described, first of all, remember, this is our -- Q3 is our smallest quarter sort of over the course of the year heading into our strongest quarter, the fourth quarter
I talked about it, strong comparable from the Q3 last year of 4%, and essentially said, the timing was really showing up in Q1 and Q3. So, we don’t expect anything coming back in Q4. But, what we really try to highlight is kind of -- if you look at our results, not just in commercial risk but really overall and kind of the year-to-date perspective, this is really where we think sort of as a best assessment overall in terms of where we are, and this we essentially said
If we think year-to-date Q3 ‘15, ‘16, ‘17, we have gone from 2% in ‘15 to 3% in ‘16, 3% in ‘17, and we believe we can continue to accelerate that over time
We see Q3 as a little of a anomaly in the context of all that
Pricing piece, I thought you might forget that
[Multiple speakers] Listen, on the pricing side, obviously a lot’s been written and talked about
Our view is -- look, there is just a -- continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there
The ultimate losses, unclear kind of where they all shake out from time to time, just look at the ranges sort of been published, they’ve been astronomical in terms of sort of how they’ve come in
I would say, from our standpoint, look, we still sit in a very well capitalized industry overall
We described while substantial, more of an earnings event versus a balance sheet event in terms of sort of where we’re over time
But I would highlight from Aon’s perspective, we see this very much on a client by client basis
We’ve invested in substantial data and analytics over time to put us in what we believe is a great position to help our clients, particularly in these kinds of environments
If you look at what we do with Aon Client Treaty for example, these are the types of investments that, frankly, reduce risk work for clients and create opportunity for them
From our standpoint, it’s going to play out over time
Sarah, there is no specific answer at this point
And we’re going to take it client by client as it evolves over time
I might add to that, Dave
If you look at it -- Christa just highlighted really Q3 year-to-date results, Q3 2017, if you did the exact same question in Q2, we’re better against each one of those metrics, as you go from Q2 to Q3. So, it’s plus 14, as Christa described and year-to-date Q3, the year-to-date Q2 was up 12%, we’re up a 170 basis points year-to-date Q3, that was a 160 basis points year-to-date Q2, up 17% EPS that same number was 15% in Q2. So, it’s actually a nice progression
And as we described it, don’t overplay, but a quarter of progress in terms of where we’re
And what you’re seeing is really core performance and operating leverage increasing as we continue to invest in the global business services platform
From our standpoint, listen, we’ve actually done, 19 acquisitions signed closed year-to-date and as Christa described, over a $1 billion committed on the M&A front
We see, again, real opportunities here to add content capability to the overall portfolio
As you’ve heard us say multiple times, so I’ll repeat it here again today, we take a very, very disciplined approach to this
Christa has put in place a return on invested capital framework, cash on cash return; nothing gets through that framework
And in essence, the benchmark is buyback, which we believe is a very, very attractive investment
But, when we find opportunities that exceed buyback, we invest in those
And there is a very substantial robust pipeline, lots of opportunities out there and we see these as kind of add-on acquisitions to the Aon family that content capability that we can scale
Townsend is a terrific example of that and UMG’s [ph] a terrific example of that, Admix in Latin America is a terrific example of that
So, lots of different opportunities for us out there and you’ll continue to see us invest along the framework I described
And we really like, Adam, is -- not only do we like the financial characteristics but what drives that is really the underlying client capability and content characteristics
And each of those bring a unique capability to the table on our behalf and we are going to -- we can then see that across the firm
And this is back to the idea of the catalyst, which is really the -- if we saw the outsourcing business, it generates another level of investment we can put back into the business, both on the acquisition side as well as investing in global business services across Aon to strengthen the firm
So, it really is we think unique opportunity over the coming two to three years, when we think about capital deployment
First of all, Mike, I would just step back
As I described when Sarah asked her question at the beginning, for us, a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what’s going on
That means there is uncertainty for our clients and that is actually the wheelhouse of Aon
The content capability, analytics we have invested in over time, it literally puts us in a tremendous position
Our clients understand risk, measure risk and mitigate risk
And that’s really what we are doing
I want to also emphasize, the investment we are making back into the firm is a substantial investment
It involves restructuring but it is also investment in a number of areas to strengthen our firm, in technology, things we are doing on the real estate front to create greater client areas to bring our colleagues together
So, a lot is going on across Aon
But it is all fundamentally to make Aon stronger engine, a stronger firm to serve clients
So, I’d go the exact opposite
What we are doing to strengthening our firm, support clients over time and this is another example of a very high stress time for clients, so we can be helpful to them
So, I see exactly the opposite
To us, this is an opportunity to invest to strengthen the firm
And that’s in fact exactly what we are doing
Quite the reverse
Again, I think our team is fully focused on clients 24x7 and that’s what Aon is all about, so don’t see any concern there at all
It’s a terrific question
And we’ve talked about that -- the industry has talked about that
These types of events highlight literally sort of individuals and companies that are quite literally uncovered in sort of events and times of trauma
I would say, at Aon, we think about it a little bit differently from a kind of a protection gap
Because if you think about this from the side of a client or an individual customer, we’re essentially saying, we have a gap out there in order for you to actually be in a better position, just buy more of our product
We look at it differentially
We look at it literally as, think about, how capital gets deployed, are there more efficient ways to deploy across the risk spectrum, and we believe there actually is
And there is different products and innovations that come with that
And so, our view is, when you think about kind of the world of risk out there and you recognize sort of how little the penetration is around the world, there is just tremendous opportunities to actually strengthen and build upon that, not just the existing risk like flood which is an obvious one but the new risk like cyber
I mean, again, if you think about cyber right now, there was $450 billion of loss in the U.S
last year, or reported loss in cyber and $2.5 billion or $3 billion in premium
The laws in Europe, which are going to come into effect in May, June of 2018 are going to create another wave of reported loss
How we respond to that to support clients is really a function of how we innovate as an industry
It is also true for the more straightforward coverages like flood and which we got to respond with innovation that actually make that more attractive, different than the current product we’ve got right now
So, we believe there is a very strong set of opportunities to increase the penetration, really serve clients more effectively as they understand, measure, and mitigate risk, but it’s going to require our industry to innovate in order to make that happen
Again, we look at it -- we do see a substantial growth fully driven by client needs
So, I mean, again, if you think about literally just the $450 billion of reported loss from the U.S
, virtually -- I’m saying U.S
because most of it was U.S
reported, that begs the question, is there just no cyber in Europe? Obviously, there is
So, why is it so much smaller? It’s a function of the laws, those are going to change
Therefore, cyber is going to go a number which is some -- many multiples of that
So, we see tremendous opportunity to help clients understand and deal with cyber
And it’s been a source of growth for us, will continue to be a source of growth for us
We’re privileged to be the largest place for this around the world and we’re doubling down our investment in it
Having said that, our industry including Aon, need to continue to innovate on behalf of clients on this category
So, we see this as a substantial opportunity because it’s a substantial source of risk for our clients
Why don’t I start on the revenue side and Christa you can pick up the margin piece? First of all, on the revenue side, much like we talked about sort of -- we don’t look at the quarter, we look at kind of year-to-date
We’re kind of 5% year-to-date
We think that’s actually great progress
I would come back reflecting on multiple calls over the last few years and just highlight again, we just have a superb team on the reinsurance side, they are tremendously well-positioned to support clients
We’re agnostic on the overall approach, we’re essentially helping our clients again think about ways to understand and control volatility
And what you saw this quarter, it really was record new business on the treaty side
And this is with existing clients but also with new clients to Aon as we gain market share in this arena
Also, we are number one in treaty, number one in facultative placements, and number one in insurance, like securities like et cetera
So, we just got an exceptionally strong position
This team has also taken great efforts to expand the marketplace
If you think about what we’ve done on the mortgage side and literally created net new markets in an area that hadn’t existed before
So, what you see on the reinsurance front is just continued progress from an exceptional team
And again, as I said clients that have lots of need out there to understand and deal with volatility, which is increasing over time
So, it’s just been terrific progress from a very, very strong team in this context
In terms of impact on margin, Christa?
I just want to thank everybody for being part of the call today, and look forward to our conversation next quarter
