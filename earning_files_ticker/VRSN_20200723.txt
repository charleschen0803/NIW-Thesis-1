Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's conference is
being recorded. Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor
Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.

David Atchley
VP & Corporate Treasurer

Thank you, operator.

Welcome to VeriSign's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Thank you to everyone for joining our call
today, and we hope each of you are staying safe and healthy. Joining me remotely from their respective
locations are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George
Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. Thank you in advance for your patience if we experience any
interference, delays or sound quality issues during today's call.

This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under
About VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our second quarter 2020 earnings release. At the
end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call
will be posted.

Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking
statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents
filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. VeriSign does not update
financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.

The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results
and 2 non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP
reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor
Relations section of our website available after this call.

In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call
for your questions.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone.

With the increased demand for and reliance on Internet services during the COVID-19 crisis, the secure
and reliable operation of our infrastructure becomes even more important. Our focus remains on our
mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical infrastructure. We have been and are prepared
to continue operating all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net, and our route
operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by ICANN, with most of our
employees continuing to work remotely. Our focus on mission is emphasized by the fact that the company
last week marked 23 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net domain name resolution system. This
achievement is the result of the dedication and expertise of our team and of our specialized infrastructure.

Also, as part of our response to the COVID-19 crisis, we announced in March a freeze of the wholesale
prices in all of our TLDs, including .com, through the end of 2020. Today, given the current environment,
we are further extending that price freeze for the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs through March 31,

2021. Additionally, we are also extending the waiver of the wholesale restore fee for expired domain
names through the end of 2020.

Now I will address our quarterly results.

Q2 of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business,
expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results. Regarding second quarter
operational highlights, at the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 162.1 million,
consisting of 148.7 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth
rate of 3.8%. During the second quarter, we processed 11.1 million new registrations and the domain
name base increased by 1.41 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45
days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2020 will be
approximately 72.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.2% achieved in the second quarter of 2019
and 75.4% last quarter.

For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2.75% and 4%. This updated
range, which recognizes the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19, reflects the strength we have
seen in new registrations and our expectation for domain name base growth for the balance of the year.

During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 730,000 shares
of common stock repurchased for $150 million. At June 30, 2020, $676 million remained available and
authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration.

Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing
needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $314 million, up 2.6% from the
same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $207 million, up 2.5% from $202 million in the
same quarter a year ago.

Operating expense totaled $108 million, up from $105 million in the second quarter a year ago and
up from $106 million last quarter. The sequential increase in operating expense is primarily a result of
increased sales and marketing spend during the quarter. The operating margin in the quarter came to
65.8% compared to 65.9% in the same quarter a year ago.

Net income totaled $152 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings
per share of $1.32 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.24 for the same quarter last year.

Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $215 million and free cash flow was $204 million
compared with the $165 million and $154 million, respectively, from the second quarter last year.
Operating cash flow in the second quarter benefited from the lower cash tax payments due to the
permitted deferral of approximately $50 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter of
2020. Additionally, the deferred revenue balance increased during the quarter as a result of the strength in
new registrations.

I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance.

Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast
reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 2.75% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier.

Operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and
65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our

VERISIGN, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

operational infrastructure, security capabilities, and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of
2020.

Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $75 million
to $80 million. This updated range reflects the additional $5 million gain recognized during the second
quarter related to the sale of our Security Services business.

Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million.

We still expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the
$168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we still expect tax
expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 are now expected
to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income.

In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter,
and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in the second half of 2020.

Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Thank you, George.

I'd like to say again that our priorities are our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical
infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and
reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at
home, online services are critical, and more businesses and individuals that never depend on Internet
infrastructure for their livelihood. Our record of .com and .net DNS availability speaks volumes about
our commitment to our mission. I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in
maintaining our uptime record even during the pandemic.

Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, I would like to walk through a few questions
which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions.

The first question: With today's announced extension of the price freeze, how should we think about the
limited pricing flexibility you have for .com?

First, as a reminder, the wholesale price for .com domain names has been unchanged at $7.85 for 8 years
since 2012. Also, as a reminder, our wholesale prices for .com are governed by our registry agreement
with ICANN. The retail price that the end user actually pays for a domain name is set by the retail channel,
which is the registrars who have no regulation of their pricing. Additionally, there's an unregulated
secondary market for domain names. With that background, under Amendment 3 to the .com Registry
Agreement, VeriSign is now permitted to raise the wholesale price of .com domain names by up to 7% in
each of the final 4 years of every 6-year period. Within the current 6-year period, the first year in which
we may increase the wholesale price ends on October 25, 2021. And we expect to effectuate a .com
wholesale price increase before that October 21 date -- 2021 date.

The second question: Are there any updates on the status of .web?

Answer: As we noted last quarter, a final hearing is currently scheduled to begin on August 3 in the
independent review process, or IRP, that affiliates initiated in November 2018. That hearing is scheduled
to take place via videoconferencing. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but
was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also, as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN's
bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making
decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final
decision on the delegation of the .web TLD.

Question 3: Can you help me better understand what is impacting the increase in new registrations and
the lower preliminary quarterly renewal rate for the second quarter?

VERISIGN, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Most of the strength in new registrations came from registrars in North America. While we don't have
the same visibility that retailers do, based on feedback from our retailers, they are seeing increased
demand from small businesses getting online. This strength was partially offset by slower activity from
registrars in China. As it relates to the preliminary quarterly renewal rate, the year-over-year decrease is
primarily related to a lower overall first-time renewal rate. Year-over-year, the overall previous renewal
rate remained relatively consistent.

Question 4: Are there any updates to the donations you announced earlier this year?

Yes, there are. During the first quarter, we made an initial $2 million donation to organizations assisting
those impacted by COVID-19 locally and nationally. During the second quarter, we made a cash
contribution of $1 million to the Equal Justice Initiative in support of their work. We are actively working
on an expansion to our VeriSign Cares program beyond the $3 million the company donated during the
first half of the year, again, with a focus on providing assistance to those impacted during the COVID-19
crisis. I'm sure you have questions, and I can only say that these additional efforts should be further along
by the time we talk to you again next quarter.
And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird.

Robert Cooney Oliver
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So on -- if I can maybe provide a little bit more. Remarkably, the domain growth is back now above where
it was pre-COVID, at least at the lower end of the range, which is pretty remarkable. You mentioned
some of the drivers there, U.S. strength. Can you maybe flesh that out a little bit more? And then China
weakness maybe being responsible for the lower renewal rate. Can we perhaps get a little bit more color
on that, both geographically, as well as some of the economic puts and takes around SMBs and what you
guys are seeing there? And then I had one follow-up.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Okay. Rob, I think we can try. First of all, let me just say that basically, the strength came from
predominantly North America with small businesses getting online. As to geography, I think we have
limited visibility, but let me invite George to comment further.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Jim, and thanks for the question, Rob. So as Jim mentioned, in Q2, we did see strength in
gross additions or new registrations in North America. I will also say EMEA and APAC were also strong.
They also improved in the quarter year-over-year. And China was a little bit lower. As far as the China
gross adds, they were similar to the gross add levels we had last quarter there, but they were down from
year ago levels. As far as renewal rates, Jim mentioned they were down about 1.4% in total year-over-
year. And we saw that decline, primarily, it manifests itself in lower first time renewal rates, and they were
down also in most markets that we keep a track -- keep an eye on. And as Jim also mentioned, we're
a thin registry. We talked to before. We don't have direct visibility into the end user. So it's a little more
difficult for us to understand the economic impact per se. But in general, gross adds were very strong this
quarter. Our net adds were good. They were 1.4 million. It was very similar to, if not slightly above, third
quarter -- I'm sorry, second quarter of 2019 when they totaled 1.3 million.

Robert Cooney Oliver
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

George, I appreciate it. And then just a follow-up. And I think it makes a lot of sense on the suspension
of the price increase given the pandemic. And so I guess I would just ask if there's anything beyond the
obvious in terms of the rationale there. And then you do draw a line on the sand that you guys will avail
yourself of the price increase in October, which I believe would get you guys the 4 years of the final 6
years. I just want to make sure we understand that properly. And if there's anything else you can add to
flesh that out.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Sure. Thanks, Rob. I don't think -- I can't even need to add anything. You summarized it accurately. We
are taking another freeze of prices through March 31, 2021. That is related to the current environment.
The date of the first year period of our available price increase is October 25, 2021. And you accurately
stated that we expect to effectuate .com wholesale price increase before that date.

I think we're ready for another question, operator.

VERISIGN, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

We'll move to Nick Jones with Citi.

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

The first one, just as you extend the waiver for restore fees. Can you walk through maybe what the
implications there are? Is there kind of a building group of domains that are up? They could potentially -- I
guess you guys could generate some revenue from these restore fees that maybe fall off. Would you then
recognize those as churned? I guess if you could walk through kind of the dynamic of the restore fees and
maybe provide a little bit of color on -- is there like a buildup coming down? And I have one follow-up after
that.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Okay. Let me invite Todd or George to answer your question.

Todd B. Strubbe
President & COO

Yes. This is Todd, Nick. First off, the impact of waiving the restore fees is immaterial to our financials, and
it's accounted for in the revenue guidance we provided today. There's a period of time after a registrar
deletes a domain name. That's known as the redemption grace period. It's a 30-day period. And the
registrant has a chance to get the name back then before it goes into general availability. So it's those
names we're talking about that's already been deleted by the registrar. And so this restore fee is in
addition to the standard registration and renewal fee associated with the domain name renewal. And we
don't disclose our wholesale restore fee, which is charged to the registrar. And of course, they determine
what the actual retail restore fee is. And we've seen many registrars pass on the waiver from a retail
perspective. So anecdotally, we believe that small businesses and individuals are benefiting from our
waiver.

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then I guess one follow-up on operating margin. With kind of the increased SMB interest
and having a digital presence, is there potential leverage in the sort of the marketing bucket kind of
throughout the rest of the year as maybe you don't need to advertise or be as aggressive in that OpEx
line?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Nick. I mean, clearly, every quarter, we're looking at our expenses and making sure we're
spending the appropriate amount in each of the categories to drive profitable growth and support the
business. Sales and marketing expense sequentially was up. And we do have plans to continue marketing
activities throughout the year. But those costs, again, are factored into the guidance that we provided. But
we do expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing activity for the rest of 2020 year.

Operator

And we will take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

A couple of questions. So the new guidance for the domain growth for the full year, what have you
factored in for the last 2 quarters in terms of the pace of new registrations and the renewal rate?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

VERISIGN, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

George?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we don't guide to gross registrations or renewal rates. We guide to the net zone increase. Clearly,
we've done pretty well here through the first half of the year. And we expect that there'll be continued
demand for the products. But as far as what will happen specifically to the renewal rate into the quarter or
gross adds, we'll wait and see. We clearly publish the gross adds of new unit information and the domain
name base on our website. You can see what is going on there. But our full year guidance is the guidance
we provide. We don't break it up quarterly.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. But maybe just to follow up and try it a different way. At least qualitatively, I think if we look
at some of the previous economic cycles, when we get to this point, we tend to see increased business
closures. And I think we saw that manifest itself in the renewal rate in the June quarter. Are you at
least incorporating an idea of a lower renewal rate in the back half and maybe a higher elevation in new
registrations just qualitatively?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

We don't forecast or model our results in that way. We do a lot of algorithmic computations and models
that have proven fairly accurate over the prior period. And we use that algorithmic model to guide us,
not only for the quarters or year, but also in our planning. It's been fairly reliable for us. And so that's
the methodology that we're looking at. It's very hard to go down and forecast demand by an end user or
by a registrar or by a country level. We clearly look at those results. But the data is so voluminous that
we have to use algorithms to help us do that. And the algorithms, which is, like I said before, have been
relatively accurate, are giving us the range that we've put out here for our guidance.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That makes sense. Can you give us what the number of domain names up for renewal in the September
quarter looks like? And how does that compare against what you just had in June? And what does it look
like versus September a year ago?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the number of names that were up for renewal in the second quarter 2020 was 35.1 million. We
expect 34.2 million to be up for renewal next quarter in the third quarter. When I go back a year ago, in
the second quarter of 2019, that was closer to 33.3 million and the third quarter of 2019 was 32.6 million.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. Great. And then last one. And I think I can guess the answer, but I still want to ask it anyway
because it's been a topic of a lot of investor conversations that I've had. You mentioned that you are going
to take advantage of the price increase before the October deadline. We know you have the 6-month
window in terms of announcement. But based on the comments that you've given, are you leaving open
the possibility that you might at least announce the price increase prior to that March time frame that
you've extended the price freezes until?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

I'm not entirely sure I understand your question. But I think maybe the answer can be determined by
having me merely state that, as you point out, there is a 6-month notice that's required to effectuate a
Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

VERISIGN, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

price increase before we have to provide 6 months' notice. And obviously, we will do that. The date of
the expiration of the first year of the 4 price increases available in the 6-year period is October 25, 2021.
And we, of course, by virtue of today's announcement, are freezing wholesale prices in all of our TLDs
through March 31, 2021. So I think a little bit of math could answer your question. There's certainly a
point somewhere, right? Go ahead. I'm sorry.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Absolutely. Yes. I think that's fair. Yes. No. I think that's fair. Maybe just to sneak one last one in.
GoDaddy's acquisition of the NeuStar registry assets brings a -- let's say a stronger, financially sound
company into the registry operations. How do you view their entrance into the registry space? And how do
you think that might influence consolidation of registries moving forward?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Well, GoDaddy has been and is -- always has been an important channel partner for us, obviously, I mean
ever since all the way back to when Bob Parsons started and built that company. We certainly expect that
to continue. End users see tremendous value in .com and .net and those TLDs. And we know that our
channel partners recognize that value as well. I just should point out that vertical integration is not new.
Several of other of our registrar channel partners also operate TLD registries. Google has Google registry.
Name.com has Donuts with over 200 TLDs in it. In each of those cases, these registrars continue to be an
important channel partner to VeriSign for our TLDs. So I expect those relationships to continue.

Operator

And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr.
Atchley for closing remarks.

David Atchley
VP & Corporate Treasurer

Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this
call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.

Operator
And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may
now disconnect.
