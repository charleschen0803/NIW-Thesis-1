Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Vice President, Investor Relations and

Tom Martineau

[Operator Instructions]

Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the company's first
quarter performance. We delivered revenue growth, margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth and
strong available cash flow against a tough prior year comparable. We continue to make progress on our
seamless access strategy while maintaining the focus on keeping our employees safe and serving our
customers efficiently.

Let's begin by walking through the first quarter financial summary. Revenue for the first quarter was
$694.3 million, an increase of 2.9% or 0.5% organically. The organic revenue increase was driven by
strength in the Americas residential and Allegion's International businesses, offsetting continued softness
in Americas nonresidential. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the
impact of divestitures. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment.

Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points in the first quarter. We executed extremely well.
And the restructuring and cost management actions taken during 2020, along with the volume leverage on
the businesses that grew, offset the mix headwinds we are experiencing.

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 increased $0.16 or 15.4% versus the prior year. The increase was
driven by expanded operating income, along with favorable other income and share count. Year-to-date
available cash flow came in at $105.5 million, an increase of more than $86 million versus the prior year.
The increased cash flow was driven by improvement in net working capital, growth in net earnings and
reduced capital expenditures.

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Please go to Slide 5. As we discussed previously, reflecting on 2020, despite the ongoing pandemic,
Allegion continues to invest in our future, most notably through our innovation engines. From industrial
design, engineering and IT, to ventures, partnerships and acquisitions, we're building a build-borrow-buy
approach to accelerate seamless access. Investing in our capabilities, partnering and integration are all
core to our innovation strategy.

Let's review some of Allegion's innovation and investments. Allegion's Overtur, our cloud-based ecosystem
where project teams collaborate on the specification design and construction of door security and
openings, expanded in multiple ways during the past year. Key and credential management was added,
more functionality and integration for our building information modeling customers and automation that
helps hardware specification writers. Overtur allows digital connectivity to our customers over the life of
the structure. It's proving its value as a single source of truth for hardware requirements and decisions
and to empower our partners to work more productively.

Our ISONAS brand also launched a significant upgrade of its software platform in Q1, the Pure Access
Cloud 4.0. Reader-controllers are pre-configured to the cloud and only require a network connection
on site, making the ISONAS system truly plug and play. The software upgrade includes new front-end
technology with customized dashboards, gives a boost to cybersecurity and anticipates added capabilities
and future new devices.

Our product innovation spans the world of Allegion. SimonsVoss recently released the SmartLocker, a
retrofit, no-drilling lock option for lockers and furnitures in schools, hospitals and industrial facilities. This
innovation was customer-inspired based on trends and needs in the market. Importantly, it integrates
the existing SimonsVoss digital ecosystem. And there's additional functionality to pry or open each lock
remotely to display breaking attempts in the software and to send notifications.

And just as our internal innovations continue to delight our customers, innovation is built through key
partnerships, and our early leadership in the IoT market has established us as a go-to partner. In Q1,
Homebase announced that they're working with Allegion and Walmart InHome to enable direct-to-
fridge grocery delivery for apartment residents starting in the Kansas City metro. Homebase enables
communities -- Homebase-enabled communities come with pre-installed Schlage Smart Locks, meaning
that the Walmart associate making the delivery gets secure onetime access for entry during a designated
time frame for delivery. This is a clear demonstration of seamless access, adding value to people's
everyday lives.

Partnering with CBORD, Apple and Android has rapidly expanded seamless access use cases on higher
education campuses. By enabling mobile credential technologies, we are part of the ecosystem that
supports contactless student IDs for iPhones, Apple Watches and Google Pay. CBORD also brings our Von
Duprin exit devices into play, giving colleges new remote lockdown and monitoring capabilities. These
integrations are good for campus securities and help universities and colleges operate more efficiently and
safely.

Rounding out our build-borrow-buy approach to innovation, Allegion Ventures continues to invest in
companies like Kasa, Mint House, VergeSense and Openpath. We also acquired Yonomi, a technology
company and leader in IoT cloud platforms. Founded in 2013 by building automation and enterprise
computing experts, Yonomi was the first to create a smart home ecosystem, one that automatically
discovers and coordinates devices. Allegion was an early customer and investor. Today, Yonomi solutions
are used in more than 150 countries, connected to millions of IoT devices.

IoT -- excuse me, Yonomi also holds unique intellectual property that matches well to Allegion's strategic
priorities for accelerating growth through seamless access, innovation and meaningful partnership. Our
goal is to be the provider of choice among IoT developers and integrators. You'll continue to see more
examples of investments in innovation through our build, borrow and buy approach in '21, and we look
forward to sharing more with you in the future.

Patrick will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back later to discuss our '21 outlook and wrap
up.

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call.

If you would, please go to Slide #6. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the
first quarter. For the first quarter of 2020, reported earnings per share was 0. Adjusting $1.04 for
charges related to intangible asset impairments, restructuring expenses and integration costs related to
acquisitions, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.04.

Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.06, driven by volume leverage, along with
continued benefits from cost-control measures and restructuring actions taken in 2020. Favorable price
and currency also contributed to the increase. The combination of these items offset the unfavorable mix.

Favorable other income and interest expense increased earnings per share by $0.08 and was driven
primarily by favorable unrealized investment gains in 2021 compared to unrealized investment losses
experienced in 2020. Favorable share count drove another $0.03 per share impact, more than offsetting
the $0.01 reduction from investments. This results in adjusted first quarter 2021 earnings per share of
$1.20, an increase of $0.16 or 15.4% compared to the prior year.

Lastly, we have a $0.02 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring costs. After giving effect
to these items, you arrive at the first quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.18.

Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the first quarter.
I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we
experienced a 0.5% organic revenue growth in the first quarter as solid price performance was able to
offset lower volume. Although the total company volume was slightly down, we did see strength in the
Americas residential and International businesses. Currency also provided a tailwind to total growth and
more than offset the impact of divestitures.

Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $498.9 million,
down 2.6% on a reported basis and down 2.9% organically. The region continued to deliver good price
realization. On volume, Americas residential was outstanding again, experiencing low-20s percent growth,
boosted by continued strength in retail point-of-sale, new home construction and electronics growth,
which nearly offset the anticipated decline in the nonresidential business caused by lower new construction
and discretionary project delays.

Electronics revenue was down mid-single digits with growth in residential products that was offset by
reduced commercial electronics, driven by delays in discretionary projects. We continue to see electronics
and touchless solutions as long-term growth drivers and expect electronics accelerated growth to resume
when market conditions normalize.

Americas adjusted operating income of $135.5 million decreased 7.6% versus the prior year period, and
adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 140 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily
by volume deleverage, negative mix and incremental investments, partially offset by benefits from cost-
reduction actions and restructuring.

Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were $195.4 million,
up 20.2% and up 11% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by strength across all major
geographies and businesses as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-over-year growth was due
to the comparative impact of COVID-related shutdowns in the prior year. Favorable currency impacts also
contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture impacts.

International adjusted operating income of $18 million increased nearly 1,000% versus the prior year
period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 820 basis points. The margin increase
was driven primarily by solid volume leverage, benefits from lower operating costs from the restructuring
cost-control actions taken during 2020 as well as favorable currency impacts. This is also our first quarter
reporting under the new Allegion International segment. The transition was seamless and made possible
by having strong leadership in place to drive effective change.

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Please go to Slide #10. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2021 came in at $105.5
million, which is an increase of more than $86 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was
driven by improvements in net working capital, higher earnings and reduced capital expenditures. Our
strong cash flow generation continues to be an asset of the company.

Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based
on a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital need from the lower volume
throughout 2020 as well as strong collections performance. The business continues to generate strong
cash flow, and we remain committed to effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to
evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and drive effective cash flow conversion.

I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2021 outlook.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Patrick.

Please go to Slide 11. We have more visibility into our markets, and I am increasingly optimistic on the
economic recovery. The Americas residential business continues to be hot and is expected to grow in
2021. We anticipate strength in residential to persist for the foreseeable future. DIY demand remains
strong, and the construction market is strengthened by a shortage of available new homes, continued low
mortgage rates and improved trends in permits and starts. However, completion rates have been lagging
starts due to labor and supply shortages, which should improve as we move further past the pandemic.

Looking at the Americas nonresidential business, we saw demand begin to increase on the repair/retrofit
projects sooner than we previously anticipated. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the
year. In new constructions, we are starting to see positive movement in macroeconomic indicators, but it's
important to remember the late cycle nature of this market.

For 2021, I expect nonresidential new construction to remain soft, but the monthly change in the
architectural building index, Dodge construction starts and potential stimulus spending are trending
favorable. And assuming this continues, it will lead to growth in 2022 and beyond. The seamless access,
software and electronics continue to be long-term growth drivers, and they will remain our top investment
priorities. They are the future of Allegion.

With these parameters in place, we are now projecting total and organic revenue in the Americas to be
flat to up 1% in 2021. In the Allegion International segment, markets continue to recover, and we expect
full year growth in most of our International segments, led by our Germanic and Global Portable Securities
business. We continue to monitor the pace of vaccine rollouts internationally as this will lead to sustainable
improvements in the economic environment. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our
QMI door business and contribute to total growth.

For the region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to 12% to 13% with organic growth
of 7.5% to 8.5%. All in for total Allegion, we are now projecting total revenue to be up 3% to 4% and
organic revenue to increase 2% to 3%.

We are also raising our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.85 to $5.05 per
share and adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.15. This guide incorporates pricing actions to offset
direct material inflation as well as reflecting our supply chain capability to mitigate industry challenges
on supply and electronic component shortages. We anticipate that these challenges will persist for the
balance of the year, and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions.

Our outlook for available cash flow is also being raised and now projected to be $430 million to $450
million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. The full year
adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12.5%. The outlook for outstanding diluted
shares continues to be approximately 91 million.

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Please go to Slide 12. Allegion is off to a great start. We experienced reported and organic revenue
growth, expanded operating margins and delivered strong cash flow. We have solid business fundamentals
and a proven ability to execute and adapt to changing and uncertain market conditions. We have managed
the business extremely well to set us up for success as markets return to normal. Macroeconomic
indicators and specific indices related to our business are trending positive, and I'm increasingly confident
in the recovery.

The Allegion commitment to shareholders, employees and customers is to be stronger exiting the
pandemic than when we entered, our work continues. I want to take this opportunity to thank our
employees for their diligence and dedication during the pandemic. It is their commitment that has driven
the company to perform well and accelerated our vision of seamless access and a safer world. Allegion's
future is bright. Thank you.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just wanted to dial in on the revised Americas organic sales growth outlook. Maybe just help
us understand how that guidance increase was split between your residential and your nonresidential
assumptions changing. And then within nonresidential specifically, how should we think about that slope of
decline shrinking over the balance of this year? As you've been running at a sort of down low double-digit
rate for 4 quarters in a row now.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. Julian, so I would characterize it this way. First of all, during the course of the quarter, things
progressively got better, particularly as we looked at our nonresidential business. And by that, meaning
just kind of the level of activity, orders, customer enthusiasm, specifically related to discretionary projects.
And so that piece of information, plus with the improvement in certain indices, leading indicators relative
to our business, i.e., ABI, new construction starts, those type of things, which I'll remind you, relative to
new construction, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be incremental business this year, but continued
improvement, particularly as we look out beyond 2021.

But the improvement in non-resi really relates to discretionary projects continuing to be favorable more
than what we had originally anticipated last time we were on the conference call. Residential continues its
strength really across the board, just really seeing good improvement in DIY, new build construction, et
cetera. We expect that strength to continue.

I would just remind you, keep in mind that last year, as we're coming -- exiting out of Q2, after the plant
shutdowns, demand started to surge. We were kind of catching our feet relative to production and kind
of keeping up with demand. We didn't start kind of filling channel inventory until late Q3, Q4. That will be
nonrecurring, right, this year. And so you get into a tougher comp, if you will, in the back half of this year
as it relates to the residential business, but still growth on a normalized basis.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then my follow-up would be switching to the Americas margin outlook. So if I look in the 10-Q, you
have that pricing and productivity in excess of inflation line. That was only about a 20 bps tailwind to
margins in the first quarter. How should we think about that playing out over the balance of the year, both
in terms of sort of what's happening with inflation and also your pricing measures?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

It's going to be more difficult, and the reason being is the inflationary item will step up, i.e., it's going
to be worse as we progress kind of throughout the course of the year. Why? Because of the input cost
specific to commodities and material components.

The other thing I would remind you of is, remember, we talked last year about some of the boomerang
effect of the cost kind of coming back in into 2021 that was not there in 2020. So that's another item.
Plus, we're going to have incremental investments. All of those are going to weigh a little bit more on
margin and will put more pressure, if you will, on margins in the back half of the year that, for '21, that
we didn't experience in 2020.

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

But let me just add something else. I think the -- on the non-resi side of things, relative to the reduced
volume, even though things are getting better as we progress throughout the year, we do have volume
deleverage. We have taken the necessary actions to extract variable costs, okay? So it's really a volume
deleverage issue. It's not a permanent item. When volumes come back, margins will accelerate and
because we've taken the necessary cost-control actions.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'd add one other dimension, and that would just be a slight mix shift as this -- as the discretionary
small project comes back, and we're seeing that and applauding it, it tends to have more mid-price-point
products versus our new build supply that's heavy in our premium product.

Operator

The next question comes from Colton West of Longbow Research.

Colton W. West
Longbow Research LLC

Looks like some great progress just made this quarter. I guess, firstly, as we speak to contacts and we
hear of a pickup in non-res quoting activity, and in the prepared remarks, you called out an acceleration
on the R&R side. With where conditions stand today, are you able to give us a more concrete sense of
when we start to see orders and then the corresponding top line growth? And is this something -- do we
start to see quotes turn into orders as early as 2Q? Or is this -- does this not materialize until maybe the
back half or next year?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

We see some favorable indicators. One, the broader indicators that you all see, ABI, Dodge starts --
not Dodge starts, but Momentum, so we like what we see there. Two, our own specification is up. The
challenge of that is specification doesn't mean orders tomorrow or next week or even next quarter. We
would see that gaining momentum as we exit '21 and then into '22. I also like the -- where the investment
is going in terms of our mix and strengths of the company. As we see end markets' dynamics in major
projects and in construction, hospitals, K-12 college campuses and institutions, that's where the market is
rebounding, and it tends to complement the strengths of the company.

Colton W. West
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. And then my next one is from sort of a 30,000-foot view. Would you consider the current level
of earnings to be trough earnings? And if so, can you walk us through the moving parts that will push
earnings to the next peak?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So I would characterize the earnings, really good performance, obviously, in Q1. If we look at the
full year guide, kind of in line with last year in terms of where we ended up. I would expect, with the
improvement in terms of our outlook, particularly on the nonresidential business gaining momentum,
that will hopefully continue to accelerate in 2022. And as I mentioned before, you would see continuous
improvement in margins relative to that business. With the continuation of residential and the strength
of the end markets, would expect growth there. So yes, I would characterize, as long as the end markets
continue to be favorable, we'll see earnings growth accelerate from '22 and beyond.

Operator

The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

BofA Securities, Research Division

So a question in the last stimulus bill, and I think HVAC companies have been talking about it and also
electrical companies have been talking about it. There's a lot of money allocated for schools. And I think if
you look in the last stimulus, I think 70% of the money was spent on capital improvement project, right?
And the money seems to be like sort of $6 billion to $7 billion a year for the next 3 years.

So I think HVAC companies and electrical companies are talking about the fact that they'll see an impact
from this in next quarter, right, because you do school remodeling in the summer. So institutional vertical
is quite a big deal for you guys. Are you going to see any impact from it? And what's your assessment of
the impact of this portion of the stimulus on your business this year and next year?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So thanks for your question. We absolutely see the billions of dollars that are being allocated into K-12
campuses. We will see benefit from that. Hard to quantify. Each project will have different attributes.
But it's clear, school security remains on the minds of Americans. And I think, too, the rise in violence,
which is disturbing across the country, coupled with the stimulus, school security will get a portion of that
investment and benefit Allegion.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. But is it in your guidance yet? Or is it just too hard to quantify at this point?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

I would say, Andrew, a little bit too hard to quantify at this point. However, as we talked about earlier,
a step-up in terms of order activity relative to discretionary projects we did see, and that will turn into,
we'll call it, new business, Q2, Q3 type of time frame. But I think trying to kind of quantify a larger impact
specific to the stimulus bill, right now, is probably premature.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would just add, we will capture a large percentage of that security spend, and we should be able to have
visibility of that in our spectrum quotation activity in which we also see a very large part of the market.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got you. And just a follow-up question, on International sort of starting to build impressive momentum
there in terms of operating turnaround, can you just give us more granularity? What's driving it? Is it
Italy? Is it Poland? Is it Korea? Is it Australia? As I said, it's been all of a sudden, there's real momentum.
Just would love to get a better sense of what's happening there.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So one, remember the pandemic started internationally before it started here. So Asia Pacific, particularly
Italy hit hard early. So we're seeing that recovery even though the pandemic continues to move.

Number two, our continued investment in electronics and software, our Interflex and SimonsVoss
businesses are performing extremely well. I'm quite proud of the work, the leverage of investment to drive
top line, which we will continue.

Third, success in our GPS business. For those of you that have gone to try and buy a bike, there's no
inventory in. We made supply chain changes that gives us some advantages versus importers. We like

11

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

that. And then we're beginning to see early recovery as well, Australia and New Zealand. Remember, our
Gainsborough acquisition, as residential recovery drives in Australia, will do extremely well there.

I'd add something else. Over the last 4 to 5 quarters, we've been working hard to reposition that. We
collapsed 3 divisions into 2. That gave us some cost efficiencies, driving more accountability then and the
ability to invest back in those businesses for future growth. I like our position, and the future is bright as
we move through recovery.

Operator

The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Nice work.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Tim.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Maybe just a bigger-picture question for you guys. Just as you're seeing buildings reopened, where in
the budget stack is security from a priority perspective? And I guess I'm just kind of wondering if you're
seeing other areas within buildings, like HVAC taking focus away from security, or are you seeing kind of
the interest in the budget priorities relatively unchanged relative to where they were pre-COVID?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would describe it as this, and I think it's consistent as I have painted it. I think over the last 12 months,
there's been the absence of any type of preventive maintenance and small project work because the focus
was on the health and safety of the occupants of buildings. I believe what we saw strongly, beginning mid-
March and continues on, is the return of that. People are going after those projects. Those small projects,
preventive maintenance activity, particularly if it's security-related, carry a pretty high priority versus
other preventive maintenance aspects.

Let's say the door doesn't shut properly, it's not locking, I have a security breach, maintenance people are
always making trade-offs. As we move into the air conditioning season or I don't have heat, those tend
to be a red priority. We could fall into yellow, but, Tim, I believe there's an absent -- there has been an
absence of preventive maintenance, these small projects, and those are moving in. I believe the budgets
are there.

I've also been refreshed that in larger projects that have -- that were delayed, those are coming back
in the mid-project level. An example would be the University of Tennessee. They had a project that was
slated to go in '20. That's come back on. So it's fully budgeted. I think, again, what -- that will naturally
occur, and we'll get our share of that wallet. And as the new construction comes back, it will add more
momentum to Allegion.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Great. That's good to hear. And then maybe just my second question, just on the M&A side of
things. How would you kind of characterize the development of the pipeline over the last 3 to 6 months?
And any sort of increased kind of activity or actionability there just given maybe more of a meeting of the
minds in terms of people's perspective on the end market?

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Chairman, CEO & President

I would say the attention of the leadership team has never been stronger, focused on moves that can help
improve the scale of Allegion. We believe, as we move harder in seamless access, scale matters. We're
pushing hard on moves that we think would help us participate in the connection of access, seamless
access at a faster pace. I'd say less time spent on smaller projects and deals.

But we've been working on this now for 7, 8 years, and we're pushing on those relationships. We believe
there's further consolidation opportunities within the market. And the faster that we accelerate this
convergence, it's going to force some action.

Operator

The next question comes from John Walsh with Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Really impressive execution in the International business. I wanted to actually ask you about where you
see the margins going for that segment now. I mean really strong out of the gate here with that kind of
high end of upper single-digits performance. What should we kind of be thinking about for the full year
there in terms of margins?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, John. So again, as you indicated, really strong performance, both top line and margin rate,
particularly relative compared to prior year. Just as a reminder, you may recall, last year, we were pretty
quick out of the gate in terms of implementing cost-control measures, going in with the restructuring
programs across the board in Asia as well as Europe.

And so you're seeing kind of the full benefit of that, if you will, reflected in the '21 results. So the
restructuring actions taken last year begin to lap in the back half of the year. So you're not going to see
kind of a step-up in the margin performance that you saw in Q1. However, I would suggest that margins
will continue to improve year-over-year as we continue throughout the year. And we should finish, on an
aggregate basis, i.e., the consolidation of Asia and Europe together, at kind of a record performance in
terms of margin percent.

And that's really reflective, as Dave kind of highlighted earlier, the continued strength in electronics, which
has a higher-margin profile. The -- all the cost-reduction actions that we've taken will continue to manifest
itself. And the collapse and consolidation of the 2 segments together, we're seeing the benefits of that
as well. I feel like we're in a really good position kind of going forward, not only to drive top line, but to
ensure that we do it in a profitable basis. And we continue from here on out getting margin accretion as
the business continues to grow.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then just as a follow-up, I think it was in response to Julian's question about residential. You
called out kind of some stock orders in Q3, Q4. Just curious here, in Q1, if you were still seeing those
stock orders or if kind of sell-in is equal to sell-out at this point yet?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So we did experience some of that, not to the magnitude that we did in the latter half of last year.
And I would say, too, quite frankly, if you kind of look at inventory levels in the channel, particularly at
big box, look on it like a trailing kind of 12-month basis, basis of future demand, still probably lower than
where it needs to be.

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

So it's a matter of kind of trying to produce at a higher level, which is difficult right now kind of given
some of the supply constraints in our business. So there is maybe a little bit more that we could put into
the channel. But right now, we're kind of assuming we're more on a normalized basis, producing basis of
demand type of thing.

Operator

The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I just wanted to put my finger a little bit more on kind of the cyclical trajectory also, and I thought maybe
it'd be helpful to kind of discuss things a little bit sequentially given how wild some of the year-over-year
comps are with COVID and the like. Just thinking about Americas in aggregate, right, with commercial
coming off the bottom and resi is still strong, I mean, is there any reason to think you don't have your
normal sequential lift in revenues there from Q1 to Q2?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I think, first, let's look at the lay of the land backwards. You had the rupture of the pandemic. Then
let's go even back, we had a record Q1. We had the rupture of the pandemic. But as we compare to
competition, I believe we were stronger quarter in, quarter out over several of the last quarters. So
whether it was up or down, the sequential nature of it, remember, we talked about plowing through our
backlog. So with that as a backdrop, as we move through, we should expect some lift in the second and
third quarters that we would normally see.

I think that's why we highlight the return of the discretionary and small projects, which I think will
certainly be better than it was a year ago. The but is that new construction demand is not as robust as
it was going into the pandemic. So I think it takes '21 to normalize itself, and we'll see probably a truer
picture of what the market is going to be and we believe better as we go into '22.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes. The nature of my question is really -- and I hate to just kind of play math exercise with you, right?
But Q2 sales typically rise 15% to 20% sequentially, right? For that to happen, you need almost 30%
organic growth in Q2. And if you do 30% organic growth in Q2, you're implying kind of negative 10% in
the back half to get to your guide. So...

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So Patrick will add the math. I would suggest, and we are suggesting or forecast that's not going to
happen. And I think one of the key drivers is new -- or nonresidential construction starts. They have been
down 28% for the last 4 quarters, and that is clearly a driver of our business. That's got to be in place to
get that type of ramp.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

So Jeff, keep in mind, going into Q2 last year, we're coming off a record quarter Q1 2020. Backlogs were
really, really healthy, both on discretionary new construction, projects that were started were kind of still
being completed. Some of them may have been delayed and pushed out during the back half of the year.
So you still have a real tough comp on non-res, okay? New construction, it begins to improve year-over-
year and sequentially. But by Q2, it's still going to be, on non-resi now, okay, not residential, on non-resi
still kind of be tough. Okay? We didn't have plant shutdowns like we did in residential business in Q2.

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Dave, just on a bit of a snap-the-line update versus where you were kind of 3 or 6 months ago. I think the
expectation was that when we get into the second half, folks will be back in some of these institutions or
offices and will drive some retrofit activity. It sounds like some of that is starting to percolate a bit quicker,
but I guess, one, am I reading that right? And two, is that something that could show up as soon as 2Q? I
know there's still plenty of chop in the new side of the market, but just versus that prior expectation of a
second half improvement in non-resi retrofit.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I want to be very clear, beginning mid-March and through today, we saw an uplift in wholesale and CHD
demand that we believe is part of an air pocket that we saw 12 months earlier. Preventive maintenance,
small projects were delayed, and that's come back, and we're very pleased to see that. It was a little
earlier. I think the results of the vaccination success we're having here in the U.S. has driven that and
overall confidence. So feel good about that.

We added to Allegion's commercial and institutional backlog in the Americas during the period. And we
continue to believe that will -- that demand will continue. I think the challenge is that new construction
backlog, which the projects are complete, I think it's evident in the starts data that comes out of Dodge,
and we just got to work through that. I think we've got a reasonable view on it. Again, market demand
was better than we anticipated in Q1, reasonably better. It's still softer than it was a year ago.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just to follow up on that. And I think this sort of gets to what Jeff was
asking as well. I guess there's still plenty of uncertainty on new construction, and you sort of prefaced
with your answer just now that the non-res new backlog is still lower. But is it lower than what you
would have thought a few months ago? I guess that would sort of imply some higher level of conversion.
So I guess, that's always possible. But it sounds like the market itself is doing better from an orders
perspective. So just trying to balance that maybe heightened caution on the backlog comment even
though I don't know if anything has really changed for you.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would say the new construction activity is performing as we would anticipate, and we see the benefits
of that really rolling in into '22. And it's the nature of the beast. I would also emphasize this. However
the market performs on the retrofit, small project and new construction, I believe that we've made the
investments here that will continue to beat the market.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. That's helpful color, and congrats on a good quarter.

David D. Petratis

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just following up a little bit more on the non-res comments. If starts inflect positive here shortly, when
could we expect the new construction business to bottom? And then just any color you could provide on
the R&R trajectory embedded in the 2021 guidance.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would say if starts inflect, and we believe they'll gain momentum as we go through the year, you really
see the benefits of that in '22 because dirt in the ground today does not mean revenues for Allegion
tomorrow. This is a long-cycle nature. Most building projects have a 12- to 18-month duration, especially
in our sweet spots. And that's how I paint it. I'm extremely encouraged by the uplift of our specification
activity and the broader indices. And I think, couple that with the stimulus, we feel good about where this
business is going.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Appreciate that, all that color. And then just kind of following up. So non-res has been running at a low
double digit or down low double digits for the last 3 quarters. Can you provide any color on the under-the-
surface movements between new construction, which kind of based on your lag comment, seemed like it
would be continually getting worse through at least Q1? And just any mix there between new construction
and R&R, just the under-the-surface movement.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

As you know, we don't really give specific guidance associated with the breakdown in those kind of
end markets. But I would characterize it this way, that continued pressure as we kind of continue to go
through '21 relative to new construction year-over-year, but getting sequentially better in the back half
of the year, i.e., as we progress, the rate of decline becomes less. The repair/retrofit was the first area
that kind of saw the decline last year. And that will start to hopefully improve in the back half of the year,
year-over-year. But keep in mind, the new construction part of our nonresidential business is roughly 65%
relative to -- or compared to the discretionary in total.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I appreciate that...

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would also suggest, just a little bit more color on that, the range of capabilities that Allegion has today,
opening price point, mid price point and full price point in terms of our commercial and institutional
offerings is significantly better than it was in the last downturn. We're seeing that growth. We're flexing
our strength in the channel to make sure if $1 is available for revenue, that we get more than our fair
share of that.

Operator

The next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

First off, can you just talk about the supply chain pressures you're seeing? And is this risk manageable? Or
are you expecting to see a revenue impact in '21?

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Chairman, CEO & President

So our record speaks for ourselves here. I think the Allegion supply chain has performed exceptionally
through the last 5 quarters. It's because of a strategic choice that we make to produce in region, and it's
benefiting us in a lot of ways. There are clear and obvious pressures, particularly on electronics. And we're
certainly adapting to those. There could be some shutdowns in terms of we're not able to produce specific
products.

With that in mind, we were very aggressive early to put in long-term orders to secure our supply chains.
We've got tight vendor relations. And again, my confidence is, yes, we can be affected, but we will
navigate it better than the competition.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

And I would add that the current guide assumes that we're going to help mitigate the impact of the
inefficiencies. I feel good about that, where we stand today. However, continued pressure there does
create inefficiencies to the extent we're unable to procure the appropriate supplies needed to produce the
products. And so it kind of remains to be seen, but we're managing through it. Some of our product lines,
particularly electronics, are hand to mouth, and it does create inefficiencies, but we're working through
those issues.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would -- 40 years of dealing with this type of thing, we made moves early that will help us, and
extremely proud of our supply team and what they've done to mitigate a variety of issues. And we were
well out ahead of this, and I think we'll come out of it stronger.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. All right. And then just quickly, great to hear the non-res rentals coming back. Is that a broad-
based comment? Or is it just happening in certain sectors today?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I think if you go across the geographies, we see stronger activity, particularly in the Southeast Texas.
You can kind of look at where COVID come -- had harder hits or where shutdowns have been harder. It
reflects the strength. As you go into the different segments, think about -- were you completing your
preventive maintenance list at any hospital in the United States over the last 15 months? I would suggest
the answer is no. College campus is similar. And we see confidence in our wholesale distribution orders,
incoming orders, and it's going into those segments that have really been battered in their ability just to
meet the needs of their customers.

Operator

The next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

First, just quickly on International. Again, congratulations on the numbers. You've explained them. I'd love
to give Tim all the credit, but of course, I won't yet. But I do want to know what his game plan is or what
the game plan is for getting what -- in general, for getting International essentially moving so that the --
so that currency and other factors are not what we're going to be talking about in 2 to 3 years, but the --
but gains in market share, et cetera. Because obviously, having International move forward is just another
quiver in your growth cap.

ALLEGION PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Chairman, CEO & President

So Tim does have a lot of instant talent, and we give him great kudos in the first 90 days. Jeff, there's
been a tremendous amount of work that's gone on in that business over the last couple of years. And
one is, I talked about the restructuring. Significant investment and prioritization around Interflex and
SimonsVoss, really nice growth over the last 6 quarters. Interflex and SimonsVoss performed exceptionally
during the pandemic, and I think that momentum will continue.

As you think about strategic priorities for Tim, it's to continue that growth and expand the cloud and
technical capabilities. You know better than others that SimonsVoss really thrives on what we call active
technologies. Driving more investment that goes into some of the passive areas will help fuel those -- their
growth, which could include also acquisition. But we like that SimonsVoss, Interflex.

I think second important for Tim is we acquired the Gainsborough asset. That's well positioned. We
launched the first electronic Trilock in the region. And we think we're well positioned to be with new -- in
the new build and the DIY to see nice growth as that residential market recovers in Gainsborough.

I think, third, what has been surprising to Tim in his first 90 days is the opportunity to export more
capability from the Americas, which he has more knowledge than anybody in the company and -- so
looking forward to taking some of the real strengths we have here in the Americas and helping our
international partners grow even faster.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Okay. My follow-up question quickly is, and maybe the answer may not be so quick, is just underneath
your level, I would say, or perhaps down a level from where you folks operate, we're seeing a shift, a
small shift in growth from away from video and toward, we'll call it -- you want to call it software-based
access control, everything from, obviously, NFC to Bluetooth to ultra-high frequency as well as just power
over Ethernet, which you folks know a little bit about.

And what we're also seeing is, simply put, a gain in software as a driver as opposed to hardware as a
driver in getting into access control. And with access control, let's say, becoming a faster growth area
than even video, and we've seen some crazy valuations in the venture and private equity markets for
some of these companies that are getting involved in areas that are either adjacent to you or actually may
compete with you, from intercoms all the way to SaaS-based things, what is the company looking at in
terms of trying to make sure that it both protects its flank and grows this business?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I would describe it as one of the most exciting opportunities that I've seen in my 40 years of industrial
participation. The company has been invested heavily and increased our investment as we went through
the pandemic. The Yonomi acquisition would be reflective. But if you looked under the covers and saw the
growth of our investments in Bangalore and our engineering capabilities, since I create -- since we created
Allegion, we've tripled the feet on the street there to be able to position ourselves more strongly in the
connectivity and the software elements.

Third, Jeff, would be the venture activity. And you see some of the investments, Kasa, Mint House,
Openpath. I don't believe we -- our strategy has been to be in the fast lanes to -- with new technology to
be able to observe, learn, partner, invest, potentially own. Yonomi went through that entire cycle. I think
we continue to sharpen our position, and I like our opportunities to be able to participate in the world of
seamless access that you described.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

All right. Great. Look forward to interacting with you guys in the future.
