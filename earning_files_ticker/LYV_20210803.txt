Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer
of Live Nation Entertainment. Please go ahead, sir.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As communities reopen, we're seeing the pent-up demand
for live events play out as artists and fans are eager to reconnect in person. In the U.S. and U.K., we're
seeing strong ticket sales and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekends
by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K. hosting 750,000 fans combined.
With vaccine rollouts increasing throughout Canada and Europe, we expect additional markets to open up
broadly in the coming months.

And momentum for the return of live has been building every month, with ticket sales and concert
attendance pacing faster than expected, underscoring the strength and resilience of the concert business
and live events in general. This progress, combined with our cost discipline, has enabled us to deliver
positive AOI for the second quarter, well ahead of where we thought we would be for this quarter. We
expect to see further ramp-up accelerate through the rest of the year, with all segments returning to AOI
profitability for the second half of the year, setting us up for a full-scale 2022.

As we put more shows on sale for this year and next, ticket sales are the best early indicator for concerts
in our overall business. To that end, June was Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month in history
for transacted ticket volume. This was driven in part by our U.S. concert division putting the highest
number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019.

In concerts, our recovery this summer continue to be led by our outdoor events at our festivals and
amphitheaters. We expect to have over 6 million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the
year, with about 2/3 of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019. Most of our major
festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019. And while
still early, at our amphitheater shows over the past few weeks, we have delivered strong double-digit
increase in average per fan revenue and on-site spending versus 2019.

Looking forward to 2022 and now 2023, all our leading indicators continue to point to a roaring era for
concerts and other live events. Starting with our concerts division, every major venue type, arenas,
amphitheaters and stadiums, have pipeline indicating double-digit growth in our show count and ticket

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

sales relative to 2019 levels. In some cases, our pipeline is so strong, we are extending our planning into
2023 and even beginning to discuss tours that extend into 2024.

At the same time, Ticketmaster's leading-edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding 11
million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth. As a
result, Ticketmaster is set to benefit in 2022 from both increased Live Nation concert ticket sales as well
as additional sales from new clients.

In our sponsorship business, our brand partners have maintained and grown their interest in live events,
with contracted sponsorship up double digits for 2022 from where we were at this point in 2019 for 2020.

As our revenue is rebounding, we continue to evolve our business to maximize opportunities from the
global recovery and strengthen our flywheel. We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million,
making us more nimble in converting more of our revenue to AOI. We have integrated our Ticketmaster
team globally, enabling us to work toward a global product road map that will both reduce our costs and
increase our flexibility and speed to deploy new client tools and improve our marketplace experience.

We continue to build our direct-to-consumer business with initiatives ranging from streaming concerts
to NFTs to artist merchandise, bringing more value to artists and deepening fan relationships. These
enhancements, combined with our strongest supply and demand dynamics our industry has ever seen, are
fueling our core flywheel strategy and setting us up for multiple years of growth in attendance revenue
and AOI.

And with that, I'll let Joe take you through more details of our results.

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some
tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to
today.

In the second quarter, our AOI was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic as the U.S.,
by far our largest market, accelerated its reopening, also driving our revenue to the highest level since the
first quarter of last year. As a result, our contribution margin ramped up faster than expected, particularly
in ticketing. Even with the increased activity, our monthly gross burn for the first half of the year was
lower than the monthly burn during the last 3 quarters of 2020 due to our structural cost savings and
continued cost discipline.

As a result, we remain confident that actions taken to reduce cash burn and increase liquidity will provide
us with the runway we need as shows return. And as we move toward reopening in more markets, we
continue to balance the strong cost and cash management with making the necessary investments to
grow the business. While we expect to generate positive AOI overall and for each segment for the second
half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5
billion relative to pre-pandemic plans.

Looking at our Q2 results. Revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second
quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion. All 3 of our business segments more than doubled their
revenues from last year.

Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of
2020. Our Q2 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from
operations, along with various onetime items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government
support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out. This was then offset by $341 million in
operational fixed costs.

Getting into our business segments a bit deeper, starting with Ticketing, which was the primary driver of
our results this quarter. Contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total
contribution margin, delivering $99 million in AOI.

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter.
Each month of the quarter, Ticketmaster had progressively stronger results, culminating with June being
Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month ever for transacted ticket volume. In general, North
America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter
as compared to approximately 2/3 of transacted tickets for 2019.

Concert tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million
in GTV during the second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019.
Secondary ticketing has similarly rebounded. Our June GTV was only 8% below June of 2019. That trend
has continued into the third quarter, with July 12 marking the highest resale GTV day in our history, driven
by the U.S. Open along with strong NBA, NFL and concert resale volumes. These results in ticketing are a
leading indicator to our concerts business.

For the second quarter, our concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative
to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year as we promoted nearly 1,700
shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter. More importantly, these ticket sales drove our event-related
deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity even higher than the $1.6
billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019.

In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our
concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have
already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show
count and fans relative to 2019.

Sponsorship and advertising then naturally flow from our ticketing and concert platforms. Our sponsorship
and advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our
activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales. We continue to find brands that are committed
to maintaining or increasing their spend with Live Nation to reach our music fans and other live event
audiences. And during the quarter, we added several long-term strategic partners, including Allegiant Air,
Adobe and cinch in the airline, technology and auto sectors, respectively. And more broadly, we expect our
sponsorship and advertising full-scale activity to return somewhere between ticketing and concerts timing.

Most importantly, as we look out at our 2022 pipeline, confirmed activity is pacing well ahead of where
we were in 2019 at this point. And with many multiyear contracts on the books, we are lining up to be
growing this business in 2022 and beyond.

Looking at free cash and liquidity. As of June 30, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in
ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion.
This was flat relative to our first quarter reported number. Our free cash, along with $971 million of
available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of
2020 and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity. Benefiting our free cash position in the second quarter was
$161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue
between short term and long term.

Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115
million per month of operational burn, up from $100 million per month in the first quarter as furloughed
employees returned to prepare for our reopening and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus
another $58 million per month of nonoperational cash costs, including investment in capital expenditures,
acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances, to give us $173 million average per month in gross
burn. And in Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1
average.

Turning to other balance sheet items. More on deferred revenue. At the end of the second quarter, event-
related deferred revenue for shows that will play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5
billion at the end of the first quarter. Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while
refunds totaled $100 million, and a shift to deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows
that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022 totaled $150 million. This long-term deferred revenue

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

will then largely shift back to short term during Q3 and Q4, reversing the timing benefit in free cash this
quarter.

Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first 6 months, with $38 million spent on revenue-
generating items. The markets have reopened faster than expected. We will similarly be accelerating some
of our investments to take advantage of additional opportunities this year and into 2022. As a result, we
now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of the
spend going into revenue-generating CapEx projects.

Our total debt as of June 30 was $5.3 billion. And our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about
90% of that debt at a fixed rate.

Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale further in the second
half of this year in key markets, notably outdoor and led by the U.S. and U.K. With this activity, we will
continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its on-sales, the concerts division to
book and market 2022 tours and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands on site and online. Given
the COVID issues in our key markets appear to be short term at this point, we continue to expect 2022
activity and results to exceed 2019 levels, with continued growth opportunities from there.
With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.

David Karnovsky
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just with COVID kind of being what it is at the moment and the Delta variant, can you just maybe talk
through how you're thinking about navigating some of the challenges that might come up in the next
month or 2 like changing health mandates, shifts in demand, any hesitation or concerns on the part of the
artists?

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Sure, David. This is Joe. I think what we're seeing is a shift to increasing requirements for entry of
either vaccinated or tested or fully vaccinated. We had that at Lollapalooza over the last weekend, very
successfully done. Over 90% of the people were fully vaccinated, which I think was a great signal in terms
of people's commitment and support of being vaccinated in order to go to these shows. So my expectation
is that we will see that continue, whether at the artist level, at the city level like New York just announced,
or they're large crowds. Frankly, Lollapalooza certainly went above and beyond what was happening at
baseball games in Chicago. And similarly, I think in other markets, we're going above what others are
doing.

So we'll continue to focus on that. I think the great news is that at this point, the discussion is around
what are the requirements to hold the events, what do we need to see in terms of vaccinations and
testing. Not hearing discussions certainly in the U.S. or the U.K. about impacting those shows to any scale.

David Karnovsky
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And I know you just restarted at the events and the festivals, but any early insights in the fan
behavior so far? You mentioned per caps are up at the amps. Is there any additional color you can provide
on what's driving that? And then maybe with digital ticketing, any learnings from having that tech kind of
rolled out at scale across your own music venue footprint?

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Yes. At this point, we've probably done about 50 amp shows that we've gotten the data on in time for
today's call. And as we said, all of that looks to be continuing to trend up. People are buying more food
and beverage. We're selling more VIP packages, more upsells. So in general, the pocket books are open.
I think it's premature to get any real specific inferences. And I think it's also just -- it's a little bit early to
get the specific impact of digital ticketing. We believe that eliminating friction always helps commerce, but
we probably won't have the data on that until our next call.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen Neild Laszczyk
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

On the 2022 concert pipeline being up double digits versus 2019, I was wondering if you could give us a
sense on how much of the pipeline is for sale today or sold today versus how much is still to come? And
then as you maybe look out over the next few quarters, how much headroom do you think is left to grow

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

the concert slate in 2022 given some of the scheduling and health constraints you're working with? Any
commentary there would be helpful.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

We have most of our - so I'll start, Joe, and then you jump. Most of our 2022 new tours wouldn't be on
sale yet. Most of what you see on sale is what would have been rescheduled from '21 or are already on
sale. So we have a large on-sale slate plan between now and end of the year for most of the big global
tours that will go out in '22. And we're not -- we're very content with our '22 lineup right now. We're
talking mostly about what to add now into '23 and '24. So that idea that it's just 1 year of bigness isn't
really true. We've got 3, 4 years here of strong demand that we're going to smooth out over the time so
everyone can get the right markets and the right Friday nights and the right date. So we see a good few
year run with all this pent-up inventory.

Stephen Neild Laszczyk
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then on the Ticketmaster side, I know you mentioned you added 11 million
net new fee-bearing tickets year-to-date. I think that was up from around 5 million last quarter. I was
wondering if you could talk a little bit about who you're winning this ticket business from. Is there certain
types of venues, league teams, maybe some of the things that's resonating with your pitch with these --
the potential ticketing partners?

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Yes. It's really happening on a global basis. We're seeing it in the U.S. We're seeing it in Europe. We're
seeing it in Asia. We put out various releases in terms of -- as we've been picking up some clients. But I
wouldn't say that there's one market or one type of client in particular. It's pretty broad. I do think what's
resonating is we've been very loud in terms of articulating the extent to which we're continuing to invest
in ticketing, in the shift to digital ticketing and the benefit that that's going to be giving to the teams, the
venues and the customers. And that seems to be working with the clients we're talking to.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Wolfe Research.

John Janedis
Wolfe Research, LLC

I just had 2 questions. One was with the expectations for the touring super cycle over the next, call it, 2
to 3 years, can you talk about how you're thinking about the demand side in terms of fans? And do you
assume sellouts through the cycle are at pre-pandemic levels or maybe higher or lower? And then on the
ticketing margin side, there was a lift there. Is that a chunk of the $200 million in cost savings kicking in?
And is something close to that level of new normal? Or are there any items to call out?

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

On the demand side, I think we -- from the data we're seeing so far, everything we seem to be putting
on sale is doing better than pre-pandemic. So demand seems to be pent up. Most of what we see going
up for '22 is great quality tours and artists. So we would expect, as we've seen over the last 10 years,
demand overall for live on a global basis has continually been growing.

We like to always point out we think that the product is still underpriced given all of the secondary
business. So this is still an attractive night out for a fan. Now that artist is traveling more around the
world, the fan base has grown for live as a functional entertainment item. So we think global demand
will continue to have double-digit growth as an industry for many years to come as the global landscape
continues to grow.

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

And then, John, on the TM margin, I mean, clearly, I spoke in my comments that we're looking this year
that we're going to be reducing our total cost structure by about $800 million relative to where we were
pre-pandemic. And the $200 million structural savings is a subset of that. So what we're navigating this
year is the pace at which we bring back some of the costs versus the pace at which we ramp up activity.
And it's not going to be totally linear. We had a great month of June in TM, and we're finally getting back
to scale there. And we expect to have nice scale with Ticketmaster in the second half, but the first part of
the year was lower scale.

So overall, yes, we expect margins to improve because a large chunk of that $200 million is going to come
out of Ticketmaster, and that would just naturally flow into a margin. I wouldn't try to overly analyze the
single quarter and let's get you a few more quarters at more traditional scale with more traditional costs
and staffing over the next 6 months.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.

Brandon A Ross
LightShed Partners

A couple of questions ago, the conversation centered around ticketing wins and press releases for you
guys. And I thought one of the more interesting developments in the quarter was the extension and
expansion of your relationship with ASM for 2 reasons. One is that ASM is obviously half AEG and it didn't
go to AXS, but more so, that Ticketmaster could sell tickets for Live Nation promoted shows in the other
ASM venues. And the North American ticket model has been exclusive for as long as I can remember at
least. Is this a sign of change in the future? Do you think that exclusivity model is here to stay? Or do you
think depending on event type, the promoter will ultimately control the ticket?

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Yes. I think the exclusive approach has worked well for the venues, and the ecosystem is a large part of
how the venues get funded and how the venues then make the rental costs approachable for promoters
and artists. So it's an ecosystem that's worked well in the U.S., and the Ticketmaster, as you know, has
been a very large source of funding and the profit stream for the venues.

I wouldn't read too much into this. If you look at ASM's scale, that's not a common typical scale in terms
of the number of buildings they have. It's also a fairly unique situation where you have somebody who
owns buildings who's saying we're going to let you bring in Ticketmaster regardless of the situation and
they control both sides of that decision-making. It's not something that we are looking to do or that we
see as any real mark of the industry going forward.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

But I would add, Brandon, I think the most -- Brandon, I would say the most important thing you said
is what you led with, is the fact that ASM owned by AEG and a private equity fund, the largest venue
management company, obviously did their homework and debated their own ticket options and renewed
with Ticketmaster because we ultimately provide the best global solution in ticketing for them. I assume
they would have liked to have used their own in-house ticketing system. But I think our relationship and
what we've done for all those venues for so long won us that business and that renewal.

So that was a very important renewal, a very good testament to Ticketmaster. I give the ASM
management team credit. They put their bias aside and went with the best option in the marketplace after
looking at all options. So we are very proud that that's a very good testament to the Ticketmaster core
competency. You hit that part for sure.

And you can update your Twitter now that we've talked about COVID and Delta. We assumed it would
happen on this call.

Operator

I apologize. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.

Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Yes, Ben. Big buildup.

Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. I better not blow it. A couple of questions. Joe, you ended your prepared remarks, I think, by saying
you continue to expect 2022 activity levels to exceed 2019. And I apologize if that's a reiteration of
prior guidance that I might have missed. But I just wanted to ask you what you meant by that. Is that a
comment about revenue and AOI? I know where the Street expectations are, but I thought I'd give you a
chance to maybe expand on that.

And then my second question is just you made a helpful comment around sponsorship, saying that I think
contracted business is up double digits for '22 relative to where you were in '19 for '20. I guess a similar
question on the ticketing question. How much of the forward year is sort of already in the books typically?
Just trying to understand what that tells us about next year and make sure we don't over-extrapolate that
comment about growth for sponsorship.

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Yes. Just in terms of overall '22 expectations first, it starts for us with what are the concert bookings,
what do the show count look like, and from that, our expectations on the ticket counts, both of which, we
think, again, are up relative to 2019 based on what we said. And I think as we've gone through the past
3 months, whatever we said 3 months ago, we're more confident in that at this point. And as a result, we
expect then revenue and AOI growth relative to 2019 as well.

And sponsorship then would be a part of that expectation, up double digits in committed sponsorship.
Usually, you'd have -- I mean we've talked about how much of our sponsorship is in the form of multiyear,
multimillion-dollar, multi-asset strategic sponsors. That's a large portion of our sponsorship base. So you
know us, we probably wouldn't be talking about expectations of growth for next year already at this point
unless we had a pretty good feel that a lot of it was committed.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

David Katz, if you're on the line, can you go ahead and ask your question? I think you're next in the
queue. You can hear us?

Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I appreciate all the detail. What I wanted to ask about since it is prevalent in a lot of other areas of our
coverage is the issue of human resources and labor, where we have seen a lot of constraints around,
frankly, getting people to come back to work. You made a comment about it in your prepared remarks,
about bringing people back at full salaries and so forth. Is that a matter that you have had to deal with
workaround, strategize around? And how do you see it?

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Yes. What I'd start with is unfortunately, we had to furlough a reasonable number of people over the
course of last year. At this point, we've brought back over 90% of our furloughed staff. Of those we've
called back, over 90% have returned. Furlough, we had a fairly low turnover rate. We think turnover rate
at or below the overall entertainment industry. So we feel very good about how we've been able to retain
staff. I think it's a testimony to people's commitment to our industry and the culture that we built here.

So in terms of the core people, they are the ones that we've talked about bringing back the shows,
bringing back the ticketing and the sponsorship. Those people are in place. As we've put on our shows in
various amphitheaters and festival sites around the country and around the world, we've been able to get
the volume of people we needed. It hasn't been a material cost impact, taking in total, and we've had to
work a bit harder at times to find the people, but it has not impacted our ability to put on the shows.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

And I would add to that, I think the only piece that we're working through right now is the -- all of the
part-time employees that are on the front of the line at the amphitheater, at the festival, we're going to
be rolling out soon our kind of mandated vaccine for our employees. We're going to move forward and be
very progressive on ensuring all our employees are vaccinated. And we're going to move more with artists
and managers, where we're seeing the likes of these artists that are going to want fully vaccinated and
tested shows as ways to continue to keep the show moving forward.

So I think the biggest challenge we've had is just scrambling on a day-to-day basis with part-time
employees back and abiding by different local COVID laws, mask, no mask, now test, no test. I think
that's been our only real challenge from an HR and a communication. So hats off to my front line. They're
doing an incredible job, running hard, trying to adjust. And we're going to move to more central protocols
now on mandating the vaccine and helping them out and ensure they're all safe, too.

Well, you still have the best earnings call music, so if that means anything. I'd say I just had a question on
-- could you discuss how much of the ticketing GTV was tied to sports versus concerts in the quarter and
how you see that mix over the second half of the year?

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

Yes. Those are certainly the 2 largest components, concerts and sports, and will again in the second half
as we relaunch -- second half, relaunch NBA, NHL, NFL, all of those at scale. So you'll have a big full
season of the 3 major sports. And at the same time, you're going to have a massive on sale for 2022. Like
I wouldn't try to parse exactly which one is bigger than the other in a given month, but those 2 will be the
2 key drivers as they were in the past few months.

Stephen William Glagola
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And I don't know if you already said this, so I apologize. But on the guidance for AOI profitability
across every segment in the second half, is that for each quarter? Or is that just the sum of Q3 and Q4?

Joe Berchtold
President & CFO

We just -- our comment was for the sum of Q3 and Q4 that each segment, we expect to be AOI positive.

Operator
