Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded, Friday, August 7,
2020. Thank you.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Frank Boykin. Mr. Boykin, you may begin your conference.

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Erica. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor
conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's second quarter results.

I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may
include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our
press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This call may include discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP
amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website.

With regards to our recent litigation and related investigations, our Audit Committee, with assistance from
outside legal counsel and forensic accountants, has substantially completed its internal investigation.
The company has appropriately filed its Form 10-Q for the second quarter. The company continues to
cooperate fully with the government inquiries. Beyond that, we refer you to the disclosure in the 10-Q and
remind you, we cannot comment further.

I'll now turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Frank.

For the second quarter, at the height of the COVID disruption, our sales were down 21% as reported or
19% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating income for the period was $36 million or 2% of
sales, and our adjusted EPS was $0.37. During the period, our cost-reduction initiatives, working capital
reductions and lower capital spending generated free cash flow of almost $500 million. Though sales
trends have improved significantly since government restrictions were lifted, the current environment
is the most unpredictable in the history of our business as the pandemic has affected our markets and
operations around the world.

During the quarter, all of our businesses were dramatically impacted, with most of our customers and
facilities operating either in a limited capacity or completely shut down for some time. Residential
remodeling was impacted by retail shops closing and consumers staying at home. Commercial has
declined as business have postponed their projects due to economic uncertainty. U.S. housing starts and
homebuilder confidence improved sharply in June as the market rebounded.

In the period, our operations were curtailed or stopped by government mandates, employee concerns and
lack of demand. We responded to these challenges by keeping our workforce safe, cutting expenses and
investments and furloughing employees. In the U.S., government programs provided tax credits to our
business. Federal unemployment supplements have made attracting workers more difficult. Outside the
U.S., many governments subsidize businesses to keep workers employed and others required companies
to continue paying employees that were not working in full.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

After the company's sales bottomed in April, our May and June results appreciably improved across the
segments as stay-at-home restrictions were gradually lifted, consumers initiated remodeling projects,
stores reopened and construction increased. Through the period, our markets improved more than we
expected, and our shipments exceeded our production rates, reducing our inventories. Our manufacturing
levels were impacted by government restrictions, COVID disruptions and employee absenteeism across
the enterprise.

At this time, our visibility of the future continues to be uncertain due to persistent COVID spread, the
unknown strength of the economic recovery. Some near-term factors represent a potential upside,
including: historically low interest rates, rising remodeling activity, consumer discretionary funds
being shifted to home improvements and increasing home purchases. Alternately, potential changes in
government policies, consumer and business spending and higher COVID infection rates could reduce
demand around the world, particularly the government's increased restrictions. Given these factors, our
business plans must remain flexible to quickly adjust our production levels.

We are restructuring the business to enhance our results and future performance. We're reducing SG&A,
our headcount and lower-performing products and SKUs. We are closing less-efficient operations and
investing in more productive equipment. The largest of these changes are in the United States where
LVT sales growth and a strong dollar have impacted many of our businesses. We anticipate these actions
will deliver annual savings of approximately $110 million to $120 million, with an estimated cost of $170
million, of which $44 million will be in cash. Many of these actions are currently being executed with those
affecting our manufacturing costs having to flow through our inventory. It will take much of next year to
complete these initiatives and capture the full benefit.

Our business is well positioned with a strong balance sheet and deep liquidity. We've recently issued over
$1 billion of new bonds to enhance our ability to strategically invest and better position Mohawk for the
long term. We're taking the right steps to manage through the pandemic, and we remain focused on
delivering innovative products, exceptional value and superior service. Our talented people are devoted
to making Mohawk the best flooring supplier to our customers, improving our business in all areas and
maximizing our results.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank for our second quarter results.

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Jeff.

Sales for the quarter were $2.050 billion, down 21% as reported, but decreased 19% on a constant basis
as the pandemic and related recession significantly impacted our business. Our gross margin was 18% as
reported or 21.4%, excluding charges, compared to 28.8% last year. The year-over-year decrease was
driven primarily by lower volume, shutdown costs, negative price/mix and unfavorable productivity, offset
by deflation. The actual amounts of all of these items is included in the 10-Q that was filed yesterday.

SG&A as reported was $431 million or 21% of sales, and 19.7% compared to 18.1%, both of which
exclude charges. It was down $63 million or 13%, excluding charges, primarily from savings in furloughs,
layoffs and government support. Other unusual charges were $97 million, of which $29 million was cash,
primarily related to the $170 million cost-reduction initiative that Jeff just mentioned. We are adjusting our
capacity by closing inefficient operations as well as consolidating some others, reducing the workforce and
streamlining our SKUs. We estimate annual savings of approximately $110 million to $120 million when
complete.

Our operating margin, excluding charges, was 1.7% compared to 10.7% last year. The decline was
driven by weaker volume, shutdown costs and unfavorable price/mix, partially offset by productivity and
deflation. Our decremental margin was 45% for the quarter and resulted from sales dropping faster than
cost. Our third quarter operating margin is expected to improve sequentially from the second quarter, but
will be lower than last year with pressure on pricing and product mix along with higher manufacturing
cost.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

Looking at income taxes. On a non-GAAP basis, we had no tax expense in the second quarter. Going
forward, the rate could vary significantly in the next 2 quarters between 16% and 22% due to changes in
profit before tax and/or geographic dispersion of income. Our earnings per share, excluding charges, came
in at $0.37 compared to $2.89 last year.

Turning to the segments. In the Ceramic segment, we had sales of $753 million, down 21% as reported,
with the business down 19% on a constant basis. The Russian business performed best, with new
construction and owned retail shops driving performance. Our operating margin, excluding charges, was
0.5% compared to 12.3% last year. The decline was driven by higher shutdown costs and unfavorable
volume and price/mix, offset by increased productivity. In Ceramic, we expect the cost of our restructuring
initiative to be $80 million.

In the Flooring North American segment, sales were $800 million, down 19% as reported as laminate
performed best with its waterproof features and DIY installation appealing to consumers. Our operating
loss margin, excluding charges, was a negative 2.2% compared to 6.7% last year. The decrease in
earnings was driven by lower volume and productivity as well as shutdown costs, offset partially
by deflation. We are estimating restructuring costs of $54 million in this segment as we consolidate
production and distribution assets, close high-cost plants and reduce our workforce.

In the Rest of World segment, sales were $496 million, down 23% as reported and decreased by 20%
on a constant basis. Sales in the segment declined more rapidly in April but improved more quickly later
in the quarter. Our operating margin, excluding charges, was 11.9% compared to 16.4% last year. The
main drivers were lower volume and shutdown costs, partially offset by productivity and deflation. As we
streamline our product offering and reduce staffing levels over the next few quarters, we will incur cost of
$36 million in this segment.

Our Corporate and Eliminations segment had an operating loss of $10 million, and we are expecting a total
loss for the year of $39 million.

Jumping to the balance sheet. Cash for the quarter was $738 million and includes the remaining proceeds
from the 2 bond offerings earlier this year after paying down outstanding commercial paper. Receivables
were $1.586 billion with days sales outstanding at 64 days compared to 59 last year. Inventories were
$1.922 billion and dropped almost $450 million or 19% from last year as all businesses made significant
cuts to their inventory. Inventory days were flat with last year at 126 days. Our fixed assets were $4.435
billion and included in the quarter capital expenditures of $81 million and depreciation and amortization of
$154 million.

In the second quarter, we cut our estimated annual estimated capital expenditures by $150 million to
$400 million. We're in the process of evaluating the amount going forward based on changing economic
conditions. Our D&A is estimated for the full year at $585 million.

Going to long-term debt, the balance sheet and cash flow both remained strong with total debt at $2.7
billion and leverage at 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our ratings all remain unchanged at BBB+ or
Baa1.

I will now turn the call over to Chris to go through the segment results in more detail. Chris?

William Christopher Wellborn
President, COO & Director

Thank you, Frank.

In the Global Ceramic segment, all of our businesses around the world were impacted by government
reactions to the pandemic. Within the segment, Southern Europe and Mexico implemented the most
dramatic regulations suspending commerce and our operations for extended periods of time. To improve
our performance, we are reducing our cost and complexity and aligning production with demand. While all
of our businesses have improved, future demand is uncertain, and we will respond as conditions change.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

In the U.S. ceramic market, many of our retail customers were closed for some time. While construction
continued in most markets, the Northeast and Midwest regions were most impacted during the period due
to greater state restrictions. For example, our ceramic manufacturing in Pennsylvania was closed for an
extended time, along with most of our customers in that region. To manage this situation, we reduced cost
across the business, including furloughs to decrease our overhead, cutting marketing activity, deferring
product introductions and controlling manufacturing and distribution costs.

Demand increased faster than we anticipated, and our inventories declined as we ramped up production.
Presently, all of our U.S. plants are operating and our service level is improving. Our new click ceramic tile
is being delivered to our customers and sales should increase throughout the year. Our new countertop
facility in Tennessee has become profitable and will improve with higher volume and mix. We have begun
producing higher-value products with more stylized colors and veining. Our new B2B systems are making
product selection, ordering and picking up faster and safer for our customers and employees. We have
implemented measures that exceed CDC guidelines to keep our workforce safe.

Given pressures on the U.S. ceramic industry, we are consolidating manufacturing into our most advanced
facilities and closing our least-efficient assets. We are combining some of our sales service centers
where they overlap in local markets. With lower commercial activity, we are refocusing our sales efforts
to broaden our position in new home construction. We are taking out lower-volume SKUs to reduce
complexity and improve our cost. We have made permanent staffing reductions to reduce our fixed cost
and align with current demand.

The Mexican economy has declined significantly, impacting employment, retail and construction. Our
manufacturing operations in Mexico are currently running but were limited during the second quarter
under government orders. During this time, we were required to pay our workforce without any
government assistance. All of those plants are currently running and most of our customers are open for
business. To reduce our cost, we are rationalizing our current product offering and aligning our production
and workforce with demand. As the peso has weakened, we are increasing our position in the premium
market to replace imported ceramic and introducing promotional products to increase our sales.

The Brazilian economy is contracting as the COVID pandemic reduces business activity. Interest rates are
at historical lows and government programs to stimulate housing sales are being introduced. Our sales are
improving as retail stores reopen in Brazil's major cities. Our exports have expanded as the local currency
has weakened. With inventories low, we are increasing our production to support local sales and improve
our service. We are further improving our cost structures and reducing our workforce.

Our Southern European ceramic business was impacted during the period by severe lockdowns, especially
within Italy, which was the epicenter of the COVID crisis. Both our customers and our plants were
completely shut down for extended periods. Presently, we have limited cases of the virus due to safety
measures in the local communities and our facilities. As the countries opened up, our sales dramatically
improved. Our Eastern European operations were less affected and demand has improved significantly.
Our European exports to other continents are down substantially as major projects have been postponed
around the world. All of our plants in Europe are ramping up to satisfy demand and service levels should
soon approach our target. Continued government subsidies are being used to manage our ongoing
costs. We are introducing fewer SKUs this year and are paring down less productive ones. As with the
last downturn, we anticipate higher rates of business failures in some of our markets due to their weak
economies.

In Russia, our ceramic business declined significantly when the country locked down. Our strong position
in new construction and our owned and franchised retail stores provided us with better market access
and benefited our business. Sales improved through the quarter and our plants are now operating at
similar rates to last year. We are placing a greater emphasis on the new construction channel which the
government is investing to support the economy.

Our Flooring North America segment sales declined substantially in April and then improved throughout
the quarter as government restrictions were lifted and consumers started shopping and remodeling their
homes. With most home centers remaining open, products such as our premium laminate outperformed
as homeowners undertook new DIY projects. Our inventories declined as sales improved faster than

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

our manufacturing ramped up. Many of our operations are facing challenges increasing production due
to local health concerns in our communities. To enhance the segment's performance, we are reducing
our overhead cost and lowering our SG&A. We are taking out higher-cost manufacturing assets and
consolidating distribution points. We are streamlining our product offering and investing in more efficient
assets to reduce cost.

Our LVT sales improved as government restrictions were gradually lifted across the country. A significant
part of our LVT distribution is through specialty stores, many of which were closed for periods of time.
As our LVT sales improved in the quarter, we are increasing our production, though the spread of the
COVID is creating challenges. We have improved our manufacturing speeds and processes, however, our
progress was slowed because European technicians were unable to travel to the U.S. We are upgrading
our manufactured and sourced LVT offering to provide enhanced visuals and features while reducing
complexity of our collections.

In residential carpet, the new home construction channel performed best with housing improving through
the period. The remodeling category slowed as retail and installation activities were suspended in some
regions. Our mix and pricing declined as the higher-value remodeling channel was more impacted and
lower-priced polyester performed better. We are increasing our production to meet greater demand and
improve our service levels.

The commercial sector continues to be challenged as many businesses are postponing new investments.
The education and government sectors were impacted less and the hospitality channel contracted the
most. We're providing both virtual and local outdoor events to support architects and designers working
remotely. We believe commercial projects will continue to be delayed and the sector will take longer to
recover.

Our rug business was severely impacted during April as many of our retail customers were completely
shut down and their inventories were not replenished. As the period progressed, home centers and mass
merchants rebounded first as consumers used our rugs as an easy way to enhance their homes. E-
commerce continues to grow in its importance as a sales channel for our rug collections. We are increasing
our production to improve our service and meet our customers' needs.

Our laminate business outperformed our other categories as consumers increased DIY projects while
at home. We are operating all of our laminate capacity to satisfy this increased demand. Our unique
technology provides waterproof solutions and superior visuals as alternatives to other hard surfaces.
We are expanding our laminate manufacturing to support our growing market and introduce the next
generation of technology which we are presently selling in Europe.

Flooring Rest of World results continue to outperform our other segments. We were able to take advantage
of more flexible government support as well as cut our expenses across the business. Our laminate and
LVT categories performed the best in the period. As LVT production in China has recovered, our patent
licensing business has followed. As we went through the period, we saw a strong improvement in sales
as stores reopened and replaced their inventories. In this segment, we have a much greater presence in
the residential remodeling, which is performing better than the commercial category. Our Australian and
Russian businesses held up better than Europe due to different government approaches to the pandemic.
Across the segment, we have reduced our overhead costs and are consolidating lower-volume SKUs. We
are now increasing production to meet emerging demand while protecting our employees' health.

Our laminate business outperformed our other products as our waterproof collections and new
introductions are increasing consumer preference for our products. Through our Internet presence, we are
supporting our retailers by expanding their online sales. In Russia, our laminate sales declined less, and
we are increasing the plant's production to satisfy demand in other regions.

Our flexible and rigid LVT sales improved as we progress through the period as retailers reopened in
our key markets. Our manufacturing plants were also impacted and are increasing production to satisfy
growing sales. Our residential sales have recovered more than commercial as businesses have deferred
projects. In Europe, we manufacture almost all of our LVT and is positively contributing to our results. We

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

are continuing to modify our processes to expand our capacity, reduce our cost and introduce new features
into the market.

In Europe, our sheet vinyl is sold primarily through retailers and sales were significantly reduced by store
closures, especially in France and the U.K. As in other categories, our business has recovered, and we
are expanding our production to satisfy our customers. In Russia, our new sheet vinyl plank contributed
positively to our results, and we have broadened our product offering to increase our market share.

Our insulation business was primarily impacted with COVID, with our markets in Ireland and the U.K.
affected the most. When restrictions were lifted, the category rebounded in June as contractors completed
projects already underway. We are expanding our customer base and the geographic reach of our
products. Our wood boards face similar plant disruptions, which impacted both our sales and margins. We
introduced a new virtual showroom and are developing specialty products to improve our mix. The start-
up of our new waste-to-energy plant was delayed due to the pandemic and is in now full operation.

The COVID crisis was handled differently in Australia and had a less detrimental impact on our
performance. The Australian market has largely recovered and we are seeing improved residential carpet
sales. Our European LVT collections were introduced during the period and are expanding our hard surface
sales in the region. This month, we implemented price increases in Australia to offset cost increases.

New Zealand's government enforced one of the most comprehensive lockdowns in response to the
pandemic, resulting in significant sales declines during the quarter. New Zealand's economy is now open
and the virus is currently contained and our sales are improving.

Now I'll return the call back to Jeff.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Chris.

Since April, we have seen substantial improvement in all of our segments and markets. The residential
remodeling and new construction channels have recovered more than commercial, where businesses are
maintaining a cautious approach to investment. Some areas, particularly in the U.S., Brazil and Russia, are
experiencing an increasing level of COVID cases, which are impacting our operational costs and production
levels. Across the business, we're decreasing costs by rationalizing assets, minimizing SG&A, reducing our
workforce and managing our product offering and working capital.

Much uncertainty remains around all of our markets regarding government policies, business confidence
and consumer spending. Our sales in July were approximately flat compared to the prior year, but we
cannot predict how the sales will evolve going forward. Given this, we are unable to provide guidance for
the third quarter, though we anticipate a significant improvement in our results from the second quarter.

We managed through the challenging second quarter while generating significant cash flow, strengthening
our balance sheet and issuing over $1 billion in bonds. We're taking substantial actions to navigate the
changing environment and position Mohawk for the future.
We'll now be glad to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist Securities.

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

In the second quarter, the reduced capacity was a big hit, obviously, in the number, second largest. What
does capacity look like for the third given what you've seen in July? You could do that in dollars year-over-
year, whatever the best way to describe it is.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

So the question is, what's the capacity?

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I mean what kind of capacity rate are you going to be running at? You cut a lot in the second quarter
to get inventory down. What's it going to look like in the third compared to second?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The third quarter, we're running the business at a much higher rate than we were. We're actually trying to
increase the inventories because they decreased too much, but we're having difficulties getting them up
given the labor issues, vacations in Europe and other things. So they're going to run at much higher rates.

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Will you equal the rates in the third quarter of last year?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

It depends on business sector thesis. They're all over the place.

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

One of the end markets, Keith, that's not performing as well as you know is commercial. So to the extent
we've got commercial capacity, it could be running at lower rates than the others.

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And I guess, final question, you talked in the intro about margins being up in the third from the second,
but down year-over-year. Is capacity curtailments the major driver of why it's going to be down year-over-
year or is there something else?

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

We've got several things that we think are going to be impacting us. We'll have pressure on pricing and
we're going to have pressure on product mix. Volumes are also going to be an issue for us. And I think
like Jeff mentioned, even as we're trying to get our inventories up now, we are going to have higher

manufacturing costs due to COVID labor issues and shorter product runs as we try to rebalance our
inventories.

Operator

Your next question is from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates.

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

Just one quick question on the trends. You mentioned flattish trends in July. Are there any major
distinctions by the segments or are they all kind of trending similarly into July?

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We said July was basically flat compared to last year and improved more than we had anticipated.
And overall, rest of the world is better than the other 2 segments.

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

And then the other thing and just in terms of the phasing of the benefits to profits from the restructuring
efforts that you've already taken, how should we think about that phasing in the back half?

And then as we think about -- I know that you mentioned annualizing it in 2021. But in the back half, that
should be an offset, I would assume, to some of the other headwinds that you're seeing. But you're saying
that the other headwinds will be more than that?

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

Sorry, your question is on the savings, how are they going to phase in? Was that your question?

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

Right. And so I was just kind of following on Keith's question about the year-over-year change in margins.
They may be pressured from some of the actions, labor issues, shorter productivity runs. I guess those
will more than offset any kind of benefit from the phasing to restructuring. I was just curious if you could
quantify some of the tailwinds from just the restructuring efforts that you announced and took, the $100
million charge that you took in the second quarter.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Yes. What happened when we started out, we based it on our experience from 2008 and '09. We decided
if the business was going to slow down, we're going to take more aggressive actions earlier to improve
our position. With that, we're cutting SG&A. We're reducing the workforce. We're streamlining our product
offering. We're closing less-efficient plants, investing in more efficient assets, which would add to the $110
million to $120 million of savings. It will take through next year to complete those and capture the full
benefit.

The manufacturing savings, don't forget, will have to flow through inventory, which will be 3 to 5 months
later, depending upon what it is and where it is. We estimate just at a really high level that the savings will
range from about $15 million to $25 million per quarter until we achieve the results that we expect.

And then just as a comment, remember that the margins for everything are really dependent on the
future sales. And in the short term, COVID's affecting it, and we're really not sure where they're going to
be.

Zelman & Associates LLC

Well, that makes sense. And if I could sneak one more in on this subject. Just thinking about the broader
trends, thinking about the actions that you're taking in terms of capacity rationalization. I guess how much
of your non-LVT businesses are going to be rationalized from these efforts? And are these adjustments
just reconciling for the relative share loss to LVT that's already taken place or are these accommodating
for maybe potential further erosion to LVT in the future?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

We are setting the business up at a level we think that will be needed to be at for the future. We've made
the adjustments in the ceramic capacities. We've consolidated some of the higher-cost assets in the
Flooring Rest of World -- I mean, in the Flooring North America. And then we've taken costs down in every
part of the business, in every segment, anticipating that it's not going to be a V, straight up and stay
there.

Your next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

The first question is really around from a channel standpoint in the U.S. Can you remind us how much of
your business goes into specialty, both in Flooring North America and Global Ceramic?

And then given the relative restrictions on specialty versus home centers in the quarter, how do you think
about the share shift dynamic and whether or not that's just kind of accelerated share shift towards home
centers over the medium term or whether your specialty channel can kind of play catch-up to that?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

You asked a lot of different questions. The specialty channel, the home center channel in most of the
markets stayed open through the period. So what happened is the specialty stores were shut down and
the only place for customers to buy our products were in the home centers in many markets. Over the
period, that changed. So that's a temporary change in the business.

In total, over the past 15, 20 years, the home centers have continued to expand their participation in the
market and take share, and it's different by product categories. The larger the category is in do-it-yourself
and/or some of the different contracting businesses depends on where it ends up and which channel it's
in. So I don't see this being a significant change in the short term, but just the same continuation they've
been on.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And second question, just back on the restructuring. Understand there's been spare capacity
and then probably some underperforming SKUs in terms of things that are getting either consolidated or
rationalized. Is there any sales impact we should be thinking about, though, when you take out this much
capacity and you take out some of the SKUs? Do you think there is a corresponding sales impact or is this
really you're going to be able to replace any lost sales with other kind of productivity measures?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

We're being more aggressive in getting rid of low-volume SKUs. We have alternatives to the products to
offer the customers, but there's always risks of trying to transition one to the other. The goal is to end up
with more business with a more consolidated offering.

Your next question is from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

Two questions. First of all, throughout the segments, you talked about price and mix pressure. Curious if
you could just expand on that a little bit, where you're seeing that and what is driving that and then also
the kind of ongoing outlook for price and mix.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

It's occurring in all the different categories. First is, the commercial businesses tend to be higher margin
than the residential businesses. The commercial businesses have taken a bigger hit and are coming back
slower, and we're not sure how they're going to evolve over time.

Within the other pieces, the more promotional products are tending to sell more than the other during the
downturn. Some because the higher end shops and stores that sell them, the people that had it pulled
back in the market more. We're going to have to see how that evolves going forward. It's a little early to
tell if it's going to be a permanent change or not. We're just assuming that the market is going to be more
difficult and we're going to have to respond to competitive positions all around the world.

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

And then going forward, I mean, as we've said numerous times, we have a really hard time looking out
beyond just a few weeks in this environment. But we would anticipate that we will continue to see price/
mix pressure going forward through the rest of this year.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

And then a follow-up on restructuring. It sounds like you've outlined a good program. I'm just curious
when considering what's taking place in the industry, especially in the U.S. the last number of years and
the contraction in operating profit of the company in total, if you had considered a larger program aimed
at generating more cost out, more cost savings or is that just unreasonable with how the business is set
up or how you view the market? Just curious if there was a program that could have netted $200 million
or $300 million of savings or if that's just not reasonable.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

It all starts with how you perceive the market is going to be in the future and what you need to satisfy it.
At the moment, we believe that the changes we made are set up for how we believe the best guess of the
business is going to be for the next few years. But we'll have to see what happens.

Your next question is from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

A lot of discussion around the costs that are being cut. But I think, Jeff, you mentioned in the opening
remarks that the $1 billion in bonds that there was some intention around strategic investments there. I
guess just if you could outline some of the areas that are sort of top of mind for investment.

Listen, we're always looking at acquisitions to go through. At this point, it's a little hard to aggressively
do acquisitions given that you don't know the environmental thesis, but we're always talking to different
people on acquisitions. On the business, we're trying to minimize the capital investments for the moment,
but we believe there'll be greater visibility in the not distant future and we'll start changing it. If you go
back 1.5 months ago, the directive was stop everything we could stop. And we really haven't moved from
that at this moment, but we're trying to decide what it should be. And every week, we get a better view of
the market and what we should do.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just as my follow-up. In U.S. ceramic, I think you mentioned something about
refocusing on new construction. Could you talk about what the exposure is now and what you want to get
that to and kind of the implications on price/mix there?

William Christopher Wellborn
President, COO & Director

Well, what we're seeing in the U.S. ceramic, just like the others, commercial is slowing. They are finishing
existing projects, but we anticipate that slowing. But we also think there's a significant opportunity in
remodeling and new construction. So we're taking advantage and moving our sales and assets in that
direction.

Your next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's Mike Rehaut. So I just wanted to circle back for a moment to the cost savings. And I believe, Jeff, you
had said or Frank, that you were kind of looking at a $15 million to $20 million a quarter. I wasn't sure if
that was something that you would expect would kick in, in the third quarter. Obviously, you talked about
there being a lag in terms of the manufacturing benefit, that we might not see that impact until, let's say,
the first quarter of 2021. I was just really hoping to get a sense of, of the $110 million, $120 million of
overall annualized savings, how much is expected to be realized in 2020 and specifically 3Q and 4Q?

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

We're expecting, like Jeff said, to average between $15 million to $25 million of savings a quarter. We're
expecting to start realizing savings in the third quarter, but we're also saying that as we go forward, we
expect that margins are going to be impacted by volume still, and that's a big question mark, right, in
terms of how the volume returns or not as well as short-term labor impact from the COVID virus, how that
might impact the workforce and productivity as we continue to rebuild our inventory and get it back to
where it needs to be.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And the $15 million to $25 million, that would be kind of proportional along the lines of the restructuring
cost or charge breakdown that you had said before, the $80 million for ceramic, et cetera?

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

No, not necessarily.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

How should we think about the breakdown by segment then?

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We weren't going to disclose that one.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. Maybe just kind of shifting gears a second to the sales side. Obviously, kind of a strong decline
across the board, it's in a pretty tight range in the second quarter. Frank, you mentioned that for July, rest
of world did a little better than the other 2 segments. Obviously, if you're flat, that would kind of imply a
little bit of growth, let's say, for rest of world and maybe a little bit of a decline for the other 2 segments.
Any type of directional thoughts around the degree of magnitude for each would be helpful and if you're
seeing a better ramp, let's say, in one segment versus the other in terms of what you've seen throughout
2Q emerge would also be very helpful.

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

Mike, it's hard, like we've said, to give a lot of guidance on how things are developing over a very long
period of time. Right now, what we're seeing is rest of world is coming back more quickly. I think as
I mentioned, they went down more quickly but have come back more quickly as well in the second
quarter. Also, in rest of world, they have more of their business in residential as opposed to commercial.
Commercial, as Jeff had mentioned, was being impacted more by this and has not come back as much as
residential. In addition, they have more of their business in both laminate and LVT. And those 2 categories
have also performed well.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The business is really obscure because right now in the Europe business and rest of world, we can't tell
whether the orders we're seeing now are filling the pipeline in the channel and they're trying to get ahead
due to what they didn't pick up that they normally do going into the vacation season or whether this is a
view of ongoing business. And that same question, we have in everything we're doing. The business has
improved, the orders are improving, but we can't tell what is projects that were started in April, May that
are postponed now and are they going to continue at that rate or is there a bubble? We can't tell what's
going to happen with businesses investing in the business. And all through the period, we can create
dramatic scenarios in either direction. And the reason we're not giving guidance is, we don't know which
one is kind of probable.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just wanted to ask a question longer term about Flooring North America. I guess just to start, I was a little
surprised that you mentioned that the improvement, you did generally better than you expected mostly
it sounded like in Flooring Rest of World, not Flooring North America. So I just wanted to clarify, did the
U.S.A. operations, in general, exceed your expectations as well?

But a more longer-term question about margins in Flooring North America, too. One thing that investors
are concerned about is the idea that FNA margins were maybe artificially high a few years ago as
inventories were rising and that maybe there's a fear that some of these lower margins that we're dealing
with more recently are more reflective of the margins going forward. But obviously, there's a lot of near-
term things that are weighing down the margin. So I'm wondering what you think the longer-term margin
structure in Flooring North America looks like. Is it reasonable to think we can get back to where we were

a few years ago, mid to high teens, once these discrete challenges are behind you or do you think that the
longer-term margin structure is maybe a little lower than it was at that time?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Let's start with the first question which was, what's different than our projection? Everything. I mean
when we went into it, we were projecting the market to be much more difficult and not to rebound as
much as it has. So in our thesis, we were preparing for a much longer, slower recovery than we've seen at
this point. Now how it's going to go on from here is anybody's guess. That's the first one.

The Flooring North America, we changed management a little over a year ago. We're continuing to
put different processes in place to improve our operations and run it better, improve our margins and
profitability in the business. And we have a huge amount of activities going on to do that. We expect the
margins to improve. We'll see how far we can get them.

Operator

Your next question is from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.

Samuel John Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Two questions. And hopefully, they're quick so I'll be allowed to ask them. In light of your being under-
inventoried at the end of the second quarter, I'm guessing that included stock-outs. So your July sales
results being flat, I'm wondering how much of a benefit July saw from shipping unfilled orders from Q2
and how much of it really is truly current demand. I'm trying to get a sense of the sustainability of that
July trend.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The order backlog, we haven't been able to push the backlog down because the sales have been going
up. So we still need to get the inventories up, and we haven't gotten them up high enough to achieve the
service levels we want on one side, but it goes back to the prior comments. We're not sure how much of
this is a bubble from before and how much is inventory in the channels. So to answer your question, we
need both those, and we don't have it.

Samuel John Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And my last one would be, given FIFO, should we expect input cost benefits to accelerate going forward in
the P&L?

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

I'm not sure they're going to accelerate. When you say input cost, you mean deflation in materials?

Samuel John Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Yes. The benefits from input cost, yes.

Frank H. Boykin
Chief Financial Officer

I think we will continue to see benefits going forward, but I wouldn't say the level of benefits is going to
increase sequentially.

Your next question is from Phil Ng with Jefferies.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I'm just curious where are you with your journey optimizing your LVT facilities in North America in terms
of breaking even? Looks like the exemptions on imports are at least going away for now. Do you have that
ability to kind of meet that demand as your capacity ramps up this back half? Is that a nice windfall for
you guys?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

I'm going to start. What he's talking about is, there were duties on click LVT that were withdrawn a year
ago for a year. I think it was yesterday, the government has reinstated the duties on those products. With
that, what we think is going to happen is the reverse of what happened last year, the industry will have
to increase prices to cover the tariffs, which should increase the value of our manufacturing as we go
through.

With the businesses, the European operations are ahead of our U.S. operations in their improvements. The
European operation is profitable today and is going to continue to improve as we continue to enhance the
operations and take cost out. The U.S. improvements are following. But again, I think we said it before,
we had expected to have multiple engineers over here all through the second quarter helping to do the
same thing we've already done. I don't know if you know that you can't travel between the 2. So all of
that's been postponed. But we are, with or without, increasing the production speeds and processes in
all of them. At the same time, we're introducing new products and styling to help the business as we go
through. So I think it should help us. I think we're getting better at it and we're turning the corner.

I just had one question on ceramic. Is there a way just with the restructuring that you could frame for us
in maybe percentage terms the structural capacity that you're reducing within the ceramic business?

William Christopher Wellborn

Yes. We're only reducing capacity in the U.S. We're taking out our least-efficient assets, which is about

beyond that with regards to the investigation, like I said, we really can't comment.

Laura Allyson Champine
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Understood. And then if I can get a quick follow-on to a previous question. Have you disclosed the
utilization rate in your LVT plants in the U.S. right now just to give us a sense of how much volume you
can service as hopefully demand picks up there?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum

We haven't. But what's happening is the capacity is increasing as the productivity and efficiencies are
going up. So we can service business significantly greater than we have.

Your next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My question is around the mix shift. You commented that you're seeing that as an ongoing pressure in the
business. But in the U.S., as we have seen that consumers are perhaps shifting some of their spend more
to home improvement, are you seeing that, that's driving any benefit in terms of the mix?

And then I guess when you kind of think about the mix shift that you are seeing there, how does that
compare to past recessions? And how much of that is due to maybe underlying shifts in the industry as
we've gotten this growth in LVT and some of these newer product categories that have come through?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Each different product category is different from each other. And carpet, there's an ongoing trend of
polyester selling more. You also have a mix in channels. So the homebuilder channel, the new home
construction channel is a lower mix than our retail channel. So as retail didn't do as well as the new home
construction, that also impact it as you go through. So there's channel mix as well as customer mix going
on.

In the different businesses, they're all different. In my ceramic business, in my laminate business, we
basically participate in the mid to high end of the business, and it's growing in its use as alternatives to
other hard surfaces. It's being used in both the retail and the new construction business much more so.
And our products are outperforming in those cases.

The ceramic business, the mix has decreased somewhat because some of the product categories are
impacted by LVT using some of the higher-end stuff. And then you have the commercial mix, which is
much higher in all the business, isn't it? So there's product changes, consumer changes and channel
changes all at the same time.

them. Is this, as we know, indefinite? And then what does this mean more specifically for your operations,
not just in the U.S., but also in terms of global sourcing?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The tariff, there were tariffs put on originally 25% on all products. A year ago, they took the tariffs off click
LVT only. And they did it for a 1-year period and it came back for renewal. The renewal was turned down
so the 25% starts -- I don't have the date in front of me. I don't know if it's today, yesterday. It may start
today. I'm not sure. And so we'll all have to start paying it. And then we're going to have to get the prices
up in order to cover it. I'm not sure I got the whole question.

Kathryn Ingram Thompson
Thompson Research Group, LLC

Really, it's the stair-stepping in terms of -- you answered one part, but then the second is, what's the real
impact? And you have some good precedents from previous tariffs in terms of your expectations and how
it will impact that particular product category and profitability.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Well, when the tariffs went down, the industry dropped prices somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.
So I'm assuming that the prices are going to go up in the 15% to 20% range with it. And any time and
anything that we're manufacturing outside of China will be better off than it was before.

Your final question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So your CapEx, you guided toward $400 million, which you said you're evaluating. I think a portion of this,
you have capacity projects that are probably partially unfinished in your pipeline. Just how much additional
capacity do you think you're going to bring online in the back half of the year and into 2021? And can you
just remind us what products those are and possibly geographies?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

We stopped all increases in capacity when this thing started. So whatever was already started, we
continued. The biggest one that I remember off the top of my head is, we are expanding our laminate
production in the United States with a new production line, with new capabilities. That will be in next
year. We're running all of the capacity that we have now, and we're looking at importing some from our
overseas businesses to support the business in the short term with it.

We had some capacity increase this year in the Russian business. I think it was in the Russian ceramic
business. I think there was some in the Eastern European ceramic business, both of which are running at
fairly high rates. And we expect to use them all. There's just unlimited ways.

The bigger pieces were new businesses. So we said that the sheet vinyl business would put a new line
in Russia. It's turned profitable in it. The LVT lines in Europe have turned profitable in it, the carpet tile
lines in Europe. All the cash we have, we're investing back and expanding our sales force to expand the
distribution of it as we speak. And then going forward, we're going through a strategic planning process
now to determine what the right level is and where to invest in. I'm assuming most of it is going to be in
enhancing the product mix, enhancing the product offerings with new features and benefits versus large
capacity expansions at this point.
