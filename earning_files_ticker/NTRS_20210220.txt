NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Bette,
Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's First Quarter
2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call this morning are Michael O'Grady, our Chairman
and CEO; Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; Lauren Allnutt, our Controller; and Kelly Lernihan from
our Investor Relations team.

Our first quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at
northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we
will use to guide today's conference call. This April 20 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The
only authorized rebroadcast of this call is a replay that will be available on our website through May 18.
Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided on this call after today.

Now for our safe harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-
looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or
future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these
statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are
difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual
results.

[Operator Instructions]

Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Michael O'Grady.

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Amid the ongoing
public health crisis, I hope you and your families are healthy and well. At Northern Trust, we continue to
operate in what we call resiliency mode, which means we are focused on providing our clients continuity
of service while the majority of our employees worldwide are working remotely. Before turning the call
over to Jason to walk through the financials in detail, I wanted to offer some brief comments on our
performance for the quarter. Our results for the quarter resulted in earnings per share growth of 9%
versus the prior year and a return on average common equity of 13.7%. Revenue was consistent with
the prior year as declines in net interest income and trading-related revenue were offset by 6% growth in
trust fees. The persistent low interest rate environment has pressured our net interest income as well as
our trust fees as reflected by money market fee waivers. While overall year-over-year operating leverage
was negative, the 6% growth in trust fees did produce 1 point of positive fee operating leverage despite
the impact of fee waivers which reduced our trust fee growth versus the prior year by 5 percentage points.

The current quarter's results also benefited from an improved economic outlook, which drove a $30 million
release of reserves for credit losses. Throughout the past year, our strong capital base and liquidity profile
enabled us to support the needs of our clients, and this was demonstrated further during the first quarter
as we saw a 10% sequential growth in average total deposits and 3% sequential growth in average loan
balances. Throughout this challenging environment, we have effectively executed on initiatives to continue
to drive organic growth within each of our businesses, one of our key strategic initiatives.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Within wealth management, our digital marketing efforts and Northern Trust Institute have driven more
conversations and engagement, and we've experienced an increase in client engagement during the
quarter. Within asset management, we have continued to see success in growth within ESG mandates
with assets under management of $139 billion at quarter end, and our quant active strategies have
experienced strong relative performance, providing us good momentum. In our asset servicing business,
we continued to see organic growth during the quarter, with the success being well diversified across
regions, products and client segments.

Moving forward, we remain focused on continuing to effectively navigate through the persistent low
interest rate environment, focusing on driving greater efficiencies as well as continuing to grow organically
in a scalable and profitable manner. Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our employees
whose commitment, expertise and professionalism throughout these extraordinary times continues to be
exceptional.

Now let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail for the quarter.

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Let's
dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported first quarter net
income of $375.1 million, earnings per share were $1.70 and our return on average common equity was
13.7%. You can see on the bottom of Page 2, equity markets performed well during the quarter. Recall
that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels in both the
S&P 500 and EFA Local had strong sequential performance based on those calculations. As shown on this
page, average 1-month and 3-month LIBOR rates were stable during the quarter with modest declines.

Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue
was flat, with noninterest income up 5% and net interest income down 17%. Expenses increased 5%,
while net income was up 4%. In the sequential comparison, revenue grew 4% with noninterest income
up 5% and net interest come up slightly. Expenses declined 3%, net income increased 56%. Recall that
the prior year -- the prior quarter included $66.9 million in expense relating to severance and occupancy
charges. Excluding those charges, expenses were up 3% on a sequential basis. The provision for credit
losses reflected a release of $30 million in reserves in the quarter compared to a provision of $61 million
in the prior year and a release of $2.5 million in the prior quarter. The release in the quarter was driven
by continued improvement in the projected economic conditions and portfolio credit quality relative to the
prior quarter. Return on average common equity was 13.7% for the quarter, up from 13.4% a year ago
and 8.8% in the prior quarter.

Assets under custody and administration of $14.8 trillion grew 36% from a year ago and increased 2% on
a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $11.5 trillion grew 40% from a year ago and increased 2% on
a sequential basis. Assets under management were $1.4 trillion, up 29% from a year ago and up 3% on a
sequential basis.

Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully
taxable equivalent basis was $1.6 billion, flat with the prior year and up 4% sequentially. Trust, investment
and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion and
were up 6% from last year and 4% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $79 million in
the quarter, down 12% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. The decline compared to a year ago
was driven by lower volume and lower volatility, while the sequential performance was driven by higher
volumes. The remaining components of noninterest income totaled $101 million in the quarter, up 16%
compared to a year ago and up 9% sequentially. Within this, securities commissions and trading income
declined 17% compared to a year ago, but was up 8% sequentially.

The year-over-year decline reflected lower interest rate swap and transition management activity. The
sequential performance was driven by strong growth within our core brokerage business, which includes
our integrated trading solutions product. Other operating income totaled $55 million and was up 60% from
1 year ago and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was impacted by higher income in the

supplemental compensation plans and a prior year market value adjustment for seed capital investment,
partially offset by higher expense relating to Visa swap agreements. The growth due to the supplemental
compensation plans had a related increase within our other operating expense. The sequential increase
was primarily associated with lower expense relating to Visa swap agreements. Net interest income, which
I'll discuss in more detail later, was $347 million in the first quarter, down 17% from a year ago and up
slightly on a sequential basis.

Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional
Services business, fees totaled $621 million in the first quarter and were up 8% year-over-year and up
4% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees were $446 million and up 13% year-over-year
and up 6% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business, favorable
currency translation and higher transaction volumes. The sequential increase was primarily driven by
favorable markets, new business and favorable currency translation.

Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $13.9 trillion at quarter end, up 36% year-
over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, new
business and favorable currency translation. The sequential performance was driven by favorable markets
and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Investment management fees in
C&IS of $116 million were down 4% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Both comparisons were
impacted by higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by new business and favorable markets.

Fee waivers in C&IS totaled $28 million in the first quarter compared to $11.4 million in the prior quarter.
Assets under management for C&IS clients were $1.1 trillion, up 30% year-over-year and up 3%
sequentially. The growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets, client flows and favorable
currency translation. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and net flows. Securities
lending fees were $18 million in the quarter, down 22% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-
over-year decline was driven by lower spreads, while the sequential performance was driven by higher
volumes, partially offset by lower spreads. Average collateral levels were up 13% year-over-year and up
11% sequentially.

Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $443
million and were up 3% compared to both the prior year and prior quarter. Fee waivers in wealth
management totaled $22 million in the first quarter compared to $12 million in the prior quarter. Across
the regions, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis, growth were impacted by favorable markets,
partially offset by higher fee waivers. Within Global Family Office, fees were lower year-over-year and
sequentially and primarily reflected higher fee waivers, partially offset by favorable markets. Assets under
management for our wealth management clients were $355 billion at quarter end, up 28% year-over-
year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and client flows,
while the sequential performance reflected favorable markets, partially offset by net outflows.

Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $347 million in the quarter and was down 17% from the prior
year. Earning assets averaged $141 billion in the quarter, up 27% versus the prior year. Average deposits
were $126 billion and were up 33% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $34.2 billion and
were up 6% compared to the prior year. The net interest margin was 1% in the quarter and was down 51
basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin declined primarily due to lower interest rates as well
as mix shift within the balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased slightly.
Average earning assets increased 7% on a sequential basis, while average deposits were up 10%. The net
interest margin declined 5 basis points sequentially, partially due to the balance sheet mix shift and lower
rates.

Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1.1 billion in the first quarter or 5% higher than the prior year and
3% lower sequentially. The prior quarter included a $55 million severance charge related to a reduction
in force and an $11.9 million expense associated with an early lease exit arising from our workplace real
estate strategy. Excluding these items, expenses were up 3% sequentially. Compensation expense totaled
$519 million and was up 4% compared to the prior year and was down 1% sequentially. The year-over-
year growth was driven by higher salary expense due to staff growth, prior year base pay adjustments,
higher incentive expense and unfavorable currency translation. Excluding the charge in the prior period,

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

compensation was up 10% sequentially, primarily driven by higher equity and cash-based incentives.
This quarter's equity incentives included $32 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff
compared to $34 million in the prior year. Employee benefits expense of $103 million was up 60% from 1
year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is primarily related to higher retirement,
medical and payroll withholding costs. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher payroll
withholding, partially offset by lower medical expense.

Outside services expense was $196 million and was up 2% from a year ago and down 6% from the prior
quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher subcustody, third-party adviser and market data
costs, partially offset by lower data processing and consulting costs. The prior quarter included a $2.5
million charge. Excluding the charge, costs were down 4%, primarily due to lower legal, consulting and
technical services-related costs. Equipment and software expense of $177 million was up 9% from 1 year
ago and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth reflected higher software support and amortization
costs. Occupancy expense of $51 million were down 1% from a year ago and down 24% on a sequential
basis. The prior quarter included an $11.9 million charge relating to an early lease exit. Excluding that
charge, the category was down 8% on a sequential basis driven by lower building operation costs and
lower rent expense. Other operating expense of $72 million was up 16% from a year ago and relatively
flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher supplemental compensation
plan expense and other miscellaneous expenses, partially offset by lower business promotion and staff-
related costs.

Turn to Page 8. Our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% under the
standardized approach and 12.8% under the advanced approach. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.9%
under both the standardized and advanced approaches. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.4
million shares of common stock at a cost of $136 million. We also declared cash dividends of $0.70 per
share, totaling $151 million to common shareholders.

The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and
liquidity profile to support our clients' needs. We continue to provide our clients with the exceptional
service and solution expertise they've come to expect. Our competitive positioning across each of our
businesses, wealth management, asset management and asset servicing, continues to resonate well in the
marketplace.
Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Mike,
Mark, Lauren and I would be happy to answer your questions. Olivia, please open the line.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess my question is on organic growth. I heard a lot of commentary throughout your 18 minutes of
prepared remarks. On positive net flows, across most parts of the business. I think in your prepared
remarks, I heard you talk about ESG mandates within asset management, but maybe you could cover
whether you quantify or qualify, I'll take either one, where you're seeing new business, what kind of
business you're winning in asset servicing? And has there been any pandemic-related pause that is now
freeing up a lot, Jim. So any color on that would be great?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Mike, do you want to start on it?

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So Glenn, as you described there, we are seeing strong organic growth across the company and
specifically in asset servicing. And I would say the first place I would start, the foundation of our growth
strategy is retaining existing clients. And as you would imagine, going through the pandemic, being able to
support clients has been extremely important, but also, I think, earned us the right, if you will, to continue
to serve our clients, many of them are largest clients. So that's been a big positive.

Second, I would say is that we have seen, I would say, a full return to marketplace activity. So our clients,
both asset owners and asset managers are actively looking at their own operating models and looking
for opportunities either to become more effective in how they invest on behalf of their beneficiaries or
improving the efficiency of the way they do that. So consolidating operations or providers, utilizing new
technology, and that has played very well into our strategies in asset servicing that we've had underway
for years. So thinking about things like front-office solutions, which is an investment book of record for
clients that have high levels of alternative assets, the ability to look at across their portfolio in order to
manage their business. And then thinking about our asset manager clients, our whole office strategy is
definitely resonating as well where we can provide services across front, middle and back office. So high
level of activity. And then I would say, success with strategies we've had in place for some time period.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Appreciate that. Maybe just the last follow-up on net interest income. The NIM was down 5%, but deposits
were up a ton. Do you feel net interest income has now finally bottomed and maybe some backup of your
thoughts behind that in terms of redeployment opportunities?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

I don't want to call a bottom on it. I mean, if you unpack the quarter effectively, we saw loan growth that
was strong and up $1 billion, and that has a few million dollar impact if you take our average return on
those assets. If you think anywhere from 175 to 200 basis points on that $1 billion, you're going to get $4
million or $5 million in lift for the quarter. And then you also had obviously a lift from the deposits overall,
but that's offset by something that's more predictable going forward, which is we're still going to have
reinvestment in -- as the security book continues to mature. And that's still got some maturation to do.
And so it's easier to predict what's going to happen on the reinvestment side than what's going to happen

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

on the loan side. But obviously, if we continue to see strong loan demand, then that's more important than
what we're seeing on the other components of volume.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I see at your annual meeting today, a 2021 priority is productivity. So I was wondering if you could put
some metrics around what you'd like to achieve? And on the positive side, I see the headcount is down
1% quarter-over-quarter. The pretax margin in the first quarter is back to the 30s, where it was not last
year at all. But on the negative side, I have to imagine the fee waivers will continue and might actually
increase. So where does it all end up? And where would you like to get to this year?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Let me take that in a few different buckets. You're right. The productivity is extraordinarily important.
And we go and we scratch and call and do everything we can to earn new business. That's hard to do. It's
not overly predictable. But what we can do is exhibit extreme discipline on the productivity side. And so
we haven't put external metrics to that, but we're looking at it a lot of different ways internally. We look at
operating leverage, which we talked about earlier, we look at fee operating leverage. And internally, we're
able to look at organic trust fee operating leverage. And so from our perspective, we want to see -- we
don't want to just call expenses up or down because a lot of our business relate -- a lot of our expenses
relates to the amount of new business that's coming in. And if we continue to show growth in the different
areas of the business, we're going to see lift in those expenses. We just want to make sure it's related in
the proper way to the organic growth that's coming in. Now you're right, headcount was down. And that
comes back to the initiatives that we talked about in January. And so you see it's a meaningful reduction
for us of about 300 headcount and that played through in lower salary expense for the company. And so
that's -- those are meaningful movements and I think reflective of the discipline and the commitment
we have around expense management. And then on fee waivers, you're right, it's -- that is a -- it's a
very, very difficult dynamic that we're facing. And I also think people need to realize, we've talked about
the fact that the $50 million we have this quarter, we're still seeing lower rates on the short end of the
curve. And as much as we've seen the 1-year, 5-year, 10-year up, we've seen overnight repo at 0 and 1,
and that's very difficult for a $275 billion pool of money market funds. And that's why we've tried to give
consistent information, not guidance, but a consistent run rate on how those fee waivers are going. And
as we sit right now, that number looks more like $65 million to $70 million on a quarterly run rate basis.
Hopefully, as the Fed balance sheet changes, we see some improvement there, but that's where we sit
today. And so it's something we have to monitor. And obviously, it has a big impact on the pretax margin
you identified.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then the one tailwind you have, I guess, the higher asset values. Can you remind us of the
relationship between every change in the stock market and your fees?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. It's going to -- it varies by the area of the business that you're talking about. In general, 60% -- in
C&IS about 60% are based on asset values in some ways. And then in wealth, you can split it even more.
And Mark, you might have those numbers close or off the top of your head, but it's...

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Right. Yes, the 60% in C&IS is related to asset values, which would be all asset values, equity assets
as well as fixed income or cash. And then as we look across, in wealth management, there is more of
a relationship there to the assets. But the equity sensitivity, if that's what you're looking at, is a little
different. And the regions, the equity sensitivity is probably 50% to 55%, whereas when you get to the
Global Family Office, there the equity sensitivity is probably closer to 1/3 just because of the way the
clients' assets are allocated.

We will now go to Brennan Hawken with UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So first on the balance sheet growth here. Quite robust deposit growth. It was a pretty significant
inflection from how things were trending in the back half of last year. And so curious about your thoughts
there? How much of this do you view as excess? It seems as though a lot of the central bank deposits on
the asset side went up, which would imply that you might think this is -- these are short duration deposits.
So if you could give maybe some color on what your expectations are for the sustainability of this growth
in deposits and how you might be thinking about redeploying those deposits over time? And how much
time do you need in order to do that?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So you're right. I mean, total interest-related deposits up, interest-bearing deposits up. And I think
the good news is that interestingly, we were able to hold on to the margin. You saw a decline in LIBOR.
And even in that book, we also saw a decline in cost. And despite the fact that part of the book is below 0.
And I think that's meaningful. To get to your question about volume levels and the nature of the deposits,
there's no doubt a lot of those deposits are nonoperational. And so we need to let them season before
we would do much beyond putting those at central banks. That said, there are other things we can do
because we've got capacity in the balance sheet. But obviously, the nature of how we run the treasury
book is to let those types of deposits, the ones that are more institutional and might be more transitional
season before we would take longer-term exposure on those.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. All right. I appreciate that. And then when we think about -- I think you had had commented, Jason,
in response to Glenn's question about that really, when you think about NII, it's a foot racing between loan
growth and reinvestment rates. Your loan growth picked up a bit here this quarter versus the trend of the
back half of last year. But period end, not necessarily all that higher than the average. So how should we
think about loan growth from here? What are you seeing as far as demand for loans amongst your clients?
And is the rate for that loan book still -- are we still better off looking at the 1-month and 3-month LIBORs
to think about those rates?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So first of all, the loan growth has come almost exclusively or the vast, vast majority has come
from the wealth management side of the business. And even though in dollars, it's not as big as the
deposits, the impact is much more meaningful. And having $1 billion in higher average deposits, that's
quite meaningful for NII, and we've talked very consistently about the fact that the deposit levels are
interesting. They're chunky, but don't really do too much on NII. It is difficult to predict what the loan
demand will be. However, what we've experienced isn't simply, I'd say, random. We've talked about the
fact that we have been communicating with clients more aggressively. And this is over the last 1.5 years,
2 years, about our desire to be with them and be a liquidity provider for them.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Our liquidity engagement with clients is it's a big part of our business. And that shows up not just in what
we do with the balance sheet on deposits, but also money market funds where again, $275 billion in AUM
there and also on the lending side, particularly on the wealth management clients. And so it's more --
this has been, I think, more of a strategic lift and -- so that's not predictive that it's going to hold on or
continue to accelerate, but we don't see it as something that we're dismissing is potentially random either.

We will now go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I want to shift gears a little bit, maybe talk about capital a little bit, and obviously and continue to be in
very strong position across all the key ratios. Can you guys remind us or kind of how you think about the
binding constraints for Northern Trust, obviously, relative to regulatory minimums, that's not kind of how
you said the bar. You typically look at your peers. So given some of the changes that they have made and
kind of how they're thinking about sort of the minimum levels they're willing to run with, how does that
inform your view of excess capital at Northern Trust? And then ultimately, how does that translate into
your appetite for increased buybacks from here?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So you're right that it's less of a -- for us, it's less of an algebraic calculation and more where we
want to be on a relative basis. At this point -- you guys have heard us talk consistently about -- thinking
about our engagement with the Board where we're totally aligned, but we want to make sure that, that
conversation continues to take place where we are on an absolute basis, how we think about things on a
relative basis and how we think about things from a regulatory perspective.

And right now, I'd say, just keeping an eye on what the industry is doing is important. So the absolute
level, less so, we got plenty of room, obviously, from a CET1 perspective, sitting at 12%, given where
the regulatory minimum are. And so if you think about Tier 1 leverage, even though the industry has
talked about coming down significantly, we're -- we've still printed well into the 6s. And that's on a $125
billion average deposit base. So I'm not going to -- I'm not giving you our buffers here, but just take a 5%
number just to get at your question on about what our capacity would look like. If you came all the way
down to 5, that would translate to a balance sheet of about $200 billion, and you could have $170 billion
in deposits, all else equal on the balance sheet today. And so you're talking about easily $40 billion on a
base of 125 currently. And so that's a lot of room. And I think also importantly, it's not like we use the
balance sheet for clients that for organizations we don't know. We're really dealing from a candidate pool
of depositors that are existing clients. And so at this point, we feel good about the capacity we have, but
it's obviously something that we're watching, given how dramatically things can change given Fed actions
and where deposits were 15 months ago.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Right. I guess I was trying to get more to the capital return framework of kind how you guys are thinking
about the opportunity for share repurchases from here given the access capital that you've outlined?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks for clarifying. Let me tackle that directly. It's interesting because this quarter is a great example
of how -- we don't just think about do we buy back stock or not. There are different ways we can invest
capital. And that 10% to 15% return target, it comes up in everything we do from a capital perspective,
including using the balance sheet to help clients. And so this quarter, you saw the capital levels come
down not because there was a meaningful decline in CET1, but because there is more activity in -- from
a client perspective, and that showed up with an increase in RWA on the denominator. And we saw higher

sec lending activity. We saw higher lending activity and we saw higher treasury activity in the form of
more bond buying, muni purchases. In each of those areas, we're thinking about what's the best way to
use our balance sheet in the long run and what's the best way to think about return. And for us, we can
think about the returns of buying back $1 of stock. We're looking at everything from what we think our
returns are going to be there, what's -- what are we getting in terms of price to book. We're also looking
at the desire to be there with clients and what those returns will look like. And when we have the ability to
think about lending or expanding C&IS relationships with the other things I mentioned, those things come
up as very attractive ways for us to use capital. It turns into better -- it turns into good growth for us in
the long run and good use of capital.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Great. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up around NIR again. So I think, Jason,
in the past, I think we talked a little bit about some sensitivities to sort of the repricing dynamics in the
securities portfolio. Maybe refresh us where that sort of stands today? So securities portfolio yield, I think,
is about 120 or so. If you look at rates where they are today, I want to say most of the securities portfolio
is already repriced lower, but holding current rates constant sort of how much more of a drag on the
securities yield do you guys expect to see over the next couple of quarters?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Well, to give you a sense of what's repriced at this point, obviously, just take -- if you look at the
$150 billion in earning assets, obviously, all of the money market assets have repriced, 85% of the loan
book is repriced. It's $60 billion of the securities. So about 63% of the securities book has repriced at this
point. So that's where we sit at this point. And then it's interesting, if you think about what's the impact
of that, I'll tell you, in this quarter alone, it was a significant impact. We actually had, if you -- just from
securities portfolio, NIR was down $10 million. And so that was the drain on it. But that's not -- I don't
want you to think about that as a pure run rate because we're thinking there about what's happening with
the loan book and so there are other factors to play in as we're reinvesting those securities. But I want to
at least start with giving you the numbers that you asked for in terms of how much is repriced and then
also what the implications are. But the runoff is coming through at this point. And also the fact that the
1, 2, 3, 5 year where we tend to be reinvesting has come up, that has brought down the influence on a
quarter-over-quarter basis as well.

Operator

We will now go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

If I can start off with maybe one of the loan book, Jason, just -- the comment you made on the 85%
of the loan book has repriced. It looks like that yield has at least for the last couple of quarters now
bottomed and it's starting to move back up. So my question would be around of the 15% that's repricing,
sort of what are the dynamics on that versus maybe what are some of the new loans that you're bringing
on that's helping improve that yield? And then longer term, most of that is tied to LIBOR. Maybe just talk
about the plan of whether some of those loans are going to use in new reference rate given the planned
station of LIBOR and how you're thinking about that?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So the longer-dated loans are -- often it's going to be in the mortgage book. And so that's what's
going to take longer effectively, just so you know. The loans that have come on disproportionately, the
growth has come, again, within wealth, but within personal loans and within some of our more corporate-
based organizations, we do have a lot of corporate -- there's small and midsized business activity in that
book, and that's where a lot of the growth has been. And then in terms of the LIBOR transition, yes, as

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

you know, and I'm sure you're covering really closely, Brian, there'll be a transition in most -- the industry
seems to be looking to move from LIBOR to SOFR as a reference rate. And so watching that and the
implications of it.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And is that transition to SOFR, I mean, I guess it's too early at this stage because there's not an effective
term rate. But I mean, is there any -- or are you sensing any implication on the yield of the loan book by
that transition? Or is it just simply too early?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Well, it's early, but we -- and I think the industry is hoping that they'll be -- once we get to those
transition dates, they'll be more of a reset and we'll have the -- not just the reference rate changes, but
the spread changes. And to reflect -- because, obviously, SOFR is different. There's not credit, there's not
duration in it. And so it's a different rate. And the relationship between LIBOR and SOFR is a lot different
today than what it was even a year ago. And so I think the industry has got some work to do to work on
what the conversations are going to be like at the point where we actually make that hard switch.

Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

So I had a couple of ticky-tack modeling question. The first is just on the non-asset sensitive fees within
custody and fund administration. And we've had 2 pretty meaningful sequential increases these past 2
quarters. That line item exited the quarter at about $178 million versus what historically had been a pretty
consistent range of $150 million to $160 million. I'm just curious what's driving the recent strength in that
line item? And maybe just as we think about from a modeling perspective, what's the right jumping off
point we should be thinking about as we look ahead to 2Q?

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Yes. And just to make sure I'm tracking totally specific, you're talking about other noninterest income at
$180 million on the income statement?

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

It's actually the $178 million within custody and fund administration, but it's a non-asset sensitive fee
portion. So that's the part that will presumably move around with that?

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Yes. So this is Mark. So you're referring to when we talk about the sensitivity of the -- of those fees at
about 60% to 65% are asset sensitive, and then the rest are kind of either their mix. Quite frankly, there's
transaction volumes within those. There are some flat fees or fixed fees or even account level fees. So you
could maybe say roughly half of it is transaction volume related. So -- and we did see a pickup this quarter
in those transaction volumes that created some of the sequential lift that we saw -- or 1% or so of the
sequential lift that we saw. So I hope that is answering your question?

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Yes, yes, that's sufficient. So we should be expecting some normalization of that, presumably it could
be higher than the $150 million to $160 million, but it sounds like the $178 million may have been a bit
elevated and we could see some rebasing there. Is that fair?

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Yes, that's probably fair. I don't necessarily have the numbers that you're doing because I don't have it on
specifically like that. That's kind of a directional guide that moves around each quarter that split. But yes,
I mean, we did -- we certainly saw heavier transaction activity during this most recent quarter that would
have benefited those fees by a bit.

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's helpful color. And just for my follow-up on NII, actually, a bit more focused on the liability
side. The beat was helped by continued grind down in those interest-bearing deposit costs. It's the second
consecutive quarter where we've actually seen that come down. Just curious if you see any additional
room to cut deposit costs further if the rate backdrop folds or has that lever been largely exhausted at this
point?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

I felt decent about coming down a couple of basis points in that book. And I think it's reflective that a lot
of that book is international. It's in currencies that are already used to having negative rates. And so the
dynamic that we've talked about that once 0 is broken, there's an expectation that the beta will continue
at that point seems to be playing through there. And so wouldn't necessary -- and we've talked to clients
a lot about where rates are there because it obviously can be a sensitive topic. But I think the win there
is we've got good dialogue with clients that indicate we're all looking at things like the euro the same way
and tracking deposit costs. So we don't have further deterioration as the asset side compresses more.

Operator

We will now go to Mike Carrier with Bank of America.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just a question on organic growth trends. You provided some good color on asset servicing in the loan
book question. Just in investment management and particularly in wealth, are you starting to see
improvement as COVID conditions improve versus last year? And how has the competitive backdrop
changed given that it seems like everybody has been focused on that part of the business?

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

So in wealth, we've continued to grow. But you're right, the marketplace is extremely competitive, which
is why it's so important that we stay focused on both the parts of the market where we think we compete
most effectively, and on providing for the clients in that segment. So where we're seeing our strongest
growth has been in the upper part of the market there. So think about clients with assets above $20
million. And particularly during this time period where equity values are going up, there's obviously been
an increase in wealth. So that drives growth. But then also with the change in administration and potential
changes in taxes and things like that, it increases the need for planning. So a high level of activity, both
with our existing clients, but also opportunities with prospects.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the expense outlook, you realize you guys try to focus on aligning
that slightly lower than the organic growth levels that firm over time. But as we transition from, say,
the low short rates as headwinds to NII and waiver headwinds stay eventually stabilizing and then as
short rates rise and eventually become still, like any necessary like investment areas ahead or like new
efficiency areas post-COVID like real estate that we should be thinking about?

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

I'll start, and then I'm sure Jason can add detail to it. But it's -- on the expense side, it's a very dynamic
situation right now. What I mean by that is we're obviously still in this resiliency mode that we talked
about, which has certain, say, cost to it, but also there are certain expenses that we're not incurring at this
point. So obviously, travel and business promotion is lower than it was pre-pandemic. With not operating
with as many people in our facilities, the cost of operating those facilities is lower. So you do have some
lower costs on that front that to the extent that we transition out of that, you would expect that those
would increase.

The second thing I would say is with regard to the organic growth that we've talked about, it does require
investment. That can be supporting large new clients. And it also can come in the form of bringing on
new talent to continue this growth. I mean as you bring on new talent, you want to make sure that you're
providing the right level of service across all of our businesses, and that means making sure that we have
the people that go along with this. And then the third piece I would just say is around our digitalization
efforts, which, again, have accelerated in the last year. And I think we're seeing the benefit of that. But
it does require investment in technology as well to ensure that, yes, we're adding those capabilities,
but we're doing it in the right safe, secure, stable way. So that backdrop does say, okay, we're going to
continue to grow, but it's going to require investment. And that's why, as Jason talked about earlier, we
also have to be focused on efficiency. And we did see, as a part of the remote working environment, there
are some efficiencies in that as well. And so how can we, for example, look at our real estate footprint and
see if there are opportunities to shrink the footprint and use that to support some of the investments that
I talked about.

Operator

We will now go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. A couple of other themes that we haven't touched on yet. One is around the wealth management
business and the virtual advising strategy. I know that's been well underway for a while. I just wanted to
get a sense as to if the demand for that is more run rate at this stage? Or are you still seeing acceleration
of demand for that strategy that you've got there?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

So if -- the way we've tackled kind of the virtual engagement through with clients on the wealth side is
the continued use of our goals-driven wealth management approach. And so we were able very quickly
to take those discussions and have virtual conversations. But with that same very -- what we think is a
very differentiated platform with clients through COVID, it was very good. Engagements were very, very
strong, and it's led the business to feel that there's strong momentum from an overall client engagement
perspective. So that's gone well. And it's one of the continued large investments in wealth management.
And Mike just talked about our investment in digitizing the business. That's an area where we can use
that as a core platform but add journeys to it, add specific areas to become more and more detailed and
specific with how -- matching up with what our clients are going through. It's very strong investment for
us, and it's been extremely positive. Our Net Promoter Scores as Steve Fran, who runs that business is
just talking about how strong those are. And so clearly, that investment has been paying off with good
client engagement.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just separately, I know you've been in the press recently with regard to some of the crypto
custody activities that you are working on, not sure when it's going to be launched. I think you've got a
partnership going on with [indiscernible]. So maybe you can give us some color on that. And part of the
question too is, it doesn't just end with custody or can you foresee an opportunity to enable -- to offer
crypto to your clients?

When I think about European investors, well, not just investors, but the services asset managers that
you work with over there are dealing with negative rates. What I hear is that there's a decent demand for
going into crypto because at least it's not negative interest rate. So how far is it until you -- or how long is
it until you offer crypto as one of your liquidity tools? Just kind of thinking, thinking out loud.

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

So Betsy, as you know, the financial markets are constantly innovating and evolving, and have for some
time period and in the business we're in, we absolutely have to keep pace with that, and do it in a way
that, again, it allows us to provide the safety and security for the clients in managing their assets. And
crypto and digital assets more broadly is right now, clearly, one of the areas that's evolving the fastest.
And so on that front, to your point, with regard to custody of crypto assets or cryptocurrencies, we've
partnered with Standard Chartered in a venture called Zodia, which will provide that crypto custody. And I
think what's important there, what we're trying to accomplish is leverage the traditional custody expertise
that we have, that Standard Chartered has as well, but do it in a fintech way. So that's why it's a separate
independent entity that, again, can develop and evolve at that pace. And at this point, we still expect at
some point in 2021 that will be approved for client use. Again, it's going to be done not only our own, I'll
call it, approvals, but also from a regulatory perspective. And then I think more broadly, to your point,
absolutely, we see many different potential opportunities in this space where clients will look at digital
assets and potentially cryptocurrencies in order to address various either challenges they have or ways
to earn better returns. And that's why we've not only done what I talked about in cryptocurrencies, but
more broadly with the digital assets, whether it's tokenization, which we've done with -- on the value,
whether it's developing a PE capability on blockchain which we've done with Broadridge, there's a number
of different areas where we've experimented either on our own or with partners in order to be able to be a
part of that innovation.

We will now move to our next question that is coming from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.

James Francis Mitchell
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Maybe just a question on the wealth management business. It seemed to be quite a bit of disparity in the
outcomes even though market appreciation, whether it's lag basis or month lag or full quarter lag, was
pretty similar. So is it just -- there's a lot more fee waivers in the Global Family Office. How do we think
about that sort of difference?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, you've hit it right. There is a distinction in the lag in that business, but that's not what drove it,
frankly. It was -- it's the waivers hit hard. And we've talked about the fact that people shouldn't see
waivers as linear. This is a good example, where the waivers -- that the GFO business is obviously much
more institutional. And so the waivers hit later. And we're now starting to see it come in, whereas the
regions have more traditional closer to, but not retail pricing. And so those waivers just hit earlier.

Second dynamic though is GFO is spiky. And we have clients there that will move billions of dollars. And
so you can have 1, 2, 3 clients that if they all have significant movements, then you'll -- you can see big

16

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

movements on a sequential basis. If you look year-over-year, the organic growth -- the growth rate overall
for GFO is actually slightly higher than the regions. But obviously, the sequential look was impacted by
those 2 things: one, waivers, and two, some spiky very large client movement.

James Francis Mitchell
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. And so the incremental hit to fee waivers, is that also going to be in 2Q more in Global Family Office
and maybe C&IS, or how do you think about the geography of that?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

I think we're -- I think from here, it's somewhat -- it's going to be more linear. I mean, the funds are
more -- they're all there at this point in waiver mode. And so I don't think we're going to see as big of a
disparity going forward. But people should just realize it's not a linear relationship. And I think there was
-- overall it was $22 billion, $23 billion in wealth, and 9 of that was in -- 9, almost 10 was in GFO. And so
that's a year-over-year look, that's just aggregate effectively. But the one quarter look, it was $5 million in
GFO alone. And so big -- that was the increase quarter-over-quarter.

Operator

Next, we'll move to Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler.

Jeffery J. Harte
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

To circle back a bit to the buyback. I mean, it's good to see you guys out there buying $135 million of
stock. Historically, it feels like the actual buyback comes in kind of below what at least our estimated
capacity is somewhat regularly. I think first quarter might have given us a partial edge with risk-weighted
asset growth. But can you help kind of differentiate kind of the buyback, the difference in your thinking
between just being conservative versus the expectation that risk-weighted assets could actually continue
ramping up like they did in the first quarter?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It's completely related, and it comes back to that theme of wanting to think about returns. And so
-- and for us, it's not like we're making a decision of do we buy back stock or just park money at the
Fed at 10 basis points. For us, we -- it's -- but it's nice to be able to see that client activity is driving the
alternative to share buybacks. So that's certainly not to say that we're doing 0 or very little. It's just to
say those are the different options we think about. And you saw sec lending activity up significantly. Just
the loan demand being up $1 billion, that's going to cause $1 billion in higher RWA just in of itself. And
then you see the deposits coming in, which is -- it's nice for us to be able to answer a client need, but that
comes with RWA as we redeploy it on the asset side. And so the best thing we can do is have the balance
sheet used for good return on equity activity that's client-related, building relationships in the long run.
But at the same time, we did do $150 million in share repurchase over the time frame. So it's not like
we were absent in the market, but you can imagine here at 12%, we're going to be looking at what does
AOCI look like, what does client activity look like and balancing all of those things together.

Jeffery J. Harte
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And just to touch on kind of the fee growth, I guess, growth across relative businesses. It seems
like C&IS has been outgrowing wealth management, at least outpacing it for a while now. I mean, is that
the right way that we should think about those 2 business trajectories going forward growth-wise? Or is
there a reason to think that kind of wealth management could start kind of catching up with C&IS?

Couple of things. One, every time -- over long periods of time, we think one of the businesses is growing
faster and we think all this is going to be the case for the future, you get an inflection. The businesses
have acted as good hedges to each other. And it's always difficult to predict those inflection points and
what's going to grow faster. For sure, if you look over the last couple or few years, you'd see C&IS having
grown faster. But in general, wealth has got good exposure to equity markets. And so -- and you also
think over the long run, there's good title growth, particularly at the top end of the wealth market. And so
those things should help as well. And so we wouldn't call a prediction necessarily on one of the businesses
over the long run and the future growing faster.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

And I would just add to Jason's comments. That's why we really like the combination of the 3 businesses.
Not only is it complementary from a client perspective, but also from a financial perspective, they have
different dynamics. So the asset servicing business, which has done a great job leading and growing at
a high rate, it also requires resources to do that as we've talked about that and has different levels of
volatility in the business, whereas in wealth management, very steady and at a high level of profitability
and scalable. And then with asset management, again, very high level of operating leverage in the
business. And as has been positioned over the last couple of years, for example, when you can get
positioned in the right products, for example, in liquidity, and the markets go up, the liquidity goes up.
Very strong increase in profitability for that and focus on other areas where we can have that same
dynamic with ESG and quant. So we like all the businesses, I would say, from a client competitive
perspective but also from a financial perspective.

Operator

We will now go to Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.

Robert Henry Wildhack
Autonomous Research LLP

Question from me on organic growth. I think a year ago, the prospects for organic growth were probably
more uncertain. And fast forward to today and your comments have been really positive. Coming out of
2020, do you see any new or different sources of organic growth that could maybe increase the long-term
sustainable rate you think you're capable of achieving?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

I'll start, and Mike, I'm sure has some comments on this as well. And let's take those -- let's take the
different businesses. In C&IS, we hinted even early today, the integrated trading solutions is something
we talked about a little bit over the last few months. That's come through. That's part of the reason I think
there's been that lift in brokerage commission income, done strategic things in foreign exchange and those
aren't -- so it's not accidental, I think, that we've had lift in those areas. And then front office solutions is
another area where we're trying to go to sophisticated clients and show the breadth of what we can do.

In wealth management, the engagement there is around expanding and continuing to invest in goals-
driven wealth management. And the growth we've had, particularly in the upper end, that product gets
to -- we've thought so much about what $50 million, $100 million and hundreds of millions of dollar
clients need in order to interact in a good holistic way and think we're set up well there. And then in asset
management, $215 billion, I remember about 1.5 years ago, where we were on a liquidity perspective to
now $275 billion And yes, there's been great growth in the industry, but they did a lot of hard things to
get cutoff times done well to get to open a Northern Trust portal-- there's so many different -- to invest
in the talent we have in that group. And then you think about our ESG and quant capabilities, ESG assets
are over $130 billion now, great engagement in -- across the Nordics with very strong client base there
and doing a lot with our ETF platform, including launching new products in Europe there. And so in each of
the areas, I think there's good opportunity for us to leverage the work that's been done to lead to stronger
organic growth

Sure. At 25,000 feet, you think about it as almost out -- trading outsourcing. Investment trading
outsourcing where a lot of clients realize -- a lot of our asset management clients realize that their core
competencies around security selection and research and not necessarily having the trading operations,
the back office that comes with that, trade order entry and so our ability to say, you can work with us and
we can be your effective outsourced trading partner, it appeals to a lot of asset management clients.

Vivek Juneja
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. So they don't have to have a trader anymore and you're just providing the back office for trading?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

No, it starts with trading. They can -- we can have portfolio managers and their middle office send us
model accounts, send us trades, and we can provide that service for them and be more of a full outsource
operation from them from middle office through trade execution and trade management.

Vivek Juneja
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. All right. I'll follow up maybe a little more offline. Going back to the capital question, Jason, Mike.
So I hear you, you want to obviously -- you're thinking about client needs and all of that stuff. But even if
we factor that in as we think about it, what level are you sort of comfortable running your various capital
ratios at? Whether it's Tier 1 leverage or whether it's CET1? Is it a 10% or is it an 11%? Whatever the
form it gets through, whether it's through loan growth, securities lending growth and/or buybacks, what is
sort of that cutoff point below which you don't want to go?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

From our perspective, I think it still is going to depend on where the industry -- where are our peers. And
regulators asking us to hold on to capital, to not buyback stock at that time. I don't -- we don't call an
absolute level. We haven't talked about our buffers externally. Obviously, we're running significantly above
any regulatory minimum. But we haven't -- and so we've got buffers that we use internally to manage
that, not something we've talked about externally. But when we engage with clients, we want to be able
to continue telling them that they've got -- they're interacting with a balance sheet that's strong on an
absolute and a relative basis. And it doesn't have -- it's part of our strategic strength when we talk to
clients. And a lot of institutions you think about, not just pension funds, but even sovereign wealth funds,
if they're investing -- if they're depositing $500 million, $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion, they're not really
depositing, they're lending to their banks at that point, and they want to be operating with institutions
that are strong. And so we're always going to be looking and seeing where the tides are in the industry to
make sure we reflect strong capital levels.

Our next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Jason and Mike, can you guys share with us -- I know you're not a prime broker. But there was that
trading mishap in March with supposedly a large family office, which probably was a hedge fund. But can
you just give us any color because we've never seen any risk in your Global Family Office business at
all. Can you reassure us that's still the case? And just maybe some color around how you manage that
business and manage those risks?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Well, couple of things. I mean, you're right, we're not a prime broker. And so we're not providing
the type of trading leverage to -- or alongside clients in taking positions is we're dealing with either our
hedge fund clients or our family office clients. In the family office business, we have some loans, but
those are much more of the loans that we see in the traditional wealth business, which are loans against
investments that clients will have and long-term clients, they're not taking that type of exposure. And so
the -- and the services that we provide for our hedge fund clients and our GFO clients, it's much more
about asset servicing, asset administration, investment reporting. That's how we're going to market to
deal with those types of clients. And so just to put anybody's minds at rest, we didn't have any exposure
to the hedge fund/family office that you're talking about, and don't see that type of exposure in our
portfolios.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Speaking of asset servicing and reporting that you just did, is there an opportunity to capitalize then if
the SEC requires more disclosure from the family office organizations as a possibility as a result of what
happened. Would that be an opportunity for you guys to do more work for your customers and therefore
maybe more revenues?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It's an interesting nuance because we -- a lot of our clients on the hedge space, they actually are
SEC registered and so we're used to dealing with them and helping those types of institutions on doing
the reporting and administration that they need to do for their SEC registration material and engagement.
And so that would be -- I don't think it's a monumental opportunity for us, we haven't talked about it that
way, but certainly, we have that capability set and would be seen as a strong provider for hedge funds
that we're looking to have more of a traditional investment reporting and overall fund administration
engagement with their service providers.

We will take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Two quick questions. One -- first one on the comp expenses. I heard that $32 million of comp was
retirement eligible. And then did you also say that you absorbed the merit increases year-over-year, so
those are getting paid out in the first quarter now? I thought those was getting paid out in the second
quarter historically. I'm just trying to think of the 2Q to 1Q trend here for comp?

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Yes. No, the merit will come through second quarter. What I did mention earlier was that this may have
been what you -- what got your mind going is we -- the reduction in overall FTE and headcount for the
company did lead to a lower salary level in the quarter. But that won't off -- but that's not -- that's distinct
from the merit increases.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

And just to clarify, this is Mark. The base pay adjustment the year-over-year increase is still reflecting of
any base pay adjustments that happened in the previous year. We're still lapping that. So if that's what
you were referring to, Brian, in the release or in some of the comments we made, that would have been
what that was referring to, not this year.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then can you also just talk about the trends in investment management. I think if you adjust
for the fee waivers, looking at the first quarter relative to the third quarter, you're not seeing much in
terms of revenue growth despite the change in market levels over that time period. Could you just maybe
touch on the flows in that segment?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Mark may want to touch on flows in general, but...

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Yes, so on the C&IS line, I think that's what you're looking at the investment management fees. On a
sequential basis, ex waivers, I think we were up about 6%. Probably 3/4 of that -- 2/3 to 3/4 of that
came from market lift. So there was some sequential organic growth there. But I don't know if that's what
specifically you're looking at.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

For the fee waivers. So -- I mean, it sounds like flow trends in there more positive?

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Yes. There were some flow activity that we saw there. Like Mike had mentioned, we've been seeing good
growth in ESG, some of the quant active products as well. But the waivers, they on a sequential basis,
certainly kind of overwhelmed what we saw from both favorable markets as well as business flows.

Operator

That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Bette, at this time, I will turn the conference
to you for any final remarks.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you in July for our second quarter update.

Operator
Thank you. And thank you all for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now
disconnect.
