Presentation

Operator

Welcome to Broadcom Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time,
for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Beatrice Russotto, Director of
Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc. Please go ahead.

Beatrice F. Russotto
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President
and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom.

After the market closed, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial
performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the
information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is
being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be
archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.

During the prepared comments, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year
2020 results, guidance for our fourth quarter as well as commentary regarding the business environment.
We'll take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today
and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual
results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.

In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A
reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached in today's press
release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Hock.

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

I have to say that the strength of our broad and diversified portfolio of leadership technology franchises
led to record third quarter revenue for Broadcom despite these uncertain times we continue to operate
in. We remain well positioned to address the work-from-home environment, especially with many of our
networking and broadband products in the cloud and telcos. In addition, we expect to soon start from
benefiting from the transition to 5G and new product ramps later this year. While there continues to
be ebb and flow in the parts of our business linked to enterprise, this is somewhat offset by the highly
recurring revenue of our infrastructure software divisions. So as a result, we remain confident in the
strategy we have laid out over the past several years, delivering sustainable revenue and significant cash
flow margins while remaining focused on total shareholder return.

Let me now provide further detail on our third quarter results. We delivered net revenue of $5.8 billion,
above the midpoint of our guidance and up 1% sequentially and up 6% year-on-year. Semiconductor
solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.6
billion, up 41% year-on-year, which, of course, does include the contribution from Symantec in 2020.

Starting with semiconductors. Our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially driven by
continued strength in networking and broadband. Networking was up 9% sequentially due to continued
healthy demand from our cloud customers as we began to ramp for next-generation Tomahawk 3 and
Trident 3 switch products. Routing demand also remains strong as telcos launch our Jericho 2 in the EDGE
and core networks. We expect the strength in networking that we have experienced since the beginning

BROADCOM INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 03, 2020

of this fiscal year to sustain in Q4, with continued demand from cloud and telcos driving solid sequential
growth.

Turning to broadband, which was up 7% sequentially in Q3. We continue to see strong demand for the
next-generation cable modem DOCSIS 3.1, which was partially offset by a decline in the satellite set-top
boxes. We also continue to see strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation access gateways in telcos and
consumer and even in large enterprises. Telecom and consumer have been particularly strong driven by
work-from-home environment. But after a strong Q3, we expect the strength in broadband revenue to
take a pause and come down on a sequential basis by approximately 10% in Q4. Keep in mind, however,
this will still be up 20% on a year-on-year basis.

Moving on, wireless was down 4% sequentially in Q3 due to the expected typical ramp being pushed out
this year. This is expected to result in a significant uplift, however, in wireless revenue of approximately
50% sequentially in Q4. Despite this significant sequential ramp and a significant increase in our RF
content, we expect revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year in Q4. Now this is due to fewer units of our
parts for the next-generation phone being shipped in the fourth quarter this year relative to last year due
to this product delay. That being said, we currently expect Q1 revenue in wireless to be up sequentially
from Q4 with an increase in expected unit shipments of our parts for the next-generation phone compared
to Q1 last year. In other words, the launch ramp this year is expected to complete only in Q1 where it's
normally been completed in Q4 of previous years.

In server storage connectivity where the majority of the revenue is tied to enterprise, Q3 was up 10%
sequentially. However, expected softness in enterprise demand will likely result in server storage revenue
declining in high single digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4.

Turning last to industrial. Resales and revenues were both down 3% sequentially in Q3. In Q4, we expect
resales to continue to hold up. However, we are taking the opportunity to further reduce our channel
inventory significantly. And as a result, we expect industrial revenue to be down double digits quarter-
over-quarter in Q4.

So in summary, our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially in Q3. And given the
continuing surge of demand in networking and the expected 5G phone ramp in wireless, we expect a mid-
teens percentage sequential increase in our fourth fiscal quarter. We should note, on a year-on-year basis,
Q4 will mark a return to growth for our semiconductor segment overall, which we think is a key inflection
point for Broadcom and which we expect to sustain into Q1.

Now turning to software. CA was up 6% year-on-year, flat sequentially. Bookings at our core accounts
continued to grow double digits year-on-year and has offset the expected reduction in the services
business. Symantec was flat sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. Similar to
CA, bookings in our Symantec core accounts are growing, offsetting the transition out of the smaller
commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. Brocade was up 3% year-on-year and,
as expected, was down significantly sequentially. Looking ahead to next quarter on a sequential basis, we
expect revenues from CA to sustain and expect Symantec revenue to be up 4%. We anticipate Brocade
revenue to be relatively flat on a sequential basis. And as a result, revenue from the software segment is
expected to be up by a low single-digit percentage sequentially in the fourth quarter.

So in summary, we expect our fourth quarter net revenue to be $6.4 billion, up 10% sequentially
from Q3. This reflects an approximate mid-teens percentage sequential projected revenue increase
in the semiconductor solutions side and a low single-digit percentage sequential revenue increase in
infrastructure software.

With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.

Thomas H. Krause
CFO & Secretary

Thank you, Hock. Let me provide some additional detail on our financial performance.

BROADCOM INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 03, 2020

First, on the P&L, gross margins were a record 74% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 110
basis points from Q2 and up approximately 320 basis points year-on-year. The year-on-year increase in
software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove a large part of the increase.

Operating income from continuing operations was $3.2 billion and represented 55% of net revenue.
Operating margins were up approximately 180 basis points quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year,
primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses and better gross margin due to mix. Operating
expenses were $1.1 billion, which was down $25 million compared to Q2. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3
billion and represented 57% of net revenue. This figure excludes $138 million of depreciation.

Looking at cash flow, we had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue.
This is up a little more than 33% year-on-year.

Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash
dividends. We also paid $192 million in withholding taxes due on vesting employee equity, resulting in
elimination of approximately 700,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 404 million outstanding
common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to
stay at 451 million in Q4.

On the financing and balance sheet front, we reduced total debt by $1.9 billion in the quarter. As we
discussed on our last earnings call, we executed an $8 billion bond refinancing and $3.9 billion exchange
offering. Through the refinancing and liability management activities we've undertaken this year, we've
been able to push out our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 6 years and reduce our
weighted average interest rate to approximately 3%. All told, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of
cash and currently have $13.9 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. We ended the quarter
with $44 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. Finally, given our strong
free cash flow generation and as we look to further deleverage the balance sheet, we plan to pay down an
additional $3 billion of debt in our fiscal fourth quarter.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for
questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is Vivek Arya of Bank of America.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Actually, just a quick clarification and a question. Clarification, I just wanted to make sure your outlook
kind of excludes or reflects if there are any restrictions on shipment to any Chinese customers. And
then, Hock, my real question is on 5G. You gave us very good color on the near-term trends. But what
have you seen in the first market for 5G, which was China? As the transition happened very quickly, the
majority of phones there are now 5G. Do you see that to be the case for your exposure also in that a
bigger percentage of the phones you're shipping into can be 5G so you see the content benefits faster
than you might have thought before?

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

By the way, to answer the first question, our current outlook covers all aspects, including what you
indicated with regard to export restrictions and everything else. All those are comprehended. And as
regards to 5G, we see the -- to be honest, we don't know -- if we're talking about devices, phones, it's --
that's an interesting question. It's very consumer-driven. And right now, to be honest about this, we don't
know how fast the ramp on 5G will occur. I understand what you said about China and understand how
operators might push to make that happen in terms of incentives. Where we stand at this point, we are
seeing the demand more coming from our OEM -- key strategic OEM customers. And what we reflect is the
demand that has been shared with us from our OEM customers.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Thanks for all the detail on the end markets on the semiconductor side. Hock, I wanted to dive a little bit
into the networking portion where you said the cloud side and the telecom side is strong. There's been
some fear in the end market as a whole that we're potentially entering a digestion phase from the cloud
side of that equation. And then very recently, one of your pseudo-competitors talked about some service
provider lull in demand there as well. It doesn't seem like you're seeing that. Is the end market different
in your view? Is it weakening or not? Or are you just overcoming that with company-specific new product
launches and ramps?

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

Well they -- there's clearly -- we have clearly been helped by the fact that we have quite a few new
programs, new products. Next-generation products, I would say, have been launched. And these are
leadership products, as I've always indicated. So in that sense, we stand in a fairly unique position of
being able to harvest or garner a lot of the share in that business. But based on what we are seeing,
we're not seeing any weakness in the cloud nor in the telcos. We are, in fact, seeing continued sustained
demand for the products -- for our networking products in these sectors.

Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Crédit Suisse.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Hock, for obvious reasons, investors focus a lot of attention on the wireless handset cycle and your
content growth there. I'm wondering if you could spend just a few minutes talking about the WiFi 6
uptake. You clearly, in your prepared comments, said that that's being a strong tailwind right now. Help
us understand what inning of that upgrade cycle you think we're in. How does your content look as we
go to WiFi 6? And do you think that this work-from-home phenomenon has put enough attention on the
consumer that there's a big installed base upgrade cycle coming or not? How do you -- how could you help
us characterize that?

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

Okay. Well again, that's a very interesting question on WiFi 6 because, with regard to WiFi, that's a
key franchise we invest a lot of resources into. We're talking about investing considerable dollars, R&D
dollars, in this space because we are needed on 2 areas. As you probably know, we supply WiFi, the latest
leadership products, in flagship phones, particularly in our strategic North American OEM. We provide
all those WiFi/Bluetooth combo chips, which provides the latest features in those. And that's one area
where we have a strong leadership position. We also have a very strong leadership position in WiFi 6, the
current 802.11ax generation in access -- what they call, mention, access gateways. Basically, it's almost
like home infrastructure, connectivity in the homes, connectivity in the offices, enterprises and offices, and
connectivity that's provided now as service providers and telcos bring signals, bring -- basically bring data,
video signals into houses -- into your homes.

And in this environment of work from home, we are seeing a strong surge of demand from telcos, service
providers as they expand this WiFi service as part of broadband to the homes because those terminations,
whether it's cable, fiber or copper DSL very often terminates in WiFi access gateways that allows the
signals to be in the home. Also, we're also seeing that many homes, many consumers are themselves
upgrading connectivity in their homes by going out and buying retail routers. As we all know it, WiFi retail
route is the latest generation, which we are very well featured in for the own homes, and that's creating a
very strong surge of demand of what I call broadband and what is a lot -- what a lot of it comprises WiFi
6.

Operator

Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley.

Craig Matthew Hettenbach
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Hock, I wanted to ask about the ASIC business and the building blocks you have there. I know you've
seen strong growth in compute off-load. There was a story out last week, you might be working with
Tesla on ASIC design. Can you just talk about the competitive strength you have for this technology and,
importantly, how you allocate resources? Because I'm sure there might be more opportunities in terms of
how you allocate and what you commit to.

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

The ASIC business is something we've been doing for many, many years, and we got -- it's gone through
various evolutions. But in many ways, we have gone from strength to strength simply because of the
breadth of our portfolio of IP cores in silicon. Obviously, ASIC is still tied to silicon. We have a lot of it. We
have lots of intellectual property capabilities, and we've been doing it for a long time. And I'll be honest,
you make a lot more money -- it's a much more sustainable model running merchant silicon than in ASIC.
It's a broader market. You create products that can be more innovative in many ways because you -- we
include software with many of our merchant silicon, whether it's our switch, whether it's our broadband
chips, WiFi chips. We provide SDK. We provide interface, software-driven, makes it programmable. All
that gives it flexibility. ASIC is still a very core part of our business, and we do very well by it. And it's a
business, though, we see that has certain limitations.

Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I wanted to ask you about lead times. I know you talked a lot about supply constraints last quarter
and constraints that were potentially extending into the second half. Can you give us some feeling of
where your lead times were maybe entering the quarter and now where they stand exiting the quarter?
Have they come in? And what's the state of that -- of those supply constraints that you've talked about
previously?

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

Good question, and especially following up from our last earnings call 3 months ago in the midst of
COVID-19 situation at that time, as we are still by the way. But as you know, pre-COVID-19, as we got
into fiscal '20 and the semiconductor industry started to improve, we had indicated and you all inferred,
there were certain constraints, supply chain constraints, particularly in regard to wafers, especially
leading-edge wafers, leading -- the most advanced node, leading-edge wafers and even then, substrates,
particular substrates, that needed to package semiconductors. COVID-19 shows up, just creates a layer
of complexity on supply chain. And the reason was, as we indicated 3 months ago, depending on where
you outsource -- or where factories are, especially in Asia, parts of Asia, you face situations of lockdowns,
operating under capacity.

And we faced them. We faced that for several months. Now that has normalized somewhat in terms of
the back end where we have 10 assembly factories that were locked down or running below capacity.
Most of that has been resolved. Having said that, the constraint on supply chain, constraint on wafers and
substrates continues. And that's what we still face today. And so lead -- to be honest, our lead times are
still very extended based on the technology nodes and the particular products that we produce and sell.
And given the kind of products we do, we see some of that constraint. And I'll be direct, we could have
shipped more in Q3 if such constraints were not as tight.

Operator

Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congratulations on the solid execution and strong free cash flow. If I look at the free cash flow for the first
9 months of the fiscal year and your EBITDA guidance for Q4, sort of back of the envelope, I'm coming
up with free cash flow growing year-over-year to around $11.5 billion for the fiscal year, which would
imply that the team should be in a position to raise the dividend to at least $14, or probably more, from
December of this year? Number one is, am I in the ballpark? And Tom, anything that we should be aware
of in terms of working capital or collections that could impact the normalized free cash flow this fiscal
quarter?

Thomas H. Krause
CFO & Secretary

No, Harlan, your math is fairly spot on. I think we clearly are going to assess the dividend at the end of
the year. But keep in mind, we are in a recession. We're still dealing with COVID. We've got an election
coming. And so I think we want to wait, obviously, until we get to the end of the year, talk to the Board,
look at the outlook for '21 before we jump to any conclusions. But you're right. I mean our capital
allocation policy is to allocate approximately half of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of
the dividend. We've had that in place now for several years, and we think that's the right approach. We're
going to continue to take the other 50%, manage the balance sheet as we are this year.

BROADCOM INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 03, 2020

We paid down a considerable amount of debt by the end of this year, $5 billion, which we're happy with.
We think the balance sheet is in a very good place as we exited fiscal '20. And then we're back to sort
of, I think, a normal behavior in terms of looking at how to drive the total shareholder return above
and beyond the dividend, allocating capital, either to M&A and/or to buybacks. And so we'll address the
dividend question, as we always do, at the end of the fiscal year but look forward to executing in this
quarter, posting results and then having that discussion.

Operator

Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask about margins long term, your aspiration specifically. You're clearly executing really, really
well in the near term, both at the gross margin level as well as the operating margin level. Tom, I guess,
historically, you've talked about product mix and business mix being the key driver for gross margins.
Is that still the case? Or are there specific levers that you can pull to potentially improve gross margins
further? And I guess more importantly, how should we think about go-forward OpEx leverage given the
current mix between semis and software?

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

Let me take the first part. Tom can give you the second part as we put in software. But on semiconductors
particularly, and this is not a philosophy -- or this is not a model that we're just coming out with. It's
always been there. It's the nature of technology and nature of the semiconductor technology markets. As
you know, we have a broad portfolio of this franchise leadership products. And we come out with them,
come out with next-generation products, in a very steady cadence of product life cycle. For instance, in
wireless, our products come out every 12, 18 months, a new generation of products; in networking, 2, 3
years; storage, 4, 5 years; industrial, anywhere from 4 to 8 years. But it comes on.

And that's why we put in the R&D to make sure our products create value for customers, each new
generation adding more value. And with each generation that we add value, we have the opportunity to
extract and ratchet up the value, financial value, for delivering on this much better, higher-performance
products. It's a natural cycle. And so with revenue generation, your margin improves. Think about it, we
have a range of about 16, 17 broad range of products in various end markets with different product cycles.
You do go through that model. What we have seen empirically, over the last 10 years, is the gross margin
of this mix of products grows naturally -- expands naturally 50 to 100 basis points each year. It comes
with the nature of the business.

Thomas H. Krause
CFO & Secretary

Yes. So I mean I think when you take that and you look at -- and we highlighted in the prepared remarks
the semiconductor business turning the corner and now returning to growth, which I think is important.
You layer in increasing diversification from software and the scale that affords us and, of course, the
margins that it brings, especially with the synergies on the go-to-market that we're driving, I think over
the horizon here, I think we see a path, frankly, of 30% to 60% EBITDA margins. I think that's the next
stop. But I think Hock's right, we have consequently, over many, many years, by driving more content
increase through R&D investments, been able to drive margins up incrementally and that will contribute to
the overall success of the margin increases that we see coming.

I just want to ask on the networking segment, and thanks for all the detail on the segments. I guess,
if you put all that in there, it looks like networking growth would actually accelerate, I mean, at double
digits. So I'm just kind of curious, if you look at the 3 segments, service provider, data center and
enterprise, just some comments. I know you have product cycles that are driving a lot of the growth but
just kind of curious on your thoughts on the market embedded in that guidance.

Thomas H. Krause
CFO & Secretary

Yes. So Blayne, I mean I think Hock talked about it, but I think it's clear cloud continues to grow for us.
I think we have a very strong product cycle in telcos, which probably gets underappreciated, especially
in the routing side. And then, look, we have a lot of different angles into enterprise, obviously, with the
software portfolio, with Brocade on the fiber channel side, things we do within the server market. I mean
it's clear that's slowing down. We saw that at the end of the third quarter. We're seeing that as we get into
the end of the year. There's some indication, given the lead times we have, that actually that's stabilizing
at these lower levels. I think it's a little bit too early to tell what's going to happen as we go into the
beginning of the calendar year. But it's obvious to us, at least right now, it's cloud and telco driving that
growth.

Operator

Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.

Harsh V. Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

First of all, congratulations on strong execution. Hock, I wanted to ask about, when I look at your software
businesses, I see sometimes bookings in double digits, but the revenue growth is a lot lower than that.
And I wanted to understand that mechanism why the revenues are always lagging your order growth rate.
And then, are you done with the attrition of customers in Symantec? Or what is the expected time frame
for that?

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

Okay. By the way, the first part of that question is pretty interesting. Yes, that's almost -- the simplest
way to look at it is we sign software contracts, whether it's on subscription or even on license and
maintenance, for a 3-year term contracts, 3 years. So at any point in time, at any 1 year, you're really
seeing only roughly 1/3 of our outstanding contract backlog coming up for renewals. And so we -- so
for those 1/3 contracts, we are seeing that double-digit booking growth as we renew those contracts,
bookings being referred to as renewals of those contracts. So when you take that part, and keep in mind,
you still have the other 2/3 backlog that continues, we recognize revenue ratably, very much so.

Every contract we sign up at renewal, we rate -- we recognize revenue ratably over 3 years so you have
to dilute that in. And that's why what happens is that double-digit bookings rate increase translates when
it's diluted with the rest of the backlog that is chugging along steadily flat to effectively a mid-single-digit
growth rate in revenue. That's the way the math works. And we've been able to do that very, very well,
especially in our core accounts.

Your wireless business is booming, obviously, on the 5G release with your largest customer, but maybe
we can talk about a little bit longer term. There's no secret, your largest customers' largest initiative is to
do their own baseband modem. And I mean that's a job unto itself. The interface, the entire RF front end,
has to usually be designed by somebody other than the baseband guys. That's the case for all baseband

providers now. In fact, most baseband from MediaTek to Qualcomm are turning to the incumbents, the
large RF semi companies, to do the actual architecture design itself.

Since you are the strategic partner for the largest portion of that, is it fair to assume that you will be
intimately involved in this? And does that change the nature of your relationship in terms of revenue
growth or margins? Because this is a once in a company history event for your largest customer, if they
can get it working, they're going to need all the help they can get. So how does this affect the margin
profile and, more importantly, the revenue growth over the next 2, 3 years in wireless?

Hock E. Tan
CEO, President & Executive Director

Ed, I love the fact that you know so much about this business. And equally, you will know, I can't
comment on that, sorry.

Operator

Our final question comes from of C.J. Muse of Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess just a follow-up. You talked about extended lead times, you talked about wireless growing into
fiscal Q1 and you also highlighted the semiconductor solutions sustaining into Q1. So as we put all that
together and obvious strength, particularly of the networking side, is it fair to say that semiconductor
should grow again into January?

Thomas H. Krause
CFO & Secretary

Yes, C.J. I mean I think what we wanted to highlight was, given the shift in the product launch for the big
phone customer, we wanted to give some color on how that translates into Q1 since that doesn't happen
very often. I think I can recall it happening a couple of years ago, it doesn't happen very often. And I think
we also wanted to be clear, given the lead times, that we do have reason of visibility, especially into some
of the growth areas like networking that we talked about. And so we do feel comfortable. I think this is the
first quarter in a while where semiconductor is going to be up year-over-year. And as you look into Q1, we
feel comfortable that we can sustain that.

Operator

Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Russotto for any closing remarks.

Beatrice F. Russotto
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. So in closing, we did want to note that Hock will be presenting virtually at the
Deutsche Bank Technology Conference on Tuesday, September 15.

And with that, that will conclude our earnings call today, and we thank you all for joining. Operator, you
may end the call.

Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You
may all disconnect. Have a great day.
