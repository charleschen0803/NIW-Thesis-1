Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody
I'm starting on slide 5 for those following presentation online
I'm going to go into greater detail on the slides to come, but let me give a quick summary of the consolidated numbers
Our fourth quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses
Consolidated revenue increased 9.2% and operating cash flow grew 7.8% for the fourth quarter, reflecting solid growth in our operating businesses
Earnings per share was $0.95, a 20.3% increase compared to a year ago
On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 9.9% to $0.89. Free cash flow during the quarter increased 64.2% to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by growth in operating cash flow and improvements in working capital
For the full year, we generated $8.2 billion of free cash flow, a decline of 8.2%
This decline was mainly driven by higher working capital and capital expenditures
So now let's start with Cable Communications on slide 6. Cable Communications delivered strong fourth quarter results
Revenue increased 7.1% to $12.8 billion, as we added 258,000 customer relationships and reduced churn across all products
In fact, we have improved churn in Video and high-speed data for 12 consecutive quarters, which we believe is driven by the positive benefits of the X1 platform, our best-in-class high-speed data product and the meaningful strides we have made in improving customer service
High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth
Revenue increased 9% to $3.5 billion in the quarter, reflecting an increase in our customer base and rate adjustments
Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 385,000 net residential and business high speed data customers in the quarter and added 1.4 million net customers during the full year, our best full year results in nine years
Our high-speed data penetration is 43.8%, up from 41.9% a year ago, as customers continue to respond to our product differentiation
Through consistent investment and innovation, we offer the best broadband product on the market
We double the capacity of our network every 18 to 24 months, have increased Internet speed 17 times in the past 16 years, and now over 50% of our residential customers have speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher
Coupled with the best in-home WiFi experience, we believe this greatly increases our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation
Looking ahead in 2017 and beyond, we think there's a lot of runway to continue to grow high-speed data subscribers
Video revenue increased 4.3% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments and customers subscribing to additional services
In terms of volume, we added an impressive combined 161,000 net Video customers in 2016, compared to a loss of 36,000 customers in 2015. This is the first time in 10 years that we have added Video customers for a full year
We ended the year strong, adding 80,000 net Video customers in the fourth quarter, driven by continued improvements in customer retention, better market segmentation and broader recognition of what we believe is the best video product on the market
Our X1 platform is a real competitive differentiator, and we have made good progress rolling it out
We deployed X1 to 936,000 net new and existing customers during the quarter, ending the year with 48% of our residential Video customers having X1 compared to 30% a year ago
Even as we have expanded the base of X1 customers, the positive benefits continue with better retention, improved customer satisfaction, and higher Net Promoter Scores for X1 customers
As a result, we will continue our rollout of X1 at a healthy pace, with an expectation that year end 2017 penetration will be in the low 60%s range
Voice revenue declined by 3% to $873 million in the fourth quarter, as the positive impact of adding a combined 44,000 net customers was offset by a modest decline in ARPU. The strong results in Business Services continued in the fourth quarter
Revenues increased 14.5% to $1.4 billion during the quarter, with the small business segment accounting for over 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers
Revenue for the midsize business segment had a higher growth rate, fueled primarily by additional Ethernet sites as we continue to invest in expanding that business
Cable Advertising revenue increased 14.9% to $728 million, reflecting higher political revenue related to the elections
Excluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue decreased 1.9%
Turning to slide 7, fourth quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $5.2 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.4% compared to 40.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The change in margin was driven by higher expenses, primarily related to programming
Programming expenses grew 12.2% during the quarter, reflecting the timing of contract renewals, while the full year increased 10.1%
The underlying increases continue to be driven by higher retransmission consent fees and higher sports programming costs
For 2017, we expect programming expense growth of approximately 13%, driven by contract renewals that began in the second half of 2016 as well as additional contract renewals beginning in the first quarter
We continue to believe that in the years following 2017, programming expense growth should normalize to historic levels of high single-digit growth
Non-programming expenses increased 4.8% for the quarter, which is lower than the full year growth of 5.7%
The fourth quarter growth reflects higher expenses to continue the rollout of X1, but these are partially offset by benefits we are beginning to realize from the investments we have made to improve the customer experience over the past several quarters
Notably, customer service expenses declined 2.1% this quarter
We expect the rate of growth for non-programming expenses to trend lower in 2017 compared to 2016, as we continue to benefit from our customer experience initiatives and disciplined cost management
Our focus on cost controls, along with modest rate adjustments and growth in high margin businesses like high-speed data and Business Services, should allow us to again mostly offset the impact of elevated programming expense growth
As a result, our outlook for 2017 Cable operating margin is that it will be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.2% in 2016. So now, let's move onto NBCUniversal's results
On slide 8, you can see NBCUniversal's revenue increased 13% and operating cash flow increased 14% in the quarter
Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue increased 10.5% and operating cash flow increased 7.8%
Cable Networks revenue increased 4% and operating cash flow increased 2.4% to $916 million, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue, partially offset by an increase in programming and production expenses, including higher sports rights costs
Distribution revenue increased 4.7%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks
Content licensing and other revenue increased 14.6%, due to the timing of content provided under licensing agreements as well as the sale of USA's Falling Water into SVOD
Advertising revenue increased slightly, as higher rates were mostly offset by ratings declines
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter, with revenue growth of 14% and operating cash flow growth of 21.1%, to $264 million
This increase reflects higher advertising, content licensing and retransmission revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production spending
Advertising revenue growth of 12.4% included our premiere of Thursday Night Football and higher political advertising
Excluding these, advertising increased modestly, as strong pricing from the upfront outpaced ratings declines
Content licensing increased 20.2%, primarily due to the availability of content provided under licensing agreements
Last, retransmission revenue increased 55% to over $200 million for the quarter, and totaled nearly $850 million for the full year
In 2017, retransmission revenues should reach nearly $1.4 billion, an increase of almost 65% over 2016, as a result of the recent successful renewals of a number of our distribution agreements
Film revenue increased 12.6% to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow declined 15.3% to $121 million
These results reflect the full quarter of DreamWorks, which we acquired at the end of August
While the strong box office performance of Sing drove a 97% increase in theatrical revenue during the quarter, a tough home entertainment comparison to last year and DreamWorks-related expenses resulted in the 15.3% decline in OCF
For the year, Film generated about $700 million in OCF
While this is down 43.5%, due to the difficult comparison to the record results that we achieved in 2015, 2016 nonetheless proved to be one of the best years in the history of our film studio
And in 2017, we are excited to have some of our biggest franchises return
Theme Parks revenue increased 32.1% to $1.3 billion
And operating cash flow increased 41.9% to $640 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis for Universal Japan, revenue increased 13.2% and operating cash flow increased 18.4%
These results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, driven by new attractions including The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood, King Kong and The Incredible Hulk in Orlando, and the Jurassic Park Coaster in Japan
In addition, the stronger Japanese yen has a positive impact, accounting for about 20% of the overall OCF growth
Partially offsetting these results were higher costs associated with new attractions, and the impact of having to close our Orlando Park for two days due to Hurricane Matthew
As we look to 2017, we expect our investments in new attractions to continue to drive growth
As Brian mentioned, we are looking forward to Orlando opening a third gate with the Volcano Bay Water Park
In addition, we will be opening a Jimmy Fallon attraction in Orlando, and bringing the successful Despicable Me attraction to Japan
Let's move to slide 9 now to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures
Consolidated capital expenditures decreased 2.4% to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter
At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 1.5% to $2.1 billion for the quarter and increased 7.9% to $7.6 billion for the full year, resulting in capital intensity of 15.2%, which is in line with the plan we outlined at the beginning of the year
The full year was led by customer premise equipment including X1 and wireless gateways, which remained the largest component of our capital expenditures, though spending declined modestly year-over-year
We also invested in our network through increased spending in line extensions as we extended our network to more business and residential customers and in scalable infrastructure as we invested to increase our network capacity
These investments enhance our competitive position, allowing us to continue to take advantage of opportunities to grow penetration and market share by delivering the best broadband product to more homes and businesses
For 2017, spending on CPE is expected to continue to decline, while we increase our investment in network capacity as well as our investment in line extensions to reach more customers
As a result, our outlook is for 2017 capital intensity to remain flat to 2016 at approximately 15%
Longer-term, as spending on CPE continues to decline as X1 scales and shifts to less expensive IP devices, we expect to see a decline in overall capital intensity
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures decreased 17.2% to $461 million in the fourth quarter and increased 4.8% to $1.5 billion for the full year
The full year growth was primarily driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan and investments in the Orlando Park
In 2017, NBCUniversal's capital investment plan is expected to increase approximately 10%, reflecting the continued spending in Theme Parks, as these investments are clearly generating strong returns as they drive increased attendance and per capita spending
Now before finishing on return of capital, let me build on Brian's earlier comments on wireless
In terms of how we'll report on our wireless initiative, we'll report the results of wireless in the Corporate and Other segment
And once the business is launched, we'll provide quarterly reporting on its key financial metrics
The only guidance we can provide for 2017, since we still haven't launched our offering, is that the OCF of the Corporate and Other segment may see an additional $200 million to $300 million drag over the approximately $900 million of negative OCF in 2016. Separate from the OCF impact of wireless is the working capital impact of providing handsets
Our approach will be to purchase the phones and collect handset-related payments from our wireless customers over time
While this approach to handset financing will impact the timing of our free cash flow recognition, we wouldn't expect it to impact overall company capital allocation plans
We are excited to launch and learn from our wireless initiative in 2017. Now, let's finish on slide 10 with our capital allocation plans
To remind everyone, our capital allocation plan is a balance of several important priorities
The first is investing in our businesses to increase the long-term earnings capacity of the company, including our CapEx investment, the deployment of capital to enhance our existing businesses, and exploring growth opportunities
I believe the plan we have for 2017 will continue to demonstrate our prudent and consistent approach to investing in our businesses
The second aspect of the balance is a healthy and steady return of capital to shareholders
As you can see on the left side of the page, Comcast has a great track record of consistent capital returns
In 2016, we returned $7.6 billion to shareholders, comprised of $2.6 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases
For 2017, we are increasing our dividend 15% to $1.26 per share, which reflects our efforts to deliver a prudent dividend payout ratio balanced with a competitive relative yield, consistent with ranges in which the company has operated in the past
We believe we have a strong history in this respect
This is the ninth consecutive annual increase in the dividend
And the compound annual growth rate in our dividend from 2009 to 2016 was 22.2% versus 10.3% for the S&P 500. In addition to the dividend increase, we expect to buy back $5 billion of stock in 2017, similar to our buyback in 2016. And the last element of balancing our capital return priorities is the imperative to maintain a strong balance sheet
We ended 2016 at 2.2 times leverage, and we continue to be comfortable operating with leverage around this level
That concludes our summary of the quarter
I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results as well as our momentum as we begin 2017. Now, I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A session
Ben, it's Mike
So on free cash flow in 2016, the decline was for the reasons we talked about on this call a year ago
It was a year where we had, in particular, a drag on working capital given the Olympics
But as you look at 2017, based on everything we've said earlier on this call, the operating results and momentum in both of the operating businesses, as well as a plan for good investments in the businesses, net of all that is we expect to grow free cash flow in 2017. Beyond that, I would say it's our expectation to be growing free cash flow over the long term, though one year to the next, we'll have some variability based upon some of the investments and, obviously, some of the business cycles, but we do focus on it
It's a big, important factor as we're running the company
It's not the only thing we look at, though
So hopefully, that covers it for you
So just on handsets, I made the point earlier that the whole thing in wireless is going be success-based, so I would wrap the comments on free cash flow for 2017 in what I said earlier
We expect to grow inclusive of everything and more to come later when we actually come back to talk about the wireless launch
And, Marci, it's Mike
On capital return, it is an annual exercise
We take it seriously this time of the year and give what we think is the right guidance for what we'll do in the course of the year, factoring in everything we have a point of view on, obviously
So that would include everything, but, in this case, corporate tax reform
Corporate tax reform, we're in a wait and see mode
We're big supporters of the idea of corporate tax reform
We think it would be good for the U.S
economy, but none of our capital plans, none of what I've described today are counting on any particular changes in corporate tax
When all that is done, we'll do a holistic review of what it all means and come back and report
That may well be in this call next year
But if it happens really early in the year, we'll see
Thanks, Anthony, for the question
So on the first point, I'll just maybe restate some of what we said earlier which is that, yes, programming costs are high in 2017 for the reasons we described, which is big renewals happening in the second half of 2016 and early – with effective the beginning of 2017 and that rate comes down in the years that follow 2017 to something that looks more normal
I'd say the overarching and important point is all the work that Neil and team have been doing on non-programming costs
So you saw it in 2016, where when programming costs were also higher than the normal long-term rates, great work to protect the margin of the overall business
And the guidance we gave for margin is that it'll be flat again to down 50 basis points in 2017. So, obviously, all the growth and initiatives that Neil has working to drive the top line will push through that margin
And I'll leave it to you to kind of model that out
