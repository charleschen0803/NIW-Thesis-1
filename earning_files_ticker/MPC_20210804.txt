Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the MPC Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator
for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.

Kristina Anna Kazarian
Vice President of Investor Relations

Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. The slides
that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab.
Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the
executive team.

We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking
statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included
there as well as in our filings with the SEC.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the
business. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvements in the demand for our products as the
rollout of COVID vaccinations and the removal of mobility restrictions have led to more economic activity
and increased demand for transportation fuels. That said, we're close to the end of the summer driving
season, which is typically our strongest part of the year. Gasoline demand is currently 2% to 5% below
2019 levels, with the West Coast still lagging at about 10% down. Diesel demand continues to hold up well
and is flat to 2019.

Despite the growing levels of personal passenger traffic, we continue to see an absence of the longer-
haul international flights and business travel. Overall, jet demand remains down nearly 30% below pre-
pandemic levels. The full return of aviation fuel demand will likely still take some time, particularly with
the recent increasing spread of the COVID-19 variants. As we head into the second half of the year, we
remain hopeful but cautious in the recovery and so we'll remain focused on the elements of our business
within our control.

Slide 4 highlights progress on our strategic priorities for the quarter. First, on May 14, we closed the sale
of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven. In conjunction with the close, we announced our plans to return
$10 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. As part of our commitment to
quickly return capital, we immediately launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in which we were
able to repurchase nearly $1 billion worth of shares. As we shared in our release this morning, we are
proceeding with the next steps in our plan to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital over the
next 12 to 16 months.

Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Dickinson reached full design capacity during
the quarter. At approximately 180 million gallons per year, Dickinson is the second largest renewable
diesel facility in the United States. At Martinez, we're progressing detailed engineering and permitting to
convert that oil refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Based on our progress and discussion with feedstock
suppliers, we're confident in the time line we have set to begin producing renewable diesel in the second
half of 2022, with approximately 260 million gallons per year of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach
full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of '23.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Third, we continue to keep a diligent focus on cost and capital in a challenging commodity business such
as ours, being a low-cost operator ensures we will remain competitive. We have continued to challenge
ourselves to examine all aspects of spend, and as a result, have delivered incremental progress. In the
first half of 2021, our operating results reflect our goal to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1
billion.

Importantly, I want to note that in June, we published our 2 annual ESG-related reports. Our sustainability
report provides an in-depth look at the company's sustainability approach and performance consistent
with the reporting guidance from SASB and GRI. Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios follows
guidance from TCFD and analyzes the company's resiliency relative to climate scenarios put forth by the
IEA.

On Slide 5, I'd like to take a moment to go over some of the ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in
sustainable energy. From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to balance the needs of today while investing
in a sustainable energy diverse future. That includes strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon
intensity and conservative natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and
emerging technologies, and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement
with our people and many stakeholders.

We currently have 3 company-wide targets many of our investors know well. First, a 30% reduction in our
Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030. Second, a 50% reduction in midstream
methane intensity by 2025. And lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030.
The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We've allocated
40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance 2 significant renewable fuels projects. In late '20, we
began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson, North Dakota facility, second largest of its kind in the
United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery to a renewable diesel
facility.

Finally, to demonstrate our focus on making sustainability pervasive in all we do for executives and
employees, we link a portion of the annual bonus program to an ESG metric. We recently introduced a
diversity, equity and inclusion component to these metrics as well, making us the first U.S. independent
downstream company to link improving diversity to compensation in the same way we led the industry in
linking GHG intensity reductions to our compensation last year.

Safety in our operations is another key to sustainable operations. In 2020, our teams demonstrated strong
safety and environmental performance, including a nearly 40% reduction in the most significant process
safety events and a 40% reduction in designated environmental incidents over 2019. Our personal safety
performance continues to be better than industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream sectors.

At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review second quarter results.

Maryann T. Mannen
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we
reported an adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion for the quarter.
This includes the results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing
operations, excluding working capital, was $1.535 billion, which is approximately $1 billion increase
from the prior quarter. And for the first time in nearly 18 months, we generated ongoing operating cash
flow that exceeded the needs of the business, capital commitments as well as covered our dividend
and distributions. Finally, we returned nearly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through
dividend payments and share repurchases.

The close of the Speedway sale marked a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to strengthen
the competitive position of our portfolio. So we wanted to call out some of the key points on Slide 7. We
received total proceeds for the sale of Speedway of $21 billion. Based on our tax basis, our cash taxes,
current and deferred, will be approximately $4.2 billion, which is lower than our original $4.5 billion
estimate. We have accrued for this on the balance sheet.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

In addition, we had closing adjustments of approximately $400 million. Therefore, the after-tax proceeds
from the sale will be $17.2 billion. To be clear, this number is higher than our initial $16.5 billion estimate.

On Slide 8, we present an overview of the use of the proceeds. Since the close of the transaction, we
have reduced structural debt by $2.5 billion and purchased approximately $1 billion of stock. In the post-
tender period, we did not repurchase any incremental shares in light of a couple of regulatory constraints:
first, a post-tender cooling off period; and second, our routine quarterly restricted period in the lead up
to the release of our earnings information. That said, not repurchasing during that limited window is not
indicative of any deviation from our commitment to complete within 12 to 16 months.

Consistent with that commitment, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are commencing the next steps to
complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital. Specifically, we are entering into an open-market
repurchase program that will allow us to buy for a period of time, including when the company may have
information that otherwise precludes us from trading, and we will provide updates on the progress during
our earnings calls.

Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made, lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020,
we have made a step change in our refining operating cost and decreased our overall cost profile by
approximately $1 billion. While there is quarter-to-quarter variability, our refining operating cost in 2020
began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021.

We have applied the same cost discipline framework that we use for refining operating costs to our
corporate costs as well. There may be variations in these corporate costs quarter-to-quarter. We
believe we have lowered our overall cost structure by more than $100 million, and we are committed to
challenging ourselves every day on ways to reduce expenses.

As you know, natural gas is a variable cost in operating a refinery. These costs have recently increased
nearly $1 per MMBtu, and we anticipate this being a headwind for the third quarter. While our results
reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate
our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which
we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact
revenue opportunities, and in no way, jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations.

Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change
in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2021 to second quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was more than
$600 million higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing. As we previously
mentioned, this quarter's results include the impacts of closing the Speedway sale.

Here, you can see the $11.7 billion pretax gain on the sale reflected in the adjustments column of $11.6
billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairment and transaction-related costs. The
$3.7 billion financial tax -- excuse me, financial tax provision reflects the net impact of cash taxes and
deferred tax impact. The resulting $8 billion gain on sale is reflected in our quarterly net income. Slide 18
in our appendix walk through the specific impacts of the Speedway sale across the 3 financial statements.

Moving to our segment slide -- results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing
segment. The business recorded the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA since the start of
the COVID pandemic with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million. This was an increase of $728 million when
compared to the first quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins,
especially in the Mid-Con region as that region's cracks improved 57% from the first quarter. Also
contributing to the improved results was higher utilization, which was 94% for the second quarter versus
83% in the first quarter.

It's important to recall that we idled 2 high-cost refineries in 2020. If adjusted to include that capacity
idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 78% in the first quarter of '21 and subsequently
increased to 89% in the second quarter of '21. Operating expenses were relatively flat with the previous
quarter despite the increase in utilization, reflecting the team's commitment to cost discipline despite
rising variable cost.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Slide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2021. Our Midstream
segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the
previous quarter. Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress executing on the strategic
priorities of strict capital discipline, lowering the cost structure and portfolio optimization. By the end of
2021, we estimate that MPLX will have decreased their structural cost by $300 million.

Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. It
reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations. We have also specifically called out items related
to the Speedway close. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working
capital was $1.5 billion in the quarter. Changes in working capital were flat this quarter. Increasing crude
prices provided a source of more than $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable
balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory
builds.

During the quarter, MPC decreased debt by $3.3 billion. Additionally, MPLX reduced third-party debt by
approximately $800 million during the quarter. With respect to capital return, MPC returned $380 million
to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $981 million worth of shares using Speedway
proceeds. At the end of the quarter, NPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher returning short-term
investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposits.

Turning to guidance. On Slide 14, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect total throughput
volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be
approximately $195 million in the third quarter. The majority of the activity will be at our Robinson and
Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region.

As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back-half weighted this year. Other operating
expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. And so you are seeing the impact
in our guided cost trends for the third quarter. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.05 per barrel
for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate
costs are expected to be $175 million, consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately
$100 billion -- $100 million, excuse me, in cost that have been removed on an annual basis.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.

Kristina Anna Kazarian
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions] We will now open the call to questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And nice results here this quarter. The first question I had was just about the execution of capital returns.
As you said, you have $9 billion to return to capital -- capital to return back to shareholders here over the
next 12 to 16 months. Is it fair to say it's going to be in the form of a buyback? And will you be executing
it just ratably in the market? Just talk a little bit about how you plan on executing it? And is there any
consideration of anything other than a buyback for the capital returns?

Maryann T. Mannen
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Neil, it's Maryann. Yes, we are planning on commencing what we would call our open market
repurchase program and that will begin here immediately after the call. We have all of those options
that we've shared with you in the past, all of the tools, ASR and open-market purchase, including the
possibility for a tender. Those still remain all viable options for us. But we believe right now that the best
way for us to achieve that commitment and as we reiterated here on the call, in the next 12 to 16 months
and to return that remaining $9 billion would be through an open-market purchase program right now.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And Maryann, as you guys think about that repurchase, is the view that you would want to do it ratably?
Or do you want to be opportunistic? Do you believe that the right approach to share repurchases is cost
averaging in over the next 12 to 16 months or to be opportunistic on volatility? Just talk about your
strategy around execution?

Maryann T. Mannen
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Neil, I think, look, the reason why we're using an open-market repurchase program is we believe
we have some control over that and certainly using an opportunistic approach over this time period is
the approach that we believe is best for us during this time period. So certainly, we would be using an
opportunistic approach during this time period.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Mike, there is -- I guess, there's memories that the Biden administration could take a hard look at
partnership structures for MLPs. I'm just curious if you can offer any perspective on how it might change
your thoughts around your ownership structure and the current strategy around MPLX, if something like
that plays out?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Doug, it's a good question. So obviously, with the administration change and with the agenda that
they have out there, they're looking for ways to pay for the programs that they have in place. So we're
aware of the potential there. Obviously, there's a couple bills that are involved with that dynamic. I would

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

tell you, right now, our thinking though, is that we would stay in the MLP structure because we don't think
it's going to change. We don't know for sure. Obviously, if it did lose its tax status, it would change our
dynamic.

But right now, Doug, if you're asking what's the probability, I think we are on the side of -- we don't think
it is going to change, and we think the partnership will still maintain its tax status. So obviously, for the
size of the MLP that we have, if all of a sudden, it was a taxed entity you're looking at around $800 million
to $1 billion of cash flow that would be lost. And I know others have asked this in the past.

I mean it's predominantly the #1 reason why we maintain the partnership structure as compared to
converting to a C corp. There's 2 dynamics that come into play. One is an immediate tax impact to all
unitholders, of which MPC is the largest, obviously. And then more importantly is to the ongoing cash flow
change that would occur at MPLX.

So we understand some of the pros and cons of the structure. At the same time, we think having
that cash flow keeps us in the MLP mode. So obviously, if the rules change, if the administration does
something different, we'll adapt accordingly. But in the short term, we still support the structure because it
gives us that additional cash flow as opposed to a tax burden.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. Presumably, you're not aware of any discussions that you've had then with the administration around
this particular issue?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

No. I mean we know that there's some advocacies for it and some that are against it. Our intel is that we
think at the end of the day, the partnership status will stay the way it is. But I'm not trying to call politics
here, Doug. Whatever happens, we'll adjust to it, but for right now, we think the MLP structure will stay
the way it is.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Mike, my follow-up is, I guess, as a follow-on to the question on buybacks just to kind of put some
numbers to you that I'm sure you're very familiar with. Your market capitalization, obviously, mid-30s,
you strip out your share of the publicly traded value of MPLX. And what you're left with there's a value of
around $15 billion, $16 billion, which implies that the remaining buyback would be more than half of the
current market capitalization.

Clearly, that's impactful. I'm just wondering if you can frame for us how you would intend to tackle a
buyback of that scale when you think about it that way? I know you've touched on that a little bit, but
when you put microchip in context, is it big enough. Just curious how you think about moving that forward
over the next 16 months.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Doug, I'd say it's a good problem to have. We are committed -- as Maryann said in her remarks, we
are committed to returning capital. At the end of the day, we -- for a long time, we were saying about
$16.5 billion. I mean now that we've closed and worked through some of the details, it's a little over $17
billion. We have prioritized the balance sheet. We've taken out some debt there. We've maintained some
dry powder to see how things continue to play out, and we've committed to $10 billion.

So throughout the time from the announcement to close, we reiterated to investors that we wanted to do
it as quickly and efficiently as possible. To meet our commitment of quickly, we offered a Dutch tender.
The market spoke and said $1 billion as opposed to what we had offered out as far as the total liquidity.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Now we are, as Maryann said in the remarks, we're going to go more opportunistic and be in an open
market environment.

So some of the questions that we get from people is are we still committed to that? And as Maryann said,
we want to reiterate, we are committed to that. Nothing has changed in our thought process there. It is
going to take time. To your point, it is a large number. We are limited by the amount of trading volume we
have and the liquidity that we have in our shares. So that is part of the constraint that we have, but we
are committed to returning it. And we're going to go into this program, and obviously, each quarter, we'll
update the market on the results.

Operator

Next, we will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Let me take a quick detour over to the renewable diesel side of the business. Obviously, you've got
the North Dakota Dickinson facility up and running. I was curious is it running off soybean oil? If you could
give us any incremental views on its contribution to the Mid-Continent profit that we saw improve this
quarter? And then on the startup in Martinez, what do you expect the feedstocks to be there?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

So it's a good question, Roger. I'm going to let Ray give you some specific on Dickinson? Go ahead, Ray.

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Roger, this is Ray Brooks. Just want to talk a little bit about Dickinson and how it's running. As you
alluded, Dickinson is up and running now. During the second quarter, we did reach our design capacity of
180 million gallons a year, good news, and we're happy about that. The other thing operationally is we
did reach the yields of renewable diesel we were seeking to get in the mid-90s, and so we're happy about
that.

As far as feedstocks, the design for Dickinson was basically an 80-20 mix of soybean oil and distilled corn
oil. And as you probably know, the soybean oil economics are challenged right now. What I'm really proud
of the team is doing is we're seeking every day to optimize a few things. First, optimize the operation of
the facility to get to the lowest carbon intensity from our operations, and then we're also optimizing the
feed slate within the -- from the design basis and we're having some success in that regard. So that's
really how Dickinson is running. And right now, it's -- like I said, it's up running, and it's the second-
largest renewable diesel plant in the United States.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Roger, it's Mike again. I was just going to say to your second question on Martinez, we're not going to
disclose at this point what we're thinking about as far as the feedstocks. That's still in discussion with
many players. So I can't really comment on that other than what we said in our prepared remarks that the
engineering is going well, the permitting is going well. We still feel really good about the project from a lot
of aspects. So we'll give you more color on that as time goes by.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then a follow-up question, maybe for you, Maryann, just because you made the
comment about natural gas prices being up. Are there any other inflationary aspects we need to watch
for in the R&M sector here? I know you've got your overall goal to cut costs and some progress there, but

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

there's always an offset unfortunately. I was just curious what else may be pushing against you there,
recognizing, of course, that natural gas can go down about as quickly as it goes up.

Maryann T. Mannen
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. You're right. And certainly, as we see it right now, we're looking at it as a tailwind that is natural gas
to the third quarter. I'd say to your first question around any other specific inflationary aspects, there's
nothing -- obviously, we didn't point to anything. There's really nothing of significance that we see at this
juncture that would have a negative impact on the third quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Crédit Suisse.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So Mike, first, congratulations. I know you took over during the pandemic, but one thing which you took
over when you stressed was everything has to be free cash flow in the portfolio and refining was free
cash flow positive, I think you made about $500 million or $600 million in free cash, so congratulations on
achieving that goal.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Manav.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

My question here is on those lines. If I look at your current dividend obligation about $1.3 billion and
then I look at the cash that MPLX is giving you about $1.8 billion, and you look at the corporate and
expenses of like $175 million a quarter, like essentially, where we are in the equation? Even if refining
only contributes like $100 million to $200 million to overall free cash flow, you can meet your dividend
obligation.

And once you do execute this buyback there's like $320 million or so dividend obligation reduction. So
what I'm trying to get to is, not that refining will not make a positive free cash flow but you actually do
not need a positive refining free cash flow to meet the dividend obligation. Am I thinking about these
parameters correctly?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Manav, you are in general. I think one of the things that sometimes people miss is our relationship
with MPLX as you're pointing out. So at the current distribution level at MPLX, we do get that $1.8
billion coming back into MPC. So I think you're right. It's one of the uniquenesses that's a positive of the
structure that we have. Right today, MPLX is generating excess cash flow beyond capital and distribution
as well. So financial flexibility is increasing at the partnership as well. So I think we're in a pretty good
position from that standpoint, and I think you're thinking about it right.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And the quick follow-up here is, I mean, you have done a -- the team has done a very good job of
lowering OpEx per barrel. It is about 25% down year-over-year. So besides the closure of the 2 assets,
Gallup and Martinez, which are the other assets or part of the portfolio in the refining, whether it was
Galveston Bay or wherever, where these material reductions have come in, which is allowing you to push
the OpEx per barrel down?

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Manav, it's really occurred across the whole portfolio. Ray and the refining team have done a really
nice job on that side. All the support functions on the corporate side have done as well. So it is part of my
DNA to be very, very conscious about cost. The team knows that's going to be a high priority for us all the
time. In fact, if anything, Maryann just mentioned, as refining runs have come back up kind of with the
recovery, variable costs have come up, but we've been able to maintain a pretty consistent level of OpEx
there. So that's been a good story for us.

We do have, again, natural gas potentially going up. But overall, we're going to continue to challenge
the portfolio, both on the refining side of the business, also in the midstream side of the business. For
those who listened to the MPLX call, we had originally stated about $200 million of cost reductions at
MPLX. We've now increased that to about $300 million, about another $100 million that we feel pretty
comfortable that we can take out of that business as well. So it's going to continue to be an area of focus
for us. That's never going to change.

We'll look for opportunities for us to optimize our system where we can. And back to your original
point, we did have a couple closures. They were our highest cost facilities, but we're going to continue
to evaluate the portfolio. I've said a couple times to people that I want to get out of this pandemic
environment to see what things look like afterwards, but we are still evaluating all assets of the portfolio.
And to your point, and I'm glad you remember that is I am a driver that all of our assets need to generate
free cash flow. That's a mantra that I believe in, and we're hoping that we have that in our portfolio at all
times.

Operator

Our next question will come from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question, just one additional one on the buybacks. The proceeds, as you noted, were $700 million
higher than expected. I think you still have a $2 billion-plus tax refund coming here in the third quarter.
So how should we think about the ability over time to potentially exceed the $10 billion buyback target?
Or perhaps another way of asking the question is, are there other uses you would see for the cash besides
returning capital to shareholders, given what you've said about the balance sheet in the past?

Maryann T. Mannen
Executive VP & CFO

Phil, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. Yes, as you know, as we've been sharing with you the use of
proceeds, we've really just been focused on the $10 billion capital return. As you state very clearly, we
know we have roughly $2.1 billion coming back from the CARES Act. We continue to expect to receive the
lion's share of that in and about the third quarter -- late in the third quarter, frankly, is our expectation.

So you're right. We will have the remaining proceeds as well as the incremental $2 billion that we'll
continue to evaluate and make good decision really around whether or not that would go in the form of
capital return. But we've not really declared beyond that initial $10 billion right now as we continue to look
at the balance sheet.

I think you know the -- obviously, our intent also was to ensure that we maintained investment grade as
you hopefully you've seen the 3 rating agencies did reconfirm that. So we do have investment grade again
on -- by all 3 of those agencies. We certainly will continue to focus on the balance sheet and be sure that,
that maintains a nimble, if you will. But again, that use of proceeds will continue to evaluate as we go
forward.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

To clarify, there's no change to the absolute debt or cash balance targets you've set in the past?

Maryann T. Mannen
Executive VP & CFO

That's right. Right now, for MPC, we've got about $9 billion of long-term debt. As we shared with you
initially, we took $2.5 billion off immediately. Frankly, as you saw in the quarter, we actually did a bit more
than that, a little over $800 million. We really cleared anything that was sitting on our revolver as well.
We'll continue to evaluate that. But at this point, we -- as you know, we are trying to be efficient about
that. So we've not moved anything beyond that initial $2.5 billion of debt reduction.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. A follow up, just one more on the operating cost equation. With $5 a barrel of OpEx here in
the third quarter and the fact that OpEx is lower 2021 over 2020 despite higher throughput and higher nat
gas, where do you feel we are, I guess this is for Mike, in the cost reduction journey here? Particularly as
you benchmark to peers, there are obviously regional differences to consider across portfolios. But how far
along do you think we are when you look at what peers are doing?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Phil, how far along is always a tough question because like I said earlier, it's a never-ending game.
So we're going to continue to challenge ourselves. We'll look for incremental improvements from here.
Obviously, we've gotten the lion's share of what we originally targeted to get, but it's something that
we're going to continue. It's going to be part of our DNA that we're going to look at every opportunity,
every chance we get to continue to push that down. I am a believer that in this business, we need to be
a low-cost operator. The team deserves a lot of credit to get after that, and we've made some meaningful
change, but we're not done.

I'll quote right from the last call, we're not in the first inning, and we're not in the ninth inning. So the
game is still being played. It will continue to be played, and we'll just obviously challenge ourselves all the
time to see where we can run ourselves as a leaner opportunity as we can without sacrificing safety. That's
another really important mantra. We're not going to put anybody at jeopardy. But we're going to run as
lean as we can. And I just -- my guidance to you is keep watching our results and keep talking about it,
and as we have additional disclosures to tell you what's happening, we'll bring those up quarter-to-quarter.

Like I just mentioned earlier, midstream has just moved from a sustainable $200 million down to $300
million down. So we feel good about that. We're now telling people that we're comfortable with that
number, still challenging it in the midstream space as well. So we're going to keep the eye on the ball as
far as our costs, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to be as lean as we can be.

Operator

Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Wanted to maybe first ask about the refining macro landscape, given that demand has recovered
completely on the diesel front and -- mostly on the gasoline front. And with the utilization that you
achieved in the second quarter as well as the guidance for the third quarter, it seems to indicate a
relatively optimistic outlook for the near term. So one, would you agree with that? And just generally,
what are your views on refining profitability in the second half? And related to your comments about jet
demand being off 30% or still, is that what's capping the utilization guidance from here?

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Yes. Theresa, I'll start, and I'll let the other guys jump in. I guess the term we used was hopeful but
cautious. So we are hopeful that we are recovering and continue to do so. What we've seen, obviously,
over the last year has been a very tough environment that we're coming out of, particularly in the U.S.
The reason we're still cautious, however, is the delta variant is spiking up in a lot of areas. Outside the
U.S. is a much more difficult environment than inside the U.S. today. And then you pointed out a couple
things is jet fuel is still lagging, in our view, and that will continue to lag for some time. But eventually, it
will come back. But for right now, it is still lagging.

And the other one that we pointed out was the West Coast is still lagging. So we're going to have to see,
Theresa, to be honest with you, we're going to have to see how the COVID plays itself out into the second
half of the year and as we approach another winter season. If there continues to be increased infection,
obviously, there's going to be some restraint on the demand as a result like we've seen before. Hopefully
not, hopefully, people are seeing this variant spread and vaccination rates will increase from where they
are today.

I think there was a good response originally, but I think it needs to go to another level. So we're obviously
hopeful that people will take caution and get vaccinated. But in general, I mean, we have the same
outlook that I think you and others have is -- that's why we used the word hopeful that we're recovering
coming out of this, but cautious that we still have some road to plow. Anybody want to add? Nobody wants
to add.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Fair enough. And my second question is related to the Martinez conversion. And following up on something
that came up in the midstream call about housing some of the assets within MPLX, just in light of the
midstream entity, throwing off good free cash flow with a healthy balance sheet currently and needing
to insulate its own terminal value, when we think about some of the bigger ticket items that you have to
spend on such as the pretreatment unit or even the conversion of some of the processing units, would it
-- would you have the flexibility to decide between MPLX participating at cost or dropping down once fully
cash flowing? Is there a preference at this point between the 2 if that is the path forward?

And just on the latter, if you drop things down once fully cash flowing thinking, this is, I believe, your
previous strategy with Capline and keeping that upstairs until it is fully reversed because when you boil it
all down for Martinez, I imagine this would really delineate like a pretty meaningfully different amount of
capital that MPLX could contribute to fund the project?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

That was a long one there, Theresa. Let me see if I can break it apart. I think the main message that
you're asking is we do have a unique structure that enables us to look to create value for both MPC
shareholders and MPLX unitholders. So there is no rule of thumb to what you stated earlier. It's case-by-
case basis. There's a lot of specifics to go into it, the dynamics of each of the individual opportunities. But
we do have that ability to sit down and figure out how we can create value on both sides.

Obviously, it's our goal to create value at MPC and MPLX and having the flexibility between the 2
structures enables that. But I do want to leave you with, there's not a rule of thumb. There's not a, "Hey,
this is the way we do this." Every instance gets its own debate and discussion, and we decide what we
think is the best to create the most value.

Next then, we will hear from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.

Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Question on Martinez and the initial startup. I just wonder how you're thinking about its performance in
the period before the pretreatment unit starts up, and I'll contextualize it with something one of your
peers said, which is that there's an expectation that feedstock might eventually price itself on CI score
similar to the way that within the refining complex commodities price on sort of their end market value.

And so I was just wondering if you're thinking about that as a possible outcome and whether that may
make operations before the PTU starts up a little easier? Or whether the expectation is really that Martinez
shouldn't enter kind of a run rate profitability until that PTU is going?

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Sam, this is Ray, and I'll take your question. you're right. As we develop the Martinez project and it comes
on in phases, the different phases will have a different feedstock mix. And so phase 1, essentially, as we
come on with the initial hydroprocessing unit. That is going to be without the pretreatment system. I don't
want to get -- like Mike said, I don't want to get into too much of the feedstock slate. What I would like to
emphasize, though, is we have a lot of optionality around how we receive feedstocks between truck and
rail and water and ability without having the pretreatment system still to optimize that mix.

The other thing I'll talk about Martinez is, whether it's phase 1 or phase 2, phase 3 is, we did our -- when
we looked at this project, we looked at it with different feedstock capabilities and the most conservative
feedstock availability for phase 1. And we still feel good about the project even if it was a very strong
soybean oil-based slate. But like I said, we're going to work to optimize around all the logistics assets, the
capabilities that Martinez offers us.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Sam, it's Mike. I'm just going to add to what Ray said. I mean I know your question is depending on
where the market goes. But the thing that makes us feel really good about Martinez is several factors.
One, we think we have a really competitive CapEx and OpEx situation. And that was one of the major
drivers when we looked at this. Second, as Ray just mentioned, we have really strong logistics: pipeline,
rail, water, truck. We have a lot of opportunity there to provide value. And then the ultimate logistics is
we're in California where we're sitting on the demand. So location also matters.

So regardless of what happens in the marketplace, and it will ebb and flow just like every other
commodity market. The reason we're so bullish on our Martinez asset is those factors that are in place
day-in and day-out. The OpEx that we're going to run, the CapEx that it takes to get there, the logistics
that we have, the location that we have, all of those play to our favor regardless of how the commodity
markets move day to day. I hope that makes sense.

Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Understood. And then just a follow-up on RINs and the RVO. MPC is advantaged because you satisfy
your D6 obligation through blending. But there's some elements of that, that are hard to follow in terms
of realizations because marketing outcomes have different RINs effects embedded in them. So I was
wondering if there's anything you can share about just sort of the net effect of blending in -- on the
gasoline side? And how you navigate it just the volatile RINs environment and maybe what that means on
sort of a go-forward basis?

Brian K. Partee
Senior Vice President of Global Clean Products

15

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Yes. Sam, this is Brian Partee. I can take that question. So the first thing I would do is actually zoom out
just a little bit and think about blended sales actually further down the value chain. So it's naturally going
to be a higher-margin sale than, say, a bulk sale that doesn't have a RIN or a blend component to it. So
we stated publicly that we're in that 70% to 75% from a blend perspective from an RVO. So we're just
naturally further down the value chain.

I think you hit on a couple of things, though. The volatility is important. So the RVO is a 12-month
compliance window, and it's really how you execute your compliance strategy. And it's the volatility
actually in the high RIN environment that we're in now provides opportunities for probably an outperform
or an underperform depending on the execution of your compliance program and how you meet those
obligations.

So that is something that's probably not been as transparent to the marketplace as we historically were
around $0.05-or-so on RINs. But now in this environment, it does provide an opportunity. It's high risk,
high reward, but we feel confident with our ability to execute both from a blended perspective of what we
blend, but also on the compliance program.

Operator

Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I'll actually try to ask the question Sam just asked a little differently, which is, have you seen the value
proposition for blending biofuels change in this environment relative to where it was in 2018, 2019? Or is
the value benefit still there, meaning that blending offsets the financial cost of having to go out and buying
RINs because it's been suggested that the value proposition has changed a bit for various reasons?

Brian K. Partee
Senior Vice President of Global Clean Products

Yes. Jason, this is Brian Partee, again. Yes, I can take that. I think the great debate is the pass-through of
the RIN and the RFS costs. And it's very difficult to empirically point to that as pass-through. So again, I'll
fall back on the execution side of things. And I think that's really where the performance lies. But it's very
difficult to pinpoint any difference between the data points that you referenced back in 2018 to today, it
really gets boiled down to the execution side of things.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just a quick accounting question. There was about an $82 million benefit from other
income in Refining and Marketing margin that appears like it's the first time it's been there. Can you just
discuss what drove that?

Maryann T. Mannen
Executive VP & CFO

I'm sorry, Jason. It's Maryann. Could you repeat your question again? You're saying an $82 million benefit
in the quarter? I'm sorry, I'm not following your question.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. For the quarter, in the line item, other income included in Refining and Marketing margin.

Maryann T. Mannen
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Jason, we'll take a look at that for you, and we'll come back to you. How's that?
