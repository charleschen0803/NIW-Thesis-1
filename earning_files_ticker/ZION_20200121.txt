Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Zions Bancorporation's Fourth Quarter
2019 Earnings Results Webcast. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP of Investor Relations & External Communications

Thank you, sir, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2019 fourth
quarter and full year earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial performance figures, after which Paul
Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions financial condition, wrapping up
with our financial outlook. Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President
and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer.

Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking
statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in
the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to the
statements made during this call. A copy of the full earnings release as well as the supplemental slide deck
are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.

The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to
non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common
industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures
are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures
and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between
these measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are
encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.

We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the time over to Harris.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Thanks very much, James, and we welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our 2019 fourth quarter
and full year results.

Slide 3 is a summary of several key highlights, which I'll cover in the next few slides.

And so I'm going to move right to Slide 4. Slide 4 shows a time series of the bottom line earnings per
share results. We reported earnings per share of $0.97. As noted on the slide, in the fourth quarter of
2019, there were 3 items that adversely affected the earnings per share figure by a net $0.17.

Also shown is the adjusted pre-provision net revenue, which as noted, already excludes the impact of $37
million of noninterest expense related to severance and restructuring charges. However, the PPNR number
also includes the positive impact of the derivative valuation gain on client-related interest rate swaps and
the $10 million adverse impact associated with the resolution of a self-identified operational issue.

Moving to Slide 5. The efficiency ratio is, of course, a function of both revenue and expense. With a
relatively quick change in the trajectory of interest rates in mid-2019 and the expectation that such a
change would create a revenue headwind, we took action to adapt quickly on the expense front in order
to actively manage our profitability. We announced 3 months ago, in conjunction with our third quarter

2020

earnings release, a plan to cut about 5% of our staff positions and a number of other positions that were
not yet filled.

We also said that the resulting reduction in salaries and benefits would be roughly proportional to the
number of positions eliminated and that these reductions should be reflected in our financial results
beginning in the first quarter of 2020. We'll continue to work to reduce a variety of costs and execute on
plans we've announced to realign certain branches during 2020.

In short, we've tried hard to respond to a rapidly changing business environment, really an interest rate
environment. And I believe these efforts should help to offset some of the interest rate-related revenue
challenges we expect in 2020.

Turning to Slide 6. One of Zions' strengths is its sizable portfolio of noninterest-bearing deposits, which
account for more than 40% of total deposits. During the fourth quarter, average noninterest-bearing
deposits increased an annualized 7.5%. Average total deposits increased an annualized 10.5%. The cost
of deposits declined 6 basis points, which equals a 12% linked quarter improvement relative to our third
quarter total cost of deposits.

Going now to Slide 7. Credit costs remained low. Consistent with my comments last quarter, credit losses
have been somewhat episodic within our loan portfolio attributable to problems specific to a small handful
of borrowers' unique circumstances. Net charge-offs for the full year were a modest 8 basis points,
generally consistent with our expectations for the year.

Nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days past due continued to show improvement. Our nonperforming assets
plus loans 90 days past due expressed as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned at 51 basis
points was 4 basis points lower than the year-ago period. Our improved risk management and credit
performance have been key factors in an improvement in our debt ratings in recent months. Due largely
to the strong credit quality of the loan portfolio, resulting in part from a shift in recent years and the
portfolio's composition to what we believe is a less risky credit profile and due to a reduced risk profile
generally, we have been able to reduce our capital ratios to a level closer to that of our peers.

We're pleased to have repurchased more than 3% of our outstanding shares in the fourth quarter and
more than 12% of our shares during 2019. In addition to a substantial buyback program during the past
few quarters, we've also been delivering an annualized common dividend yield of nearly 3%. Our common
equity Tier 1 capital ratio remained strong at 10.2%.

Next, let me step back from the financial data and update you on just one of a variety of strategic
initiatives we have underway, and that's digital delivery. Shown on Slide 8, we are enhancing digital
experiences for our customers with a goal of being quite competitive with the best providers of financial
services products, banks and nonbanks alike, while remaining focused on continuous improvement in
streamlining our processes, thereby keeping noninterest expense under control. We continue to make
solid progress, notably in small business and consumer digital account opening and small business and
mortgage digital loan application processes. Additionally, we are on track to significantly enhance our
online consumer and small business mobile platforms later this year.

Our core replacement initiative remains on track, and I've noticed that at least a couple of other of our
peers have recently announced that they would be embarking on some form of core systems replacement
projects. We'll spend a significant amount of time on our core systems replacement and our other
technology initiatives at our Investor Day in just 2 weeks.

With that overview, I'm going to turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials in additional
detail. Paul?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21,
2020

I'll begin on Slide 9, which highlights 2 measures of balance sheet profitability, return on average assets
and return on average tangible common equity.

As noted, the fourth quarter results were adversely impacted by the severance and restructuring charges
and the resolution of an operational issue and positively impacted by a derivative valuation gain on
customer-related interest rate swaps. Combined, these factors adversely impacted return on average
assets by about 20 basis points and return on average tangible common equity by about 200 basis points.
We remain focused on continuing to improve balance sheet profitability.

On Slide 10, looking at the chart on the left, Zions net interest income declined slightly compared to the
prior year period. While average earning assets increased by 3% during that time frame, the yield on
earning assets decreased by 17 basis points, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 2
basis points, leading to a decline in the rate spread of 19 basis points and a decline in the net interest
margin of 21 basis points. Net interest income was down 3% over this period as the decline in net interest
margin was somewhat offset by balance sheet growth.

Turning to a linked-quarter view. The net interest margin compressed 2 basis points relative to the third
quarter as the lower interest rate environment continued to impact loan and securities yields and also led
to lower borrowing costs. The waterfall chart on the right depicts the elements that resulted in the linked
quarter charge in -- change in net interest margin. Within the loan yields bar, about half was portfolio
churn, sometimes referred to as the front book and back book, while the other half was due to the change
in benchmark interest rates. On the funding side, the net interest margin impact of the cost of funds
decline was evenly mixed between the cost of deposits and the cost of wholesale funds.

As Harris noted, highlights in the quarter included the growth of deposits and the decline in the cost of
average deposits. While our cost of funds increased 3 basis points over the year-ago period, it decreased
a solid 14 basis points from the third quarter of 2019 from 57 basis points -- to 57 basis points from
71 basis points or about a 20% improvement in cost. This was primarily due to lower rates paid on all
interest-bearing liabilities in addition to a favorable mix shift as solid deposit growth made it possible to
reduce wholesale borrowings. We expect that the net interest margin will compress further during the
next couple of quarters, reflecting the forward curve and our best estimates of loan yields, deposit costs,
balance sheet turn and other factors.

Slide 11 highlights a key component of net interest income, loan and deposit growth, and breaks them
down by both rate and volume. Average loans grew 5% over the year-ago period. Average loans in the
fourth quarter were essentially flat to the prior quarter. As we have noted previously, it is not unusual
to observe a quarterly ebb and flow to balance sheet growth due to several factors, including customer
demand, the balance of loan growth and payoffs and seasonality.

Over the prior year period, the yield on loans decreased 23 basis points, and relative to the prior quarter,
the yield on loans decreased 19 basis points. As I noted in the discussion of the previous slide, about half
of the linked quarter compression in loan yields was due to movement in benchmark interest rates, and
the other half can be attributed to the churn of the portfolio, where new yields are 15 to 20 basis points
less than maturing loan yields.

Shifting to funding. Average total deposits increased 5 basis points over the prior year period...

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

5 percentage points.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Sorry, 5 percentage points over the prior year period and a solid 10 percentage points annualized growth
rate when compared to the prior quarter.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21,
2020

As I noted last quarter, maintaining this rate of growth in deposits will be difficult, especially with seasonal
factors typically seen in the first few months of the year. Nevertheless, we expect moderate deposit
growth to accompany our loan growth for 2020.

Slide 12 is a new slide and shows the changes in our investment portfolio size and yield and changes in
our borrowed funds position size and yield. As I have mentioned on previous calls, we reevaluated the on-
balance sheet liquidity needs a few quarters ago and, in conjunction with that analysis, elected to bring
down the size of the securities portfolio. Simultaneously, we were able to achieve solid growth in deposits.
The combination of these 2 trends allowed us to pay down wholesale borrowings by about $2 billion in the
fourth quarter. As a reminder, almost all of the wholesale borrowings are variable rate. These changes in
the lower interest rate environment has allowed the cost of borrowed funds to decrease 20 basis points
relative to the prior quarter and 44 basis points from the year-ago period.

Turning to loan growth. Slide 13 depicts year-over-year period-end loan growth by portfolio type with the
size of the circles representing the relative size of the portfolio. Municipal loan growth has been a highlight
for a couple of years now. The marginal credit quality there is very good with the average new deal being
about $4 million, and the probability of default being relatively low. Loan growth across the enterprise also
reflects our credit risk appetite and active management of portfolio concentration limits.

On Slide 14, customer-related fees were up 2% from the year-ago period. In certain categories, our long-
tenured and deep client relationships enable stable core fee income. This includes commercial account
fees, card fees and retail and business banking fees. We have greater growth opportunities in certain
other segments and have been working to improve the revenue from these areas. Notably, we have seen
strength in capital markets product sales, which were up 19% from the prior year, as well as wealth
management and trust fees, which were up 14% from the prior year period.

As shown on Slide 15, noninterest expense increased 12% to $472 million from $420 million in the year-
ago quarter, adversely impacted by the previously mentioned $37 million in severance and restructuring
costs and $10 million for the resolution of an operational issue. Excluding the impact of these items,
noninterest expense reflects the ongoing efforts to reduce expenses, streamline operations and improve
overall efficiency with notable reductions in advertising, credit-related expense and professional and legal
services over the prior year period.

During the fourth quarter, we ran a full parallel allowance for credit loss process, one for the incurred loss
accounting standard and the other for the new current expected credit loss or CECL accounting standard.
Slide 16 reports the results of that parallel run. We have highlighted the various changes that may impact
the allowance for each of the major loan portfolios with a total estimated impact on the allowance for
credit losses at the bottom of the table. Our day 1 impact on the allowance for credit losses was a 5%
reduction associated with the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard.

I might add a word of caution here. We've noted many times in the past that we expect our allowance to
become more volatile under the new CECL process as it is now subject to economic forecasts that may
move materially from quarter-to-quarter. Therefore, our day 1 impact in the allowance for credit losses,
which will be set at March 31, 2020, may be materially different.

Now I'll turn to the outlook slide on Page 17. This is our outlook -- financial outlook for the next 12
months relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged at moderately
increasing. Our outlook for net interest income remains slightly decreasing, incorporating our outlook of
the current shape of the yield curve and our continued expectation that balance sheet growth will be more
than offset by the continued churn of the portfolio. We will continue to actively manage our deposit pricing
in a lower rate environment, and this may present some upside opportunity to this outlook.

Regarding customer-related fees, we expect slightly increasing customer-related fees a year from now
when compared to the fourth quarter. Building on our prior comments related to noninterest expense,
we expect the overall level of adjusted noninterest expense in 2020 to be consistent with or slightly
below adjusted noninterest expense for 2019. And as a reminder, the position elimination announced
in October of 2019 will begin to impact the run rate of noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2020.
Also, as we have previously disclosed, we are in the process of resolving our defined benefit pension plan,

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21,
2020

which is expected to result in a onetime charge likely toward the middle of 2020. Our outlook for adjusted
noninterest expense excludes this charge.

Finally, regarding capital management, our CET1 ratio has declined to 10.2% from 11.7% a year ago.
Our current level of capital is more than sufficient to support the risk on our balance sheet, implied by
our internal stress testing. Our CET1 ratio remains above the median of our peers. We continue to believe
that remaining stronger than the peer median is important. Maintaining a risk profile, which we believe
compares favorably to peers while also maintaining relatively strong positions in capital and liquidity, is
prudent. Therefore we expect the capital return to shareholders in 2020 will be significantly less than it
was in 2019, assuming no material change in the macroeconomic environment. Said differently, we expect
our capital ratios to remain relatively stable throughout 2020 when compared to the levels reported this
quarter.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Andrew, would you open the line for questions? Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I guess, maybe just to start off, I saw net charge-offs jump up a little bit to $22 million. Obviously, I did
not see a related increase in your provision expense. Can you just provide a little more detail on what
drove the higher charge-offs in the quarter?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Sure, Ken. This is Michael Morris. We had one modest charge-off in Q4 that drove the overall charge-offs
for the year. Beyond that, we saw stabilization and stronger probability of default metrics around the rest
of the portfolio along with other improvements. So it was not material enough to drive an increase in the
ACL.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

And I would say it was not related to any other segment of the portfolio. I would characterize it, Michael,
correct me if I'm wrong, but I would characterize it as sort of one-off charge-off.

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Right.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Was there any industry or a particular industry it was in?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

It's in the recreation industry. And I was just -- and it was a $10.8 million charge-off that kind of came out
of the blue.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Okay.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

So that we threw in the towel and walked on a large investment, and we and some others took the hit.
So...

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

As Paul noted, there's nothing systemic. It's not like we have a portfolio of these kinds of loans, et cetera,
et cetera.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21,
2020

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got you. Okay. And I'll refrain from asking if it was a federally legal recreation type.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

It was very legal.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

It was very legal.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, it was legal. Okay. Just -- it's fine, sorry. And then sorry, just my follow-up question. On expenses,
obviously, you took the severance and restructuring charges, totally get it. It seems that your guidance is
still sort of unchanged or sort of already consensus and myself are already building in sort of that modest
reduction in '20 versus '19. Is that just solely the fact that you adjusted your guidance back in 3Q such
that -- because I guess, I'm just trying to figure out like how meaningful that is going to be in first quarter
when you start to see the benefit from those restructuring actions?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The outlook is unchanged because, as you said, we had sort of full information by the time we
reported third quarter earnings towards the end of October. And so that will -- the expense reductions that
we have undertaken were baked into that outlook that we provided in the third quarter. And as it relates
to run rate, we are saying kind of flat to slightly decreasing relative to full year adjusted 2019. And we're
saying that because while -- these reductions are allowing us to continue to make the investments that we
think are important to run the business, including continuing to invest in our people.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

On the NIM, I know you gave the comment that you expect some incremental compression here over
the next couple of quarters. Can you just help maybe size that up? Is it similar to the magnitude of the
compression that you saw in the fourth quarter of about a couple of bps. Is that the pace that we're
looking for? And what's the likely driver going to be? Is it ongoing modest pressure on the loan book? Is
that where the pressure is coming from?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

John, as you know, we don't provide specifically guidance on the net interest margin. We do, however,
provide an outlook on loan growth and net interest income, which you see on our outlook slide. So I
don't want to go further than that. I will say that the ongoing net interest margin pressure would really
be related to the loan portfolio churn that I described in my prepared remarks. And also, as I said, the
opportunity, I think, is repricing deposits. And so to the extent we are successful there, obviously, and are
able to reprice our deposits lower, that will have a positive impact.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then on the loan growth front, just want to get a little bit more color around what
areas of the loan portfolio do you expect to drive the bulk of the growth as you look into 2020? And more

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21,
2020

specifically, regarding the municipal loan book, I know you've seen some really good growth there. What's
your appetite for incremental growth there? Do you have a target size that you're willing to let that book
reach?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

John, this is Scott McLean. And our growth should continue to look like the year-to-date panel that you
see on Slide 22, basically 50% to 60% coming from C&I. That's where municipal sits. And we don't feel
like we're reaching any limits in terms of our municipal growth. It's been growing rapidly, largely because
it was coming off a very small base. But the underwriting procedures we're using and practices are highly
consistent with what we've done for many, many years there. We just have leaned into the area, covering
more geography more densely than we have historically. So we see continued growth in municipal.

But the growth in 2020, it should look like '19, probably 50% to 60% C&I. We'll see some modest growth
in CRE, but it would probably be low single digits. And then consumer, I think we'll continue to see will
represent 20% of our growth, plus or minus. Largely -- it's largely driven by our 1- to 4-family and home
equity businesses.

I would just note on the fourth quarter being soft, the 4 quarters ending in the third quarter of '19 were
all very strong. But if you look back prior to then, we had 2 or 3 soft quarters in a row. And so we're not
especially alarmed by having a soft fourth quarter here.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust.

Jennifer Haskew Demba
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Two questions. First, can you just talk about the operational issue you outlined in the nonrecurring items?
And secondly, other than technology investments and your progress there and strategy there, could you
talk about maybe the other topics you're going to focus on, on February 6 at the Investor Day?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Sure, Jennifer. This is Scott. The operational issue, I would just describe it as we -- one, it was self-
identified. Secondly, as we continue to adopt common practices, we just saw some disparity in a certain
pricing practice that we had that we thought we really just needed to double-back and create consistency
over a period of time. That's all it was. The dollar amount is larger than we would have liked, but we felt
like it was the right thing to do. So no real story there other than just creating consistency in our practices
across the company relative to how we price items to our customers.

And for the Investor Day, Paul, do you want to take it?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I can -- at a high level, yes, we are going to talk about technology as you would expect. But I think
the idea this year is that we're going to talk about technology in the context of our business and really
demonstrate how -- kind of how we're going to market and where we're focused in our business, how
technology is going to support that and then, of course, provide an update on credit and financial outlook.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.

So in thinking about the outlook slide, is positive operating leverage still possible in full year 2020? I
caught in the remarks potential upside mentioned from potentially pulling more on the expense lever and
potentially also pulling more on the deposit cost lever?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Erika, we have not commented specifically about positive operating leverage. As we have mentioned
previously, over the sort of the medium and long term, that's clearly our goal. I think next year will be
tough, as we outlined in the slide. While noninterest income will be up, net interest income is expected to
be slightly down. And so expenses -- with expenses sort of flat to down in that brew of revenue, as I said,
I think positive operating leverage will be tough to achieve in 2020.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

I had a kind of a big picture-type question. I'm just thinking where we are in the cycle, how you guys
think about the balance between protecting the profitability ratios versus growing the balance sheet.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

I guess I'll just say that I think it's a time where everybody -- you have to be just very careful. That said,
actually, we keep asking ourselves where are we in the cycle because it -- I mean, this has been a very
unusual cycle. It's been about as long and flat as the yield curve is in some respects in terms of the -- it's
been kind of low growth for a very long period of time. And we're not seeing anything that suggests to us
that anything is about to turn suddenly. We're not seeing anything systematically in our credit metrics,
our portfolio that gives us any real pause. But you just know that at some point, we're going to see a
cycle. And so we're trying to -- we'll try to be careful. We certainly establish goals and targets internally
in terms of what we'd like to see in the way of loan growth. At least, starting with me, I'm pretty careful
about making that sort of the main thing around here is to hit loan growth targets. I think that's just --
that creates a culture that's not very healthy in a financial institution.

Deposits is kind of a different animal. I mean you can push people to go out, and we get deposits, but
loans, the nature of that game is you have to be selective. And so while we hope to see the kind of loan
growth we've outlined here, expect to see it, we're going to be careful along the way. And I think we have
been the last couple of years.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

I would just add to that, that if you look at the loan categories that are possibly most toxic going into
the decline, construction lending is an example. Our construction loan growth has been really flat.
Really dating back to 2014 and before, we're up maybe $300 million in terms of total outstandings and
construction loans, from 12/14 to 12/19. We're not a big card or auto lender. And those are 2 places
where you see a lot of challenges going into a downturn. And our leverage portfolio, as we've talked about
before, compared to our peers is we're underexposed there relative to our peers, although you have to
always watch that portfolio carefully. So I just -- those are 3 product categories that you would want to be
really concerned about if you saw a lot of rapid growth, and we haven't experienced that.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

I'll just add to that. In energy, we've significantly reduced our total exposure to the services sector over
the last 3 or 4 years. And so the portfolio has to -- in terms of its total composition, it has to add up to
100% or something. But that something has become more conservative, we think, over time. So...

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

That's really helpful. And then just on these loans, can you just give an update on customer sentiment and
how it compares to maybe last quarter, if you're seeing an improvement.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

I think it's still -- I mean, around the markets we're in, still pretty good, and maybe even getting a little
better from where it was a quarter ago. I mean it's -- we still hear concerns about labor availability. They
are sort of high-class problems, if you will, as opposed to the kinds of challenges that can really, really
hurt businesses. I think that the economy feels pretty good throughout the West.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I want to first ask you, so the securities portfolio came down quite a bit in 2019 as you telegraphed. Well,
how do you think about this in 2020? Should we still expect a decline in the portfolio?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

I wouldn't expect -- a lot of this kind of balance sheet repositioning, I'll call it, we really took care of in
2019. So we are constantly looking at our kind of net liquidity position, constantly thinking about the
size of the portfolio, relative to the size of the balance sheet. And it's really being driven by our liquidity
stress testing. I don't foresee a big decline from here in the securities portfolio. But as I said, we're -- in
such a flat interest rate environment, we're very sensitive to the fact that the securities portfolio is not a
moneymaker for us, and it's dilutive to the margin and, frankly, to income. And so we are managing that
portfolio almost completely for liquidity at this point.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And where are new yields for new securities?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Last quarter, we -- our average was about 2.45% of the securities we put on.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then finally, on expenses. If we look at the expense outlook, does that include the anticipated
benefit from eliminating the defined pension -- defined benefit pension plan?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Our plan has been closed for years. And so what's happened is that it's not really for -- I've been here 5
years, and it's really not been -- had a significant impact on our noninterest expenses that I can think of
in any given year over the last 5 years because we had closed it kind of 10 years ago to new entrants, and
it was no longer, as I recall, accruing benefits. So this is really sort of an administratively -- this is a plan
that was waning as it was. And so there's this sort of an acceleration of the resolution of all the liabilities in
the plan.

Chairman & CEO

And as we've noted previously, when we say that expenses will be stable to slightly decreasing, that would
exclude this kind of a onetime expense that takes the mark that's currently in AOCI and runs it through
the income statement. That's the back-end equity. So...

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Paul, if I could ask you another right side of the balance sheet question. You obviously saw a really nice
remixing into deposits and were able to lower your wholesale debt profile. First question is just how much
more room do you have to remix on the right side of the balance sheet?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as we said, we reduced wholesale borrowings here $2 billion in the fourth quarter. So to the extent
we can continue to grow deposits, and those deposits are priced correctly, we can continue to change that
mix. Although my expectation is, and as I said in the outlook, the balance sheet will continue to grow,
and that wholesale funding will be an important part of just kind of that ongoing mix. So in other words, I
don't see a huge opportunity there, unless we get an outsized kind of deposit growth.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And that's my second question then. Just related to the type of deposit growth you got and the
pricing of it, can you talk about relative to the 11-or-so basis point decline you saw in interest-bearing
deposit costs or how do you see that going from here? Meaning, how much more ability is there just
through the pull-through of lower rates versus continuing to work with customers on the downside of rates
as you had on the way up?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I believe we continue to have opportunity there. When you look at where deposits were a year ago
versus where they are now, and then you compare that to the absolute level of rates, my belief is, well,
we won't get deposit rates down as low as they were 1 or 2 years ago. I think we still have some room to
really manage that exception pricing to continue to work that pricing down.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. One quick follow-up. Just in the slide deck, you mentioned the year-over-year impact of premium
amortization from the SBA book. Can you talk about -- is that expected to continue? Or is there any
outlook for changes in premium amortization in your forward outlook?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Not a big change. On the SBA look -- book specifically, that is just over 10% of our investment portfolio.
It used to be larger. That is an asset class that is declining over time. The other artifact about that asset is
that it's floating rate. And so it's prime based. And so you've got the -- in that particular case when you've
got kind of a floating rate asset that is experiencing prepayments in a falling rate environment, the yields
on that book have been -- have put pressure on the whole portfolio.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21,

So as I said, that part of the book is a little over 10% of the investment portfolio. But when you look
at the 4 basis point decline in the yield, over half of that was related to the SBA book. So that's all
incorporated into our outlook, and we're not expecting a big change in that trend.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley.

Stephen M. Moss
B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask about the increase in commercial NPL this quarter. Just wondering if that was driven by
energy, and what are your expectations for the energy book and loan balances here going forward?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

I'll take that, Steve. This is Michael. The increase mostly is related to commercial loans, some oil and gas,
but mostly other non-oil and gas commercial. The outlook is favorable. We don't see further NPL issues for
2020. They're hard to predict, as you know, but we have -- also, we have quite a few nonperforming loans
that are actually contractually performing. So we look at the net number as well, and it's positive relative
to the industry and our peer group.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

On energy, did you want to -- were you asking about energy specifically? Or...

Stephen M. Moss
B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division

Yes, please, Scott.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Sure. Our commitments and outstandings are well below our December '14 levels, which is really
when they peaked. And as Harris noted a bit ago, our exposure to services is now less than 20% of
outstandings, down from about 42%, 43% of outstandings back then. We're always watching the -- this
portfolio very closely. I think what's getting a lot of headlines is the equity markets are basically closed
to upstream companies, E&P companies and to the midstream. And so that just creates a lot of sort of
tension in the narrative about energy.

The public debt markets and the private equity markets are open for upstream and midstream companies.
So capital is certainly flowing. And we're -- our upstream and midstream portfolios are they're -- knock
on wood, they're performing pretty well right now. Natural gas is also a really highly visible topic right
now. Pricing of natural gas will continue to be soft. It will stay in probably the sub-$2 region for a bit
here during the next couple of months, 3 to 4 months potentially. But that portfolio for us, where we
have natural gas in our borrowing bases, came through the fall redetermination in pretty good shape.
And we could have some criticized loans that have heavier natural gas exposure, but we think it's very
manageable. So we're...

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

And I also think, I mean, the $13 million increase in nonperforming loans in C&I this quarter didn't include
anything of any material amount in oil and gas.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes, energy was -- energy nonperformings were basically flat to last quarter.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21,
2020

Stephen M. Moss
B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then let me take one more crack at expenses here. The quarter included that
$10 million item. Just wondering, like, is there just going to be an acceleration of the investment expense
coming on that perhaps doesn't make you a little bit more constructive on the level of expenses, the level
of decrease in expenses?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

I would say that those 2 items are unrelated.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.

Brian Paul Klock
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I was going to ask you about the capital stack. I know that you guys -- your guidance is for the overall
level of CET1 to be stable here. And you guys have returned a lot of capital over the last few years. So
just looking at your capital ratios, I mean, the CET1 is still pretty strong, but even your total capital ratio
is very strong. And then I look at you still have the 100 basis point cushion between CET1 and your Tier
1, so it doesn't look like you need to do anything to add to that capital stack, but it does seem like maybe
that the preferred stock, it seemed like it's a little bit expensive relative to what some of your other peers
have issued at. Is there anything you guys can do to make that more efficient, anything in that preferred
stock part of the stack that maybe you could refinance out for something cheaper?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

We have been -- Brian, because you've followed us for a while, we have been very active in kind of
proactively managing particularly that preferred part of our capital stack because we've recognized this
as being relatively expensive. So -- but at this point, it would be hard for us to go out and kind of pick
anything out of the open market. We really need to wait for the contractual provisions of the preferred
before we can manage that any more closely.

Operator

And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Director of
Investor Relations, James Abbott, for closing remarks.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP of Investor Relations & External Communications

6 for our Investor Day, as Brian Klock just alluded to. That's scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. Eastern
Time. If you would like to attend, please contact me either by phone or by e-mail. And we look forward to
seeing you at that point in time. Thank you again for your attendance today.

Operator
