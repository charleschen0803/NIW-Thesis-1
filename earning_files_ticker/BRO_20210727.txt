J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter '21
earnings call.

Q2 was a very strong quarter and it's the best in the history of Brown & Brown. Our performance for the
first 6 months of 2021 is due to the tremendous effort of our talented 11,000-plus teammates that deliver
creative risk management solutions for our customers. Each of our segments delivered impressive results
with strong top and bottom line growth due to more new business, good customer retention, increased
premium rates across most lines of coverage and higher exposure units driven by continued economic
expansion. These results reflect the strength and diversity of our operating model as well as the power of
our performance-based culture.

Now let's transition to the results for the quarter. I'm on Slide 3. We delivered $727 million of revenue,
growing 21.5% in total and 14.7% organically. This is the strongest organic growth that we've ever
delivered. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments.

Our EBITDAC margin was 32.9%, which is up 340 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. Our net
income per share for the second quarter was $0.49, increasing 44% on an as-reported and adjusted basis,
with the latter excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. During the quarter, we
completed 2 acquisitions and would like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that
joined during the quarter.

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance and believe we're well positioned to continue
delivering best-in-class solutions for our customers. Later in the presentation, Andy will discuss our
financial results in more detail.

I'm on Slide 4. Let's start with the economy and what we saw during the quarter. As companies continue
to reopen and strengthen, business confidence is improving. However, not all companies are back at
100%, and we continue to hear about struggles with certain customer segments in hiring workers. We
think this will work itself out over the coming months and quarters, but these open roles are serving as
a bit of a governor on the speed of recovery. Due to this uncertainty, customers remain very focused on
their insurance spend and, therefore, managing their deductibles and aggregate limits.

Rates were generally in line with what we experienced in the first quarter. However, we started to see
some moderation to the level of increases in certain admitted and nonadmitted lines. Certain customers
and industries with high losses remain a placement challenge. However, we continue to see carriers
seeking higher rate increases on renewal business while quoting at or below expiring rates for new
business of a similar risk profile. Admitted rates continue to be up 3% to 7% across most lines. The
outliers are workers' compensation rates, which remain down 1% to 3% and commercial auto rates, which
are up 5% to 10%.

From an E & S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%. Coastal property, both wind and quake, are
up 15% to 25%. However, near the end of the quarter, we started to see less upward pressure on -- less
upward rate pressure on renewals.

Professional liability for most accounts remains challenging, the SPAC market in particular. Professional
liability rates are generally up 10% to 25-plus percent. Cyber rates are generally up 10 to 20-plus percent
with increased underwriting questions and some reduction in coverage availability. Also, excess umbrella
coverage remains very difficult to place. For both of these lines, we're seeing carriers reduce overall limits
while seeking significant rate increases.

In the E & S space, California and Florida personal lines continues to be the most challenging. The appetite
for personal lines and cat areas will continue to be constrained through at least the end of '21.

From an M&A perspective, we closed 2 transactions during the quarter with the annual revenues
of approximately $11 million. Our pipeline remains full, and we feel good about the level of activity
engagement with prospective sellers.

Slide 5. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered an outstanding organic growth
of 17.6% for the second quarter. The performance was driven by growth across all lines of business and
most customer segments through a combination of strong new business, good retention, rate increases
and higher exposure units as a result of the economic recovery.

National Programs grew 13.3% organically, delivering another great quarter. Our growth was driven by
strong performance from most programs due to robust new business, good retention and rate increases.

The Wholesale Brokerage Segment delivered a solid quarter with 12.3% organic growth. Brokerage
continues to perform very well, delivering strong growth in new business and realizing continued rate
increases from most lines of coverage. Binding authority had a good quarter, driven by new business and
continued economic recovery. And personal lines in California and Florida remain very difficult to place,
and we don't expect carrier appetite to change in the second half of the year.

The Services Segment had a good quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 4.6%, primarily driven
by claims processing revenue. Growth for the quarter was partially offset by continued headwinds within
the advocacy businesses, primarily the social security space. Overall, it was a very strong quarter across
the board.

Now I'll turn it over to Andy to discuss the financial performance in more detail.

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Great. Thanks, Powell. Good morning, everybody. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results
and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. We're on Slide #6.

For the second quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $128.5 million, or 21.5%, and organic
revenue growth of 14.7%. EBITDAC increased by 35.4%, which expanded EBITDAC margin by 340 basis
points despite lower margin associated with certain acquisitions completed in the past few quarters and
slightly higher travel costs. The EBITDAC growth was driven by the continued leveraging of our expense
base and lower noncash stock-based compensation.

Income before income taxes increased by 44%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to a lower growth rate
in amortization and interest expense as well as a decrease in acquisition earn-out payables. Net income
increased by $42.5 million or 43.9%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 44.1% to $0.49.

The effective tax rate for the second quarter of this year and last year was 25.2%. We continue to
anticipate our full year effective tax rate for 2021 will be in the 23% to 24% range. Our weighted average
number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year, and our dividends per share increased to
$0.093 cents or 9.4% compared to the second quarter of 2020.

We're over on Slide #7. This slide presents our results after the adjustment to remove the change in
estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. For the second quarter of this year and last year,
the impact was minimal with the adjusted and as-reported diluted net income per share of $0.49 growing
44.1% over the prior year.

Moving over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the
quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 21.3%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs
increased by 2.2%. Organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in
foreign exchange rates, increased by 14.7%.

Over to Slide #9. The Retail Segment delivered total revenue growth of 28.3% driven by acquisition
activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 17.6%, which was driven by growth
across all lines of business. Organic growth for the quarter was positively impacted by approximately 300
basis points due to the $8 million adjustment recorded in the second quarter of last year for the economic
disruption associated with the pandemic.

EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 510 basis points, and EBITDAC grew 55.1% due to the
leveraging of higher organic revenue, along with a gain on disposal associated with the sale of certain
books of business. The growth was partially offset by recent acquisitions that have margins lower than the
average, higher noncash stock-based compensation and slightly higher travel cost. Income before income
tax margin increased 580 basis points, growing faster than EBITDAC, driven primarily by amortization and
intercompany interest expense growing at a slower rate than EBITDAC.

We're over on Slide #10. Our National Programs Segment increased total revenue by 14% and organic
revenue by 13.3%. Regarding outlook for the last 2 quarters of 2021, we wanted to highlight that we
anticipate approximately $4 million to $6 million of revenue shifting from the third quarter to the fourth
quarter due to renewal timing for certain accounts.

EBITDAC Increased by $7.9 million or 12.6%, growing slightly slower than total revenues due
to incremental costs associated with onboarding new customers, increased noncash stock-based
compensation and slightly higher variable costs. Income before income taxes increased by $18.4 million
or 38%, growing faster than EBITDAC, primarily due to lower estimated acquisition earn-outs payable and
lower intercompany interest expense.

Over to Slide #11. The Wholesale Brokerage Segment delivered total revenue growth of 17.7% driven by
acquisitions in the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 12.3%. EBITDAC grew by 19.1% with a
margin increase of 40 basis points, even with lower guaranteed supplemental commissions, slightly higher
variable operating expenses and incremental noncash stock-based compensation. Income before income
taxes grew by 6.9%, which was slower than total revenue growth primarily due to higher intercompany
interest expense and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Over on Slide 12. Our Services Segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 4.6%. Regarding
outlook, we anticipate organic revenue growth to be flat or down slightly for the second half of the year
due to continued headwinds in processing claims by the Social Security Administration.

For the quarter, EBITDAC grew by 9.8%, driven primarily by leveraging organic revenue growth. Income
before income taxes increased by 19.8%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to lower intercompany
interest expense and amortization.

A few comments regarding liquidity and cash conversion for the quarter. We experienced another strong
quarter of cash flow generation and have delivered $466 million of cash flow from operations through the
first 6 months of 2021, growing $50 million or 12% as compared to the first 6 months of 2020. Our ratio
of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue remained strong at 30.2% for 6 months --
for the first 6 months of 2021. With the combination of our cash generation and capital availability, we are
well positioned to fund continued growth.

With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Andy. Great report. From an economic standpoint, we continue to believe the economy will
improve over the coming quarters. This should drive increased confidence among business owners and
how they invest in their companies.

A few items we believe will impact the speed and trajectory of the economy are, in no particular order:
one, the ability to hire workers in certain industries; two, supply chain issues that continue to constrain
production and sales; three, the spread of and response to the Delta variant; and four, the impact of
inflation. How these play out will influence the bumps in the road to recovery.

At this stage, we believe there should be further economic improvement throughout the remainder of '21
and into 2022, but not at the same pace experienced in the second quarter. As a result, we anticipate
some moderation of our organic revenue growth during the back half of the year compared to what we
delivered in the first half.

As it relates to the underwriting process, we continue to anticipate our carrier partners to be competitive
for new business and accounts with low losses. We also expect rate increases will be fairly similar to the
first half of the year with maybe some moderation.

From an M&A perspective, we believe the market will remain very active. There are a lot of companies
looking to do transactions, and we feel that we are well positioned with a good pipeline to attract great
companies to join the Brown & Brown team. We will continue to follow our disciplined approach of focusing
on culture and financial alignment as these have been the key to our long-term success in delivering
shareholder value.

We've been talking over the last few earnings calls about our technology initiatives and how these are
advancing. We're very pleased with our progress, and the teams are doing a great job. Our holistic focus
is to improve the experience for our customers, carrier partners and teammates. To achieve this goal, we
have prioritized the following areas: optimize and enhance our utilization of data and analytics; expand
our digital delivery capabilities around products and services; and engage in initiatives designed to drive
greater efficiency and velocity through our underwriting processes.

In summary, we couldn't be happier with the financial performance of the second quarter and the first half
of the year. The results are just outstanding. Our team is doing an incredible job of leveraging our wide-
ranging capabilities to win new customers and retain our existing customers. We are well positioned to
continue delivering good, profitable growth.
With that, now let me turn it back over to Marianne for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Greg Peters from Raymond James.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on a strong quarter. Before I ask a question about your results, probably worthwhile to
get you guys to weigh in on what you perceive might be the opportunities and headwinds and the fallback
from the fact that Aon-Willis Towers Watson merger has been canceled.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Thank you for the comment. Number one, I would say that we were probably surprised, like many people,
in the fact that it was not able to come to some sort of conclusion with the DOJ. Having gone on that long
surprised us. Any time you have a transaction of that size that is -- in any industry that fails to go forward,
there's going to be change in organizations. Some people may decide they want to be on different teams.
They may decide to go in different direction with different businesses. There's all kinds of scenarios.

But from a standpoint of -- our focus is on our existing customer base and the new customers that we
can bring on to our team. And the way you do that is through high-quality, talented people that we have
11,000 plus today, and we're on our way to the next level and the next level.

So I would tell you that we're always looking for good people, and we're always looking and talking to new
prospects. And so disruption creates an opportunity, But like I said, you don't wish ill will on anybody, and
that was a very unusual dynamic that surprised us.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Right. And switching to your results and the organic revenue results, you commented about the balance
between rate, new business, et cetera. I was wondering if you could give us some more color specifically
as it relates to Retail on how much is it new business versus how much of it is existing customers just
coming back online, getting back up and running, et cetera. If you could give us some additional color on
that, that would be helpful.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Right. Thanks for the question, Greg. As you know, we don't give that level of detail. And I know that's
what everybody wants. But what I would tell you is we are writing a lot of new business, period. We do
have some customers that are coming back online. That is helpful. You have, in some instances, rate
increases.

You also have -- remember, certain industries that are not coming back online. So I don't want to give
you the impression that every industry is coming back online at the same rate and speed as every other
industry. And so the restaurant business is just one perfect example. But I would tell you that we are very
pleased with our retention of our existing customers and the amount of new business that we're writing
across the system in all of our divisions.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. I guess the final question I'll ask is on free cash flow. The conversion rate of in excess of 30% is
well above what your annual run rate usually is. Are you anticipating that the back half is going to be

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

lower to bring down the average for the full year? And maybe you can talk about some of the nuances that
have driven the free cash flow result that you've reported in the first 6 months.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Greg, it's Andy. The -- so I guess we'll take your question into 2 pieces, is -- let's talk about the first
6 months of the year. So on an as-reported basis, we're at 30.2%. We were 28.3% last year. And that --
keep in mind, last year as part of the pandemic, allowed all companies to defer their tax payments. So we
had talked about the fact that we had a $15 million deferral of taxes last year into the third quarter. So it
further demonstrates what a great first 6 months of this year that we had. That is primarily driven out of
the incremental margins and the growth that we've had in the first 6 months of the year. We manage our
working capital very tightly, have always for many years.

As it relates to the back end of the year, would anticipate it probably would not be at that same high level
just because of the phasing of the business between the first and second half of the year. But we'd still
anticipate it being good.

Operator

The next question comes from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I was hoping we could revisit the programs business. Can you talk a little bit about what drives the
continued acceleration there? I feel like you typically call out a few items, but I think I missed that in the
opening remarks this quarter.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

We didn't really call it out, Phil, from a standpoint of we had a lot of strong performance across all of our
programs businesses. I think in the past, we've obviously called out things that have cat exposure, and
those businesses continue to perform well, but it was not exclusive to those businesses. We would just tell
you that the entire segment performed really well in the quarter.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. All right. And so I feel like when we're talking about organic in the past, there's been a bit of a
disparity between the haves and the have-nots as to what businesses have started to come back. And
listening to the opening remarks today, it feels like business confidence is improving. And maybe the have
and have-nots is being shifted more so because of things like headwinds in hiring or supply chain issues
as opposed to business confidence. I guess is that a fair characterization that we have this shift? And how
should we think about this with the framework that you talked about moderation of organic in the back
half of the year?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think your statement, Phil, is true in kind of just at face value. The challenge with that is those
people that experienced the toughest time during the downturn are going to have the longest memories
relative to the go-forward and their confidence and thought process in reinvesting in their business.

So I think that your assessment is correct, yes. I also think there are lots of people that are watching.
There's this great desire to get out and be so-called normal again. And yet, now people are watching the
Delta variant spread very closely and how does that impact their business and/or their hiring.

So I think that we're just trying to -- we think that the economic for the GDP and expansion in the second
half of the year is going to slow down slightly. It will not be like what it was in the second quarter. Doesn't

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

mean it's going negative. Doesn't mean anything like that. It's just -- if you look at all the stuff that we're
seeing, it just moderates -- it shows a moderation in the second half of the year. We agree with that, and
that's kind of how we'd answer that.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Hey, Phil, the other thing that we mentioned in our comments -- and this is you talked about the haves
and have-nots. The have-nots of those industries that were most impacted over in the past 15 to 18
months, one of the areas where they are challenged, and hopefully this again will work itself out over the
coming quarters, is their ability to hire workers. And so that's just going to take a while for that to work
itself through the system for them to get back in there. And that's why we made the comment about a
little bit of a governor right now as to how quickly gains can recover.

Operator

The next question comes from Mark Hughes from Truist.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Powell, you talked about the -- I think I heard you say coastal, you saw less upward pressure on renewals
at the end of the quarter. Did I hear that properly? And then at the same time, you talked about the
Floridas, coastal still being difficult to place. I think your description of the coastal property, that you
raised the upper bound in Q2 versus 1Q. Just a little more detail there would be great.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So my first comment was specifically directed at commercial properties, not individual homeowners.
So what I'm saying is, is we're seeing a slight tapering of the rate increases that we saw in the late part of
the second quarter.

The comment about California and Florida is personal lines, that homeowners, and particularly certain
segments of those personal lines markets. So they can be older homes, they could be lower-value homes,
they could be frame construction homes. In the California case, it could be anything in a brushfire area, all
of those type of things.

So what I would say is when you see that range, Mark, there could be a slight wiggle in the range be it
either the bottom or the top end. Don't read too much into that in terms of -- we just kind of want you to
know where the vast majority of those renewals are coming in.

And the point being is as we got down towards the end of June, we started to see some renewals with
slightly less rate pressure. Did not mean it wasn't up, but those are on commercial buildings. It could
include a condo. I mean that's habitational, but not a stand-alone home like if you had a home in Fort
Lauderdale or a home in Miami or wherever.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And then any comment on employee benefits? How did you see payrolls? Any particular consulting
projects? Just the growth there versus the P&C?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

We're very pleased with how our benefits business has performed this year. And we continue to write a
lot of new business because it's an area, obviously, that is -- it's very expensive. It's complex. It's utilized
by the employees of the insured. And we have continued to add capabilities in our benefits area and feel
really good about it. So both segments performed really well in Q2. So it's not a -- it's not one over the

10

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

other. But as it specifically relates to your question, that's how I would answer it. It's performing really
nicely.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay, and then finally, new business, you mentioned a couple of times you say you don't break apart your
growth drivers. I understand that. But is there some difference now? Is it a step function that there's more
business out in the market and you're capturing share? Or is it just good, strong but more in line with
historical?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

I don't think there's something going on dramatically different today. But what I would say is this. We
were very pleased with our performance during the first wave of COVID. And we were -- as I've said
before, I was very pleased at the amount of new business that we wrote over a video conference, where
we weren't able to meet with the people in certain periods of time. And those opportunities have continued
to remain and/or accelerate with people wanting to see us. And so we're out talking to people all over
the country. And we just have some really cool opportunities. And so I don't think there's -- I don't want
to give you the impression that there's some, like something different that's going on. It's just we're
executing really well.

Operator

The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question is on the margin side. Do you guys -- at the start of the year, had said you guys expected
flat to slightly up margins for the year. And you reaffirmed that last quarter, I believe, that you guys are
sitting, after the first half of the year, over -- just over 200 basis points of margin improvement. So then
can you just give us an update on how you think either margins will trend for the full year? Or how you
think they'll trend for the second half of the year relative to the improvement you saw in the first half?

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I know we had said we -- when we started the year and even through the first quarter, flat to up slightly
for the year. And you're right, we're up about 210 basis points right now. We feel good where we are for
the year at this stage and think that depending upon how the back end of the year looks, that we will have
some margin improvement. I don't know exactly where that will come out.

We would not anticipate the same level of growth on a full year basis as what we saw in the first 6
months, just because we know we're going to have some increase in our variable cost in the back end of
the year. Again, I don't know exactly where those are going to land. We feel good about the back end of
the year and probably have some margin expansion. But don't expect it at the same level as the first 6
months, okay?

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question, going back to the guidance of some maybe moderation
in organic in the second half. So I mean, we're sitting -- I know we only -- aren't even fully done with July,
but have you guys seen a moderation in July relative to where things were trending in the second quarter?
And when you say moderation, right, you guys printed a really strong -- it came in at 12%, right, for the
first half in terms of organic. And so could we still be in the double digits in the second half of the year,
even with some moderation?

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

So Elyse, first of all, thank you for recognizing the strong performance in the first half of the year. We
appreciate that. And so we're very pleased with 12.1% organic growth.

Number two, again, as you know, we don't give organic growth guidance. We have historically said that
we're a low to mid-single-digit organic growth business in a steady-state economy. Obviously, there are
some unique dynamics that are going on right now in terms of economic expansion and rates and some
other things that are helping with that. But we're executing our plan as well as we ever have.

So what I would say is this, we would just ask you to think about the economic indicators that you see out
there that we can see when we looked at and/or decided to give that potential moderation in the second
half of the year. So whether you look at GDP, car sales, whatever it is that you're looking at, that may give
you an idea of kind of how we're thinking around in the second half of the year. But we're not going to give
organic growth guidance in the second half.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Have you seen anything, Powell? Like I know we're not even done with July. But have you guys seen
anything in the data that indicate things are slowing? Or is it more just like you said, looking at economic
indicators and just thinking that things might slow as we move through the third quarter and into the
fourth quarter as well?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Elyse, you know that I couldn't answer that right now because that would be a forward-looking statement.
I know -- appreciate your interest, but we're not going to comment on July. But we're going to keep doing
what we're doing, which we're going to continue to deliver for our existing customer base, and we're
writing a lot of new business.

And we've said that we think there could be some rate moderation in the second half of the year. I don't
think it's going to be enormous, but it could -- it absolutely is going to happen, in our opinion. And we're
going to continue to invest in the business by looking for acquisitions that fit culturally and make sense
financially. But yes, we haven't -- we're not going to comment on what we've seen in the first part of July.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, and Elyse, a couple of other things just to keep in mind as you're thinking about the back end of the
year versus the first half of the year. Keep in mind that we have a higher weighting of employee benefits
to the first half of the year, and that grew very well for us. Very, very pleased with the performance there.

The second, and we were talking about this last year, is our lender-placed business had just an
outstanding 2020, performing well again this year. But the year-on-year comps are going to be extremely
challenging. They probably, realistically, will not grow over or at the same amount they did last year. So
that's just going to make the second half of the year just more challenging to grow over that. So just kind
of keep those in mind as you're thinking about kind of weighting on the full year.

Operator

The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Not to take anything away from -- the second quarter organic growth, obviously very strong. You're doing
a lot of things right. Some of it is the environment. And I was hoping you could talk about how that's
impacting M&A discussions.

12

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think the impact on M&A discussions, if there's something that is driving a discussion differently
is the potential change in the tax laws as opposed to the rate environment or the topping of the market
or whatever the case may be. So everybody sells, and when they sell and why they sell are for different
reasons. But I would say that the -- a very common point that is raised in lots of discussions -- that
doesn't mean it's the reason, but a reason, is the concern that the tax structure may be differently next
year on businesses that would be sold. And so -- and how is that going to be impacted in the U.S. tax
structure.

So what I would say, Meyer, is this. To your point, we understand that there is a little bit of an economic
positive impact, but I do want to make sure that you remember that growing at 14.7% on a $2.6 billion
trailing base is a pretty big number. And so I would like to make sure that you and everybody else out
there listening understand that I wouldn't want anyone to take that for granted. That is not easy. It is
something that we're very proud of, and we've got a lot of things firing on all cylinders. But just I would
moderate that comment just a little bit.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

No, understood. That's very helpful. I guess what I was trying to get an understanding of is whether there
are broader-than-normal differences in terms of future productivity among potential acquisitions, like
between your perspective and the potential sellers.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think there's 2 ways to look at that. I think there are very high expectations of value. And the
interesting thing is how people portray their business going forward, particularly if there's a business
broker involved, might be very optimistic. So you have to -- a pro forma of a pro forma is not actual
numbers. So we look closely at that. That's how I would answer that question.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. No, that's helpful. Also, earlier, you talked about the various technology priorities going forward in
terms of data and analytics, et cetera. From our perspective, where are we going to see that make the
biggest difference? Is that a revenue or a margin factor?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Well, here's the way I would tell you: You aren't going to be able to see it in a -- right on a piece of paper
and say, huh, there's the deal. What you're going to be able to see is we're going to implement technology
we either bought or developed or both into our systems that make us more efficient. And we're going to
continue to invest in the business to grow the thing quickly going forward.

So what I would try to say is we're going to capture data. We're going to invest in the technology. We're
going to make things easier for our teammates and our customers. But we're going to continue to reinvest
in the business as well. So we said, as someone said earlier, that we were going to have incremental
margin improvement in 2021. We've been very fortunate in the year-to-date so far. And Andy talked about
what we think we're going to see in terms of margins in the second half of the year. But it is part of a
long-term game plan to enable us to be more competitive and deliver for our customers.

So you're not going to -- we're not going to be able to say, here's your deal. And we're going to break it
out on the line item. We're not going to do that. We're just not going to do it. But we are investing in it,
and it's important that you know that. But at the end of the day, we're going to just have to apply that to
our customers, and they'll be able to see the benefits.

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

And Meyer, that's -- it's cutting across all of our segments. So again, you're not going to just see a retail
or a wholesale jump by X on either top line or bottom line. It's something that's just going to naturally
organically happen over time in all the segments. But it's one of the key priorities for us.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley.

Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

A bit of a follow-up to one of Andy's earlier comments on second half and margin and expenses. I guess
specifically on T&E, we've heard some varying opinions on how that's going to play out in the second half
of the year. I was curious on your opinion there of do we get back to full T&E by the end of the year. Or
how does the pace look in the second half?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

This -- it's Powell, Michael. And the answer is do I think we're going to get back to full T&E by the end of
the year? I think that's unlikely, but we're starting to see a ramp-up because I can tell you, our customers
and our prospects want to see us. And so we are on airplanes and trains and automobiles a lot more today
than we have been, and I only anticipate that increasing.

Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then one more for you, I guess. In the opening question on kind of the follow-up from the
merger that didn't happen, you mentioned opportunities on talent, is what you were kind of alluding to.
I guess does that have other implications on just broader implications for the mix or the pace at all for
industry M&A?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

That's interesting. I don't...

Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And so specifically what I mean is, will there be more demand for kind of middle markets or lower M&A if
big ones didn't happen.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I don't think so. I think there's -- it's -- those are 2 independent things. I think there is a demand in
the insurance brokerage space for all sizes, as you know. That's number one.

Number two, when you see certain firms are interested in acquiring or building more than others,
large and upper-middle market capabilities -- and that could be domestically or internationally for that
matter. And some firms have tried to focus on hiring teams, as you know, from large brokers and moving
them over. Historically, we haven't done that. We have hired people from other firms, and we have
acquired people and other organizations that had been at large firms before. And so I think those are 2
independent things.

I do think that any time you have a shakeup in something like this combined -- if you combine that with
the pandemic and the ongoing issues around the pandemic, I think you have still a lot of people that are
evaluating, do I want to be part of this type of organization, whatever that is? Or do I want something a

little different? And that may create opportunity for entrepreneurial firms like ours. That's the way we look
at it.

Operator

We now take the next question from Mark Hughes from Truist.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just one detail. Andy, you talked about the Social Security Administration kind of slow rolling claims. Could
you expand on that?

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, so Mark, we were talking about this last year. And again, it's kind of a trend that we see that just
happens over different cycles where the Social Security Administration will either accelerate the processing
of a number of cases that we have submitted in there. And they did that back in the kind of back in the
'17, '18, a little bit of '19.

Then what happens is then they constrain the number of lawyers that they have in their reviewing cases.
Those slow down over time and then it'll kind of work back out. You've probably seen the announcement
that their -- the previous director is no longer with the administration, and they're looking to put a new
one in. So that will again, cost and changes up there. It is a cycle. We'll kind of work through it, and then
hopefully, the amount that we've been submitting in there will get processed over the coming year.

It does take a while. It just doesn't turn back on like a faucet overnight. We've got really good inflow into
the business. We just can't get the output from SSA. And that's where we anticipate headwind at least
for the back end of the year. And then we'll have a view as to what it looks like for '22 when we get some
more road covered.

Operator

As there are no further questions, I'd like to hand the call back over to your host for any additional or
closing remarks.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Thank you all very much. We look forward to talking to you after our Q3 for our Q3 earnings call. Have a
wonderful day, and thank you. Bye-bye.

Operator
Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and
gentlemen. You may now disconnect.
