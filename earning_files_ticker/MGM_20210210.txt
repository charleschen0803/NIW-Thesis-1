Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020
Earnings Conference Call. Joining the call from the company today are Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive
Officer and President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer;
Adam Greenblatt, Chief Executive Officer, BetMGM; Hubert Wang, President and COO of MGM China; and
Jim Freeman, SVP of Capital Markets and Strategy. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is
being recorded.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Jim Freeman. Please go ahead.

James Armin Freeman
Senior Vice President of Capital Markets & Strategy

This call is being broadcast live on the internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we have furnished our
press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.

On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal
securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-
looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. Except as
required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or
otherwise.

During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance. You
can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial statements in our press release and our investor presentation,
which are available on our website.

Finally, this presentation is being recorded. And I'll now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today. I hope you and your families continue to be safe
and well. Before we get to the details of our performance in the fourth quarter, I want to take a moment
and thank the thousands of MGM Resorts colleagues around the world who have helped worked so hard
over the past several months. I, along with the other members of the senior management team, am
eternally grateful for the resilience and commitment that our employees have shown throughout this
crisis.

I continue to be amazed by what we've accomplished together. We have adopted seamlessly to a rapidly
changing environment, always putting the safety and enjoyment of our guests and our employees first and
foremost. More than anything else, that gives me confidence in our company's future success.

I'd also like to welcome the newest member of our executive team, our CFO, Jonathan Halkyard. Many of
you know Jonathan from his tenure as CFO of Caesars, and most recently as the Chief Executive Officer of
Extended Stay America. Over the past 20 years, Jonathan has built a well-earned reputation for integrity,
developing people, driving strategy and delivering results for shareholders. I'm excited to have him here
at MGM. And even though it's only been a short time, I can assure you, he's already having an impact.
Welcome, Jonathan.

At MGM, our long-term vision is clear and differentiated. Our goal is simple: to be the premier
omnichannel gaming, hospitality and entertainment company in the world. We will achieve this vision by
investing in the development of our people, providing fun and inspiring entertainment experiences for
our guests, delivering operational excellence at every level and allocating our capital to drive the highest
returns for our shareholders.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

During the quarter, we made progress on each of these fronts. As the pandemic unfolded over the past
year, we had to take the unfortunate steps of furloughing many of our employees to match business
levels. As the business begins to recover and operating restrictions abate, we expect to continue
remobilizing our fantastic teams, rehiring and retraining them in order to serve our guests. Over the
course of this year, we will do the same with our industry-leading entertainers across all of our properties.

Our BetMGM sports betting and iGaming venture is growing at a historic rate, enabled by what I believe is
digital gaming's most talented management and technology development teams. I believe our people are
truly the best in this new industry.

Operational excellence is a mantra here. Beginning in late 2019, we refined our operating model,
increasing spans of control and simplifying organizational layers to accelerate decision-making, bringing us
all closer to our guests and to reducing costs. These moves are already paying off. Our program of $450
million in domestic cost savings helped drive margin improvement, especially at our regional properties
in the fourth quarter, and we should achieve the full target when business demands return to our 2019
levels.

And finally, we are focused on being disciplined allocators of capital, always driven by the goal of creating
value for our shareholders. In the first and second quarter of 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, it
was critical to create and sustain a liquidity cushion for the company, with the top line still under pressure
and the travel climate a bit uncertain, our fortified balance sheet is essential to protect equity value while
enabling MGM to be aggressive when identifying opportunities to invest for growth. And invest for growth,
we have. Even as we've been managing through the crisis before us, we have kept an unwavering focus
on the future and particularly on several attractive ROI growth opportunities that align to our long-term
vision.

Along with our partners, Entain, we have invested in BetMGM, and we have seen it emerge as a leader
in the U.S. sports betting and iGaming business. We've launched an extensive room remodel program
here at Bellagio, slated to be done this summer. And we're taking steps to expand the company's digital
capacities and strengthen our omnichannel strategy globally. And we have been laying the groundwork for
growing our presence in Asia to the Japan IR opportunity and additional investments in Macau.

With that, let's focus on, obviously, the fourth quarter's results. Our consolidated fourth quarter 2020
revenues were $1.5 billion, incrementally better than our third quarter by $1.1 billion. Our fourth quarter
adjusted EBITDAR has improved sequentially to a positive $97 million this quarter. Our full year 2020
revenues were $5.2 billion, about 40% of 2019 levels. And our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAR loss was
approximately $148 million.

The operating dynamics in Las Vegas and our regional properties were, however, quite different in the
fourth quarter. Let's start with Las Vegas.

Our fourth quarter Las Vegas Strip revenues were $480 million, about flat from the third quarter. However,
our Strip's property EBITDAR was $54 million, up from $15 million in the third quarter driven almost
entirely by October and the first half of November. The fourth quarter started relatively strong here in Las
Vegas with hotel occupancies of about 46% during October. And in fact, October was our strongest month
since the beginning of the pandemic, but public health concerns dampened visitation over the course of
the quarter, and this has obviously continued at least 'til now through February. Our fourth quarter hotel
occupancy finished at 38% with weekends running at 52% and midweek at 31%.

Our M life loyalty members continue to drive visitation with our casino segment contributing to total room
nights improving by about 13 points over the last year. And our casino customers and new M life member
sign-ups also continue to skew towards higher worth and younger customers during this quarter. It's our
belief these headwinds will continue into the near term with current Nevada gathering guidelines in effect.
And public health sentiment, where it is, we expect midweek business will be challenged throughout the
first quarter. In this demand environment, we have remained flexible to minimize our cash usage and
ultimately maximize our portfolio-wide profitability.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

In the fourth quarter, we closed our hotel towers at Mandalay Bay and Park MGM during the midweek. And
in early January, we also announced the full closure of Mirage during the midweek. We remain diligent in
closely aligning labor needs to demand. The good news is the approved vaccines appear highly effective
for vulnerable populations, and we are monitoring the rollout closely. As the burden of our health care
system eases, gathering, travel restrictions are being lifted. Assuming that most of the population is
willing to resume normal activity, which we certainly saw glimpses of last summer, then we believe the
demand for travel and visitation in Las Vegas could be robust later in the year. In fact, our gross bookings
in January was the strongest since the start of the pandemic, and guests are increasingly booking 90-plus
days out. I'm also looking forward to the coming pool season with much optimism.

While the return of the larger groups will ultimately depend on the easing of gathering guidelines and
other factors, we remain bullish on the long-term demand. We still have significant rooms on the books
for the third quarter and have more on the fourth quarter than we had at this time last year. Both 2022
and 2023 are approximately one on pace compared with prior years. And it's interesting the LVCVA
recently conducted a survey which indicated that 91% of those surveys missed the face-to-face nature
of meetings, and the majority were also just simply burned out from virtual meetings. The survey
also indicated that business travelers believe Las Vegas is more prepared than other leading business
destinations to safely host in-person events.

Data points like these tell me that the fundamental drivers of Las Vegas as a tourism and meeting
destination remain firmly intact. We remain bullish in its proven ability to drive demand and believe the
markets return to pre-pandemic levels over time.

Now let's move on to our regional performance. Our regional operations performed exceptionally well in
the fourth quarter despite being subject to a series of operating restrictions. Our fourth quarter regional
operations revenues were $595 million, up 7% sequentially versus the third quarter. And adjusted
property EBITDAR was up 9% sequentially from the third quarter to $159 million. As in Las Vegas, we
are highly encouraged that our performance was led by a higher level of casino spend by a younger
demographic.

Gaming volumes were approximately 70% of last year's fourth quarter, but our regional properties
delivered 129 basis points year-over-year EBITDAR margin growth to 27%. We achieved this despite the
statewide restrictions, including the full closure of Detroit for a month as well as the week-long exposure
in extended hurricane repairs at the Beau Rivage. Adjusting for these headwinds and other state-by-
state restrictions, we expect our margins for the quarter would have been up 580 basis points year-over-
year. These continued cost improvements, predominantly in labor and marketing efficiency, are largely
sustainable. I expect continued strong regional margins as revenues return towards our 2019 levels.

Finally, I know we are all encouraged by the states lifting operating mandates over the past couple of
weeks. No doubt, this will enable our properties to serve greater numbers of guests and expect these
guests will lead the recovery in our system.

Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on BetMGM. The sports betting and iGaming market is one of the
largest and most exciting growth opportunities in the U.S.A. today, and BetMGM is emerging as a long-
term leader. BetMGM began 2020 in just 3 markets and has ended the year with 10. It is now currently
live in 12 states, and we expect to be in 20 states by the end of 2021 with access to approximately 40%
of the U.S. adult population. As each state rolls out, MGM is securing a leading market share position.

In the fourth quarter, BetMGM's market share was 17% in its retail and online markets and 19% if you
exclude Pennsylvania, which were only open for part of December. This is a testament to BetMGM's
successful execution and strong management teams as it continues to enter new states on day 1 -- on
day 1 and gained share in its existing markets. Consider the venture's entry into Michigan just a couple of
weeks ago. We had a fully operational iGaming and online sports betting offering on day 1 and prelaunch
registration efforts to build momentum into go live day.

Between December and January, BetMGM registered 138,000 new customers. In the first 10 days of
launch, BetMGM generated $13 million in GGR. That's especially impressive is that our iGaming GGR per
day in January was higher than in New Jersey, where BetMGM is the #1 operator.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Michigan is a market where we knew we had the right format to win. We have an MGM branded retail
presence with a loyal customer base. The ability to go live on day 1 with both iGaming and sports betting,
a compelling product, an attractive target and an attractive target demographic. While it's still very early,
we're extremely pleased with these results thus far.

Our leadership positions have proven sustainable. BetMGM was the #1 iGaming operator in the U.S. in the
fourth quarter, and we expect to continue growing our market share.

On the sports wagering side, BetMGM delivered impressive online sports betting results in 2 of its newest
markets, Colorado and Tennessee. In the fourth quarter, BetMGM had market shares of 31% and 34%,
respectively. These share gains led to $178 million of net gaming revenues associated with BetMGM in
2020, well above its target of $150 million. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, BetMGM's net revenues
doubled the previous quarter.

The convergence between BetMGM and M life has been monumental. In the fourth quarter, 17% of
BetMGM sign-ups have come from MGM, and 39% of the new M life sign-ups have come from Bet
MGM. BetMGM's key competitive advantage is its ability to lever MGM's destinations our broad-based
experiential offerings and our M life loyalty program as efficient and effective customer acquisition tools.
Once engaged, we know that omnichannel customers have vastly greater value to our company than
single-channel customers. And again, while we're still in this in the early days in Michigan, we are already
proving this out. We are currently seeing customer acquisition costs below the $200 range.

In 2021, we and our partners, Entain, expect new revenue associated with BetMGM to grow well
over 100%. In fact, preliminary estimates of January's net gaming revenues associated with BetMGM
operations was $44 million. On Super Bowl Sunday, the number of online bets placed with BetMGM was
11x last year's online bets, and the online handle was 17x last year's handle. That is why we remain
aligned on investing aggressively to fund the growth of this business, and we expect to continue doing so
this year in pursuit of this market opportunity.

Let me conclude now with our performance in Macau. This market continued to steadily improve
sequentially with fourth quarter market-wide GGR declining 70% year-over-year compared with 93%
year-over-year decline in the third quarter. MGM China's fourth quarter revenues were $305 million, up
sequentially from the third quarter's $47 million. And adjusted property EBITDAR was also up sequentially
from a $96 million loss in the third quarter to $41 million in the fourth quarter. This included a $23 million
bonus accrual reversal during the quarter.

We are pleased to finally see that MGM China is back in the black, driven by strong market share gains
as well as continued cost mitigation efforts. Better yet, we think the evolving market structure of
Macau's gaming squarely meets our strengths in the market. MGM China has always been geared to the
premium mass segment. Between our branch office infrastructure, our product design and our marketing
capabilities, we've always had an advantage in this segment. And our growing market share is evidence of
this evolution.

There is no question that we recently reemerged -- with the recently reemerged COVID cases and
government warning and limited travel during the Chinese New Year holiday seasons have impacted
demand in the near term, but we expect the broader rate of recovery will continue to be gradual and
driven by the premier market -- mass market.

I like our opportunities for accretive investment in Macau. Currently, construction of the additional suites
in the south tower of MGM Cotai is underway and will be ready in mid-2021. We've also begun remodeling
our MGM Macau villas in the gaming space on level 35. And at both properties, we're adding F&B options
focused on the gaming floors. And then longer terms, we have also had the ability to build out another
hotel tower at MGM Cotai along with meaningful entertainment assets to diversify our offerings.

For the past 13 years, MGM China has been committed to supporting Macau as a world tourism
destination. We again look forward to working with the government through the licensing renewal process
and hopes to further our support for many more years to come.

Switching on to our liquidity. It remains extremely strong and has served as a strong foundation from
which to navigate the crisis with an eye towards our longer-term goals. As of December 31, MGM had $8.8
billion of consolidated liquidity, which included $2 billion at the MGP operating partnerships and $1.2 billion
at the MGM China, leaving our domestic operations liquidity at over $5.6 billion.
Before I turn this over to Q&A, I'd like to close just with a few final thoughts. We remain diligent in
navigating the near-term operating environment, aggressively managing our operating model and our
cost structure. I am optimistic about the long-term recovery of all of our markets and believe that MGM
is well positioned to gain share. I'm also excited by BetMGM's position in the rapidly growing U.S. sports
and iGaming betting market. And we are confident that despite near-term headwinds, our balance sheet
delivers a strong foundation upon which to build the future of our company. With that, I'll be happy to
open this up to any of your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Bill, either based on conversations with Nevada Health officials or Governors Sisolak's office, when would
you anticipate a rollback in the more recent capacity restrictions in Nevada? And does March seem likely
seasonality? Ideally, it would make sense? And how do you then think about some of the midweek room
closures and reopening some of that hotel capacity?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Look, obviously, we're in constant dialogue with the governor's office and the health officials. We are
hopeful that there'll be a March rollback probably 'til October levels would be ideal. There are no promises
that the governor has slated a call for later this week. I would suspect we'll see something targeted
towards March. So I think March may hopefully begin to feel like October if we're lucky. And by the way,
this is my presumption, not my knowledge. And I'm hoping by end of spring, as we go into June, we'll see
yet another significant rollback as we get ready for events. There are several large conference conventions
that want to come both citywide and here at the property.

And then as you know, March Madness and followed by really spring break, pool season around here
is substantive and meaningful. And so I think we'll see occupancies hopefully go back to October and
then beyond. I know Corey is planning on -- maybe to speak to Corey's quickly, some openings here and
sometime in March.

Corey Ian Sanders
COO & Treasurer

Yes, Joe, our focus on openings will be if we could burn less cash being opened. And what we're seeing on
our booking pace that, that will definitely occur at the beginning of March. So we would expect to open
those 3 properties 7 days a week beginning in March.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And when you look at sort of the net group convention booking activity, what's sort of the period
or month where you see, call it, slippage from canceling and rebooking at a future date ceases, that
September, that October? And then when you look at '22 bookings, I know you were generally pretty
positive on that. If you look at the number of conventions versus the number of anticipated attendees
associated with the convention? Is there much of a difference there? So at some point, we have to be
concerned with attendees, not just sort of whether or not the event will take place when we think about
next year?

Corey Ian Sanders
COO & Treasurer

Yes, Joe, this is Corey. I do think, especially the ones that will attend this year, and we have some
association groups, some pretty big size ones scheduled beginning in June. We do expect the attendees to
be a little bit less initially. But I think as vaccines roll out and as people feel more comfortable traveling,
the amount of people coming may not approach what it was at peak, but we hope to see that return in the
beginning of 2022.

The big -- the first big citywide event has actually been scheduled and has been talked about. That's
the World of Concrete at the new convention center addition, which I walked yesterday, and it's quite

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

spectacular will be really great for the city. I think it will give the city a competitive advantage. And then
literally 2 weeks later, they have Barrett-Jackson.

So we are optimistic what we see on our books in the third and fourth quarter. We still have a quite
amount of rooms on there. And we're -- fourth quarter, we actually have more rooms on the books than
we did same time last year as we look at year out. And so we're pretty optimistic on what we see in the
future. The other data point that we're starting to see is people are starting to look to book, and we have
over 120,000 rooms under contract for 2021 out there right now that I think people are just getting --
looking for one more sign to say things are going to be on the clearer side.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And then, Joe, maybe a little color to put things in perspective. I always find this number interesting. We
collect a lot of advanced deposits for entertainment. Mind you, we haven't had entertainment now for
better part of the year. We're still holding 82% of those advanced deposits for things like Lady Gaga and
other shows that some of them aren't even rebooked yet. And I think what it simply says is that when
available, people want to come back. And the idea of there being, yes, some of the groups may be lighting
participation, but I think the overall leisure travel and the notion of us with this massive amount of pent-
up demand for people to get out. I think we'll offset it in occupancy.

For us, some of it is going to be about RevPAR over the short term, not the long term. But I'm pretty
excited by the trends and the way people have reacted to date. We just had a great Super Bowl weekend
in terms of participation. So I think people will respond as we come out of this.

Operator

The next question will be from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.

Chad C. Beynon
Macquarie Research

I wanted to touch on the press releases that were out during the quarter just on the Entain situation. You
were very clear in terms of everything you've been able to accomplish recently with BetMGM. But just
wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more in terms of what was announced, the process and then if
you would expand beyond the United States, given your success here, if that was part of the thinking with
your original proposal?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Look, Chad, look, I mean, the thinking is we see a great deal of opportunity in digital gaming, sports
or iGaming and other potential channels, actually, where entertainment and gaming could converge.
That being said, it's a big world. Obviously, we have a very good partner in Entain. We have our JV with
BetMGM that I've just articulated how well we think it's doing. There's a lot I can't say, they're U.K.
takeover rules. So there's a whole lot I can't say about our thoughts around that.

Obviously, we had an interest. We're now in a quiet period. We'll have to see what happens. But I will say
this, it is MGM's intent to play in this space on a substantive and significant level on a global basis. And
so whether this is the avenue or the route to do it or not, I think time will tell. But we do want to diversify
our revenues. We think this is where the industry -- it's already started to prove itself. This is where the
industry is going, and we want to be a larger part of it.

Chad C. Beynon
Macquarie Research

And then one thing you hadn't touched on yet is Japan. There were some announcements out there in
another market, not the market that you're focusing on. Can you just give us an update in terms of what's
the latest in terms of timing, provincially, and then with the federal government over there?

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Sure. The federal government announced a 9-month delay. Osaka has not given us the requirements of
what that will mean to them in our submissions. I think that will be coming out within the next several
weeks. I think you'll see a requirement of us to submit an RFP with our partner, ORIX, sometime this
summer. It's yet to be ultimately determined, and we're ready to go.

I mean we've been in that marketplace a long time. We're a believer in Asia. We're a believer in Japan.
We've spent a lot of time and energy becoming the sole -- once standing at the gate, if you will, in Osaka.
And so how long this all takes? Obviously, COVID has hit there as equally as hard. And there's a great deal
of sensitivities around it in that market. We haven't had our people on the ground there for a better part
of 9 months. So it's going to take some time to rebound, but we have the intent and as well, I believe that
the government still has the same intent of moving forward.

Operator

The next question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

And Jonathan, welcome. I just wanted to start, Bill, you gave some really interesting disclosures on what
you're up to in the sports betting and iGaming front and specifically, some great data around Michigan.
And I just wanted to get maybe a sense in particular, the iGaming numbers look really stellar to launch
off, I mean, already being at a pace that's ahead of New Jersey is pretty significant, given I think the
population is about the same size.

So could you maybe unpack that for us a little bit? What do you think is driving the depths of that
market? What do you think is driving MGM's success there as it relates to maybe some of your cross-sell
opportunities and customer acquisition?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

I'll kick it off. I'd love you to hear for Adam here because he's obviously doing this every day up there. But
we got going early, we were ready for it. We preregistered folks. We had a campaign. Obviously, we've
got huge brand presence there. We have a deep and rich database there. And ultimately, I think, with our
product, it resonated.

But Adam, why don't you provide some color?

Adam Greenblatt

Yes. Absolutely, Bill. Thanks, Shaun, for the question. Well, firstly, I'm delighted to be here, and it's a
testament to the work of the BetMGM team, the success we're seeing. And Michigan is a great example of
our strategy, BetMGM strategy coming to life.

Bill's already touched on the power of the brand. We've got BetMGM Detroit branded BetMGM -- sorry,
MGM Grand Detroit branded. As the power of omnichannel, we've got both sports and gaming. And that
really plays into our hand.

The technology that we use from Entain was built in a way that gives us tremendous amount of flexibility
in driving cross-product play. And we're really seeing this come to life in Michigan. And I think the key
step that perhaps you're looking for is multiproduct play. Recognizing that we're in the early days of the
market, we are seeing well over 30% of our customers playing both casino and sports. And so we're really
excited about it. There's so much potential.

iGaming has started more strongly than our sports business. The Super Bowl was very good for our sports
business. So yes, we look to the future of that state very, very encouragingly.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then maybe as my follow-up, you guys did allude to your customer acquisition cost being, I think,
lower than some of the market standards that we've seen in other markets. I'm kind of curious on your
thought of is that type of rate sustainable when you have this type of presence in kind of first-day launch?
Or do you expect to begin to reinvest some of that lower customer acquisition cost, both as the market
matures and also maybe to vastly further boost your market share presence?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Adam, again, why don't you...

Adam Greenblatt

Yes, for sure. Bill already touched on our ability to get live on day 1 of the market, and your question is
relevant to that. What we are seeing having launched 5 states in 87 days, a very, very busy first quarter
and beginning of 2021, what we've seen is that in the first few days, the early weeks of the market, CPAs
are very low. Then we see as competition, other operators join us in those markets, we see CPA rates rise,
we expect then the guidance that you've had from us and others to sustain for a period.

What we do expect, though, is that as the market rationalizes, as the market matures, the leaders cement
their position in those leadership positions that we will see those CPAs come down in due course. So that's
kind of the profile.

Operator

The next question will be from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just some more BetMGM question. I think the key message is that your -- you've gotten really strong
share to date and you see room to continue to ramp. And looking at your disclosures quarter-over-quarter,
it seemed like you ramped New Jersey iGaming share from 20% to 25% and Colorado online sports
betting share from 12% to 31%, despite, I believe you launched on May 1 in Colorado, along with the rest
of the market. So what's driving this really strong ramp? And what gives you confidence it will continue to
go?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Go ahead, Adam. And you can't say brilliant management, but go ahead.

Adam Greenblatt

Well, that's -- obviously, that's where I was going to go. Our business is a detailed business. Our business
is the orchestration of all of the tools from the top of the acquisition funnel, to how we look after players
to how they experience, our product, to our real-time CRM tools to the brand to the work that we're doing
with MGM Resorts to really bring to life that M life database to the fact that our players that BetMGM
players earn loyalty points that are redeemable for real-life experiences within properties.

All of these factors play a part into differentiating what BetMGM represents to our customers. And so to
pull out one or other elements of that, I think doesn't really reflect how important it is to line up all of
those factors in order for the whole thing to come together and that, I believe, is what is driving our -- the
momentum that we're seeing in our business. And it is sustainable because of it.

It's difficult to do. And the business is -- our BetMGM business is now really hitting stride. We've got the
right team, the tools are working, and we're seeing the fruits of that in the numbers.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Adam, I guess, as a follow-up, you hit #1 share in Tennessee. There are fewer competitors in that market,
but you still have the main competitors in that market. What do you think is driving your leading position
there?

And then you also highlighted in the slide deck, $13 million of deposits in January. Can you just talk a little
bit about why that's relevant?

Adam Greenblatt

Yes. I'm personally delighted about Tennessee because many -- some have suggested that we would
accelerate gaming but perhaps not be as strong in sports. And for me, Tennessee is the poster child of our
ability to compete against the early leaders in a sports market only. Now why are we seeing such success?
We were there on day 1. All of the components of our operating model were in place right from the start.
We have the right partners. We are partners with the Titans. So put all those things together, obviously,
combined with product, CRM, all of the acquisition machine working. And we're demonstrating that we can
fight and win toe to toe with the best.

In relation to your second question, which is around deposits, that's important because that's the fuel, no
deposits, no ability to wager, no ability to play. And the other point is to the -- what -- it's important --
rephrase.

The moment of truth is our players actually putting hard-earned money into an account to play with us
rather than it being purely bonus money incentive money. And so the importance of that $13 million is it
demonstrates the scale of fuel to drive NGR. I hope that's helpful.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And the next question will be from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Bill, if you could, just as you guys think about the book of business for -- on the group side for '22 and
'23. And you kind of look at where occupancy levels were and where rates were in 2019. Obviously, the
group side is pretty encouraging. So when you think about the ability to backfill and drive pricing and
stuff, assuming the base case scenario, vaccinations, everything plays out. We flip the calendar next year
and all of this is behind us. How do you guys kind of think about a return from a hotel revenue, REVPAR,
profitability perspective over the '22, '23 period, look, for the strategy?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would hope by the fourth quarter of '22, we're at about a 90% pace of where we were in 2019. I
think the question really becomes what are the first and second quarters look like, and that's obviously
dependent on the balance of this year and how quickly that ramps. But I hope to be every bit of the way
there and maybe even the third quarter. It just again depends how quickly it comes back. It depends on
how much rebound enthusiasm we have from customers just wanting down the house. so while I think,
again, the group business may be slower, we certainly have the business on the books. I think there's
going to be massive pent-up demand in terms of leisure business wanting to come.

And then we really haven't thought about or talked about the funnel for international. I mean I think you
all know this historically that Bellagio summer, so we get into summer of next year with a clean slate
internationally is 40% of our guests are truly not only in gaming, I mean our guests are international. And
so we have a large segment of that business. I think that will play into this, if it's allowed to come back
the way we hope and believe it will. And so that's my thinking or sentiment. Adam, I don't know if you
want to add.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Adam Greenblatt

Yes, I completely agree, Bill. The only other dependent is really air traffic and how much -- how fast they
can build their capacity back because I think the demand for our business will be there.

Jonathan S. Halkyard
Chief Financial Officer

Carlo, it's...

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Yes, go ahead.

Jonathan S. Halkyard
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Carlo, it's Jonathan. And the only thing I would add is that I think this could be particularly interesting
with these revenue gains against the cost structure that's been resized as a result of a number of the
initiatives this company has taken on over the past 18 months and is now being tested in certain pockets
of growth that we've seen, whether it be weekends or on the regions and has really resulted in margin
expansion in those periods. So I think that the top line certainly is an important part of the question, but
the way in which we flow that through down to EBITDAR is going to be probably even more exciting.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And we had in the fourth quarter I think the point that -- the occupancy in the fourth quarter, Bellagio,
Corey, was 34%, something like that.

Corey Ian Sanders
COO & Treasurer

I think they're a little higher.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

A little higher.

Corey Ian Sanders
COO & Treasurer

Yes. Yes.

Jonathan S. Halkyard
Chief Financial Officer

But the margins were up into the 40s.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

So I mean we had -- so it -- even in that small of amount of volume, we can see the margin, we can
clearly see in the regional businesses, but as Las Vegas returns, we'll see, I think, here, first and foremost,
in Aria, hopefully. And then it will flow through the balance of the business.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And Bill, just to clarify, I think you said 4Q '22. Did you mean 4Q '21 with that 90% number?

President, CEO & Director

No. I meant...

Jonathan S. Halkyard
Chief Financial Officer

4Q '22...

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

You asked the question on '22. I -- that's what I said. I'm sticking by it.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Okay. I would just want to make sure. Okay. And then just one follow-up. As you guys -- obviously,
you guys talked a lot about the sports piece and off to the -- it's been off to the races and a really strong.
How should we think about and I know this is going to be kind of a moving target because, unfortunately,
as new states come online, clearly, you're going to be spending and investing in those states, and that's
going to take kind of the profitability window longer, which is ultimately, obviously a good thing.

But if you think about the states where you're live now, with what you are seeing, the volumes you're
achieving and think you will be able to subsequently achieve, when would you say kind of breakeven from
an EBITDA perspective on the sports side could come? If we were to just assume status quo and no new
state launches.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Look, Adam, I don't know if we've broken it out exactly that way. I think we're in the second half of
'23 and beyond before we start to come down, if you will, off of peak investments. Adam, obviously, it
depends on how states roll out and when. Obviously, by '24 and '25, we have models that are throwing off
substantive EBITDA. Adam, I don't know if you want to add to that.

Adam Greenblatt

Yes, that's absolutely right, Bill. It's -- on a state basis, we've indicated that our expectation is it takes
about 3 years to get to breakeven. So the critical piece here is the timing of state rollout, particularly the
big stage.

Operator

And the next question will come from John DeCree with Union Gaming.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just one for me to continue the discussion on BetMGM. One of the statistics you provided was about 17%
of BetMGM sign-ups have come from M life. And I'm not sure if you have any real data, but I'm curious
if you could talk about where some of the other customers are coming from. You've got a number of
partnerships that you've put together Yahoo! and sports teams and such. And so curious if you have a
sense of where the other 80% or so of customers are coming from? And if that's not really available,
kind of where are you spending your efforts in customer acquisition away from M life, direct marketing,
anything like that, that you could kind of give us a little bit of color on how you're acquiring those other
customers right now?

William Joseph Hornbuckle

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Adam, all you.

Adam Greenblatt

Yes, absolutely. By far, MGM is #1. Through M life and omni, MGM is #1. We've said that, and that remains
the case. And frankly, I think that's only going to get bigger. Clearly, we're at limited -- not limited,
reduced occupancy in the properties. And we're seeing great conversion rates in the properties, both
conversion rates and also CPAs. So very excited about a post-COVID world.

After that, you correctly referenced Yahoo! Yahoo! is our next largest partner source of traffic. They've
just actually been licensed in Michigan, and we've already seen the positive impact on player recruitment
from that. Behind that, there is a range of sources. We're investing in brand. We're investing in outdoor,
TV, digital. So the biggest single source rather than being attributed to one partner, our biggest source
of traffic is organic. So it's the combination of all the work we're doing on brands and TV and outdoor. So
people actually typing into their browser BetMGM, that's the next biggest one. But otherwise, it's a range
of origins.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And then John, frankly, for us, in the brick-and-mortar side, it's the inverse because that number is almost
double in terms of people that we've been able to reactivate to the brand, bring in. I think I mentioned
on the last call, some of the success we had at Borgata, bringing back 165,000 folks -- reigniting 165,000
folks from M life who hadn't been in, in a while. And so it's a 2-way street.

Obviously, for acquisition for Adam's team, this is the cheapest. For us, it's the opportunity to reactivate
and reengage. And frankly, stay engaged 365. Vegas, they come 1.5x a year. If we're lucky, regionals are
more, but the idea that we could have connectivity for that extended period of time is pretty exciting.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Securities, LLC, Research Division

I agree. I'll let you get a couple more quarters of casinos reopening, and then I'll ask you for some stats
on how those new BetMGM customers and M life are doing at the casino. Looking forward to that. And
congratulations on the solid results.

Operator

The next question will be from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Two questions. And if we can, this may be a chance to get Jonathan in the game. As we look at the
recovery, specifically in Vegas, we've all talked about how the regionals expect to retain a healthy amount
of the margin increases. But I'm wondering how complex it is opening large-scale integrated resorts and
the degree to which you can sort of hang on to margins. I'm wondering what comment you can make
about profitability levels as we roll out to a more normalized level and whatever that is, '22, '23 and how
that margin percentage compares to '19?

Jonathan S. Halkyard
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for getting me in the game. I'll offer a couple of thoughts. There's -- as I've done some
forensics on the performance of the business last year and in 2019, and looked at the projects which
Corey has led through operations to really reconsider the operating model and not just in the past 12
months, but even before the company entered 2020, I'm convinced that this business, with the return of
the volumes as complex as it is, as you noted, can secure the gains in the cost structure that they have
seen so far.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

It was a long time ago. It feels like a long time ago. But it's important to note that this time last year, in
January and February of 2020, MGM's property-level margins had increased almost 500 basis points over
the prior year. And that was a benefit of the cost moves and some restructurings that occurred during
2019, and we were already seeing in the numbers a year ago.

And that program, those series of programs were augmented further, of course, during 2020. And beyond
that, and this has been a bit of a surprise for me coming to MGM for sure, that the company really has
a very effective operating model with centers of excellence in the areas you would expect, hospitality,
gaming, finance, entertainment, that cut across the entire enterprise and are effective and efficient,
delivering, I think, a better outcome at lower cost. And that kind of organization is absolutely critical when
we talk about things like the reopening of these properties.

So I certainly anticipate EBITDAR margins solidly above 30% across the enterprise as we recover. We
would have seen that in the regions in the fourth quarter of 2020 had we not had the closures. And I'm
confident that we can get there in Las Vegas as well as we reopen.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And David, I just might add a thought, look, we are open. We open and close some of them every week,
and that's a complex process. But -- and so we've proven to ourselves that the restructure, our ability to
spread management across multiple properties in terms of senior leadership, not only is going to work,
has worked.

And so it's not overly complicated. I think the trick for us will be -- make sure that we're tight and we're
disciplined on yielding volumes and making sure that we do labor the way we forecasted it and the way
we've presumed that we've done historically in the last couple of months, as Jonathan mentioned before,
the pandemic. That will be our test, if you will. It's not overly complicated at this point. As a matter of
fact, kind of being here in the middle of the shift is probably the most complicated.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. And my follow-up is probably not for Jonathan. I wanted to ask about the digital gaming and
the degree to which and the importance of which owning your own technologies and owning your own
capabilities becomes increasingly important as you scale. Candidly, it was one of the first thoughts I had
around the -- just before the Super Bowl when there started to be some news about volumes becoming an
issue.

If you could just talk about that importance going forward, that would be helpful, economically and
strategically.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, I will kick it off, and then I think Adam can speak to the Super Bowl. I'll be happy to hand that
one.

The good thing with our partnership is it's that. We gave our retail business. They gave their technology.
And so by not owning our technology in most circumstances, there's a percentage that comes with that.
We're not burdened with that, if you will. We're not paying a percentage of GGR or NGR, GGR on someone
else's technology. So that's the first affirmative thing.

When it comes to this initiative with Entain, obviously, America is the biggest thing in the world right now,
and so we're all highly focused on it. And so our ability -- and as you know, it was rough out of the gate,
but our ability over the last year, particularly led by Adam now, to get the teams engaged, to get the
technology, to get the development effort, to get the product that we need and want for America of note
because obviously, it was designed to speak to Premier League and other things, has been meaningful.
Sure, ultimately, at some point, it could come into play. But for today, we don't pay the premium that
others do.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

As it relates to Super Bowl, it wasn't necessarily a volume thing, but Adam, why don't you just comment
on it for a moment?

Adam Greenblatt

Yes, of course. Bill, if you'll indulge me, just before I get on to that, just to -- David, to build on what
Bill has said. Look, owning the owned technology piece is important for -- on 4 -- 4 pillars. The first,
obviously, is cost. We're not paying away to a third party, the cost of it. But importantly, by owning our
product, we can get to market quickly. We can be there on day 1 as we've demonstrated 5 times over --
in 87 days. I don't think anybody else has done that. So speed to market so that we can capitalize on that
pent-up demand, that low CPA period that is vital and valuable. We can also -- staying with product, we
can also respond quickly and I believe more quickly than anybody else to what customers are telling us,
and we have a research group now and a research process, so that the process of ongoing improvements
to product can be translated into what customers experience as quickly as possible. So that's a further
benefit.

Content is the other. We have in-house within our partnership within Entain, we have in-house studios,
which allow us to bring unique content to market, which is both cheaper than buying -- obviously, we're
not paying away a rev share. But it's the only place in town that you can play certain games. Our most
popular iGaming product in New Jersey and now in Michigan is our in-house developed game.

So -- and playing that forward, why is that relevant? Because we think that we can continue to
develop, innovate and differentiate. And the last is the tools that are unique to our platform, the player
management tools, the customer communication tools. All of those come together in a way that we think
is strategically valuable.

Now getting on to the -- that's all the good stuff. As regards the Super Bowl, look, Bill already mentioned
the Super Bowl was a record-breaking day for BetMGM. Online bets 11x last year, online handled 17x last
year. And our digital performance was robust throughout the U.S., which, as you probably read, wasn't the
case for all operators and actually enhanced our competitive position.

But Nevada was different. But -- and in Nevada only, we did have an outage, which resulted in the system
being down during the game. But the system was restored shortly after and has been working as normal
ever since.

Now this is the important part. The issue that caused the outage was specific and was the unfortunate
result of a human error and has been addressed. We know that the software works, which makes the
downtime on Sunday, all the more disappointing, particularly given all the tremendous work that was done
by our MGM colleagues in preparation for the event, which was just enormous. And it goes without saying
that we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers, who I hope are looking forward
to March Madness as much as we are.

And I'll give it back to you, Bill.

Operator

And our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

All of my BetMGM questions have been answered already. Just one on Macau. Obviously, you were cash
flow positive in the fourth quarter. But I know from your comments and comments that others have
made, it sounds like a lot of that was really in the month of October. So just wondering with the sort of
dampened levels that you've talked about, has -- is the property cash flow positive now here in Q1 so far?

William Joseph Hornbuckle

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Zhi Qi Wang
President of Hospitality & CFO

Thank you. Thank you, Robin, to make my early rise in Macau worthwhile. Actually, I think I want to
correct one thing you stated.

In Macau, actually, the cash flow has been all positive each month in the month -- in the fourth quarter.
Actually, December had the best financial results. And also in terms of business recovery, December was
the strongest. And of course, going into first quarter, we saw some of the momentum carried over in the
first week of January. But after that, because of the COVID cases in China increased so there was some
travel advisory put in place by the Chinese authorities at all different levels. We do anticipate that hotel
occupancy will reach a level similar to October Golden Week last year for Chinese New Year period. And
this will be a period for us to remain positive for month to -- for quarter-to-date period.

And visitation to Macau is a function of COVID cases in Macau, COVID cases in China and also the
availability of vaccination. I think that when you look at these variables, there is no reason to believe that
the travel advisory will stay in place for a long period of time because I think Macau has been almost 250
days without any local cases. And in China, the first that we saw in December or early January has quickly
diminished to about low double digits in the teens. And vaccination in Macau and also in China has been
pushed out to more and more people.

So I do believe that we have reason to be optimistic in the first quarter. Back to you, Bill.

Operator

The next question will come from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Changing gears a little bit. What are your latest thoughts and the different paths to think through MGP and
potentially deconsolidating that asset?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Look, I'll kick it off, and we'll let Jonathan end since I spoke way too much here. Obviously, we have
an opportunity with some more high basis units that we can go after. It's still our long-term intent to
potentially sell some of this down, if not over time, all of it, so we're more asset-light company. But there's
a lot involved between now and then. And so Jonathan, why don't you pick it up for me.

Jonathan S. Halkyard
Chief Financial Officer

I mean I'd only offer a couple of thoughts, Stephen. As Bill said, it certainly is our goal over time to reduce
our ownership stake in MGP, it would -- I think it would help, in some ways, simplify our story and our
corporate structure.

We do have some opportunities to do tax-efficient sales of OP units. But it is also a -- it's a high yield on
the investment that we have in MGP right now, so relatively high yields. So we certainly need to balance
our moves with that, which is right now an appealing return on that investment. But the direction is
certainly over time to reduce that.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Makes sense. And then if I can sneak a follow-up in on BetMGM and iGaming. Are the customer acquisition
cost for all iGaming and sports betting players, including the M life customers? If it is, what do you think
the customer acquisition costs are for non-M life customers? Perhaps another way of coming at it, can
you identify how many of the M life sign-ups of that 39% that were attributed to BetMGM, what does that
equate to in terms of just number of people?

Stephen, can we hook you and connect you with Adam for some of that off-line?

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes, that sounds good.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

We could go on for a while on that one. We've obviously suggested that M life customers are a whole lot
less expensive to get. There's obviously more expense tied to brand-new customers that, over time, we
think we'll become profitable for all of us.

iGaming actually costs a little bit more, but they're much bigger wallet, they last a lot longer, which is the
value set there really. And sports betting is so new. We don't know what 3 years in the sports betting looks
like because no one's ever done it before. And so -- but I'd love you to spend some time with Adam. And if
I could offer you up, Adam, that would be great.

Adam Greenblatt

Of Course. Of course. I'd be delighted. I like talking about our business.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference
back over to Bill Hornbuckle for any closing remarks.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. Obviously, we're excited about our sports
betting business. You can tell, and I can sense everyone's excitement. It's obviously the conversation and
the value driver of present. And we think, ultimately, in the long term, for long term for the company.

You've heard us talk about diversification. We are hell bent on that, whether it's into this space or other
areas, brick-and-mortar and otherwise in Asia. That's something we're going to continue to be keenly
focused on. We're going to have a very disciplined approach coming out of this emergence, if you will,
to make sure that the expenses that we put in play, and we've all worked so hard for over the last 18
months. And frankly, 2 years, it started a long time ago. And then we doubled down during COVID when
we restructured once again at the parent company level.

You've heard from Jonathan his view on the outside. Our COE and our environment, our operating model
is working. So not only is it cost-effective, but we think it's effective in general, and it works.

And ultimately, we're going to become extremely customer-centric. We want to value up our customers.
We want to push them up our chain, our food chain, if you will. We think there's a lot of retail money
still to be had at Aria and at Bellagio. And we're excited to get going with platforms here around digital
marketing and some of the things we've just put in play with the digital check-in that gives us access to
customers like we've never had before that we're excited to ultimately to deploy.

So a lot more to come. Obviously, we've got probably 3 or 4 months of angst, and we'll see as these
states continue to roll out and most notably here in Southern Nevada, what happens. I think starting
this week, we'll hear from the governor. And then over the next couple of weeks and months, it will be
important to stay in touch. And obviously, any or all of us are available right after the call or into tomorrow
morning. So I thank you all. Bye-bye.
