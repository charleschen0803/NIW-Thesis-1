PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 17, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the PPG Industries Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My
name is Rocco, and I will be your conference specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's
event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead, sir.

John Bruno
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your
continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call.
Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince
Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday,
July 16, 2020. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the
investor center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and
provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management's
perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.

Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements
reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and
financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results
to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking
statements.

This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in
the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these
non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional
information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.

Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome everyone to our Second Quarter 2020
Earnings Call. As John noted, we posted a detailed narrative on our website yesterday afternoon. And as
a slight process improvement versus prior calls, I will make just a few opening comments on the quarter,
and then we'll move into Q&A.

First and most importantly, I hope that you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.
Throughout this challenging time, we remain encouraged and proud of all the PPG team members for
protecting each other, meeting the dynamic needs of our customers, helping communities and ensuring
stability for all our stakeholders. We continue to remain optimistic about our business and continued
growth prospects.

I also want to comment briefly on the issue of systemic racism and discrimination that has existed
for far too long. As a society, we're at a pivotal moment in history and clearly enough is enough. As
a global company, we're focused on doing our part to help advocate for equality, justice and inclusive
workplace that is free of discrimination. Our global leadership team has been holding open discussions
with employees looking at strengthening our diversity and inclusion leadership efforts, reviewing our
own policies and processes and leveraging the PPG Foundation to support nonprofits who are making a

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 17, 2020

positive difference in these important areas. This is and will remain a priority area for me and the entire
PPG leadership team.

Now I'll move to discuss our financial results. Last evening, we reported second quarter 2020 financial
results. For the second quarter, our net sales were $3 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted
share from continuing operations were $0.99. These results, which were significantly impacted from the
business interruption caused by the COVID pandemic, were better than we originally anticipated. As we
communicated in our financial update provided during the quarter, April and May volumes in aggregate
were down more than 30% due to the pandemic. For the month of June, strong global architectural
coatings demand continued, largely driven by do-it-yourself sales and was coupled with sequentially
improving auto and general industrial demand, resulted in total company sales to be down by a low-teen
percentage.

I'm pleased to report that our global architectural business delivered a record quarter, driven by strong
performance in many countries, highlighted by our Mexico team. During the second quarter, our recovery
advanced furthest in China where several businesses, including automotive OEM, general industrial
coatings and protective marine coatings, all had higher year-over-year sales volumes. Year-over-year
demand was lower in other major global regions, but our sequential monthly sales volumes improved in
each region during the quarter.

Given that we have a large China business, we began our pandemic response in late January, so we were
able to implement quick, already tested and decisive actions to help mitigate the lower sales activity and
the virus spread outside of China. As a result of these actions, we delivered about $170 million of interim
cost savings within the second quarter. In addition to the interim cost savings actions, we achieved more
than $20 million of cost savings from our restructuring programs which are permanent reductions to our
cost structure.

This, coupled with good selling price realization of nearly 2%, mostly from our distribution-type
businesses, helped us achieve double-digit margins in the second quarter, which is significant
improvement versus the depth of the prior recession in 2008 and 2009. Our operating margin in the
second quarter is a strong testimony of the structural cost savings we have delivered in the past few years
and higher level of variable cost in our cost structure overall.

Also in the quarter, our cash flow from operations totaled approximately $500 million, a level comparable
to the prior year second quarter. This is supported by rigorous management of our working capital,
resulting in a $400 million reduction in our working capital compared to the same period last year.

Looking ahead, we expect economic activity to continue to recover with differences across end-use
markets and geographic regions. We expect our global architectural business to continue to be more
resilient and deliver higher organic sales in the third quarter. Although we anticipate softness in the U.S.
commercial maintenance segment to linger and do-it-yourself demand to remain strong but somewhat
less robust in the second quarter, we are pleased with the advancements with respect to our U.S.
architectural coatings delivery model, preferred authorized dealer network and our global digitalization
initiatives and expect continued customer adoption leading to further growth opportunities in the future.
We anticipate demand for our automotive OEMs and general industrial products to continue their recovery
in the third quarter. Other businesses, including automotive refinish and aerospace, will take longer to
recover until travel and miles driven return close to 2019 levels.

Results mean -- excuse me. Due to the uncertainty over the economic climate resulting from the
continuation of the COVID-19 pandemics, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be down 8% to 15%
in the third quarter, with differences by business and regions. Decrements to margins in the third quarter
are expected to be slightly worse than those experienced in the second quarter. This is related to removing
some of the interim cost-mitigation actions in the third quarter as demand for our products progresses and
to ensure we properly service our customers as they continue to resume their operations.

Our liquidity position remains strong and has improved from the first quarter. We remain committed
to our legacy of rewarding shareholders and have approved a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend, a

reflection of the confidence we have over maintaining and growing our cash flow. We will also continue to
be disciplined over our approach to capital allocation.

As the pandemic continues, our focus will remain on leveraging The PPG Way, protecting our employees
and providing excellent support to our customers with the essential products and services they need to
resume and ramp up their operations.

In addition, we will continue to support the communities where we do business. I'm very proud and
pleased with how our global team, as a One PPG team, is managing through this prolonged and extremely
challenging time. I firmly believe that we will emerge as a stronger company.
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now Rocco,
would you please open the line for questions?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Michael, just on raw materials in Q3 and the back half of the year, what are your expectations as to how
much of a tailwind they might be versus either the first half or the prior year?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, David, I would look at that in 2 ways. The first one is we continue to see moderation on a year-over-
year basis. But you have to be a little bit careful that on a sequential basis, things like copper and oil have
started to move up. So I think that moderation -- pace of moderation will vary in the third and fourth
quarter. We're not exactly sure how the pandemic is going to continue to play out. But I would be looking
at it on both a prior year basis as well as a sequential basis.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Very good. And just on the DIY strength continuing into Q3, how much moderation do you expect? And
how much do you think maybe was pulled forward into Q2 from these projects?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I don't think there was really any pull-forward. If you look at inventory on the shelves, I would
say that most of our big box customers would advocate that they would like to see more inventory
on the shelf. So I don't see a pull-forward from that standpoint. But I do think there is a limit on how
many rooms that people will paint in their house. So I do think it will start to slow down over time. Now
obviously, that's going to vary by how long there's a stay-at-home ordered by various states. But we are
not expecting the third quarter to be quite as strong as the second quarter.

Operator

Our next question today comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Really appreciate the granularity on the slide deck. It's really helpful. Michael, you mentioned that you felt
the next quarter, maybe aggregate, would be down about the same rate as the June month. So is that --
am I right to read that as an expectation of just sort of a steady state from the June exit velocity for the
firm? Or is there something else under the hood going on there?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

No. I think that's a reasonable assumption. I think the question we have is if you look at some of our
big markets, so think about automotive, right? They have demand out there, but they're having people
problems, getting their plants up and running and making sure everybody's safe. So I think that's the
challenge that we don't understand, is to what extent will they be able to keep their plants operating at
the level they want? Because they have the demand, and it's just -- now it's just a matter of whether they
can keep it going.

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 17, 2020

Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And then you commented that you were able to pull some, I guess, period costs out during the second
quarter. But on the industrial side in particular, it seems many of those have to go back in to start
supporting a recovery in those -- in that customer base. How long do you expect that to last? And should
we then see the flip side of that, which is a really healthy incremental margin improvement as those
volumes come back?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Bob, the way we're looking at it is in the second quarter, we had a number of our plants down for
a substantial period of time. Some of them down 4 to 6 weeks, right? And we did a really, really good job.
Our team did a fantastic job with our customers coordinating what colors they wanted when they started
up. And we tried to manage that such that they took the colors we had, the colors they wanted, right
before they shut down. And so we were able to actually stay down longer than they were because of that
coordination with the customer. So that, we can't duplicate in the third quarter because basically all our
plants are running again.

But we have learned a lot of things through this pandemic. Our ability to drive productivity has improved.
Our digital initiatives have continued. And so I think a lot of that is a testament to the resilience of the PPG
team.

Operator

And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with R.W. Baird.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Hope everybody is doing well. I guess just as a follow-up to the last question. On the 8% to 15% volume
decline you're forecasting for 3Q, does the downside extreme assume any incremental lockdowns in the
U.S. or any other regions? You mentioned, for example, Michael, in your prepared comments that auto
OEM should benefit sequentially from reduced seasonal shutdowns in 3Q. So I would think that would
be a positive variance. I'm just trying to understand what operating paradigm you're embedding on the
downside extreme.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Ghansham, this is Vince. No question, that's a fairly wide range. We just don't know the shape of the
pandemic in some of the key regions. We're still seeing effects, obviously, in Latin America, South
America, India, U.S. So the range that we put out and tried to bracket the best case and worst case with
respect to how that pandemic will affect the quarter.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then in terms of the decremental margin variances for 3Q relative to the 2Q baseline, I think
you said slightly worse. Can you just give us some more color on that?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Again, I'll go here again. So I think one of the issues, if you look, we had a 40% decremental in Q1,
the pandemic hit very quickly and abruptly. We weren't able to manage our costs accordingly. As Michael
just mentioned -- and we were able to be very planful throughout the quarter in Q2, managing our --
not only our operations, but our administrative group. The operations are all started back up. Some of
those costs are binary, they're either in or out. So regardless of the volume, these kind of semi-variable
costs, some of those are back in, in Q3. So we're not going to be at the 25% or 26% decremental, but

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 17, 2020

we're certainly not going to be at the 40% decremental we had in Q1. So it'll be somewhere in between.
Hopefully closer to 25%.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

And Ghansham, I would say that in the later quarters that will come, we're going to have better
incremental margins. I mean I think that's a given. As that volume returns, we're more efficient, and we
can see that helping us out.

Operator

And our next question today comes from John Roberts at UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

China's recovered nicely for you. Is it now steady state as well? Are you going to continue to grow from
this second quarter level in China? And any progress to report on your new coatings for EVs?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

So John, we see continued improvement in China. But we're not seeing like a massive jump. I think
the GDP for our customers are probably going to be in that 3% to 5% kind of range. We are seeing
continued improvement in the automotive demand. People are staying away from mass transit, so
there are more people driving. So that's positive. We do see virtually every province has some kind of
automotive stimulus package to support their own little automotive guys in that province. So we do see
that continuing. Our industrial business continues to win share in China, so we expect that to continue. So
I'd say, overall, we're still very positive on our China team as well as our China business.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

And John, I can add a few things, just to piggyback on the last question. China, we haven't seen a full
volume recovery. We've seen a nice volume recovery. But as we alluded to, our financial performance
there is above prior year due to those -- the effect of those incrementals Michael was talking about.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

And John, back to your last question, which is EV. We are getting orders on the various aspects of the
EV battery. So we're getting some, obviously, painting the exterior. We just recently won a new award
for, I would say, the leading EV maker in China, where we're providing protective coatings inside the
battery. Obviously, that's to eliminate what they call thermal vents, which you and I call fires. So we're
very pleased with that. And we continue to see more trials underway with all the leading battery guys in
China. And we think that's the market that's going to grow the fastest for EVs.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then I may have missed it, but I didn't see any additional reserve for bad debt. How are you feeling
about general industrial? Because big manufacturers, as you mentioned, are having some problems
keeping their pants up. I would imagine it's even harder for the small manufacturers in the general
industrial area.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, John, just as a reminder to everybody, we took a $30 million bad debt reserve in the first quarter,
anticipating some effects from the pandemic. We were not anticipating to see a big customer problem

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 17, 2020

in Q2. Most of our customers have enough liquidity, certainly, to last quarter or longer. That $30 million
would be something that we would expect, if we have to choose at all, to come through sometime in the
latter part of the year. Our collections in Q2 were actually very strong. We've had, in some regions, some
of our best percent currents. We still have that $30 million reserve there. Again, we do expect that to be --
we'll vet that as we go through the balance of the year, but we would expect some impact in this -- in the
latter part of the year.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Really nice quarter there. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the stores and how to do it for -- do it for
me channel is sort of shaping up for 2Q? I know there was improvement throughout the quarter. Where
do you think you're at in July? And how do you think that will play out for interior demand in the third
quarter?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, there's clearly improvement every month in our stores business. And so we're pleased to see that.
The work that is really being done a lot of is the exterior work right now. And now we're starting to see
consumers be a little bit more understanding and they're allowing inside work as well. So I think the pace
of recovery will continue.

The challenge, of course, in our architectural business in the U.S. is the commercial side and the
maintenance side. So the buildings that were underway are going to get completed. And then that -- we
think there's going to be a slowdown in new construction. And then of course for resident -- or commercial
maintenance, that's going to be the challenging part going forward.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then as a follow-up, Slide 9, you had a nice comparison regarding your margins now versus
they were in the last downturn. If -- when volumes return back to pre-COVID levels, which understandably
could take some time, where do you think margins will end up, given cost savings and better pricing,
down the road for each of the segments?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Mike, on a like-for-like basis, we're several hundred basis points better, be it Q1 '08 -- Q1 '09 or
Q2 '09. Again, that's a reflection of all the structural cost savings we've actioned the past several years.
So if you flash forward, hopefully, when the volumes come back, we would expect to hold that couple of
hundred margin basis point improvement versus the last cycle.

Operator

Our next question today comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Congrats on the quarter. When we look at the cash that you generated in the quarter and the strength of
the balance sheet, it's -- obviously, it's huge. I guess can you speak to the opportunities to deploy that
capital as you look throughout the rest of the year? Are you seeing any opportunities in terms of M&A?
Or are people a little gun-shy, trying to not -- kind of worried about selling at the bottom and that type of
thing? How should we be thinking about that?

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 17, 2020

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

So John, we have a number of books in-house, and we're making progress on some of them. As always,
the challenge is the bid and the ask gap. Now the benefit is that with the June that we had and the June
that we expected, some of these companies had, that bid and the ask should start to narrow. So we do
expect to have some progress in this area this year. Obviously, I don't think we're going to close on any
of them in 2020, but I do expect us to have progress. And I would say the pace of the inquiries has not
changed. We had a strong order book, if you will, going into this, and we have good opportunities coming
out of this. So I'm pleased with what I see.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. No, that's helpful. And then I guess, PPG runs a pretty lean ship in the first place. And then this
quarter, you announced $160 million to $170 million, big restructuring program. I guess can you give us
a little color as to where that's actually coming from and your comfort that you can hit that? I know you
were speaking earlier to -- this is -- you're seeing a lot of new opportunities around digital and that type of
thing. I guess how is that playing into this as well?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, digital is clearly a significant one. So we are moving much more to a click-and-collect and click-and-
deliver model, and that has provided nice tailwinds and we expect that to accelerate. And if you think
about the traditional trade painter, that was not their method of doing business prior to the pandemic. So
we anticipate that's going to continue.

Obviously, we have some opinions on, and you saw that in the second quarter results. Aerospace is going
to take a little bit longer to recover. And so we took aggressive actions in our aerospace business. We're
also getting more productive in our refinish business. So those 2 businesses are there.

And of course, I would say the last one is the service model that we have in automotive and to a small
extent in industrial. We've shifted much more to a pay model. And so we will either get paid for our
technical service people out in the field or we will have less of them. And right now, I'm pleased to report
that our customers are really paying for them. This is -- if you notice for OEM, we were above market in
all regions, and that's because they value the technical service that our people provide and allow them to
start up. That's really important to them, and so they have been willing to pay for that.

Operator

And our next question today comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Michael, you seem to be more positive on the refinish market compared to a few months ago with the
trends in Europe improving, China now back to 2019 levels. And so even if U.S. and Europe lagged by
6 months relative to China, do you believe that 2021 should be a robust year for refinish? Or would you
agree with that logic?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I don't know that I would use the word robust, but I think 2 things I would point to in refinish. One,
this second quarter has completely washed all the inventory out of the chain. And so you're not going to
have to worry about how much inventory is in the chain. Our body shops ran them down, our jobbers ran
them down. Everybody washed them out of the system. So going forward, you're going to see hopefully
demand matching up with what we're selling.

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 17, 2020

And I would tell you also, I was pleasantly surprised by the orders that we saw in June despite congestion
being, I would say mediocre at best, there's still a lot of opportunities out there. So body shops are
running at 70% to 80% right now in the U.S. and Europe. And so that's actually a little bit better than I
would have projected, given how little congestion there is out there on the streets.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. And then secondly, sort of a big-picture question. PPG always had good insights into the economy.
So my question is, clearly, the OEM -- auto OEM SAAR has come down, and there is a view that the auto
recovery will be slower than the housing recovery. IHS doesn't see a peak in autos until 2023. So what are
your projections in terms of the trajectories in those 2 end markets?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well actually, it's ironic because we have the same 2023 for getting back to 17 million. But that's not
the way I'm thinking about our automotive business. I'm thinking about our automotive business will
have better volumes than that sooner because of the growth in EV. So I am thinking about this slightly
differently. It's going to be build and EV going forward, not just builds.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

And anything on housing?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

I think housing is actually going to be stronger than people anticipate. I think people are going to be
willing to live outside the bigger cities. And so I anticipate housing to get better, faster and sooner. And
with interest rates at these kind of levels, there's really no reason why people can't qualify for mortgages.
So the key will be how quickly can we get people back to work. Right now, you've got so many small
businesses that I think are at permanent damage risk. That's the thing I worry most about, is all these
small business people that are out -- will likely be out of business.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Can you compare the trends in the aerospace OEM market with the trends in the aerospace maintenance
and repair market exclusive of defense?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Jeff, as you know, the builds for Airbus and Boeing have come down appreciably, and we anticipate
them to stay down for a while. So last year, they were building, let's call it, 45 737s month. Now they're
building, let's call it, 20% of that, 30% of that. So appreciably different.

Now MRO, though, is strictly dependent upon the number of times that plane goes up and comes down.
And we peaked at about 64% of the flights -- or planes being parked. And now we're about only 40% of
the planes are parked. And so MRO will start to get better because it's -- again, it doesn't matter if there's
1 person in the flight or 100. And so we anticipate that getting better.

So we think a leading indicator -- if you want to try to estimate MRO, a leading indicator is the growth in
flights. Not passengers, so don't pay attention to the passengers, but pay attention to the flights.

Yes. They're -- all 4 regions are different. So you have lower prices in Asia, you have higher prices in Latin
America due to currency. You have slight moderation in Europe and very little moderation in the U.S.

Our next question today comes from Chris Parkinson with Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. Throughout all this malaise, there's been a reasonable amount of debate on market shares in
architectural, packaging, coil and refinish, I guess have been kind of the primary 4. Just given what you
know now, just how do you assess your end market share movements? And then also, how would you
assess your competitive positioning for the balance of this year? And then also outlook into 2021.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Hey, Chris, it's Vince. I think it's -- there's been -- there's a lot of opaqueness out there, so it's really hard
to determine market shares. We'll certainly go through this quarter, next quarter, look at all of our results,
our competitors' results. I think the biggest thing we see, obviously, is there's a share shift right now from
do it for me to DIY. That helps our DIY business, hurts our trade business. Competitively that has different
impacts.

In the other business you mentioned, there's really a lot of variables by region. For example, in packaging,
a lot of the packager, or a lot of the can guys in Asia had to shut down for COVID reasons. So it's really
hard to discern what you're asking until we're on a more steady or run rate basis.

We're comfortable with what we're doing. We're comfortable in some of the strategic initiatives we laid
out, like digital, delivery, those things are coming into favor. So the work we've put in the past couple of
years around those are helping us. Some of our technical items, some of our technical things, like Michael
mentioned earlier with respect to EVs, are coming into favor. So a lot of the long lead items we put in
place, due to this pandemic, are coming into favor, which is helpful for us.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And just within architectural, could we just get -- dive into this a little bit more? Just can you just
quickly comment? Obviously, it's maybe difficult also to discern in this type of environment. But just it
seems like you still have a lot of momentum at Home Depot with TIMELESS and DIAMOND. You've had --
you previously were talking about some new initiatives, that even at independents and then even some
stuff on online and digital. So just how should the market be thinking about your U.S. growth rate outlook
versus peers and just relative competitive positioning? Because it seems like you're doing a lot in both resi
and even non-resi. So do you have any comments on that?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Again, it's hard with not a lot of market information at this point. But our digital sales are up triple digits
off of a very small base. We definitely see -- as Michael alluded to earlier, we definitely see our customer
base more willing to move to a digital platform. We're certainly holding our own in the DIY market, but
that whole market has been elevated. We moved to this preferred authorized dealer network really to be
more optimal in our full delivery. Our dealers are up consistent -- mostly consistent with the DIY market.

our own in this market. We feel right performing in Mexico, depending on -- in Europe, depending on the
country. Again, the DIY market is just outperforming and we're well favored right now.

architectural record performance.

And our next question today comes from Kevin McCarthy at Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

With regard to your architectural business, I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you're seeing
in Europe in terms of trends by country or at least U.K. versus continent and also by channel there.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

So Kevin, I'll start with France. As you know, that's our largest market. In France, April, we had a lot of
challenges in April because of the stores were shut down because of government mandates. And starting
in May, they started to loosen up. And then by June, all the stores were open. And in July, we're doing
quite well. So France was just a steady upward trend.

The U.K. started really strong April, May, kind of a little bit of a downturn in June as the re-spike in
numbers came up. But in July, they're back to really, really good numbers.

Poland is doing great. There's no doubt we're taking share in Poland. And the rest of our Eastern European
business is quite strong. The Benelux, we're definitely doing exceptionally well there. So I've been pleased
with our European performance.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Just from a channel perspective, Kevin, same phenomenon we're seeing here. DIY is very strong both in
the U.K. and on the continent. Trade is feeling the same effect that it has here.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then second, if I look at your heat map on Slide 6, it strikes me, if I count it correctly, you've
got 11 boxes that show above-market growth and 0 that show below-market. I think 2 quarters ago,
below-market might have been a half dozen boxes or so. So I appreciate it's got to be very difficult to
gauge what the market is doing when conditions are so dislocated. But I guess my question would be, did
you feel as though you've gained share in any of your businesses due to the pandemic, whether it's ability
to operate or execution or otherwise? Or am I reading too much into that?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think Vince tried to cover this previously. In these kind of times, it's always difficult to put your
finger on exactly whether you're gaining share or losing share.

But I do feel -- there's no question that we're gaining share in Australia. I mean that's an easy one to
measure. I would say the U.K., pretty easy to measure there. I would say those are the areas that we're
most comfortable with.

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 17, 2020

Clearly, automotive is easy to measure. We know exactly what the builds were and we know exactly what
our sales are. So that is a given. I think the rest of them, can be quite tricky to figure that one out.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would just add. One we were comfortable with is, in certain regions, our protective business due to
our technologies. Again, it's come into favor as customers are looking for functionality in these times. And
I think also in some of our general industrial businesses, where we're working with our customers to start
up, we're typically one of the favored coatings companies to help customers start up and have that secure
launch process. So -- but again, it is very difficult, Kevin, until we see a bigger array of results and really
over a couple of quarters.

Our next question today comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Just wanted to ask about Q3. So your pace of sales decline in June was 12%. The guidance for Q3
is 8% to 15%. So at the midpoint, you're around 11.5% or so down in Q3. And so that's not much better
than June, I guess, in aggregate. So is it your assumption that there will be some considerable moderation
in architectural as automotive comes back, and that's what kind of drives a similar result in Q3 versus
June? Or is there a possibility that maybe we can see some upside to that if architectural doesn't decline
as much? How are you thinking about the offset between architectural and automotive in Q3?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Arun, as we mentioned earlier, we have a wide range for Q3. It's really based on the uncertainty
around the pandemic in some of our key regions. So we're hopeful to be at the low end of that range, if
you will. But we may be on the high end, 14%, 15%, if the pandemic continues to worsen in certain parts
of the world. So that's really what we're looking at.

It's still very difficult to predict on a month by -- certainly, week-by-week, but on a month-by-month
basis, what our customers are going to do, what customers can actually run. We're seeing spot shutdowns
from customers due to COVID, we're seeing spot shutdowns from customers due to parts issues. So that's
why there's a wide range there and expect some volatility throughout the quarter.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then as a follow-up, just on the cash issue, going back to the -- you have a very strong balance
sheet here, over $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet as well. You stated in the past that you do not
want to build cash, but it does appear that it may be difficult to consummate and close any deals this year,
as you said earlier as well. So just curious what your plans would be if you're not able to deploy that cash
in M&A. Would you prefer to keep that as liquidity in reserve for now? Or would you be able to put it to
work in capital return?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Arun, certainly for the near term, we're carrying excess cash. Again, our sight lines are limited in
terms of how this is going to affect us. But we're not health experts. We're hearing there may certainly be
a flare-up in some of the key countries in the fall. So we're going to be conservative.

As Michael alluded to, our acquisition pipeline is refilling. Those are bolt-on in nature. We may be able to
execute on some of those. Whether we can close or not this year, I agree with Michael, will probably be

difficult given we're a month out before the end of the year. But we'll certainly manage our acquisitions
and our cash around that.

We do have the capability to pay down some debt if the skies clear here. We have a short-term facility
that is free to prepay. So all those are variables, we really just need more visibility on the economy before
we start to make some key decisions. We don't want to grow cash, as you mentioned. We will look for
earnings accretion opportunities, whether it be acquisitions or other. But we just need more visibility
before we start to pull triggers on some of those.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Securities, Inc.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

You reported that some auto body shops switched over to PPG refinish coatings. And I was just curious
where you saw that and whether it's due to that new paint mixing product that you rolled out in Europe.
What is the status of that rollout? Are you getting traction from it? Have you considered expanding it into
other regions? And is operating at a 70% rate help you in your process of trying to cause a body shop to
flip over to you because they may not be running flat out?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Stephen, just start talking about MOONWALK, we've had 250 installations put in, 150 of which
got put in, in the second quarter. And 30 of them were new body shop wins. So it is performing at a good
level. Obviously, we've been a little bit challenged getting that out into the field because we have to send
tech service people into the field with the equipment to make sure people are trained on running it. So we
anticipate that we'll continue to roll that out.

We will be looking at moving that into the U.S. as well. Obviously, it's most important in the high labor
markets and the high -- markets where labor is hard to come by. And so that would say that we're
probably not going to roll that out in Asia as a likely place.

But we have been picking up share in refinish. We track that quite closely. It's a net win basis because you
win some, you lose some. But overall, we feel comfortable. The key with refinish will be getting the miles
driven back as well as congestion.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And I had a follow-up for you on the trend of shifting from do it for me to do-it-yourself. Do you see that
same trend in your own stores, where you're picking up more homeowners coming in or ordering online
to buy paint? And I was just curious as to your view, based on those relationships and discussions, do
you think that some of that impact could be lasting, i.e., those homeowners continue to paint their rooms
themselves rather than hiring a contractor post-pandemic?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Stephen, we said for multiple years, the shift between DIY and do it for me is highly correlated to the
unemployment rate. So certainly, in the last 5 years, as the unemployment rate has come down, you've
seen more do it for me. You've seen obviously a spike in the unemployment rate during these times,
you've seen abrupt shift back the other way. And again, I would just look at that unemployment rate on
a go-forward basis to determine how these channels will react. It acted the same in 2008, 2009, and it's
recurring now. So that's the key. We still think long term, do-it-for-me is going to continue to grow, but
certainly for the foreseeable future with unemployment high, the do-it-yourself market will remain robust.

And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just want to ask a clarifying question on the cost-saving to make sure that we have our model right
and we don't do any double counting. If I assume your volume constant on a go-forward basis, and you
have $170 million of interim cost savings that came out in the quarter. And then you've got the new
restructuring program which is $160 million to $170 million in annual savings. Or let me try it this way.
The $170 million that came out on an interim basis is presumably going to come back over time. And the
$160 million to $170 million that's, on the comp, should offset that. Now maybe it won't be one-for-one,
but is that the right way to think about it, that those 2 things will ultimately offset each other?

John Bruno
Director of Investor Relations

Vincent, John Bruno. That's exactly right. The $170 million is, we could call it is transitional or temporary.
It will come back as volume comes back, and the restructuring savings are intended to be permanent.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just one last follow-up on that. Are you done with the large-scale restructuring cost for
the year with the charge in the quarter? Or will there be some trickles out in the third quarter and fourth
quarter?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Well, various things like -- there are certain costs that are related to restructuring, Vincent, that we
cannot, based on GAAP accounting, take until they're incurred. So there will be some modest trickle outs
in Q3, Q4 and even Q1, again, based on the accounting guidelines. They're very modest.

Our next question comes from Sean Gilmartin with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Can you hear me? Vince, can you hear me? This is Duffy.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Duffy, we can hear you.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay, great. I just wanted to drill in a little deeper on the DIY versus trade split. So in the 2 summer
quarters, what this effect looks like it's going to be important. Roughly, what is the normal DIY versus
trade breakout, just size of the 2 businesses over those quarters? And then what would be the influence in
that shift kind of on margins? As I'm assuming gross profit margins for DIY is higher than trade? And then
on the cash flow as well, as I imagine, there's less credit in DIY than there would be in trade. And is that
big enough to kind of skew the numbers or influence the numbers for the overall company?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

So it's a little -- it's different by market -- different by region, Duffy, first of all, but we'll stick to the U.S.
market for clarity. Typically trade's 55% to 60% on gallons basis of the market. It's less -- it's 50-50 on a

17

dollar basis. For PPG, we're close to that mix. We are seeing, obviously, double-digit growth in DIY. We've
seen a decrement in our trade business. Part of that's due to the stores just being shut down in certain
parts of the country. Again, because of double-digit growth in DIY in Q2, that's been beneficial for that
part of the business. But the trade business is a higher fixed cost. We have stores. We have leases. So
volume there, when it comes back, typically carries a nice incremental.

We don't give out profitability by channel, so we're not going to go there. But again, as long as we're
producing positive volumes in our architectural business. And as Mike alluded to, we had very strong
financial performance in all regions, certainly in the U.S., it's beneficial to us and our shareholders.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. And then, Michael, question for you. I imagine you're getting ready for kind of your meeting with
your business leaders planning ahead to next year this fall. When you look through the slate of your
businesses, are there some of the businesses that you think are just structurally different over the next
1 to 3 years because of [ what's happened ], where they're going to have to meaningfully change their
business plans? And if so, kind of which ones would be the most obvious there?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think, Duffy, the one that is on a, what I think a temporary lag is aerospace. I am fully convinced
that whenever it's safe to get on a plane again, the planes will fill up. When I look at the number of cruise
ship bookings for next year, it's radically up. People want to travel, people don't want to be locked in their
homes. So probably don't have to wait for the vaccine, but a vaccine would certainly be a huge benefit.
But we are aggressively managing our cost structure in aerospace. So I think that's the one that will
probably be a little bit longer.

I think refinish, we had -- incrementally, every month was better, April versus May versus June. So I'll
be in a better position to answer that question by the end of the next quarter. But I would say that we'll
probably be 90% of the way back at refinish in the back half of the year. And then it's a matter of what do
we have to do to get that last bit back.

But those are the only 2 that I think of -- I mean, I see cars as a long-term getting back over time. And
for us, we'll be growing faster than the market because of our EV exposure. And industrial, similar kind of
thing. So I don't see any structural deficiencies, except aerospace in the short term.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

And Duffy, if I could add to that, as we alluded to earlier, we do see this digitization, especially in the
architectural space. We see some paradigms being broken now that makes the entire supply chain
more efficient. We see behavior. Typically in a crisis, you see behavioral changes, which is where we're
evidencing people are just more willing to adopt to delivery, more willing to adopt to digital. Again, we've
been talking about this for certainly more than 6 months. And we're seeing a structural modification of
behavior in that channel, not only in the U.S., but we're seeing it in Europe. We're seeing it in Australia. So
I do think that will be something we're going to measure and monitor and try to continue to promote.

And our next question today comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.

Kevin William Hocevar
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Michael, I think you mentioned earlier that on the DIY side, you thought your retailer customers would
probably like to have more inventory. So does that imply that manufacturing hasn't been able to keep
up with the really strong demand? And does that also imply that we could see a restock coming at some
point? And is that a regional comment or global?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, it's definitely regional. I would say we're understocked in Australia, the U.K. and a little bit in the
U.S. At this point in the paint season, they never want to miss a paint sale. That's the key. And then they
typically destock in the third and fourth quarters as they -- especially after Labor Day. So I would tell
you that this year is a little bit different. How much inventory they're going to carry going into the fourth
quarter is a total unknown at this point in time. And so if I had a crystal ball, I'd tell you that there is
a potential for some continued strength beyond what you see in the market. But I think that would be
probably a little too much speculation.

Kevin William Hocevar
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Okay, great. And then pricing was up nicely for the quarter, 1.7% for the company and particularly out of
the Performance Coating segment, up 2.7%. So just want to get your sense on how sustainable you think
that, that pricing is. I know in your slide deck, you said you expected pricing to be about 2% year-over-
year in Performance Coatings in the third quarter. So a little bit of a [ fade ] sequentially, I don't know if
that's just a comp related or any expectation that there's some type of price fade. But just curious, with
volumes doing what they're doing, particularly on the industrial side of the business, how sustainable you
think pricing is at these types of levels?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So the reason that 2% is a comp over year-over-year, the timing of when these increases come vary.
So we feel very comfortable on the Performance Coatings side that pricing is there and is sticking and will
be there. On the industrial side, obviously, that's always a harder place. But right now, we're maintaining
price. We're going to continue to maintain price from a PPG perspective. We'll be willing to walk away
from business to make sure we get paid for the value we think we're going to deliver. Right now, I see
customers much more focused on us helping them get up and running and price hasn't been a discussion
-- a significant discussion at this point in time. Obviously, that's going to change once they're up and
running and fully operational and things like that.

But by and large, what I tell people on the industrial side is we didn't get all the price that we needed in
the last up cycle, and so we should not be giving away any price just immediately when this -- you see
raw materials start to moderate. So I think there is a give and take here. And right now, I feel comfortable
that we should continue to maintain price through the balance of the year.

So on the heat map, Brazil seems to stand out to me as the biggest anomaly, growing year-over-year. And
PPG, you're growing above the market. It seemed like coronavirus issues worsened there. So could you
give some more color on what happened in Brazil?

Michael H. McGarry

Yes. So we're down in the southern part of Brazil. There's 3 states down there that we're very strong in.
So we're not that strong in -- think about Rio and São Paulo. That's not where our strength is. And where
we are, the pandemic is not as robust as it is up in the major cities. Plus, we have a new leadership team
down there in Brazil, and they've done a really outstanding job of growing with our -- not just our big box
customers down there, but also on our trade side. So it's been 2 factors.

Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about your raw material inventories. I suspect that you
moved through a lot of the high-cost raw materials and -- but where are you in that process? It seems like
with automotive builds ramping up, that you're going to eat through the higher-cost raw materials in short
order. Is that right?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Jim, if you look -- just look at our volumes in the quarter, we came in, obviously, the quarter with
seasonally high inventories. We worked through that more quickly in performance, given the volume
trends there versus industrial, where we were down 30%, 40% in some businesses. We're eating into that
industrial inventory now. So -- and then we're also -- to Michael's earlier point, we're a seasonal business.
So we're going to be very mindful of what inventory we build or what raw materials we buy as we get
further in the year here. We want to obviously manage our inventories down seasonally towards the end of
the year. Typically, we're ratcheting down our coatings manufacturing production beginning this month and
carrying through the summer trying to obviously work our inventories down in Q4. So very mindful of that,
but I think your assumptions are accurate.

Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

A quick short-term one and a long-term question. On the short term, with $170 million, the interim cost
savings, that is on top -- for Q3, that would be on top of the $30 million to $35 million highlighted in the
slide deck? And then do you expect that to come back in a linear fashion as volumes recover? Or do you
see it as a sort of a lumpier kind of way that will flow back into the income statement in 2021?

The longer-term question, as you look at your learnings on digitalization and distribution, should we
expect a chunkier investment cycle in the next 2 to 3 years in order to shift, to help PPG drive the market
-- the shift in market behavior and leverage it? Or how should we think about the investment cycle on that
front?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Laurence, this is Vince. I'll take the first one, and Michael will take the second one here. So yes, we have
$170 million of interim -- net interim cost savings in the quarter. It was actually gross higher, but we had
lower manufacturing throughput that took away from some of that. That will come back in a more -- as we
alluded to earlier, I think that will go back in a more lumpy fashion than Q3. Some of these costs are semi-
variable. As we start up plants, we do have to bring back certain cost pools in their entirety. So it would
not be linear with volume. We're obviously working aggressively to manage those costs, not only in Q3,
but on a go-forward basis. So it wouldn't be completely ratable with volume. It will be lumpier around how
we're bringing our operations back.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

And then Laurence, on the digital question. There will be some lumpiness on the capital side, but it will
vary by business. So once we have a solution in place in architectural, we'll replicate that around the world
without a lot of significant capital expenditure. But as we roll out some of the solutions that we have for
automotive and industrial, those things will need to be replicated and will be a little bit chunkier. So our
capital spend this year is down, but not in digital. In digital, it's up.

Our next question comes from Mike Harrison at Seaport Global Securities.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Wanted to ask about the auto OEM business. The heat map is showing that you guys were above market
across all regions. I think you mentioned that getting customers to pay for technical personnel in their
plants was part of that. But can you talk a little bit more about what was driving that and maybe quantify
how much above-market growth you saw in auto OEM?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Mike, I would tell you that the #1 thing the auto guys want is to get their plants up and running.
And the paint shop is at the end of the line. So if you end up with a car that's made, but you can't get it
painted, that's really expensive for them. So they wanted our people in the plant before they started up to
make sure that they were ready to go. And then they wanted extra help in the plants to ensure a smooth
start-up, at which we've been able to do.

So I would say the amount that we were above market varied anywhere from 2% to 10% depending upon
market. But that's not sustainable. We'll be probably above market next couple of quarters, but then it will
probably be ratably back to market performance.

At the end of the day, the customers are very much interested in helping them grow their business. So
productivity is another thing that we're focused on. So our tech service people are in the plants to help
them drive productivity. And the more that we can do that, the more that they're willing to pay for those
services.

All right. And then in the refinish business, the European piece is showing is yellow and everything else is
red. Can you maybe talk about what you were seeing regionally? And I guess I'm a little bit surprised that
given the recovery in China, that Asia Pacific was still showing as red in that heat map. Can you talk about
what's going on regionally in refinish?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

So in refinish, actually in China, the -- if you think about the big cities, they're already back, I would say,
at about 90-plus percent of congestion. Not during the day, but peak rush hour in the morning; and in the
evenings, looked just like they did pre-pandemic. But what we're seeing is that people are consolidating
their trips, and therefore, you don't see that -- those extra trips during the middle of the day. So the roads
are a little bit more open. So that's the only negative in China.

In Europe, they did a much better job of handling the pandemic than we've done in the U.S. And so
congestion is coming back a little bit quicker in Europe than it is in the U.S. So we're actually quite
pleased. And they've done a better job of managing their inventory as well. There's not as many large,
super-large distributors in Europe like we have here in the U.S.
