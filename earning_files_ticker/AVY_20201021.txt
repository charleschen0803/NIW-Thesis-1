[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from noon Pacific Time
today through midnight Pacific Time, October 24. To access the replay, please dial (800) 633-8284 or +1
(402) 977-9140 for international callers. The conference ID number is 21930680.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Cindy Guenther, Avery Dennison's Vice President of Investor Relations
and Finance. Please go ahead.

Cynthia S. Guenther
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

Thank you, Frank. Please note that throughout today's discussion, we'll be making references to non-GAAP
financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with GAAP
on schedules A-4 to A-9 of the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release.

We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates
about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject
to the safe harbor statement included in today's earnings release. We undertake no obligation to update
these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances other than as may be required by law.

On the call today are Mitch Butier, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins,
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Cindy, and hello, everyone. Once again, we are proving our resilience across business cycles.
Revenue came in significantly better than we anticipated at the start of the quarter, which, combined with
our cost reduction actions, enabled us to deliver 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share and strong
free cash flow in the quarter despite lower sales.

We said coming into this year that a key focus of ours in a lower growth environment was to protect our
overall profitability. We're delivering on that promise. Margins expanded significantly in the third quarter
reflecting the successful execution of our long-term strategies as well as the team's fast response in
implementing temporary cost saving actions in a better-than-expected volume environment. Even with
the sharp drop in volume in the second quarter, our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin is up 80 basis
points to 14.9%.

Our strong performance reflects the agility of our teams which have come together extraordinarily well
in navigating one of the most challenging periods we've experienced as a company. In this environment,
our focus continues to be on ensuring the health and well-being of our employees, delivering for our
customers, supporting our communities and minimizing the impact of the recession for our shareholders.
And I'm pleased with the progress we are making on all fronts.

Now despite our best efforts to protect employee health, we have identified roughly 350 confirmed cases
of the virus within our 30,000-plus workforce, with the majority of cases apparently reflecting community
spread rather than a work-based source of infection. Fortunately, about 3/4 of the employees impacted
have already recovered.

While all sites were operational throughout Q3, the recent surge in confirmed cases in a number of the
regions in which we operate highlights the continued uncertainty of the current environment as well as the
importance of remaining vigilant with respect to safety and agile in meeting customers' needs.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Now a quick summary of the business trends. All 3 segments came in better than we expected at the
start of the quarter on both sales and margin. LGM sales, though still down in the third quarter compared
to prior year, improved sequentially due to faster-than-expected pickup in the global graphics business.
Overall, our Label and Packaging Materials businesses moderated sequentially as expected, with North
America and emerging markets having picked up a little faster than we expected, while Europe came in a
bit weaker.

From the start of the pandemic until now, volume trends for Label and Packaging Materials had varied
by region. From March through September, volumes in North America were up mid-single digits, while
volumes in Europe were up low single digits. In both regions, we experienced significant volume surges
during the early stages of the pandemic, followed by a moderation of growth due principally to destocking.
Now as we look across this period overall, our North America business has been trending faster than
the long-term average for the region, while Europe has been trending a bit below the region's long-term
average.

The emerging markets picture has been different. Asia Pacific volumes have been flat overall from March
through September, with volumes rising to mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter. While it's good to
see the recent pickup in demand here, this is still below the long-term trend for the region.

As for RBIS, demand improved much faster than we anticipated back in July, down only 5% organically for
the quarter compared to the roughly 35% decline we saw in Q2. Enterprise-wide RFID sales grew by 65%
in the quarter on a constant currency basis, reflecting 20% organic growth and the contribution of the
Smartrac acquisition. The strong growth of our RFID business was primarily driven by apparel, particularly
within the value segment of the market.

Outside of apparel, we continue to see increasing interest in new applications within logistics as well
as food and grocery. Specifically, we are working with logistics companies to assess the technology in
light of the accelerated shift to e-commerce with many providers operating at holiday-like peak volumes
throughout the pandemic.

Given the stress that this has put on supply chains globally, we're now working with several companies to
demonstrate how RFID and related solutions can drive an increase in both the throughput and accuracy of
their operations. We're active on multiple pilots in this area and have some smaller deployments already
underway.

The momentum in food-related end markets likewise continues, with increased pilot activity among quick
service restaurants as well as retail, both in the U.S. and emerging markets. These applications are
focused on driving labor efficiency and improved availability of products. Similar to apparel, the migration
to e-commerce for food delivery is strengthening the use case for RFID in this market.

Overall, we continue to expand our RFID project pipeline. Customer engagements are now up close to
45% since the start of this year. As these projects continue to move through the pipeline, we continue
to expect long-term growth of 15% to 20%, as we build RFID into a broader Intelligent Labels platform,
which is now a more than $500 million business.

Returning to the total company. We entered this crisis from a position of financial, operational and
commercial strength. And as I mentioned earlier, our businesses are once again proving their resilience
across economic cycles. Our teams are adapting quickly to new commercial and operational norms,
responding decisively with best practice safety measures, protecting our profitability in a lower growth
environment and positioning us well to capture demand as conditions improve.

Though the nature of the macro challenges is different today than in past recessions, historically, our
businesses have continued to deliver solid free cash flow in periods of economic downturn, and sales and
earnings have rebounded quickly in the 12 months following.

Our strategy remains clear. We are continuing to invest to expand in high-value categories, particularly our
Intelligent Labels platform while driving long-term profitable growth of our base businesses. We remain
confident in our ability to continue to create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

I'll now turn it over to Greg.

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. Though this year has certainly been very challenging, we're
executing extremely well, as evidenced by our financial results this quarter. We delivered adjusted
earnings per share of $1.91, up 15% over prior year and significantly above our expectations as the end
market demand picked up faster than we had assumed in July.

Our tight near-term cost controls in this environment, combined with the flow-through benefit of that
better-than-expected volume in addition to our ongoing structural productivity actions, drove strong
margin expansion in Q3.

Sales declined by 1.3% ex currency or 3.6% on an organic basis. And currency translation reduced
reported sales by 0.5 point in the quarter. Despite the drop in revenue, we reported an adjusted EBITDA
margin of 16.1%, up nearly 2 points, and an adjusted operating margin of 13.1%, up 140 basis points.
And we realized $13 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter, most of which represent the benefit
of projects initiated this year. And we recorded approximately $11 million of restructuring charges, roughly
half of which relate to noncash asset impairments. And we continue to target between $60 million and $70
million of incremental net savings from restructuring this year, with roughly half of that in RBIS. And we're
also on track to deliver roughly $150 million in temporary savings from short-term cost reduction actions
this year, which will be a headwind for us as markets recover.

Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we realized $342 million of free cash flow, up
roughly 5%, with strong growth in the quarter, driven by lower capital spending and higher net income.
And I'm pleased to report that we achieved our targeted sequential improvement in working capital
productivity, particularly with respect to inventory turns.

Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at quarter end of 1.9, below
our long-term target range of 2.3 to 2.6. As we've proven our ability to manage through the compounding
global crises we faced this year, we've begun to again put that leverage capacity to work, including
increasing our level of distributions to shareholders in line with our long-term capital allocation strategy.
And we announced today that the Board approved a 7% increase to our dividend rate, and we resumed
our share repurchase program late in the third quarter.

Turning to segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales were down 2.6% on an
organic basis, driven by volume and mix as well as deflation related price. And sales were down roughly
2% organically in Label and Packaging Materials as growth in specialty and durable label categories was
more than offset by a decline in the base business, while Graphics and Reflective sales were down about
8%.

As Mitch mentioned, the Graphics performance represented a strong sequential improvement compared
to the roughly 30% decline we saw in Q2, with steady improvements monthly throughout the quarter.
As expected, the overall trend for the Label and Packaging Materials business moderated sequentially,
following the Q2 demand surge in the mature markets, with improvement over the course of the quarter in
all regions.

Mitch touched on the overall volume trends by region for the Label and Packaging Materials business since
the start of the pandemic. Looking at the segments -- the total segment's sales trends by region in Q3, in
North America, LGM sales were up low single digits organically for the quarter, with a strong rebound in
Graphics and LPM inventory destocking largely behind us by the end of July.

In Europe, where destocking began about a month after we started to see it in North America, LGM sales
for the quarter were down high single digits on an organic basis, with a fairly steady improvement in the
trend as the quarter progressed. And the Asia Pacific region, which grew modestly for the quarter on an
organic basis, likewise saw a fairly steady improvement in the sales trend through the quarter, which was
led by growth in China and India.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

And finally, we've been very pleased with the resilience of LGM's business in Latin America, which
delivered mid-single-digit organic growth for the quarter. LGM's adjusted operating margin increased 170
basis points to 15.2% as the benefits of productivity and raw material deflation net of pricing more than
offset higher employee-related costs and unfavorable volumes.

Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 5.2% ex currency and
down 4.7% on an organic basis, as strong growth in our high-value categories was more than offset by a
roughly 12% decline in the base business, driven by overall lower apparel demand. Looking at the total
apparel business, base and high-value categories combined, the value channel outperformed all other
channels, up nearly 50% for the quarter. As Mitch indicated, ex currency, enterprise-wide RFID sales were
up 65% and up 20% on an organic basis. The adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 60
basis points to 12.1% as the team's productivity and cost control actions more than offset unfavorable
volumes.

And turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales declined 7.6% on an organic
basis compared to the 21% decline in Q2, reflecting sequential improvement in trends for automotive
applications, particularly in China and North America. And adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis
points to 12.1%, due to favorable product mix, productivity and deflation net of pricing, which more than
offset the impact of lower volume.

Now shifting to our outlook. Given the continued uncertainty regarding global demand, we are not
resuming annual guidance at this time. As we've done since the pandemic started, we'll arrange an update
call in December to let you know how things are playing out.

In the meantime, I'll highlight some of the key pieces of the equation that we have reasonable visibility
to now. We expect that underlying sales trend, that is organic growth and the benefit of the Smartrac
acquisition, will be similar to or better than what we saw in the third quarter. In addition, as announced
back in January, we benefit from an extra week in the fiscal year, which is expected to add roughly 1 point
to our full year growth rate or about 4 points to the fourth quarter. And this should add roughly $0.10 of
EPS to the fourth quarter and full year, which obviously represents a comparably sized headwind to 2021
revenue and earnings.

The anticipated headwinds from currency translation have diminished as the year progressed. The
negative impacts from currency now stand at roughly 1 point to sales growth and $9 million in operating
income for the full year based on recent rates. And as mentioned, we expect to generate restructuring
savings net of transition costs of $60 million to $70 million this year. And we're targeting roughly $150
million of net temporary savings, which includes reductions in accruals related to incentive plans. And note
that more than 80% of the full year estimate for temporary savings has been realized year-to-date. And
again, the vast majority of the temporary actions that we've taken are expected to be a headwind for us
when markets recover.

As Mitch said, protecting our margins is a key focus for us during this period of slower growth. Assuming
we continue to see stability in our end markets, we're now targeting to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin
for 2020 that exceeds prior year. You may have noticed also a modest benefit in the quarter from a lower
tax rate, which reflects our current full year adjusted tax rate estimate of approximately 24%, in line with
our long-term expectation for tax rate in the mid-20% range.

And finally, given the strength of Q3 results, we are now targeting to generate over $500 million of free
cash flow this year. And this target includes an expected $165 million to $175 million of spending on
fixed and IT investments and another roughly $60 million in cash payments associated with restructuring
actions.

In summary, we're very well positioned to navigate this challenging environment, and we look forward
to coming out even stronger when our markets fully recover. And while there certainly continues to be
macroeconomic uncertainty, looking ahead to next year, assuming a modest recovery in sales, we're
targeting to maintain our EBITDA margins and to once again generate over $500 million in free cash flow.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Now before we open the call to questions, I have a special announcement to make. As some of you
already know, Cindy Guenther, our Head of Investor Relations, for most of the last 20-plus years, has
decided to retire at the end of December. After supporting nearly 100 earnings calls, this will be her last.
Over her 25 years with the company, she's been a valued partner and resource to me, Mitch and the rest
of the leadership team as well as the investment community. And we're very grateful for her so many
contributions over the years.

And while, of course, we'll miss Cindy, we're happy to welcome John Eble back to the corporate team to
lead Investor Relations. John has served in a variety of important finance roles over his time with the
company, both in the businesses and at corporate, including a few years working with Cindy in Investor
Relations. So he will definitely hit the ground running.

John Eble;Director, Commercial Finance and FP&A

I too want to thank Cindy for her years of partnership and support to me as well as to the organization at
large. So it's truly been a pleasure, Cindy, and I and the entire organization, and I'm sure the investment
community, are very thankful for your years of leadership partnership and support. So thank you, again.

Cynthia S. Guenther
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

Thank you, both.

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO
And with that, we will open it up to questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Cindy, congratulations. It's the end of an era. And John, congratulations to you as well.

Cynthia S. Guenther
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

Thanks, George.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. It's been fun. So I guess the first question I had, I want to go back to Slide 8, where you're showing
the 2019 sales by product category. And you show that 15% of revenue for last year was roughly driven
by logistics shifting and other variable information. Given what we've seen this year and, obviously, the
pickup in e-commerce, is there a way to update us on how much that portion of the pie represents now
for 2020? And if there's any incremental you can give us in terms of how you think e-commerce is both
benefiting RFID and variable information for that matter?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, George, I think you're asking about just what the new mix of revenue from Slide 8 for 2020. I mean
2020 is actually not going to be a great baseline, just given what happened within Q2 overall. But clearly,
you would expect with the significant growth in RFID as we build out the Intelligent Labels platform, both
organically and with the Smartrac acquisition as well as a big piece of that being towards logistics as well
as other, and you can see those pieces of the various pies across these slides increase. So we will update
all this at year-end, but I will say that even 2020 won't be a great baseline. So we'll give you probably a
bit of a more rounded out view going forward how we expect it to evolve similar to how we have in the
past.

Cynthia S. Guenther
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

George, I'd also point out. If you're assuming that all of the RFID is in that 15%, that would not be
correct. We've captured apparel-related RFID in the 21% on that chart.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Cindy.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Cindy, I wasn't. I was just using it as a stepping off point for discussion. But is there a way to comment,
maybe a quick follow-on here, on how much growth you've seen in variable information and how much of
that you'd attribute to e-commerce?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

We are growing faster than average in volumes in the variable information categories within LGM. And
clearly, within RBIS, it's a big driver now. Within RBIS, it's mostly apparel still, so that is the largest
category. But as far as the pipeline, the pipeline is still growing quite significantly in other areas such as
food and logistics, as I mentioned.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then my other question, I'll turn it over. Question number two is, you've obviously done, so
far, a very, very good job on the temporary cost saves. Certainly, you've had really strong margins. So
how should we expect that temporary cost save and that spending to be metered back into the business
as volumes pick up? Do we have to worry about a quarter some time in 2021, where you're looking at a
particularly negative earnings comparison because you've got the cost saves coming in, maybe more --
excuse me, the spending coming in more quickly than the volume ramps up? How would you have us think
about that reintroduction of spending into the mix '21 and ultimately, I guess, '22 as well?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, George, It's Greg. So again, as we've said, the $150 million of temporary cost savings
is made up largely of 3 buckets. So incentive comp being the smallest bucket there and in addition to
volume-related savings as well as some belt tightening. And as we've said before, we would expect as
volumes come back, for the majority of that cost to return. Now how fast that returns, particularly that
volume-related piece, will depend on how fast the volume returns. But even here at the end of the third
quarter, of course, we started to see with volumes coming better than we'd expected, a little bit of an
increase in volume-related costs. And when we think of things like overtime or temporary labor and those
type of activities, we start to see that coming back with volume. So that's something we'll be managing
with volume segment-by-segment as it returns.

From an overall cost perspective, while we'll expect to see that headwind from that temporary cost
savings, we'll also continue to see the benefit of the more structural cost reduction actions, the
restructuring that we've done this year of $60 million to $70 million and then a similar level of incremental
restructuring benefit next year as well.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Cindy, congrats. You're certainly leaving on a high note.

Cynthia S. Guenther
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

I planned it.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

It seems like very well planned. So if we go back to Slide 7, where you have the monthly sort of organic
growth throughout the -- through the course of the pandemic, it looks like you exited 3Q down 2% or
so. 3Q average was down 3.5% roughly. And it sounds like you're pointing towards that sort of average
for the fourth quarter. So can you give us a sense as to how October has tracked, whether Europe has
actually rebounded relative to what you saw in 3Q? And then is there something we should keep in mind
apart from the extra week or so in the fourth quarter that would get us to that average for 3Q, for 4Q?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Sure. So as we said earlier, we're looking at 4Q being at or better than the pace of sales growth or decline
in the third quarter. And we're only a few weeks here into October. I think the last couple of quarters'
earnings calls have been a little bit later. So we had a little bit broader view. But after only a few weeks,
we have seen an improving trend so far in the month. So we've seen slight improvements, particularly in
developed regions within LGM and pretty favorable so far in RBIS as well early on here in October.

Now what we think we've seen in the back part of Q3 as well as the early part of Q4 here for RBIS is really
brands and retailers have been gearing up for somewhat earlier and potentially longer holiday season. So
we started to see that ramp up a little bit earlier in September, and we've seen a little bit of that at the
beginning of October here as well. And I think what we see as we're going forward is not really sure how
that will play out as we enter the back half of the quarter. So when we look at RBIS, how retail sales flow
through, I think, will help shape how that picks up later this year.

At the same time, as we talked about last year, when the pandemic hit is when the spring season was
starting to get in underway and much of retail shut down. So it's uncertain yet exactly how that will play
out and how those orders will play out for the spring season as it comes in later this year and at the
beginning of next year. So we started out stronger in RBIS, but we see a little more uncertainty, especially
as we go through the back part of this quarter.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. And then in terms of your comment on margins for 2021, I think you said EBITDA margins roughly
comparable to or at least maintaining it with 2020 levels. Can you give us some of the buckets of that?
Because $150 million of temporary cost savings is a very, very big draw in terms of a headwind. What
would be the major offsets?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So like you said, that is a big drop. And if we see the -- that will be partially dependent on how
volume goes, right? So with volumes being still uncertain, we'll layer that back in, as we mentioned a
minute ago. As volumes come back, we would start to see those costs come back. At the same time, one
of the bigger offsets is the incremental restructuring we've talked about as well, which we expect to be
about $70 million next year. And that's why in my comment, when we look this year to next year, with
a little bit of modest volume growth, we'd expect to be able to maintain the strong margins that we're
seeing this year.

Now part of the other way we're thinking about it is also comping to 2019, so kind of the pre-pandemic
target. So looking at where we were in 2019 to 2021 or beyond when markets recover will have a
significant benefit from the couple of years worth of restructuring savings that we've been doing and the
structural cost reductions over that multiyear period. Now that would be offset over a couple of years of
wage inflation and obviously, investments in the business and things like that. But when we look '19 to
'21, that's why we expect to continue to see margin expansion over that multiyear period.

Operator

Our next question comes from Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So in terms of RFID, are you still seeing evidence that your RFID engagements are accelerating? How
much of this is driven by non-apparel markets versus apparel? And in general, do you see this business as
a post-COVID winner as companies push more omnichannel sales strategies?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Yes. So overall, we continue to see momentum build within RFID and related solutions as part of our
Intelligent Labels platform. And its apparel, continue to see it in the numbers, the results, but even from
our pipeline apparel, we actually saw a pretty big tick up in early-stage pipeline development as well.
So in addition to companies moving through the pipeline, there's a lot more jumping into the mouth of
the funnel, if you will, as the just case for RFID is getting stronger and stronger because of COVID, as
you mentioned, but just everything else that's sort of related to driving more and more omnichannel and
just the increased efficiency, automation, lower labor content that retailers and e-commerce players are
looking for.

So seeing that within apparel, seeing that within food, same use cases, as I mentioned before. That's
more business case and pilot activity, what we're seeing largely in food. And then within logistics, we have
a few early stage deployments as well as quite a bit of pipeline activity and, again, quite a bit more even
early-stage engagements. So COVID definitely reinforces the strength of RFID. And you really just need
to think through the why. It's really around more automation, more contact-less, not contact-free, but
contact-less activity, whether that be at retail, whether that be in the restaurants, whether that be just in
accelerating and make more efficient logistics and supply chain. So we are seeing continued reinforcement
across the board.

Apparel, as we've said, will continue to be the main driver of growth over the coming couple of years. Our
focus over the last couple of years has been to continue to drive penetration within apparel while seeding
opportunities in other end markets, as we've called out. And that activity is progressing well.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then if you just talk about what you're seeing right now in terms of your
chemical and paper raw material costs, how do you see your price cost relationship playing out in the
fourth quarter and then into 2021?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So we still saw a little bit of sequential deflation in the third quarter, really driven by paper. And then
in the back part of the third quarter, really started to see some inflation in a couple of areas. One is in
chemicals, particularly in North America, when we look at chemicals and films. And also, we're starting to
see some pressure in freight, particularly in North America as well. So we see that kind of moderating a
little bit of a headwind as we go from Q3 to Q4 from an inflationary perspective.

Hard to call what that's going to look like, I think, for 2021 at this point, will be somewhat dependent on
the macro and where volumes end up going. But we had some -- still some favorability in Q3. We see
that turning to a little bit of unfavorability from an overall basket of raw materials and freight in the fourth
quarter.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Mitch or Greg, just in the context of your comments about 4Q organic sales being similar to or better than
the 3Q pace, are you surprised that sales trends are progressing as well as they are, considering another
wave of COVID cases across developed markets, not to mention high unemployment and otherwise? I'm
just wondering what exactly you think is going on. I know -- I saw P&G reported blockbuster volume
growth yesterday. So I know CPG demand remains quite elevated. But just talk about more broadly what
you think is happening? Why you think sales are holding up as well as they are, just given everything
going on?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So specifically, we'll talk about the components. LGM, it tends to be a relatively sticky -- stable
business across the cycles. And so it's not as sensitive as some of the big shifts that you see, even COVID,
one. And two, you'd expect it actually to be growing faster than overall consumption because of what's
going on, migration to more packaged goods as well as e-commerce trends that we've been talking about
in the past. And if you look at what's going on with overall, just general GDP growth trends, personal
consumption and nondurable consumer goods, our revenue trends across the pandemic, that's why I
stepped back and commented on the March to September time frame, have been better than some of
those macro categories, as you would expect.

Within the -- if you look month-to-month, we clearly experienced something different than we've seen in
past recessions because of the health crisis, where we saw inventory building earlier and then destocking
later. But across it, we would expect our businesses, our markets to grow faster within LGM than what
you're seeing on end consumption. End consumption is still the key step overall as you look going forward,
what your own individual assumptions are around that. We do not expect with the new resurgence of
coronavirus cases in the regions in which we operate for it to create the panic buying and the amount of
surge activity that we saw early in the stage. I think, by and large, ours and just, in general, supply chains
have proven resilient to be able to meet customer demand. So we wouldn't expect the kind of lumpiness
going into Q4 next year. So that's basically what we attributed to overall within that business.

And within RBIS, clearly, it came back much quicker than we anticipated. And essentially, after everything
coming to a halt for a couple of months, retail and apparel decided -- realized they needed to have goods
in time for holiday. And so there's been a big shift and ramping up orders dramatically to have goods
for holiday. And that's what we're seeing, and they're looking to spread it out. And I think some of the
uncertainty there is just -- some of it is having more sales before black -- traditional Black Friday, starting
it earlier because it will be at a slower burn, if you will. And then it's still got to be seen what happens at
the consumer level, but even in the post-holiday period. Over the last 10 years, there's been a shift to
more and more gift cards, which actually has improved January sales as well. And so that could play out.

So you could see this going multiple different directions. And our view is on -- for RBIS, holiday is key.
How the consumers come out? What that does to retailer sentiment as they go into the following seasons?
And then last is what Greg mentioned earlier, there is a lot of product manufactured between December
and February, that ultimately, the retail stores were closed for in the mature markets in the spring. Some
of that was ultimately sold through. Spring garments look a lot like summer, were sold through just a few
months later. Others may have been stored in warehouses. We're hearing stories of that and maybe pulled
back out.

So for us, there's a number of questions both about holiday, what it does to the retailer sentiment, but
also just the spring season, some questions. But that's near-term lumpiness. I think overall, if you just
look at our categories tied to consumer goods, we expect the markets to continue to be resilient over the
long term. And our position is very strong to continue to win and capture significant value now.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I appreciate that, Mitch. And just one other one. At the outset of the pandemic, you talked about next
year under the assumption that this turned out to be a normal recession or at least similar to the last
one. And obviously, that hasn't been the case. This has played out much differently such that you now

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

expect full year earnings to be up from a year ago. I mean what lessons, if any, would you draw from this
experience as it relates to looking out into next year or thereafter? I know you already said you expect
your margins to be comparable next year. But any thoughts about next year, just given how this year has
played out? And what you've been surprised by, what you haven't been surprised by? And how you think
this may unfold?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I think the biggest lesson is just the importance of and strength of our scenario planning. We've
talked about this in the past earnings calls and so forth. This is something we do. I think it's often looked
at by investors from just a financial scenario planning, but we embed this within our businesses to be
prepared for multiple environments. And we never predicted a human health crisis pandemic globally. And
so while the root cause was different, we had to, I'd say, sharpen up different elements of our scenario
planning, but we were able to pretty quickly go into deployment mode. And the team was already used
to being able to do this. And so I think that -- it just reinforces the value of scenario planning. And we've
learned that in a big way coming out of the last recession, and that's something that I and we have
continued to make sure is a key priority, which I think maybe a lot -- many people would maybe take
their foot off the gas a little bit on scenario planning when you have a long, steady expansion like we've
experienced, we did not. And I think it's proving out right now.

And so going into next year, our focus here is on protecting margins even in a low-growth environment.
And as Greg commented earlier, that's our focus. And there's lots of variables around restructuring costs,
temporary cost savings, what's going to happen with volume, raw material costs, everything else. There's
lots of variables you got to think about. Just our overall drive here is to continue to show we have a
business that can sustainably deliver GDP-plus growth in top quartiles over the long run. That is our focus.
And I guess our biggest lesson is to keep doing what we're doing.

Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS Securities.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Let me reiterate my congratulations to Cindy, and thanks for all your help. Much appreciated.

Cynthia S. Guenther
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

You're welcome.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So just on the quarter, looking at some of the monthly trends, specifically just thinking about RBIS, it's
kind of impressive how stable each month was. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color
on maybe some of the undercurrents behind that. Was RFID stronger earlier or later or base label and tag
stronger earlier or later? Or was it as smooth as it looks based on what you show on Slide 7?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Josh, so there's some movements between months. I think the other thing is September was actually
a tougher comp for us as well. It was a very strong month for us last quarter. So even being down 5%
in the month of September is still, from a pace perspective, a bit better than what we saw earlier in
the quarter. So I think we -- as we've talked about from the base apparel business, it's really been that
gearing up for holiday that started to impact us as we moved through the quarter. And then RFID, as Mitch
has talked a fair amount about, has been strong pretty much across the quarter. So all that continuing to
progress as we moved through and into the very early part here of October.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And just on the free cash flow side and cash deployment, I mean, you did a small amount of share
repurchases this quarter. I think if you look at perhaps forecast, your leverage comes down pretty quickly
over the next couple of quarters as you move past the tougher 2Q comp. How do you think about cash
deployment here over the next couple of quarters? Do you think share repurchases play a bigger role? And
along with that, the M&A pipeline active and rebuilding? Is it possible to do deals given what you might
see in terms of tougher performance through 2020 in terms of targets you may be looking at?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So I think overall, as you said, I mean our balance sheet has continued to strengthen here through
this time period this year. We've got ample capacity to continue managing across all the levers of our
capital allocation. So continuing to invest organically in the business. We're continuing to work the M&A
pipeline, just as you talked about. We haven't seen much flow through there yet after the Smartrac
acquisition that we just closed in March of this year. But we're continuing to work that pipeline. I wouldn't
say that we've seen big changes in valuations this year, but continuing to work that.

And of course, continuing to return cash to shareholders with a growing dividend and continuing share
buyback. So our focus is on continuing the same capital allocation priorities, I think, that we've had over
time. We took a bit of a pause on buybacks for a little while, of course, at the early part of the pandemic
here, but we'd expect to return to our overall capital allocation strategies and priorities going forward.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

And the only thing I'll add is, we did comment in the past, is we had an active M&A pipeline, mostly
bolt-ons and so forth. But there was a pause on just the amount of activity engagements as every
company was working to manage through the depths of the crisis. So there is just tonally a bit more
pickup in activity overall. So that's what we're seeing. But we're in a good position from a balance sheet
perspective, and we're planning to leverage it.

Our next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas from JPMorgan Securities.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

In looking at your income statement, your SG&A costs year-over-year really don't change very much
for all of the interim cost savings and the structural cost savings. The real change was in cost of goods
sold, and that cost of goods sold is down more as a percentage, it's obviously a much bigger number than
SG&A. And it's also a place where you've got negative volume leverage. Why is it that the cost savings are
really located in cost of goods sold and not in SG&A?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So I think over the course of the year, it's pretty well balanced between SG&A and cost of sales.
Obviously, a lot of those volume-driven temporary cost reductions we've talked about are more in cost
of sales because those are things like overtimes and costs, some furloughs in the second quarter, et
cetera. So that chunk is really more focused on cost of sales. I think -- and there's some movement up
and down between quarters, a little bit of incentive comp favorability we talked about in Q2, a little bit of
unfavorability then from that perspective in Q3. So I think over time, it's fairly well balanced between the
2, but moved around a little bit between quarters.

Okay. In the label business, I think you said that your European volumes were down 10% in the quarter.
Was that because they were down a lot in July and then they really improved? Like what does the down
10% look like for each of the months? Or can you frame it so that we have an idea of where things stand
in Europe or what were European volumes in October?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So they were down upper single digits volumes within Q3 for Europe, our Label and Packaging
Materials business. They are down almost 10% in July and trended better throughout. And then in
October, they're down low single digits. So an improving trend.

Our next question comes from Paretosh Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets.

Paretosh Misra
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Congrats to you, Cindy. Wanted to go back to your RFID pipeline side. I guess engagements are up 45%.
So where does that put the number of engagements? Now is that close to 500 now? And how much of the
revenue growth -- RFID revenue growth in the apparel business, you think, is net growth? Because I'm
guessing you're missing on sales of the traditional base tags to some of these apparel customers. So just
curious, what's the net incremental there?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So most of it is net incremental. I don't have a precise number. And you have to also understand,
because of what's going on in retail, some categories and just -- customer categories are down and others
up dramatically and particularly value, as we had mentioned earlier. So as far as the pipeline, yes, we're
still seeing robust -- we're not going to probably be disclosing. Actually, there's a number of activities
within each of the pipeline overall, but it's continuing to ramp-up at the pace that we've talked through.

Paretosh Misra
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Fair enough. And Mitch, can you talk about the -- some of the sustainability and ESG-related initiatives
that you've currently going on in your organization? Any opportunities for Avery to really differentiate or
stand out versus other packaging and specialty materials companies on that front?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Yes, just quick comments. So we've got 2 broad focuses. One is just reducing the environmental
impact of our actual operations. We've had a focus that we embarked on back in 2015 on reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, buying more sustainably produced raw materials such as paper and so
forth. So we've had ongoing activities. We are on track or ahead of schedule on all those greenhouse
gas emissions in absolute terms, not relative terms. So while we've grown, we've actually reduced
our greenhouse gases by more than 30% already and are ahead of track of our targets. So that's one
category.

Second is really around how do we create more sustainable products, enabling a more circular economy
around recyclability and so forth. We launched CleanFlake a number of years ago, specifically with that
end, which helps more efficient and effective recyclability of plastic containers. We are now looking at how
to roll that out and broaden the specific number of the product portfolio all around CleanFlake as this is
starting to take more hold within the market. So our focus here is continuing to reduce the environmental
impact of our operations as well as more sustainable products. We're seeing a lot more opportunity there
and plan to -- are and plan to continue to leverage our innovation strength to go after it. So we will, early
next year, lay out more of our strategies. We've had -- on the sustainability front, we laid out some 2025

goals back in 2015. We're going to lay out a new set of horizon goals through 2030 early next year, and
we'll be talking about more fulsomely with all of you.

Our next question comes from Christopher Kapsch with Loop Capital Markets.

Christopher John Kapsch
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

And I'll throw in my congrats to Cindy as well. Actually, I've been following the company long enough to
remember that Cindy sort of tried to retire once before. And so hopefully, this one sticks, right?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

We wouldn't let her to go as well.

Christopher John Kapsch
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Yes. So my questions are focused on LGM. And you mentioned sort of the disparate trends by geography,
contrasting, particularly, North America and Europe. And you talked about those trends, Europe lagging
North America maybe as we progressed sequentially through the quarter. But you also mentioned this
trend, which I'm hoping there's an explanation for where North America is sort of trending above its long-
term characteristics and Europe has been lagging that for some time now. Wondering if there's something
different about the competitive dynamic or something structurally about the markets that are different
now that could help explain that trend?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I think there's 2 factors. One is, as we look over the 7 months from March through September,
what we commented on, the biggest one is just consumption in Europe is below the U.S. That is one clear
thing. Can't really tell the difference between destocking levels, inventory relative to the 2. But the other
one is, we did comment that we thought we lost some share in Europe in Q2. We have been recovering
that here in Q3, and we'll continue over the next couple of quarters, but we've recovered a good portion of
that here in Q3 already.

So if you look over the March to September time frame, that is part of the impact. But the majority of it,
we believe, is tied to just differentials in the end consumption.

Christopher John Kapsch
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

And is that differential to the end consumption, does that have to do with economic activity? Or is it
something just the nature of the way packaging is trending in Europe vis-à-vis North America?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Economic activity in general and the conversion to more e-commerce seems to have been slower.

17

forever. But have you learned anything through either the belt-tightening side or the volumetric driven
cost cuts that maybe don't reverse and so that we could actually see some of the -- a portion of the $150
million actually hold as a permanent cost cut. How should we be thinking about that?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We said that we expect the vast majority to come back depending on volume environments. But
clearly, the current environment, I think, has provided new opportunities for new ways of working and
so forth. So we would expect some of it to be sticking through the long term, just around how to travel
and everything else. And we were fortunate in the amount of technologies that we had already deployed
globally, we could quickly go to virtual on everything. So it was a good catalyst for us to kind of go that
next step, but that's clearly not all sustainable to be running the business that way. So some will stick. We
haven't done the full assessment of exactly how much of it will be. We'll be doing that actually over the
next -- coming few months. But some of it will, but the vast majority will be coming back.

Operator

Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So you already told us that next year, you would hope to keep EBITDA margins relatively constant with
2020. And correct me if I misphrased anything there. Is there a way to give us a bit more color, give an
inch, take a mile on what you expect for RBIS. You said half of the savings will be -- from restructuring
will be going into RBIS. I guess the sort of the question behind the question is you're putting up margin in
RBIS that years back would have been great in a normal volume environment, which we've not been in.
So do you expect RBIS this flat? Or do you think RBIS margins actually have the ability to be up year-on-
year? How would you guide us if you could, as we think out to '21?

And then the other question I had regarding RBIS, and I'll turn it over. You mentioned that retailers and
brand owners are trying to position ahead of the holiday season. The season has maybe begun a little
bit earlier than expected, could go on longer recognizing there's going to be a bit of variability into '21.
That level of activity by your customers right now, is that really going to drive your volume for the fourth
quarter in RBIS? A lot of those shipments would have already occurred. And is it really more we should be
looking at it as a bellwether for what your orders will be late 4Q, 1Q, looking out to the spring season?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So George, a couple of questions there. First one, as far as RBIS margin outlook for next year, I don't
think we're going to comment on that. Our overall point here of laying out the expectations for 2021 is
that with a modest amount of growth, modest recovery, we are going to be focused, again, just like we've
talked about for the last 2 years in a low growth environment to protect margins. And that will be a key
focus of ours, and that's across the enterprise.

When we start getting into individual components of the portfolio, it depends what the volume
environment is as well. So I think what you can see is RBIS, despite significant challenges on the top line,
particularly in Q2, is managing those well. And if I remind you that in Q2, even -- we could have even had
better margins there, but we chose not to move on some actions at the time. So we deferred a number
of restructuring and cost-out actions and everything else at the depth of the crisis into Q3. So some of
that was bunched up into Q3, and that's what you're seeing between the 2 quarters. But I'm not going to
comment on specific components of the portfolio for 2021 at this time. I think a lot of it goes to what your
own assumptions would be around how each of the individual markets respond to the environment, what
the environment is in general next year. But our focus here is doing exactly what Greg laid out earlier.

As far as the timing of RBIS sales and some of the uncertainty, the uncertainty is really late Q4, early Q1,
around just what the impact is going to be around the fact that retail was largely closed in the spring of

2020 and some garments weren't sold. So that's reason one. And two, retailers and apparel brands will
have seen early how holiday is performing. And that impacts retailer sentiment and what they're open to
buy is for the following season. So it's really, I'd say, watch closely on the consumer behavior and retailer
brand communications here mid to late Q4, and that will be a key driver for us.
