Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. We thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule
to be on our call today. To start, I want to acknowledge the united and extraordinary efforts of all of
the talented, committed and resilient people of Air Products around the world. They work hard every
day to provide critical products and services to our customers. Our people, working in solidarity and in
a determined way, have made it possible for us to keep our 750 facilities around the world operating
throughout this unprecedented crisis. And I want to particularly thank our team who worked through the
very challenging severe winter storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Our people are the ones who are making it possible for us to continue to deliver our near-term business
results, while also pushing forward to develop, execute and operate major world-class projects to ensure
our growth in the future. Our people are the ones who make our higher purpose real every day, that is
to help humanity move forward in a sustainable way and bring people together to help solve energy and
environmental challenges.

Now please turn to Slide #3. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products. It
is a moral responsibility to keep our people safe, and our goal will always be 0 accidents and 0 incidents.
Despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our
strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers and our communities. I also want to emphasize
that sustainability is at the core of our DNA, and it drives our growth opportunities. We will be issuing
our annual sustainability report later this month, and I look forward to continuing this very important
conversation with you.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Now please turn to Slides 4, 5 and 6. You can again see our goal, our management philosophy and our
5-point plan for moving forward. These are the guiding principles that we follow every day and that will
continue to guide us in the future.

Now please turn to Slide #7. We remain committed to delivering superior financial performance. And as
I said, our people also know they are supporting a higher purpose in the work they do every day. Our
industrial gas expertise in many areas is critical to the success of dozens of industries. And the scope and
complexity of our mega projects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from
different parts of the world to work together as one team. We are proud to bring people from diverse
backgrounds and experiences together to collaborate and develop innovative solutions for some of the
most challenging energy and environmental problems in the world. That is our higher purpose, and it
inspires our team and drives us forward every day.

Now please turn to Slide #8, which highlights our gasification projects. We are committed to our
gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We continue to see countries
and large companies driving to convert low-value feedstock into high-value finished products. They have
identified gasification as the best way to use abundant, low-value resources, like coal, pet coke and
refinery bottoms in a sustainable manner. And we are in the best position to work with them and help
them deliver better, more sustainable solutions that benefit their economies and their people.

Consistent with our strategy, we are pleased to have completed the acquisition of the remaining 50%
share of our gasification technology joint venture in China. Now that this team will be 100% part of Air
Products, we are confident this will make us even more successful to pursue and win new large-scale
gasification projects. We do expect to announce additional gasification projects in the future.

Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 large gasification projects, which I have
discussed during our last 2 earnings calls. First, our $12 billion acquisition of the Jazan gasifier and power
plant from Saudi Aramco. We have continued to make significant progress working with our partners and
lenders since our last update. The team has worked hard to bring the project to the final stage of project
financing. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect this project to reach financial close in this
fiscal year.

I also want to provide you an update on Lu'An. During our second quarter, we continue to recognize a
reduced monthly fee under our interim agreement while our customers' plants were shut down. But I
am very pleased to announce that our customers has requested the start-up of our facility, and we are
proceeding with the commissioning of our plant. Since our equipment has been idled for several quarters,
it will require a period of time to bring all 4 gasifiers back on. But for your information, as of this morning,
the first gasifier was online, making synthetic gas and supplying our customers. So we are encouraged by
this development.

Now please turn to Slide #9, which shows our EPS growth. As you can see, we have delivered greater than
10% annual EPS growth since 2014, despite the adversities presented by the recent external challenges.
This is a testament to the hard work of our people and the stability of our business. This year, again, we
expect to achieve nearly 10% EPS growth in challenging conditions. I will discuss our expectation for this
year in more detail later in the call.

Now please turn to Slide #10. A reminder that we share our earnings and its growth with our investors.
Both our EPS and dividends have grown double digits since 2014. While we continue to develop our
exciting growth opportunities, we have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividend that we
have increased for the last 39 consecutive years.

And finally, Slide #11, shows our EBITDA margin. As always, my favorite slide, where it shows that the
margin is up over 1,200 basis points since 2014. Margin is down slightly, primarily due to the significantly
higher energy pass-through for natural gas, which increases our sales but doesn't impact profits. I'm very
proud of our team who delivered EBITDA margin over 37% for the quarter despite the challenges of the
pandemic and the winter storm affecting the U.S. Gulf Coast.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, to provide a financial review. Scott?

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Seifi. We continue to demonstrate the resilience of our company, our business and most
importantly, our people. EPS increased despite the ongoing COVID impact, lower earnings from Lu'An
and the extreme U.S. Gulf Coast weather during the quarter. Our business, which is about half on-site,
continued to deliver stable cash flow in spite of difficult conditions continuing around the world.

Now please turn to Slide 12, for a brief discussion of our second quarter results. Sales topped $2.5 billion,
up 13% compared to prior year, driven by strong prices, higher energy pass-through and favorable
currencies. Volume was flat as the additions of new plants, acquisitions and increased sale-of-equipment
activities were offset by reduced Lu'An contributions, COVID-19 impacts and the winter storm. Prices were
again up versus prior year with improvements in all 3 regions. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of
year-over-year pricing gains.

Overall, prices were up 2% in total, which represents a 5% increase for the merchant business. COVID-19
continued to negatively impact our business. We estimate the pandemic reduced overall sales by about
3% and EPS by about $0.10 to $0.15. The U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm disrupted our customers,
interfered with our operations and caused the sharp spike in local energy prices. However, we were able
to mitigate much of the negative impact through operational actions and contractual pass-through to
customers.

Our people work tirelessly overcoming these challenges during this time, restarting our plants quickly and
restoring supply to our customers as they also recovered from the weather impacts. I want to extend my
sincere gratitude to our people for a job well done.

The adverse weather, in addition to having a modest negative impact on sales and profits, also reduced
our margin. Higher energy cost pass-through, primarily due to the storm, decreased the EBITDA margin
by about 300 basis points this quarter. As a reminder, this contractual pass-through increases sales but
not profits. EBITDA of $934 million improved 5% as favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income
more than offset the negative impact of volume, the winter storm in the U.S. and higher development
costs.

Operating income was 2% lower, while EBITDA was higher compared to last year, largely due to
depreciation on new plants, particularly the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired last year. ROCE was 320
basis points lower, primarily due to the increase in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt.
Sequentially, sales were up 5%, primarily driven by 4% higher energy cost pass-through. Price was up
1%, but volume was down 1%, driven primarily by the Lunar New Year slowdown in Asia.

Now please turn to Slide 13. Our second quarter GAAP EPS was $2.13, which included 2 non-GAAP
items, a $0.12 gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner in Europe and an $0.08 loss from a
facility closure. Excluding the non-GAAP items in both periods, our second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.08
was $0.04 above last year despite the negative $0.10 to $0.15 impact of COVID-19 and lower Lu'An
contribution. Volume was unfavorable $0.19. The negative impacts of COVID-19 and Lu'An more than
offset gains from the PBF acquisition as well as a number of small new plants, particularly in Asia. Volume
was flat in sales, but unfavorable in EPS due to business mix.

It is important to recognize that as the 60% majority owner of the Lu'An joint venture, 100% of the
negative impact from Lu'An is included in this volume line because we consolidate the operating results.
However, this was partially offset by the positive impact reflected in the noncontrolling interest line
as the net income shared by our partner is also reduced. In other words, the negative $0.19 volume
overstates the overall EPS impact to Air Products from Lu'An. Price net of variable costs contributed $0.09,
demonstrating the value we deliver to customer and includes the higher energy costs associated with the
winter storm. Cost was modestly unfavorable as we continue to add new resources for future growth and

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

incur additional development costs. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.10, primarily due to
appreciation of the Chinese RMB, euro, British pound and the South Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar.

Equity affiliate income added $0.05 on strong underlying business results, while noncontrolling interest
was also favorable $0.04 on lower profits in our consolidated joint ventures, primarily Lu'An, as I
mentioned previously. Interest expense was $0.06 unfavorable due to the costs associated with the
additional $5 billion of debt. The remaining $0.04 includes a favorable $0.03 nonoperating income impact
and a favorable $0.01 impact from a lower tax rate. The effective tax rate of 20.2% was 30 basis points
lower than last year. We still expect our effective tax rate to be around 20% to 21% in fiscal year '21.

Now please turn to Slide 14. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash
flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated almost $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or about $11.60
per share. From our EBITDA of almost $3.7 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note
that our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global
headquarters.

From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or almost $1.2 billion as dividends to our shareholders
and still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow,
even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends
and capital deployment.

Slide #15 provides additional details on our capital deployment. As I said last quarter, Air Products
continues to have substantial investment capacity remaining and available to deploy into high-return
projects consistent with our strategy. As you can see, we expect about $18 billion of investment capacity
available over the 5-year period from FY '18 through FY '22. The $18 billion includes over $9 billion of
cash and additional debt capacity available today, over $2 billion of investable cash flow between now and
the end of FY '22 and over $6 billion already spent. Additionally, we anticipate generating more cash and
borrowing capacity as projects come on stream and contribute to the growth in our results, and some of
the spending on our backlog extends beyond FY '22. We expect to reframe this potential for you later this
year.

We continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. With
a few smaller new projects signed and some coming on stream, our total project and M&A commitments
remained about $12.7 billion, with about $10.5 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we've
already spent over 35% and have already committed 95% of the capacity we show here.

Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide #16 for our Asia results. Sales increased 6% compared to last
year as favorable currency and price more than offset weaker volume. Pricing up in all countries added
1%, which represents a 3% increase for the merchant business. This was the 16th consecutive quarter of
year-on-year price improvement. Sequentially, price was also positive, but rounded to 0.

Volumes are down 2% as higher merchant volumes, I'd like to repeat, higher merchant volumes and new
plants partially offset the impact of Lu'An being shut down. Merchant volume improvement in the region
has been encouraging, particularly in light of the strong rebound following the expected Lunar New Year
slowdown. But the recovery is not consistent across all product lines.

Additionally, we brought on stream a number of new smaller plants that contributed to our results. EBITDA
was similar to last year, as strong price and favorable currency helped offset the impact of lower volumes.
EBITDA margin of 46.4% was 330 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to lower volume driven
by Lu'An. Sales and profit were down sequentially, primarily due to Lunar New Year.

Now I would like to turn the call back to Scott to talk about our Americas results. Scott?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Americas results. Sales increased 13%
compared to last year as strong price and significantly higher energy pass-through more than offset lower
volumes. Volume was down 6%, primarily due to the continuing negative impact of COVID-19 and the
winter storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Although there are signs of overall economic improvements in the
U.S., the operating results for U.S. refineries remained low.

The winter storm this quarter further reduced the demand for hydrogen in the Gulf Coast, in addition
to pressuring the merchant products. We have also seen some transitory contractual reduction in our
hydrogen business recently, as some refineries are reconfiguring their operations to produce renewable
fuels. However, such production will use hydrogen once the process is completed. The usage of hydrogen
for renewable fuel per unit is, in fact, 4 to 5x more than conventional fuel.

Price was again better across most major product lines. The 3% increase for the region was equivalent
to a 7% increase on the merchant business. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price
improvement. Higher energy pass-through increased sales by 15%. The higher energy prices through the
rest of the quarter were exacerbated by the record high prices during the winter storm, which much of this
contractually passed through to customers.

EBITDA reached nearly $450 million, a 6% increase over last year as better price, higher equity affiliate
income and the PBF acquisition more than offset the volume shortfall, including the adverse impact of the
winter storm. EBITDA margin declined 310 basis points. Higher energy pass-through, which increased
sales but not profits, reduced margin by 650 basis points. In other words, margins were up over 300 basis
points, excluding the energy cost pass-through impact.

Compared to last quarter, Americas volumes increased 2% following the holiday season and continued the
gradual COVID recovery. Price also improved 1%. EBITDA improved double digits sequentially, supported
by improved volume, lower maintenance and higher equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin was almost
flat sequentially, which included a negative 450 basis point impact from higher energy pass-through.

Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other statements. Simon?

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region
results. Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales and EBITDA both
improved nearly 20% versus last year. Volume plus price was up 7%, as volume grew 5%, principally due
to acquisitions and higher on-site volumes, which more than overcame the adverse impact of COVID-19,
predominantly in our packaged gas business. Price increased for the 13th consecutive quarter and was
higher across most major product lines and subregions. The 2% price gain for the region corresponds to a
3% improvement for the merchant business.

Currencies were favorable 9%, primarily due to the strong euro and British pound. EBITDA jumped 17% to
nearly $220 million, supported by favorable price, volume, currencies and equity affiliate income. EBITDA
margin dipped 50 basis points, primarily due to a negative 100 basis point impact from higher energy cost
pass-through. EBITDA was down 2% compared to last quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower equity
affiliate income, while margin decreased 220 basis points, including a 70 basis point negative impact from
higher energy cost pass-through.

Now please turn to Slide 19, global gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as
well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activity, but profit was lower
due to business mix and higher product development spending.

Please turn to Slide 20, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs.
Sales were higher this quarter, driven by increased project activities as we continued to execute multiple
large LNG and other projects. Profit dipped slightly on higher corporate costs.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Now to provide some additional thoughts, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Simon. Now please go to Slide #21. Unfortunately, as everybody knows, the world continues
to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic. With widespread vaccination efforts, some regions have been
able to reduce the spread of the virus, while others are experiencing an increase in number of cases.
Against this backdrop, we take pride in our ability to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow. Our on-site
business, roughly half of our total sales, remained stable and our price continued to be strong. We have
also seen signs of improvement in merchant volumes.

As we look forward, although we still see uncertainties ahead, our confidence in major economies around
the world is growing, particularly in light of the increasing pace of vaccination. Therefore, we have
resumed providing EPS guidance this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Lu'An has asked us to restart our
facilities, and we expect Jazan to close during this fiscal year.

However, there remains some uncertainty to the exact timing of these events; therefore, we are providing
our EPS and CapEx guidance, excluding Jazan and Lu'An restart. In other words, the restart of Lu'An and
the financial close of Jazan, if they happen within this fiscal year, they will be accretive to the guidance
that I'm giving you.

Our quarter -- for quarter 3 of fiscal year 2021, our earnings per share guidance is $2.30 to $2.40 per
share, which is up 14% to 19% over last year. And the guidance for our fiscal year 2021 is $8.95 to $9.10,
up 7% to 9% over last year. We see our CapEx at approximately $2.5 billion for this year, again, excluding
Jazan. Meanwhile, we continue to execute our other projects, bringing them on stream and finalizing
agreements with our customers. We are committed to the capital deployment strategy and to growing our
pipeline of our projects.

Please turn to Slide #22. As always, the success of our strategy is rooted in the great team we have at Air
Products. We believe strongly that our only sustainable long-term competitive advantage is the degree of
commitment and motivation of our people, the people who work hard every day to bring our strategy to
life. I am very proud to be working with this team.

Our deep commitment to sustainability creates exciting growth opportunities driven by the energy
transition to a lower carbon world. Our gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen growth platforms are at
the core of this transition. In the past 5 years, our differentiated strategy and our core competencies have
positioned Air Products to lead across these areas.
Now at this time, we are very pleased to answer any of your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research
Partners.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Seifi, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on capital allocation. If you were to look out over the medium
to longer term, let's say, 5 years, how would you expect to allocate capital among 3 buckets? The first
would be green hydrogen, the second gasification and the third, traditional projects such as ASUs and
SMRs?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Kevin, thank you for your question. I see that we are focused on gasification, carbon capture and
hydrogen and, obviously, our underlying standard business. We think that our underlying business will
require investment of approximately $500 million to $700 million, $800 million, with all of these smaller
plants and generators and all of that to grow with the overall economy in the world. Then in terms of
the other 3 opportunities, in terms of capital allocation, I don't want to kind of prefer one over the other
because it depends different parts of the world. Obviously, we are not going to spend any money on
significant gasification project in some of the more developed coal gasification in, for example, Europe or
the U.S., but there will be coal gasification projects in India and Indonesia and the other -- and China.

Carbon capture is going to require a lot of capital, and that will be very, very prevalent in -- I foresee, in
Europe and in the United States, specifically. And then obviously, green hydrogen and blue hydrogen, it
will be all over the world. So I would have a balance with them. But since these are all mega projects, for
1 year or 2, one of them might be higher than the other one. But in the course of 5 to 10 years, if you
take all of the capital allocation, I think that most of the capital will go to carbon capture, then hydrogen
and then gasification.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes. And secondly, if I may, Seifi, you mentioned that some of your hydrogen customers are reconfiguring
to produce renewable fuels. How much of that do you expect to occur? And what is the net benefit? It
sounds like the reconfigured refineries would consume a lot more hydrogen. So just trying to get a sense
of what that benefit could be to you over time.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

The benefit could actually be very positive. The only caveat over here is that there is a lot of talk about
this thing. There is a lot of interest in it. But I'm a conservative person, I want to wait and see how many
of these projects actually do materialize.

But as I think Scott mentioned when he was talking about the Americas, the intensity of hydrogen
requirement per barrel of renewable diesel versus per barrel of ordinary diesel is almost 4 to 5x. So if
these refineries in a major way convert to renewable diesel, the demand for hydrogen will actually go
up. But again, I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves because there is a lot of talk, but we'll see how
many of these projects will actually materialize.

Operator

Next, I'll move to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Seifi, just on Jazan, once the financing is complete, should the project start up immediately? And also has
your expected return on the project come down during this period of discussion and negotiation?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Are you talking about Jazan?

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. So first of all, if I may answer the second part of your question, we had given some general
guidance about the profitability of this project to the investors almost 2 years ago. During the period of
the negotiations and so on, that expectation is still correct. So secondly, the first part of your question,
once we close on this thing, the day we close, the next day, we will get our fixed fee, and therefore, it will
be accretive to our EPS.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Very good. And just on Lu'An, do you expect the same level of earnings post this current restart as you
had prior to the project going down back, I think, last June?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

No. I think we explained to you that when we renegotiated the contract, we renegotiated that we have
a structure for, if the plant is down, what we get paid. We have a structure for when the plant is up and
running for a period of time, and then we get back to full payment for -- per the original contract. So
there's kind of 3 levels.

And we'll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I'm just wondering -- you mentioned that the purchase of the other 50% of the Chinese JV that you didn't
own, you made it sound like that was going to be sort of a trigger that would lead to the announcement
of other gasification projects. I'm just curious if you could elaborate on sort of what is the significance of
owning that other 50% that, therefore, maybe allows you to do some other projects?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Because then we don't have to consult with somebody else in terms of what we do and what we don't do.
Because when you are a 50-50 joint venture, you have to have a consensus when you're going to different
projects in different parts of the world and different people have different preferences. But then it is 100%
owned, then we can decide on our own what we want to do. Therefore, I think that is why I said it will
facilitate us in terms of getting additional projects.

Okay. And if I could also ask you on the guidance for the back half of the year, maybe specific to the
Americas, are you assuming any meaningful improvement for your refinery customers and/or for helium
volumes?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Not particularly, no, for neither one. We are assuming that things will be approximately -- there might
be some improvement, but that is not the driver for the forecast. We are taking a conservative approach
there.

Operator

And we'll move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I was hoping you could clarify some of the dynamics in the Americas business. There was some kind of
penalty from storm, and there was some order of magnitude benefit from the acquisitions that you've
made. If you look at the volume exclusive of the storm and the acquisitions, what might it have been
during the quarter?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

The volumes would have been down.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. I know that.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

You are referring to our hydrogen business, Jeff, right?

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

No, I'm referring to the consolidated volumes in the Americas. That is, what would they have been
exclusive of acquisitions and exclusive of the storm?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

I think our merchant business -- I mean, our LOX/LIN business would have been kind of flat and then
our hydrogen business would have been lower. Because as you know, we have some refineries like the
Shell refineries, which was a customer shutdown. And then out of the 100% volume, some of the volume
on the pipeline is not contracted long term. It is a spot sale and the refineries, considering their level of
operation being low, they had cut back on their spot sales. So the hydrogen volumes would have been
lower, especially on the Gulf Coast.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The equity income in that division was $32 million in the quarter, and maybe it was up $10 million year-
over-year and $10 million sequentially? Why was the equity income so high? And is that an unusual
number?

Chairman, President & CEO

The equity income is so high, Jeff, because I explained that last time, because our equity affiliate
in Americas is Mexico. And Mexico, unfortunately, because of COVID, the demand for oxygen was
phenomenal, just the way it is right now in India and the way it is for -- in Brazil. Quite frankly, that is why
some of our competitors are having very good results because of that. It's a very unfortunate situation.
But I mentioned last quarter that if you are in the medical business right now, Mexico, Brazil, India will
make you a lot of money. And we saw that benefit in our joint venture in Mexico.

Operator

And we'll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.

Mike Harris

It's Mike Harris, actually sitting in for Bob. I think, if we go to your favorite slide, #11. I noticed that the
EBITDA margins appear to have declined like 3 consecutive quarters. And you seem to be gaining price.
So just kind of trying to reconcile how you're gaining price, losing margins? So how should I think about
the margin going forward?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think you should -- you are on the very right track, and let's look at the causes. Number one, the
margin comes down when Lu'An is shut down because Lu'An is a very, very high-margin business. So that
Lu'An, by itself, has a significant effect when it is down.

The second thing is that when natural gas prices go up, we end up showing more sales because we are
buying natural gas and then the customer reimburses us for that. But it shows us higher sales, but it
doesn't affect the profit line. So if natural gas, every dollar of natural gas going up, affects our sales
by $350 million in a year. So if natural gas prices continue to go up, then our margins for our hydrogen
business looks lower because the profit doesn't change, but the sales go up. So those are the 2 effects
that you need to think about.

So as we go forward, if natural gas prices come back to the levels they were, and if Lu'An starts up, then
you're going to see our margins go up. So I still feel very good about our margins. We haven't seen a
fundamental change in the profitability of our business.

Mike Harris

Okay. And just as a follow-up, Looking at Lu'An, when we think about commissioning, is that a process
that you think about in terms of weeks or months? And once that facility is back online, is there some type
of a break-in period that they have to run at reduced rates? Or can they ramp that facility up fairly quick?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the thing is that with a plant that has been shut down and then you start it up, you never know
which pump works, which pump doesn't work. But as I mentioned in my comments, as of this morning, we
do have one of the gasifiers online supplying their product to our customers. And I'm hoping that the other
3 will come on stream in the next few months. We don't want to be too specific because we can start up
and one pump can have a failure and then you have to recommission or change the pump and all of that.
But overall, it's not going to take years, it's going to be a relatively short period of time.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

So I guess a little bit of a follow-up on Lu'An. This year has obviously been a lumpy year with it with the
kind of not getting paid full out, like the contract being rejiggered a little bit while it was down. I guess
is there a way to think about how the total payout in fiscal '21 versus fiscal '22 will look out in terms of
overall earnings contribution?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Fiscal '21, which is the one we are in right now versus fiscal '22, right?

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes, that's right.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Versus next year? Well, this year, I mean, we haven't made a lot of money in Lu'An because, in fact, the
plant has been shut down for 6 months, and now we are starting it up. So I think that fiscal year '22 will
be significantly better than '21, barring any plant breakdown or anything.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. So it should be back to kind of the $0.25 contribution or something in that range? Is that the right
way to think about it?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

I don't want to confirm that because it depends on how much we run and all of that. But John, the biggest
issue over here was the fact that people thought that gasification is dead, the plant will be shut down
forever.

That -- we always said that's not the case. We always said that this is due to change in management and
so on, and that has proven to be correct. So the fact is that the customer wants the plant running, the
plant is viable. It is going to produce product. And now how much is our profitability, '22, I'm sure, is
better than '21, but it also depends on how well they we run the plant and how many times we can keep
the gasifiers on the stream and all of that. So I don't want to give you a definite prediction. Obviously, we
will give you a much more accurate prediction in October when we give you our guidance for 2022.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. Fair enough. And then maybe just as a follow-up, you spoke to merchant business starting to pick
up and seeing signs of the macro kind of having some pull there. Can you speak to what that means
for bidding activity around either the gasification side or some of the traditional on-site business? Are
you starting to see increases in bidding activity or demand and interest from kind of the larger-scale
customers at this point? And how should we think about that in terms of filling up the backlog and contract
announcement as how we look through the rest of this year?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

John, the demand for those kind of projects never slowed down during the COVID. It continued to be
very strong. It continues to be very strong. And we are optimistic about -- very optimistic about the
deployment targets. Scott mentioned that we have almost 95% delivered 2 years in advance, and we are
very bullish on that. We see a lot of very large projects that we are working on, and I think those will bear
fruit as we go forward.

And we'll move on to Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Wanted to ask you about the Asia business. It sounds like you saw a strong recovery following the typical
Lunar New Year shutdowns. But I believe you said that markets are recovering at different rates or maybe
that the recovery has been a little bit uneven. So can you give us a little bit more color on what you saw in
Asia coming out of Lunar New Year?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

That's a very good question, actually, Mike. What I said was that we saw a very strong recovery in China
and other places after the Lunar New Year. The thing that I said is that the recovery is not even across all
product lines. That specifically means that our LOX/LIN business is coming on strong. Our argon business
is coming strong, but that is not necessarily true about our helium business in that part of the world. And
that is because some of our -- because we have -- as you know, we are holding very firm to our pricing
strategy. And as a result, we might be losing some market share there.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

All right. And then within the electronics market, it seems like that is set up to see very strong demand
over the next couple of years. But as I look at the on-site facilities that you're going to be starting up in
the coming years, really just looks like the Samsung plants in Korea. Can you talk about your activity
within the electronics market? And whether there are some additional on-site opportunities that maybe
aren't listed there on that slide or that you plan to book over the coming months or years?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

The demand for electronics and the electronics on-site business for high-purity nitrogen is very strong. We
are participating in that. We have won a lot of contracts. Some of that, we cannot announce because the
customer doesn't want to announce it because they want to keep their clients kind of confidential. But we
are not losing any market share in that area. We are -- we have proprietary products, which are actually
very competitive, and we remain very bullish in that area.

That is going to grow my friend, it's not going to come down. We are going to continue to invest heavily
for the next 10, 15 years because the opportunities are huge. Our financial capacity is there, and we are
not going to be buying shares. We will maintain our dividend and increase it, but we are not going to
waste our money buying shares. We are going to invest in high-return projects, which there are plenty of
them for us.

And what we will do is that, in a few months, we are going to give you a plan for the next 5 years, the
same way that we did in 2018. In 2018, we said between '18 and '23, we will spend about $15 billion. We
are already ahead of that. And in a few months, we will give you a plan for 2020 -- for -- a 10-year plan,
2018 to 2028. So don't expect -- yes, go ahead.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. No, I understand. Just I -- for 2022, I know it's early to give specific guidance, but do you think
investors should be adding Jazan and Lu'An back to their 2022 outlook, particularly as they look to value
the company going forward?

Seifollah Ghasemi

Well, if everything goes fine, and Lu'An -- we are totally successful in bringing Lu'An online, and we signed
all of the final contracts and finished the financing, 2022 will be a good year because then Jazan and Lu'An
will be there compared to this year. Not a bad assumption.

We'll move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just a question. Last weekend, Wall Street Journal had an article talking about delays at the Greater NEOM
project, and I get that your project can be separate from the city itself. But just want to see if you guys
are seeing any of those types of delays as you're moving forward? Kind of where are you with purchasing
long lead-time equipment? And when will we start to see that capital from NEOM actually rolling through
your cash flow and your balance sheet?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

First of all, I don't want to make any comment about the bigger NEOM project because I don't know
enough about it, and that's not something that we are involved. The one thing that I can confirm is that
our project has nothing to do with the city. Whether the city is delayed or built or not built, it doesn't
affect our project at all. We are self-contained. We are going to be desalting our own water. We are going
to produce our own power. And so we are totally self-contained. So that -- any kind of any issues with the
city will not affect our project. In terms of our project, we have placed orders for some of the long-term
items, and we are making progress. And in terms of cash flow, it is -- already we are spending money on
that project right now.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. And then maybe if we could jump to helium. I know there's notionally some new capacity coming
online, but it seems like demand for helium is picking up strongly. Can you walk us through how you would
view kind of the next 1, 2, 3 years, just supply/demand in the helium market globally?

On that one, I think the -- you know the number of sources of helium and all of that. The biggest question
about supply/demand in helium is not a secret. It is what is going to happen to the project that Russia is
doing, the so-called Amur project. That project will produce a lot of helium when it is online. The issue is
when is it going to be online? Is it going to be -- end of 2021? 2022? 2023? At what rate, that is in Siberia
and all of that. So I don't want to make any predictions on that, but that is the only other major project
that is underway.

You mentioned some temporary hydrogen headwinds as those refiners reconfigure to biodiesel. Do the
hydrogen contracts allow for suspension of volume if they have extended downtime to reconfigure?

Seifollah Ghasemi

We'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

Seifi, I found your response to Kevin's capital allocation question interesting where you highlighted carbon
capture as being potentially the largest bucket. And I wanted to just drill into that a little bit. Would you
say that is potentially the largest because of the interest in it as from customers that see it as a way to
meet some carbon reduction targets in a relatively inexpensive way? Or would you say that you have
something to bring that's really somewhat differentiated in the capacity of either your technology or your
access to these CO2-rich streams coming out of the SMRs that you could target? And just anything that
you might have to add on that with perspective of any limitations to where you can sequester the CO2.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, thank you for the question. And also thank you for providing the answer because you kind of
answered the question by saying that we are in a unique position. We are operating the largest carbon
capture facility in the world right now. Operational. We have been running it for several years. We capture
1 million ton a year of CO2 from the SMRs that we have in Port Arthur. So we know how to do this thing.

Secondly is that we have many, many SMRs that put out CO2. Therefore, the CO2 is there that can be
captured. The other thing is the fact that there is significant focus on this because by capturing CO2, you
can make blue hydrogen. And therefore, the transition to the hydrogen economy can happen very quickly

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

using hydrocarbons. And a lot of people are very interested in that. People who make hydrocarbons are
very interested in finding a way to produce hydrogen, capture the carbon and say here is the hydrogen,
which is almost -- is not as good as green hydrogen, but it is hydrogen with significantly reduced carbon
footprint. So that is why I am -- I think that there will be a lot of big investments in that area, and we
are very well positioned with our core competency, with the plants that we have around the world to be a
major player on that, and we intend to be a major player on that.

Our goal is very simple. Gasification, we have put ourselves in a position that we are the major -- the
leading company for gasification. Any gasification project in the project -- in the world, probably Air
Products will do that. We plan to be the leader in blue hydrogen, which means CO2 capture, and we plan
to be the leader in green hydrogen, which we already are with the plant that we are building in NEOM.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

And Seifi, just one on your outlook for the fuel cell buses, you talked about this tour of U.S. cities. And I
just wanted to get your view on whether that opportunity is potentially more attractive in the U.S. because
the cities can start with gray hydrogen that's relatively less expensive than if it were sourced from natural
gas in Europe at 3x the price? Is it the attraction starting gray? Or do you see, longer term, the fuel cell
buses in regions like Europe is potentially larger in that green hydrogen could be more comparably cost
and priced relative to gray?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

You're raising an excellent question. The issue is that, in terms of the economics, you would expect that
U.S. will be ahead of Europe because of the cheap natural gas that you can convert and all of that, you
can capture the carbon and have blue hydrogen and all of that. But then there is the fundamental element
of the government interest. And what we are finding out is that the governments in Europe are a lot more
committed to green hydrogen. They are really committed to green hydrogen, not blue. They want green.

And as a result, I think our hydrogen business, our green hydrogen business, the biggest potential will
be in Europe rather than in the U.S. or any other part of the world. That's the way it is developing right
now. But things can change. Government policies can change. If in the United States, all of the states or
at least the majority of the states adopt the LCFS plan that California has put in place, then you are going
to see a boom in terms of hydrogen in the U.S., but I don't know whether that happens or if that happens.

But in Europe, we see that. And then in Japan, they are going with the idea of taking blue ammonia and
putting it in their power plants to reduce their carbon footprint. So the different parts of the world are
doing different things. But what you are delineating is a very logical economic thing, but on top of that,
you have to put the layer of where the government pressure is. And I think for a project like NEOM, the
biggest potential market will probably be Europe.

Operator

And next we'll hear from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

First question relates to the guidance. Just wanted to confirm how you're handling the COVID impact, the
$0.10 to $0.15 that you cited for the past 2 quarters for the remainder of the year?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we are expecting that the COVID impact would be a little bit less in the U.S. because of the
vaccination and an improvement in Europe because of the vaccination. And then in China and the rest of
Asia, that COVID impact is not as significant anyway. So we have kind of considered some improvement
because of COVID impact, but still having, in mind, that there will be some.

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Great. And then I wanted to follow up on the carbon capture. It would appear that -- you responded
to the earlier question discussing blue hydrogen, but it would appear there's quite an opportunity for
stacking some of these carbon capture credits for renewable diesel. And obviously, there's a higher
hydrogen content there that you mentioned.

Why aren't we seeing that occur right now? You mentioned there's a lot of talk about projects, but maybe
things aren't happening. I'm curious what bottlenecks might exist? And if that involves perhaps some
takeaway capacity for CO2 that maybe needs to be built by someone else before those can move forward?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well let me just focus on making sure I understood your question correctly. You are saying how come
these renewable diesel projects are not happening faster? I think the main reason is that right now, the
only place that it makes sense to sell renewable diesel and still be profitable is in California.

So people -- I mean, Valero, when they are producing this thing in Texas, they don't sell it in Texas,
they sell it in California because if they sell it in Texas, they lose money because just the cost of the raw
material for making renewable diesel is probably $2.50, $3 a gallon.

So -- and so right now, everybody is making things to go to California and sell it in California. And
therefore, people are sitting down and saying, "How many -- how much capacity does California have?"
Because if you add all of these renewable diesels in 4 or 5 years, 100% of the diesel sold in California will
be renewable. Then what do you do?

So people need to get themselves comfortable that this policy that California has will be picked up by
Oregon and Colorado and New York and all of that, which I think it will be. But until it is done, I think
you're not going to see a significant growth on this thing because people are going to say, well, how am I
going to -- where am I going to sell it?

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And just following on to the other part of the question, related to carbon capture opportunity. Is there a
bit of a chicken and egg problem there where the infrastructure might not be in place to take the captured
carbon to wherever it's going to be stored or sequestered? And how do you see the market sorting that
out?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

You are very right because when people talk about capturing carbon, so we can capture carbon for you.
Anywhere there is a plant which puts out CO2 out of an SMR or a chemical unit, we know how to capture
that. That's the easy part. The question is that what do you do once you have captured it. You need to
have a place to sequester it. And the biggest question is that where is it possible to sequester it? Where
is it possible that there is enough pore space to do that? That is the biggest -- that is the major question
that will come into play in terms of how many of these projects can you do, where can they be done and
all of that?

Just want to come back quickly on Lu'An, if you might. I just want to confirm what we're hearing this
morning, which is that when you're fully through commissioning and when you're running the 4 gas fires,
and I appreciate this project is run at a very, very high utilization rate historically.

But Seifi, is what you're saying that whenever you hit that run rate, will the contribution be substantially
similar from Lu'An as what it's been historically, meaning there hasn't been any change to the commercial
terms or the economics from Air Products' perspective?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, that is the question that I tried to answer before, that when we renegotiated or reconsidered the
arrangements with Lu'An, I don't want to go through all of the details because the customer doesn't want
us to disclose that. We said that we have come up with 3 stages. One is when the plant is shut down, what
do we get? The second thing is that when the plant is up on stream, what do we get for a certain period of
time and then we go back to the original contract.

So I do not want to represent to you that if we come on stream 100% in 2022, we will make as much
money, the $0.25, as we did in 2019, it will be less than that. How much less than that, I cannot disclose
to you. But there is a period of time where we have agreed to reduce our fee to help the customer.
And then we will -- but then the overall return on the project is still as good, if not better, because the
customer has agreed to extend the term of the contract, which means that our return on invested capital
for the length of the contract is still intact. Okay?

Stephen I. Richardson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes, that's clear. And one follow-up, Seifi, if I may. I mean you've been through obviously a lot of
conversations over the last 2 to 3 quarters, both on Jazan and Lu'An, and it's clearly taken a lot of the
market's focus. I was wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit about lessons learned about how
you'll talk about projects going forward, the way in which you're thinking about projects in the backlog?
And kind of the best way to communicate these variabilities, which will come up from time to time with the
market and your investors going forward?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the one lesson that I have learned all my life, it's not just -- is that you always need to tell the
people the truth at the time that you are talking to them. And therefore, maybe we overdid it, maybe it
was -- could have been handled differently, but I believe we handed the right way. In November of 2020, I
was very concerned about Lu'An, and I was very concerned about Jazan and I told the investors.

Now I did explain to them, put the caveat in them that some people didn't listen to us that, look, I
don't think these -- this is what I know right now, but this doesn't mean it's the end of the world. This
doesn't mean that it's the end of gasification. This doesn't mean that we are not going to do Jazan, but
some people took it like that and our stock got hit by $50. But quite honestly, if I had to do it again, I
would always tell the investors what we know at the time that we are talking to you, and we should be
transparent.

But I think maybe we can do a better job -- we can always do a better job. Maybe we can do a better
job on putting it in the right context, not to kind of create panic. But one other thing that I'm sure the
investors appreciate is that as we go forward with all of these big projects and so on, these kind of things
is normal that it happens. It's just my request to the customers -- to the investors is please just don't
panic. I mean we will tell you what it is and make a judgment based on the facts rather than suddenly
other people who have always been saying that gasification doesn't work and then we say, Lu'An is shut
down, and they say, "Look, I told you so, this is it. This is the end of it. Nothing else is going to happen.
These guys are going through the wrong track." But again, as I said, we will always tell you exactly what
we know at the time we talk to you.
