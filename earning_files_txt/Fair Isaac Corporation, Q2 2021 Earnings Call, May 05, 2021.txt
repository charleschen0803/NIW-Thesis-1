Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac quarterly earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, May 5, 2021.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber, Vice President, Investor Relations and
Treasurer. Please go ahead.

Steven P. Weber
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's Second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve
Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO,
Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior
year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to
facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business.

Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve many uncertainties, including the
impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company's business, operations and personnel,
that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained
in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking statements
portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor
Relations team.

This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the
company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these
non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation
G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the
SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through May 5, 2022.

And now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'd like
to start by saying that I hope you are all safe and healthy. And I want to thank our dedicated FICO
employees who've done an exceptional job meeting the challenges of the last year and never wavering
in their commitment to FICO or their colleagues and our customers. We have a tremendous team, a
great culture at FICO, and I'm really honored to report that FICO was ranked #1 on Forbes annual list of
America's best midsized employers. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some
slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results, and
how we view our business at the midpoint of our fiscal year. And I'll discuss how we continue to refine our
strategy to optimize our Scores assets and sharpen our focus on our world-class decision management
platform.

We reported revenues of $331 million, an increase of 8% over the same period last year. We delivered $69
million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.33 per share up 18% and 20%, respectively. On a
non-GAAP basis, net income was $90 million, up 40%, and earnings per share of $3.06 was up 42% from
last year. We continued to deliver very strong free cash flow growth as well. Second quarter free cash flow
was a record $152 million, up 178% from last year.

I'm pleased to report that we continue to execute well against our strategic initiatives throughout the
company. As we've said for the last several quarters, we're continuing to migrate more of our business
toward a subscription-based model, including SaaS software subscriptions and term license subscriptions

for on-prem software. This strategic decision will provide a more representative view of the growth
trajectory of our business but it also gives us some difficult comparisons to last year when we had
significant upfront license revenues.

In our Applications segment, we delivered $130 million of revenue, down 8% from last year due to a 29%
decline in upfront license revenues and a 21% decline in Professional Services revenues. In our Decision
Management segment, we delivered $33 million of revenue up versus our Q1, but down 14% due to
reduced upfront licenses and lower services revenue. Transactional revenues in DMS were up 34%, and as
we continue to transition more of our software business to a recurring SaaS model. We continue to have a
lot of interest in this technology, and our pipeline contains more big deals, so we continue to gain traction
in this space. We remain committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics,
and we are focusing our resources to make that vision a reality.

On the Scores side, the business continues to perform very well. Scores were up 31% in the quarter
versus the prior year. On the B2B side, revenues were up 25%. There was continued strength in mortgage
originations, which grew substantially year-over-year and also sequentially. We'll see more difficult comps
in the back half of our year as it's now been a year since the refi boom began. Auto origination volumes
were fairly flat, but revenues were up versus the previous year.

We're continuing to see positive signs in cards and other unsecured loan activity. Volumes were still down
from last year but were higher than Q1. The price increases we instituted are starting to have an impact,
giving us revenue increases in pockets where volumes are weaker. On the consumer side, we continue to
drive impressive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 47% versus the same quarter last year. The growth of
myFICO.com is particularly remarkable, up 82% this quarter versus last year.

The continued strong demand is a testament to the quality of our offering and an understanding by
consumers that FICO is the Score that lenders use. Finally, as you know, today, we announced the
divestiture of our Collections and Recovery product line. Mike will provide some financial details in a few
minutes, but I'd like to explain the strategic rationale behind this move.

We're extremely focused on our strategic vision to enhance, expand and distribute the FICO Decision
Management platform. We believe we have an incredible opportunity to be a best-in-class leader in the
next wave of business analytic technology. In order to fulfill our potential, we need to make choices to
be able to allocate all the resources we can to the platform strategy. The FICO collections and recovery
products help customers make important decisions throughout the life cycle of collections and recovery.
These products deliver excellent functionality and serve an important customer need, but the complexity
of the underlying architecture makes it impractical to migrate to our platform, coupled with the need
for high-touch professional services engagements and customization it doesn't fit within our strategic
framework.

So as we did with our ESS divestiture and as we do with our China joint venture, we've chosen to sharpen
our focus and align our resources on our decision platform. I would like to thank the team that built and
delivered an industry-leading set of products and solutions that have helped our clients enhance our
Collections and Recovery efficiency, effectiveness and compliance. I want to assure the Collections and
Recovery customers that FICO and Jonas Software are committed to serving our clients without disruption
during this transition period. We're confident that Jonas Software will continue to invest in these solutions
and support our clients and colleagues with the same commitment and partnership they've come to
expect.

I'll have some final comments in a few minutes. But first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial
details.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our second quarter results in
more detail. And provide some information on the impact of the divestiture of the collection of recovery
products that we announced today. Revenue for the quarter was $331 million, an increase of 8% over

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

the prior year. Our Applications revenues were $130 million, down 8% versus the same period last year.
The quarterly decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in upfront on-prem license revenue
and professional services revenue. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q2 revenues were
$33 million, down 14% over the same period last year. We had an increase of 34% in SaaS subscription
revenue in the DMS segment, but that was offset by decreases in upfront on-prem license and services
revenue.

Now before turning to our Scores segment, I would like to remind you of the key moving parts that are
impacting our applications and DNP -- sorry, our DMS segment revenue. First, our on-premise license
revenues will continue to be negatively impacted as we move away from perpetual license sales to a
ratable subscription revenue model. Second, we have changed our revenue recognition assumptions for
on-premise license subscription sale. As a result, we now recognize less license revenue upfront, and we
recognize more revenue ratably over the term of the deal. The net impact this quarter was lower license
revenue on our applications and DMS segment of about $6 million versus what it would have been under
our prior methodology.

We anticipate the full year impact will be between $45 million to $50 million lower software license
revenue this year, all of which will be recognized in future periods. We expect an especially difficult year-
over-year license comparison in our fourth fiscal quarter, where last year, we booked more than $60
million in upfront license revenue under the prior methodology. As we pointed out in the past, this change
in timing will not have an impact on free cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license
sales over the term of each subscription contract.

Finally, as we explained last quarter, we are deemphasizing low-margin nonstrategic professional services
engagement, which is resulting in lower PS bookings and revenues. This is driven by our core strategic
goal of selling more high-value recurring revenue software. Professional services are a very important
component of our business model, providing installation and configuration services for our software
and advisory and consulting expertise that enables our customer to leverage the power of cutting-
edge analytics in their business. These parts of our professional services business are here to stay. The
reductions you are seeing in our services business are the result of our strategic decision to focus our
energies on these value-added services.

Now turning to our Scores segment, revenues were $169 million, up 31% from the same period last
year. B2B was up 25% over the same period last year, driven by continued high volumes in mortgage
originations as well as some unit price increases across our different score categories. In the B2B
business, we also had a royalty true-up and an annual license deal this quarter that had a small positive
impact on overall revenues. B2C scores revenues were up 47% from the same period last year, both
myFICO.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly.

This quarter, 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated
15%, and the remaining 6% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and
maintenance sources for the quarter represented 85% of total revenues, consulting and implementation
services revenues were 11% of total revenues, and license revenues were 4% of total revenue. SaaS
software revenues, not including related PS revenues, were $62 million for the quarter, up 8.8% from the
prior year.

Q2 bookings totaled $84 million, flat with the previous year. Those bookings generated $9 million of
current period revenues, a 10% yield. SaaS bookings, including the associated professional services were
$25 million for the quarter, down 19% from the previous year. Professional services bookings of $22
million were down 35% from last year. However, overall software bookings, excluding professional services
bookings were up 5% year-over-year.

We continue to see a strong pipeline for our software products, and we feel good about the bookings
outlook for the full fiscal year. But again, we do expect bookings to trend lower overall compared to
historical numbers as a result of our deemphasis of professional services sales and somewhat shorter-
term length of typical SaaS and on-prem term license contracts. As a side note, we remain committed
to providing our shareholders with more of the common metrics that subscription software companies
typically provide in order to give investors a better understanding of our software business. We continue to

work to extract and validate the necessary data, and we hope to be able to provide it sometime this fiscal
year.

Our operating expenses totaled $230 million this quarter compared to $218 million in the prior quarter,
which included a $7 million gain on sale of product line assets. Excluding that onetime gain, expenses
were up $5 million, primarily due to increased incentives expense. Compared to Q2 2020, operating
expenses were down $2 million. We do expect expenses to step up somewhat in the back half of the
year as we gradually redeploy the restructuring savings we incurred last year to add strategic headcount,
primarily related to the development of our decision management platform software. We also expect our
travel and entertainment expense to increase once we're able to resume in-person meetings with our
customers and colleagues.

Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 39% for the quarter, a margin
expansion of 700 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $69
million, up 18% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $90 million for the quarter,
up 40% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. We expect our
FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%, and we expect the net effective tax rate
for the year to be about 19%. That's prior to the impact of the divestiture of our Collection and Recovery
business. We do expect to book a taxable gain on the sale, and we will provide more details on that next
quarter.

Free cash flow for the quarter was $152 million compared to $55 million in the same period last year, an
increase of 178%. For the trailing 4 quarters, free cash flow was $461 million. At the end of the quarter,
we had $198 million in cash, up $53 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at $975 million
with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%.

Turning to return on capital. We bought back 441,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of
$466 per share. During the quarter, the Board -- the prior Board repurchase authorization was exhausted
and a new $500 million authorization was approved. At the end of March, we had about $470 million
remaining on that authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.

Finally, I'll walk through the expected impact of the divestiture of our collection and recovery products. As
Will said, we made the decision to divest these assets to increase our focus on our decision management
platform. The Collection and Recovery products we sold accounted for less than 10% of total company
revenues. Because they often involved significant PS engagement as much as half of total revenues, they
had a much lower margin profile than our platform products. There will be some noise in the next few
quarters as we work through the transition, but we expect that this divestiture will not have a significant
impact on our pretax income. We expect to close the deal sometime in our third fiscal quarter, and the
sales proceeds will contribute to the funding of a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program that
we plan to execute once the transaction closes.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we remain focused on our strategy and committed
to taking our Decision Management platform to a growing number of interested customers. At the same
time, we are innovating and providing our cornerstone value in Scores in both B2B and B2C. Finally, as
you know, we haven't provided guidance for this fiscal year, we still see a lot of volatility as we see the
global economy begin to open back up. We have tremendous confidence in our business model, but are
far more focused on providing long-term value than hitting specific numbers for the next few quarters. It's
those values that drive us to favor ratable subscription revenue over upfront license revenue. So for now,
we're not providing any formal guidance until we see how the credit markets stabilize, and we understand
the full year impact of our recognition of license revenues.

Now I'll turn the call back to Steve so that we can do some Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.

Gregory R. Bardi
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is actually Greg on for Manav. I think the divestitures you've made so far make a lot of sense when
you explain them. Just wondering if there's any smaller products left out there that could be candidates for
a similar treatment? Or from here, it's more about being selective in the contracts going forward?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I would say that this is pretty much the end of the reprioritization of our resources. So we don't see any
significant divestitures in our immediate future.

Gregory R. Bardi
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And historically, M&A hasn't been a big part of the story as you go through this process of
reprioritization and thinking about capital allocation, is there a potential for M&A to be a bigger part of the
story going forward?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I'd say that the potential in the future is about the same as the potential in the past. It's always been
there. And we've always had trouble finding anything that we find as attractive as investing in ourselves.
Our current plan is to deploy all of the proceeds from this transaction in stock repurchase.

Gregory R. Bardi
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And maybe last 1 for me. Just on the sales pipeline for the software business. I think you said
you're pretty bullish about what you're seeing. Any color by geography as we see different fits and starts
and reopening by geography, if there's any areas that you're seeing and more traction? Or any color there
would be helpful.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I'd say that South America is strong. But we're seeing signs of the economy waking up kind of across the
board. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

I guess what I would add is the nature of our sales on the software side are lumpy and long sales cycle for
the most part. And so month-to-month, even quarter-to-quarter changes in the ability of our customers to
have people in the office to meet face-to-face due to the pandemic and other things. It doesn't necessarily
show up with the same frequency that might for a company that had a shorter sales cycle and more
higher frequency, lower ticket sales. So pipeline that we see in the major regions we serve looks healthy,
all things considered in all regions. And I wouldn't be able to identify anything specific that would make 1
region or another standout.

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

And the next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.

Kyle David Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to talk a little bit about the expense trajectory. I know you guys said that you expect those
to go up a little bit next quarter, given some investments, particular on the DMS side. Does that outlook
include the transition of some of the costs associated with the debt collection business? Or how should we
think about kind of the expense trajectory and what transition costs and stuff you guys expect to occur?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

We'll be able to provide more -- can you hear me? Yes. Sure. So we'll be able to provide a little bit more
detail on that when we get to the closing. So stay tuned next quarter for any more specifics we're able to
share. In general, as we said in our remarks, we don't expect it to have a material impact on profitability,
which means that the expenses that we expect to remove are in the ballpark of the revenues that we are
selling. And furthermore, we do continue to believe that our expenses for the year relative to last year will
be about the same, if not down a little bit. So all the trends that we saw in our expenses, not including the
impact of collection recovery divestiture continue to play out, and we still feel good about the full year.

Kyle David Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just on the Scores business, the quarter came in very strong. Is
there any additional color you guys could give us on what drove some of that strength between some of
the recent pricing initiatives that you guys have taken versus just volume with some of the -- with healthy
credit markets and the strong B2C business?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I'd say it's more on the volume than on the pricing, although the pricing is trying to feather in as card
and some of the places where we put price increases in last year start to pick up in volume. So it's both,
but I tip to volume. And then I think the real strength -- mortgage continues to be strong. And the real
strength, I think, is B2C is just remarkable.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Question on the B2C. Can you provide a little bit of additional color? Obviously, you provided some
metrics, but the revenue growth sequentially was really strong after there was a temporary pause. Any
color in kind of what drove that? Was there additional marketing with your partners? Or we should be
thinking about maybe some seasonality in any outlook you can provide to that would be helpful.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

No. I -- I'd put it in 2 categories because the strongest part of it was myFICO. And I'd say it's attributable
to very strong execution. There's some seasonality, of course. But I'd attribute some of the strength to
very strong execution. And to consumer. I mean consumer is increasingly interested.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And what is the current mix between myFICO.com and your partner at this point in terms of the
B2C revenues?

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I'm not sure we break that out, Mike. I don't know that we disclosed that, do we?

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We don't disclose that, sorry.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then in terms of the special price increases that went into effect, if I believe I heard you
correctly, you talked about them feathering in at this point. So how should we think about -- are they
currently at the full run rate in this -- will they be at the full run rate in this quarter or maybe did half of
them hit last quarter, 2/3 of them? How should we think about that mix?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think you should think in terms of fully in, except that the volumes that they were applied, the
kinds of Scores they were applied to had lower volumes. And so as those volumes return, you'll see a little
more impact. But at this point, it's volume going forward.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And if I understand correctly, it was mostly on the card and auto side for the impact.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

It was spread around. There was card -- they were card increases.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And how far below normalized levels is card volumes at this point? Obviously, auto volumes have
fully recovered we can pretty much track mortgage volumes on a daily basis, but there's less insight into
card volumes. Any additional color you can provide there?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I really can't.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

I will say that we have seen sequential increases in cards, which you can also see from the results this
quarter of the card issuers and in the bureaus. So we're seeing the same trends they see. And overall,
across our categories, whether it's cards, auto or mortgage, the volume trends that we've seen are not
inconsistent with what you can see from the -- or some others who are in those businesses.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Caroline Conway with AllianceBernstein.

Caroline Conway

I'm curious about the implications of the divestiture on customer retention and the strategy for expansion
into new service areas with existing customers. It would seem to me to be beneficial to keep a relatively

full suite of financial services products available, especially as you look to drive DMS adoption, but that
may be overestimating the goal of this product line. So it would be great to get your thoughts on that's
strategic...

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

No, you're absolutely right. You're absolutely right that our customers -- we have many customers who
are customers of the Collections and Recovery product line as well as many other solutions that we
provide. And we've always believed that the broader suite of capabilities has high utility for our customers.
This is really -- and our customers won't suffer from them. So our customers are going to wind up with
continued tremendous support and innovation and investment in this product line from Jonas.

And we have a close relationship with Jonas. We'll be doing coverage together. So I don't worry very much
about whether our customers will be well taken care of because I'm confident that they will be well taken
care of. What it does do is it frees up the resources and investment for us to focus on the platform side
of the solutions that we provide to our customers. So no question that, that's the right place for us to be
focused.

Caroline Conway

Great. And just as a follow-up to that, are there any other components of the relationship with Jonas that
you're expecting to emerge? Are there any products that you're expecting to leverage from their side?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

No, it's really around Collections and Recovery. But then we have some parts of our -- of FICO that we'll
continue to operate in and near and around the Collection space. So for example, FICO advisors, will
continue to provide consulting advice around collections. But generally speaking, the business is turned
over to Jonas, and we'll make sure that the transition is seamless.

Operator

[Operator Instructions]. The next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

On myFICO, so recognize your brand strength, recognize that, that part of the market is doing well. In
terms of the branded paid channel, I guess, the indirect and some lead-gen players pulled back. I'm not
talking about your partners, I'm talking about alternatives in the market, pulled back at points over the
last year, which I think benefits the myFICO channel. Anything further you can say about execution, if its
changes in how you go about marketing or changes in product. I guess what I'm trying to get comfort with
is some sustainability of myFICO strength if some of those lead-gen partners start to lean back into the
market?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's a good question. And it's hard for us to say whether the impact is from them pulling back or
from our own excellent execution. What seems to be happening is there's a lot -- at least in my mind,
that there's a lot of appetite and interest in monitoring credit, particularly in times like these. And a very
natural place to go is myFICO.com. And as you know, we do actually relatively modest marketing around
it. But the brand is very strong. We have over 90% aided awareness in the FICO brand in the U.S. And
so it's not surprising that we've got a lot of attention there. I think we'll always be positioned -- we'll
always position ourselves as an innovation leader and having really robust and fully featured product.
And the premium -- we try to be the premium product in the marketplace as well as a bit of a lab for
experimenting with offerings that we then turn over to our partners and urge them to replicate.

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then just maybe any update on the uptake or usage of the Resilience Score index?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

It continues to be used and it's in test, essentially. We actually have quite a number of lenders who are
using it now. And so far, the feedback is very positive. We're not charging for it. It doesn't have any
revenue impact.

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Right, right, right. Okay. And then last, I get that we're going to get the new more typical software assess
reporting financial metrics later in the year. But just -- can you help us ring-fence like what is on strategy
revenue, like you talk about it, it feels to me like in several different ways. You have, I think, DMS, DMP,
there is the SaaS versions of different products, you gave us a metric ex professional services. So can you
just help us ring-fence what you're viewing as kind of like core on strategy and where it sits today?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Let me turn this over to Mike in just a minute to answer that question more fully. But what I would
say is everything that we have left in our portfolio is what we want to have in our portfolio. And it's a
combination of legacy products and our platform products. We've been in a process of migrating and
moving the capabilities from legacy products to the platform. And so increasingly, the new sales happen
on the platform, we consider that to be truly strategic. So platform sales are where we want to be lend
to self as well to lend and expand, lets our customers who leverage the platform for small incremental
investments, get a lot of incremental benefit. I mean there's benefits for FICO and for our customers on
the platform.

That said, we have a really large business of FICO Solutions that are in place, on-prem, some on the
cloud, but mostly on-prem, and we anticipate that those will be in use by our customers for many years to
come. And so we continue to invest in those. We will continue to maintain those. We'll continue to make
sure that our customers are getting the full benefit out of the investment that they made over past years.
And as they're ready to migrate to the platform, we'll be ready to take them there. But the business really
has both sides. And what you'll see is that the, call it, legacy solutions, the off-platform solutions, we're
not selling nearly as much of that going forward, and the energy is going into selling platform, but we'll be
supporting growth. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything?

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Jeff, look, as we think about how to recast our reporting to be more helpful to you and our
shareholders. The principles are -- the focus is on recurring software revenue, hence, are beginning to
shine more of a spotlight on the services revenue because those are declining not -- we're trying to make
them decline, but we're just trying to focus on the services that really add value and let them reach their
natural level in terms of revenue. The margin profile is not such that we generate a whole lot of value
out of the services directly. It has value to our customers and increase the stickiness and all that. But PS
revenue -- for PS revenue's sake is not something we're seeking. So our focus is on recurring software.
And so our metrics will help you see that more clearly.

Second is the apps versus DMS, distinction is less and less relevant. It's been in place for a long time
in our disclosure, but it's [ outlined ] in its usefulness. So we're likely to simplify and talk more about
software versus Scores as opposed to Application, Scores and DMS.

And then finally, the key -- the prime directive in our software business is platform, platform, platform.
And so we'll help you get better insight into what our platform revenues are doing and what's happening in

our revenues that are, I'll call them to-be platform, not yet, but on the road map. So those are the things
we're trying to achieve as we think about how best to expose it to you.
