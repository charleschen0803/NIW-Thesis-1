Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the KLA Corporation Fourth Quarter
Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead, sir.

Kevin M. Kessel
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome to KLA's fiscal Q4 2020 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of our June
quarter and outlook for the September quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive
Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.

During today's call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2020 that we released
today after the market closed in the form of a press release, shareholder letter and slide deck. All of these
documents can be found on the IR section of our website.

Today's discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless
otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings materials
posted on the KLA IR website.

Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events as well as presentations,
corporate governance information, including our quiet period policy and links to KLA's SEC filings,
including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments
today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC filings. Any
forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks,
and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ
significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.

As we mentioned last quarter, we are changing the format of these calls to provide deeper insights into
KLA and our business performance and also allow more time for Q&A. Beginning this quarter, we will
provide some highlights from our full prepared remarks, which can be found in the shareholders' letter
before beginning our Q&A session. I encourage you all to read the letter. It can be accessed on our KLA IR
website.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace.

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. On behalf of all of us at KLA, we hope you and your
families are safe and in good health. And we thank you for your continued interest and support of our
company.

In many ways, our performance in the June quarter once again highlights how the KLA operating model
and long-term strategic objectives provide a dependable framework to guide our execution and help us
consistently deliver on our commitments. Thanks to the dedication, engagement and perseverance of our
global workforce in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, KLA delivered strong
results in the June 2020 quarter.

Revenue and non-GAAP EPS each finished above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, demonstrating
strong consistent demand from our customers, exceptional execution by our teams and the enduring
strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model under today's extraordinary circumstances.

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

For my opening remarks today, I plan to touch on some of the key messages from our letter to
shareholders. I'll start with an update on our priorities related to COVID-19, touch on the industry demand
environment and then cover 5 highlights from the quarter before passing it to Bren, who will review our
financial highlights and our outlook.

In terms of COVID-19, we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our
employees, their families and our partners. Our action to date have been successful and effective as
reflected in our strong financial results in the first half of calendar 2020, but more importantly, in our
safety record to this point in this pandemic.

What's also important is that our worldwide teams have never lost sight of what our customers need. Our
teams have been exceptionally resourceful and committed to executing for our customers' most pressing
needs and challenges. Customer feedback has been outstanding, and KLA is consistently delivering on our
customer commitments.

Investment in the long-term remains an important priority for us during this time. We're confident that our
R&D investments will help ensure a bright future.

Now turning to the industry demand environment. Customer demand is strong. We ended the quarter
with our second highest level of quarterly backlog ever. In the June quarter, we saw broad diversified
strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control was above plan, multiple EPC
businesses set records and our services business achieved record installations. Today's environment
continues to accelerate many of the secular industry growth drivers that we outlined in our 2019 Investor
Day. Data center demand, 5G infrastructure, the revival of PC demand to support work from home, virtual
collaboration, remote learning and entertainment and gaming are driving an acceleration of the data era
that translates across end markets and industries.

We're also seeing this acceleration in our own business, adopting new digital productivity tools to improve
collaboration with teams and customers. We've also increased investment to accelerate digitalization of
our global enterprises. For example, in our services business, we're working closely with our customers to
expand remote service technologies to augment our in-country service and installations engineers.

There are 5 highlights that stood out the most during the past quarter. First, we saw continued strength in
foundry and logic in the June quarter, and our revenue forecast for the remainder of 2020 shows relative
balance between businesses from these customers. Business from memory customers is improving
somewhat in the second half of 2020 versus the first half, with higher business levels and more customer
breadth expected in the December quarter with that momentum continuing into 2021.

Second, KLA ended the June quarter with near record total company backlog, demonstrating momentum
in the marketplace across our portfolio. Newly launched products, such as the well-received eSL 10 e-
beam inspection platform helped drive our market leadership.

Third, our Services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and healthy
free cash flow generation once again this calendar year. The Services business set a record for system
installations in the quarter. We see robust service contract penetration, which has risen steadily from
the 70%-plus contract penetration to 75%-plus over the past several quarters and delivering a strong
recurring revenue stream. We're forecasting Service revenue growth in 2020, in line with our long-term
annual 9% to 11% target.

Fourth, the newly formed Electronics, Packaging and Components, or EPC group, delivered record results
in the June quarter and finished above our internal forecast. Within EPC, we achieved a key milestone
with the SPTS delivering record quarterly revenue of $100 million in the June quarter. We expect 2020
to be a year of double-digit growth for SPTS. PCB also had a record quarter, driven by improved market
positioning supporting 5G infrastructure and handsets. The strong results for EPC are coming about 18
months post the acquisition of Orbotech. We're very pleased to see the successful demonstration of our
strategic growth strategies bearing fruit. We're also on pace to achieve cost synergies from the Orbotech
acquisition above the original targets.

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our
shareholders, today, we announced our Board of Directors has approved the 11th consecutive annual
dividend increase. The increase raises our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.90 per share for an annual
run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. KLA's dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%
since inception.

Before I hand it over to Bren, let me summarize by saying KLA's focus on innovation and execution,
combined with market leadership and robust free cash flow, have helped us successfully navigate through
these challenging times. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand in our 2023 targets
remain firmly intact and will drive diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage that
positions our business to be even stronger and more resilient in the future.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Bren.

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Rick. KLA's June quarter results highlight both the soundness and strength of our ongoing
strategy. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership,
all while growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital
returns strategies.

Total revenue was $1.46 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, slightly above the midpoint of the
guided range of the quarter of 59% to 61%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.73, towards the high end of the
guided range of $1.81 to $2.87. GAAP EPS was $2.63.

Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment was modestly above expectations for the quarter.
Foundry was once again strong at approximately 50% of semiconductor process control systems, towards
the high end of the guided range for the quarter. Foundry was once again strong on at approximately
50% of semiconductor process control systems revenue. Logic was about 10% of semiconductor systems
revenue, and Memory customers were roughly flat at 40% in the June quarter. Within Memory, the
business was evenly split, about 50-50 between DRAM and NAND.

Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment was a record $100 million, up 18% sequentially
and 50% year-over-year and is on track for double-digit growth in calendar '20.

PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was also a record at $202 million, up 26% sequentially
and 10% year-over-year and above internal plans.

In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, total debt of $3.5
billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3
agencies.

From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $411 million in the June quarter. Free
cash flow conversion was 96.5%, and free cash flow margin was 28.2%.

For capital returns, over the past 12 months, we have returned $1.35 billion to shareholders or 83% of
free cash flow, including $522 million in dividends paid and $829 million in share repurchases. We believe
our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and
offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.

As Rick mentioned a moment ago, our Board approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase that
resulted in an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share.

As it relates to guidance for the September quarter, we would like to start out by saying that our
operations teams have done a great job of mitigating the supply chain challenges and disruptions related
to COVID-19, although we are carrying more inventory to mitigate unanticipated disruptions should
they occur. The extra measures we have taken to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical
components in our supply chain have definitely been effective, as demonstrated by KLA's strong results for
both our March and June quarters that either met or exceeded the midpoint of guidance ranges.

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

With that said, we are narrowing our guidance range as we generally see consistency in the current
operating environment. The demand profile today for the second half of the year is firming, and we now
anticipate that the second half will grow versus the first half of 2020. For the calendar year, we expect a
faster-than-market-growth year for our Semiconductor Process Control business and growth for the total
company in line with or above our long-term revenue growth target range.

With that, guidance for the September quarter is as follows: Total revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion
plus or minus $75 million. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as
product mix is more favorable versus the June quarter. The market reception to new product offerings in
our Semiconductor Process Control business has been strong, and as outlined at our Investor Day back
in September, the company has made solid progress on our plans of driving cost and efficiencies on new
product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide serve service infrastructure. Finally,
GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.18 to $2.82, and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of
$2.42 to $3.06.

In closing, we have adapted to a challenging environment. We are executing well and have even more
confidence that we are on track to meet our 2023 target model, both in terms of top line growth and
profitability. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides
our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across
an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology
leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns
to shareholders.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A.

Kevin M. Kessel
Vice President of Investor Relations
So Charlie, please provide the instructions for the queuing and begin the Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Solid job on the quarterly execution. Three months ago, the industry's supply chain as well as demand
trends looked pretty uncertain. You fast forward to today supply chain has come back. Semiconductor
fundamentals, while weak in June, are slowly showing signs of improvement entering the second half of
the year.

If I look at your results and guide and make some assumptions on this December, it looks like you'll
be towards the upper end of your pre-COVID-19 revenue outlook or sort of in that low double-digit
percentage revenue growth for this calendar year. First, is that a fair assumption, and maybe some
commentary on your WFE spending outlook today versus pre COVID-19 earlier this year?

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Harlan, it's Bren, and I'll go first here. So I think your conclusions are generally correct. As we said in the
prepared remarks, we see our view on the year to be generally within our long-term target growth range
of 7% to 9% or above. And so as we look at the year overall, I don't think things have changed all that
much. I mean you're right, there was always a lot that had to be done back in March and June in terms of
managing supply chain and supporting customers. But we worked through all that, and we've got some
consistency now in our overall view.

So in general, I would say that our views overall are virtually unchanged. On WFE, everybody counts it up
a little bit differently, but I would -- so I don't want to put a point number out there, but I would say that
somewhere in the mid- to high single-digit type growth, 55 -- or mid-50s to high 50s probably the right
way to think about it.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And you entered the June quarter, I remember, with the view of strong Specialty Semiconductor
trends, but maybe more muted trends within some of your other EPC segments, like PCB and Display,
as these are more consumer and sort of auto-focused -- automotive-focus segments for you guys and
probably more impacted by COVID-19. But you kind of delivered strong double-digit sequential and year-
over-year growth in the PCB, Display and Components Inspection business. So what drove these solid
trends? And how are you thinking about this particular segment as you move to the second half of this
year?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Thanks, Harlan. Really pleased with the performance in EPC. And I think you have to -- when you
think about the different divisions, we saw a strong continued momentum in packaging, and that's really
the ICOS business. We're also seeing SPTS, the Specialty Semi business, had a very strong showing, and
we mentioned that set a record there for revenue.

PCB was, earlier in the year looked like it was going to soften and it strengthened and driven a lot by
5G infrastructure build-out. And we feel really good about the execution of that team. Display is still in
a tough spot, and that's not one that really we saw a lot of strength. And we're following through on the
conversations we've had on display, where we're working on the cost structure and being positioned for
when the recovery happens there.

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

But I think the other businesses -- the other thing that's really notable is SPTS had a very strong quarter
in spite of no automotive business. So that's really upside as we go forward. And I think it's pretty fair to
say, automotive semiconductors have bottomed. And so we feel pretty good about -- it's pretty much all
up subside from here as the spending has heavily been curtailed, but it shows signs towards the end of
next year -- or this year and then into 2021, we'll see some resumption of investment as the electrification
projects continue.

So yes, we feel good about where we are with that. And we are definitely getting traction, having those
under one organization and engaging with customers at a high level.

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Harlan, it's Bren. The only other thing I'll add to that is as we go back to April, when we were thinking
about the quarter, it was unclear what the handset environment would look like in the second half of the
year. And so I think one of the encouraging signs that we did see, to Rick's point, was the PCB business
was really driven by 5G and the preparation for the handset introductions that are to come.

So that was a bit of a surprise for us or perhaps had some unknown built into it just related to overall
COVID. So it drove the SPTS business, as Rick said, but also drove incremental upside in PCB.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulation on the results. Bren, just on the gross margin guide into September, pretty good sequential
growth. I'm wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit. Is this a larger percent coming from the
Semi Process Control? Or is it mixed within SPC? And I guess, importantly, do you think that that -- the
June quarter and now growth into the September is a trend that you can sustain going forward? Or is this
kind of an anomaly quarter relative to mix?

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. John, so I would say that, yes, I mean, quarter-to-quarter, we're seeing sequential growth in Semi
PC. And so that's having a positive effect on gross margins.

And -- so I think that what we're seeing there -- I'm encouraged, as I said, in the shareholder letter, we
talked a lot about driving cost and efficiency improvements in new platforms. And customer reception has
been strong. So we feel pretty good about the product portfolio we have and the margin position.

So let me just say that I have more confidence around our margin trajectory moving forward. Although
quarter-to-quarter, the mix dynamic tends to be the biggest factor that drives our margin around this
range. But certainly, as we look forward, we feel pretty confident that we should be able to maintain this
sort of 61% above type trajectory that we're experiencing right now.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Helpful. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about second half of the calendar year growing over
the first half. I'm kind of curious if you could break that down between sort of Memory and Logic Foundry
and how might that have changed over the last 90 days. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it
sounds like maybe you're less optimistic about a memory uptick in the back half of the year and perhaps
more optimistic about Logic/Foundry sustaining. And if that's the case, any read as we go into calendar
year '21?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

Yes. We do see -- we think there's a lot of evidence that the Foundry Logic is going to hold through the
second half. And I think that also now we're getting indications of strength going into '21.

Part of the uncertainty, I think, around the year that everybody has is the Memory recovery probably
toward the end of the calendar year, and that's really where we would expect it in Q4 to strengthen there.
So that's, I think, maybe the less certain part of that.

But the setup for Logic looks really good. I think the progress that customers and designs and the ongoing
investment by our customers and multiple design wins and multiple proliferation of devices and multiple
players, so we're also getting breadth. And our products are doing really well. So we feel pretty strong
about how the Logic/Foundry is going to hold up.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I have 2 of them. Firstly, the weaker brand. Clearly, like 2 of your Logic and Foundry customers have
spoken about pushout of either the 7-nanometer or potentially even the 3-nanometer on the Foundry side.
With that backdrop, how do you think of KLA's Process Control revenue opportunity over the next year or
2, given that some of the leading edge nodes are getting pushed out? And then I have a follow-up.

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes. There's really nothing that's been discussed publicly that hadn't been the way we've been factoring
and forecasting our business. It's pretty much consistent with what we've seen. I think some of the public
announcements are catching up with some of what was going on.

But you have to look at why there are delays, when there are delays. And the delays tend to come from
-- it's much more an inability to execute than it is the demand. There's plenty of demand at the leading
edge. It's the challenges associated with yield management, with process control, with the overall process
integration, and those are factors that we're heavily involved in. So we think that there's a lot of continued
momentum for us in process control, both metrology and inspection on the leading nodes. And so we --
that's part of why our earlier comments in the last Q&A question were about the strength that we see
through the calendar year and then into '21. So we feel pretty good about how that's going.

And I think our -- in partnership with our customers, we're helping them work through some of the most
challenging metrology and defectivity issues, some of which, frankly, they did not anticipate but we did.
And we've been showing some value and getting adoption as a result. Does that make sense?

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes, yes, that does. And then just to follow-up on the product side. You guys introduced a pattern wafer
e-beam inspection to [ help ] semicon. I'm just trying to figure out is your e-beam tool still focused on
defect detection? Or are you still looking at patent facility or voltage contract? And your competitors are
going to, like, multi-beam tools. You guys are still at single beam. So I just want to figure out the e-beam
road map.

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes. So what we wanted to make sure is that we could provide differentiated performance for -- to address
the market gaps that existed and that we could provide customers a complementary solution along with
their optical tools, because what they're really trying to balance is how do they get all the characterization
understanding and product development that they've been looking for out of the portfolio.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

So we have some unique capabilities in our e-beam inspection tool. We think that the coverage it provides
and the uniqueness, in addition to the fact that it's closely coupled with our optical tools, gives a very
strong advantage to our customers by using them in parallel. And that's what we're seeing.

We have mapped out and we have a lot of confidence that we understand what the road maps look like in
terms of the different e-beam architectures, and we feel very confident about our ability to be competitive
in e-beam. We wouldn't have reentered the market if we didn't feel like we had a differentiated solution.

And so that's the ability both define the defects of interest and define them as throughputs that are
compelling for our customers. And we -- as we map out the future, we don't see any gap between us and
competitors. In fact, we see that we have the ability to continue to differentiate our solution.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide a little more color on your prepared comments
regarding memory and greater breadth of spending into Q4 and then beyond into 2021. Would love to
hear kind of what you're hearing in dialogue with customers there.

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. C.J., it's Bren. So I mean, judging by our percent of business for the September quarter that's
Memory, it's lighter than in June. So most of what we see in the second half. And this was one area where
it wasn't all that clear if you back up 3 months ago and say, okay, we thought we'd see some Memory
recovery in the second half of the year, wasn't exactly sure when we'd see it.

But as we -- so it looks like it's more December focus. And it -- I would say, it is probably heavier on the
flash side, although there is fluidity in terms of how customers are thinking about those investment plans.

But I think you can look at all the players that are out there that we would expect to see business start to
improve in that time frame. And then I think there's solid momentum as we move into next year.

I don't want to provide color on '21. But I think as we take a step back and look at where memory has
been, I mean starting in the middle of 2018, we've seen a pullback in very disciplined management
of memory capacity and most of the investment focused on technology transition. So as that market
continues to recover, I think that the market is in a pretty healthy place overall as we move into '21.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful. As my follow-up, for the PCB Display and Component business, including Service, how are
you thinking about second half calendar year versus the first half? And then as part of that, how should
we be thinking about the seasonality in terms of peak quarter, Q3 versus Q4, given how dominant PCB is
within the construct there?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes. SPTS, I would -- it potentially could be flattish half-to-half. We'll have to see how it plays out. I
think PCB's second half will be slightly -- will probably be lower in the second half. Given what's driven
the strength we saw in the June quarter, I would expect a lot of focus on execution as we move into the
second half there.

On the flat panel business, I wouldn't expect much to change on that front. It is 100% consumer-focused.
There's virtually no LCD investment out there. And so there's a fair amount of digestion of that capacity

that's still being worked through. So I don't expect any growth. In fact, maybe second half might be flat to
modestly down in that business.

Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel.

J. Ho
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Congrats on the nice quarter. Just maybe following up C.J.'s question about the memory spend and timing.
Typically, Memory is a little bit more metrology-biased versus, say, Logic and Foundry being a little more
inspection-biased. Is there any difference on the timing of your tool deliveries? Because -- what I'm trying
to get at is inspection tends to lead some of the process tools, but metrology may come in conjunction
with process tools. So am I looking at that correctly? Or are there still "lead times" in terms of metrology
shipments relative to process tools?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

It's a good question. Certainly, metrology -- certain parts of metrology like in film measurement and
overlay, tends to scale with capacity, but you also have unpatterned inspection that scales also with
capacity.

On the pattern inspection side, it tends to be a little bit more front-end in terms of just the development
process itself. So -- now I think from a lead time point of view, I don't think the lead times on the products
are all that much different, a few months or so. But generally, that's how it plays out.

J. Ho
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And maybe, Bren, as a follow-up, in terms of the OpEx management, you probably
have gotten some savings over the last several months due to COVID-19 and the diminishing of travel and
things of that nature. As we get back to a more "normalized environment", how do you balance some of
the increases that will come from that versus these attractive OpEx levels that you're achieving today?

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's a good question. And we're probably operating right now $10 million to $15 million below what I'd
consider to be normalized run rates. We certainly wish we could add people faster, both in terms of new
heads but also replacement headcount. And so this situation has slowed us down from that perspective.

So I think if you just look at overall spending levels today relative to revenue, we're sizing the company in
that $380 million to $385 million range. I mean ultimately, the way we're going to run the company over
the long-term is to drive a 1.5x drop-through, 1.5x to revenue growth rate drop-through to earnings. And
so that implies 40% to 50% incremental operating margin. So for every incremental dollar of revenue,
we're probably going to increase costs $0.10 to $0.15 or so. So that's the way to -- if our incremental
gross margins are above 60%. So it's a way to think about it.

So we're going to look at the opportunities to invest. We always invest in our portfolio. It's why our market
share is almost 5x our nearest competitors. Why we introduce products faster than our competitors is that
we want to make sure we've got the best products out there, and we continue to innovate. And so we're
going to look at the opportunities first and foremost and then size over time, consistent with our long-term
model.

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So Bren, I guess my first question is on the Process Control revenue, so [ I think it was ] down in June.
And I know that there was maybe some difficult comps because of the Q4 last year. But WFE in the first
half of this year is definitely up and your Process Control Shipments have been down in March and June.
And -- but it sounds like you think that you're going to, at least, keep up with WFE for the year. So that
would imply a pretty big back half of the year, given what's happened here in the first half. Can you maybe
hold our hand a little bit and tell us why you seem to have lost like a little bit of share in the first half
and maybe why Process Control will be up so much? And maybe help us gauge how much will it be up in
September? Are you talking 10% to 15% Q-on-Q? And then I have a follow-up.

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

So Tim, we don't really look at WFE spend half-to-half here. I just look at overall expectations and the way
we laid out the year at the beginning of the year, and we're mostly in line with the plan that we had. And
against the backdrop of, let's say, WFE levels that are mid single-digit growth for the year, I would expect
our Process Control Business to outperform the market.

So as I said earlier around, since it's such a big part of our business that we would expect it to be within
our target revenue range for the year, slightly above Process Control. That statement is consistent for our
Process control segment as well.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Bren, I guess just on...

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

I would expect it to be up half-to-half.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And I guess just on that point, can you give us a sense for where you think it will be in September?
And then I guess my follow up was you didn't repurchase any shares in the quarter, which is kind of
interesting. Why not?

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

So Tim, we guide the overall company, and we manage and deploy resources across all of our businesses
to meet our expectations. And so I don't want to guide the Semi PC business. But in terms of just overall
expectations, I'd expect that business to grow mid-single digits versus the June quarter.

But that being said, if I've got strength in other parts of the company and -- I may deploy resources in a
different way that helps us sort of manage to our overall numbers. But at the end of the day, what we're
really trying to do is drive to our expectations and to continue to ship and support customers according to
their timing.

But I would expect a mid-single-digit, sort of, quarter-to-quarter growth in that segment.

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

I think, Rick or Bren, you mentioned some signs of foundry demand perhaps sustaining into next year.
I was hoping if you could give us some more color because I think consensus seems to be that foundry
demand could actually -- possibly decline next year.

And I realize it's early, but from what you see today, is it possible that foundry demand could actually be
positive next year?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes, it's really early for next year. But what we do see is multiple customers making investments in
foundry. And so far this year, it's been largely a smaller group. So one.

And so the expansion of that is really -- and the conversations we've been having and the commitment
to that is what gives us the confidence for the second half of the year. And then the follow-on projects
that are coming after that are what we think it's a good setup for 2021. But obviously, there's a long time
between now and then.

But I think the notion that there is success of the advanced nodes, that you have the 5G infrastructure
building out, you have a lot going on in the advanced computing and high-performance computing, along
with the work towards AI, is all very positive for what we're seeing in terms of the continued investment
in Foundry and Logic. And a lot of that is driven by the additional capability people are getting from the
advanced nodes. So that's what gives us confidence to that plus the conversation since we're having, and
our challenge in meeting some of the slot demands through the rest of the year just to keep up with what
customers are talking about needing. And we have pretty good ways of judging their actual intent.

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

There are also a number of projects in China that are IoT, RF sensor-focused. And so it's made Foundry
a higher percentage of the mix overall this year, and we would expect some sustainability in that as
we move into next year. So to Rick's point, there's a fair amount of diversification really across all end
markets. We would expect automotive and industrial, those areas, which sort of fits back with the China
statement or more trailing edge, to be better next year.

And there's enough end market demand at the leading edge that's driving incremental customer
investment and mitigating reuse and so on. So I think the setup, as we continue this year and for the rest
of the year but also as we move into next year, looks pretty good.

There was a question earlier, Tim's question on share repurchase. I just want to spend a second on it.
So we -- as we started the quarter, we focused on overall liquidity and wanted to see how the market
shaped out, given all the unknowns on COVID. So as we progress through the quarter, we did pause our
share repurchase plan. We did buy back a fair amount of shares in the March quarter. And I would expect
that we'll start our capital allocation program. We'll begin at this quarter, again, at least around share
repurchases, and should finish the year in line with our objective of returning at least 70% of the cash flow
we generate to shareholders. So I would expect this year to be above that baseline.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And if I could ask a quick follow-up. There are 2 big trends going on. So TSMC appears to be
getting stronger. So there are fewer, perhaps high-end leading edge customers to go after. And then there
is also this trend of more sovereign manufacturing, which I understand is probably the same demand, but
may be scattered across more places that could cause some cyclicality. And I don't know -- how do you
think KLA is positioned when there are fewer leading edge foundry customers?

And then if there is more software and manufacturing, does it shift more of the spending towards your
competitors, who are exposed more to capacity rather than to technology shifts or yield improvement?
Just how do these 2 big trends play out for KLA over the next few years?

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I wouldn't say they are fewer. So I think if you look at leading edge investment and, certainly, our
expectations for what we've seen in this business and what we expect going forward is -- to Rick's earlier
point, is no correlation between any of the announcements or conjecture that's in the marketplace versus
what we're doing internally. So we feel very good about the leading edge adoption that's out there.

And I think that as you see the end markets adopt, I think that that deploys more capacity. And with
foundries, if foundries are providing more of that capacity, then that tends to be a higher process control
intensity, and as those customers have to deliver a lot of yielded product to tight market windows. So we
feel pretty good about that. There's a lot of end demand and there's specific designs for that demand. And
so I think on the trailing edge side, there is some start-up costs for new projects or maybe inefficiency
in the market. But over time, they're building to specific markets. And you might see some trading of
capacity there. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about the leading edge environment, particularly
end demand, but also the technology scaling that's now happening with EUV.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

In the past, you've talked about opportunities for higher metrology intensity at NAND flash at higher layer
counts. So I'm just curious, as we go into this next Memory spending cycle, relative to the past cycle,
how should we think about just your opportunity there for kind of peak cycle revenues relative to the last
cycle?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes. I'll take the first part, and then Bren can fill in the number, thinking -- it is true, Joe. I mean what
we've seen in -- 2 things. One, as the design rules have -- or the design complexity has pushed both in
flash and, of course, in DRAM, that does create more opportunity. In some cases, the opportunity was
already there, what was missing from us was necessarily a solution. So part of it was having the capability
and tools to support the advanced node and the needs, and that's something that we're pretty happy with
in terms of -- as we laid out in the past, our ability to drive up process control intensity in Memory. And
we've already seen the first part of that. So we feel validated in that approach.

The other thing that's interesting, and we didn't necessarily know is going to happen, but on DRAM, the
introduction of EUV for DRAM driving more defectivity needs and capability and the usage of that. So there
are some really positive trends in terms of driving process control intensity well above what it was in the
past for Memory. We really went backwards when the first move to NAND was first introduced because
they went back a couple of design rules. And now they're back moving forward. We have some product
capability. We've learned how to solve some of these problems, and we're engaged closely with customers.
So we feel good about the progression of process control intensity as the design rules continue to move
forward -- the technology nodes continue. It's not just design rules, as you know, but the challenges in the
increased number of layers. So Bren, from a standpoint of the numbers?

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think we've seen process control share of WFE increased 2 to 3 points from the transition from
planar NAND to vertical NAND. To Rick's point, we do have some new products in the pipeline that if these
products are effective and can be deployed in multiple units across fabs, give us an opportunity to improve
that intensity higher, both in terms of metrology with some x-ray capability that we're working on, but also
if we can help solve the defectivity challenge and defects within the stack and locating defects within the

depth dimension of the stack. So there is no shortage of opportunities, and I think we've seen it improve
so far, and we look to see a little bit of improvement moving forward.

On the DRAM side with the introduction of EUV, there is infrastructure for EUV, whether it's one layer or
more, you still have to have a reticle inspector. To be able to qualify reticles, you have to qualify blanks
and then, of course, you have to do print check to validate reticle fidelity in the fab itself. So there's also
infrastructure investment that needs to happen to support EUV in the DRAM side.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to clarify in your prepared remarks, you talked about the new U.S.
restrictions. Is there a change in that at all relative to what you talked about last quarter in terms of -- I
think, in the prepared remarks, you talked about it's difficult to predict the near-term dynamics related to
those.

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Well, it was. And we had to go through the exercise as did our peer companies of determining whether or
not we were -- how to be compliant with the regulations. And I think all the peer companies have gone
through that exercise, and we've been able to navigate that. As we said, we're going to obviously follow
the law. It was just -- there was some uncertainty as to what exactly -- how to interpret it. So we've had
the benefit of working through those details and feel like we've moved on from that.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Joseph Lawrence Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your business in China. It's been pretty stable as a percentage
of revenues. How is that mix shifting between multinationals and China sovereign, kind of, customers? And
what are you seeing specifically from China sovereign customers?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

We're seeing growth this year. So you've got the pieces that are part of PCB and display. So my growth
statement is more WFE-centric. But I would expect it to be up 20% or more. So I think WFE levels in
China, for the native China customers, are -- is probably somewhere in the $9 billion to $10 billion range.
So it certainly is growth this year, and it's more foundry, and I would call it infrastructure-centric.

5G-exposed on an annual basis?

Richard P. Wallace

as you point out, we've got good exposure. We've got good products to serve those customers. And we

feel like that's -- this is early days for the 5G build-out. So we think there's continued opportunity there as
we go forward.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. And then, Rick, there was a questions earlier

on delay at the U.S. logic maker. Longer term, I see you have better exposure to foundry versus that
logic maker based on your 10-K. Is that shift of capacity from the U.S. logic maker to Taiwan foundry
potentially neutral for your logic opportunity or modest positive?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

It's really hard to say. I mean I think part of what we've experienced over time is that there are customers
that, historically, we've seen a high correlation between their ability to stay on the leading edge and their
engagement and investment in KLA process control equipment.

So what we're seeing now is people that feel like they're needing to catch up are investing more to do
that. But I think it's pretty clear. If you want to stay on the leading edge of logic and foundry and you
don't have the ability to fully understand, in the learning cycles in the fab, you're going to struggle. So
anybody that's trying to get into a lead or maintain a lead ends up changing their investment profile.
That's why -- what's really good for us is people that want to do advanced node technology because they
need to invest.

And so I would say that if it moves, it's because that they've struggled. And if they want to be successful,
then they end up investing more. So I think that what's really good for KLA is advanced nodes, and the
desire people have to support them.

I think -- and as you know, in a foundry, especially a multiproduct foundry, the other challenge they have
is their multiple process flows. So it also is a challenge for inspection and metrology to be able to support
so many flows because all the designs aren't all going through the same process flow.

So we generally feel really excited when we see the large number of increasing designs at advanced
nodes. That's what's really, really been encouraging.

The other thing on the sustainability of it, just the one thing we would have wondered earlier this year was
if we were to see utilization in the fabs of logic and foundry, go down, and we haven't. So we feel pretty
good about the sustainability of the investments across the board.

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Well, we installed a record number of tools in the June quarter. And so we feel very good about that on the
circumstances and being able to transition to more localized teams to handle the installation requirements
for our tools. And of course, our guidance for the September quarter contemplates those plans.

KLA CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2020

Overall, service has been -- has done extremely well. Rick talked about utilization rates at Foundry and
Logic. We've also seen very strong utilization rates in Memory, which is another indicator of health of the
market.

So we feel pretty, pretty good about all of that. We think we're going to grow our long-term growth rate
expectation. Annual growth rate expectation for service is 9% to 11%, and we think we'll be in our target
range. And because of the scale that we're now able to drive and some of the investments we've made
over the years, in China in particular, but also in Taiwan and Korea and so on, we're able to drive more
economies of scale in our profit structure as well.

So that's -- it's a pretty good situation right now for service, and I think we've adapted pretty well, and
we're trying to leverage some of the remote capability tools that are out there today for us to position this
business from an efficiency and support point of view even better going forward.

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes. I'll just add to that. I mean our service guys are really heroes. Service guys and gals this last quarter
and this year, they've done an amazing job.

When we look at all our customers, even back in Wuhan during the early stages of this crisis, the only
people that were going anywhere inside of fabs were our service guys. And they were there to support
our customers. And so often with our customers, when they don't want to have visitors of any kind, the
exception is service because they want to keep these fabs up and running.

So really, it's been remarkable to see the resiliency of that. And as Bren said, the long-term trend looks
good. And this year, we feel really good about services ability to hit the targets we set out pre-COVID for
them. So we feel really good about that.

Blayne Peter Curtis
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Then I just want to ask on the recovery you're targeting in Memory. Just kind of curious, on the DRAM
side, it was going to be a late year. I was just curious if that's part of any of the recovery you're targeting.

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

I think DRAMs a little bit -- I think Flash is better. As I said earlier, I think Flash is better in the second half
of the year and that DRAM is probably stronger in the first half of the year overall. But I mean, again, that
can move around a little bit, but that's how we see it right now.

the inspection side of your business, where I think you guys are pretty well entrenched.

Richard P. Wallace

different regions to have supply base.

So there's never been a lack of interest and motivation. That happened in Japan, of course. That
happened in Korea. Not quite as much in Taiwan, but definitely happened in China. So for sure, there is
interest and desire to have their own capability.

But like -- as you know, this business, that's -- the impetus on us is to keep driving performance capability
and making sure we're competitive so that more like -- kind of more compelling so that we win that
business.

But yes, of course, there is interest in trying to have alternatives other than U.S. But I think the practical
business of running semiconductors is you've got to be competitive on a worldwide basis, and so you've
got to have the capabilities to compete worldwide. And that's always been our belief is we have to win
overall because any opportunity any region has to go with another solution, they're going to do it. So we
don't see that as particularly different than it's been in the past.

Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

And a quick follow-up for Bren, just a nice gross margin guide in September. Wondering if there are any
in lingering COVID-19 costs that are still affecting the gross margin possibly in the freight, and logistics
shipping would be one area.

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I don't think it'll -- there are, and I don't think it will change in the September quarter and probably
not in the December quarter. So there is a bit of a headwind there, about 40 basis points last quarter. And
so the revenues were up a little bit, so a similar impact.

Well, this quarter, they're already factored in the margin guidance. So yes, I think as we start to
normalize, whenever that might be, we'll start to -- we'll get a tailwind from increasing competition in the
freight market overall. But yes, inbound freight is -- costs have gone up there.

the revenue related to 3 data peers?

you get the buildout. And we also have some of the -- as Bren mentioned earlier, we have a fair amount of
logic that's trailing that continues to be the investment.

But on leading edge, sure, we'll see early -- and already in those conversations about that early capability.
And that will be of course, our leading edge tools. Not as many early on, but that's really in the debugging
phase of that.

And I would expect -- to follow-on there, I would expect broader levels of investment into the first half of
next year. The breadth that we talked about this year, we expect some continuation of that into next year.
So a lot of compelling opportunities for a number of players in the foundry and logic space.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. And maybe my follow-up to -- a follow-up question. Historically, you see Process Control strength
early in the process and then it phase once the products are involving production. Do you expect this
pattern to continue? Or do you see more sustainable strength through tech transitions going forward given
what you talked about earlier about the dynamics happening in the memory market?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

It really -- it is true. I mean that trend is true. It's especially true when there's fewer -- there's less
innovation. I think the difference now on the leading edge is what EUV has done, is brought back scaling.
And so that was really more pronounced in a period where we had that long gap where there was no EUV.
There was not another lithography technology for several years. And so that really exacerbated that trend.

So the 2 other factors now, you've got additional designs, which is kind of a surprise from where maybe
the world was a while ago. And then you have multiple players trying to -- so the phase of that is
different, where you have different players trying to cut in. And since there's a leader and then the other
folks are behind, that gives another wave at a different location.

So I think the net of all that is it tends to be more sustainable. Plus, we have more products that are
more tied to production. An example would be overlay, which is much more correlated to production
and the number of layers that get measured at overlay doesn't really decrease that much now given the
challenges. So you don't have that same reduced sampling and reduce the number of tools in some of
these product areas as we might have had in the past.

Kevin M. Kessel

Operator, I think we have time for one last question.

Operator

We have a question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Market.

Weston David Twigg
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just -- there was something you said earlier that really resonated with me for KLA, which -- that is more
process [ that helps ], which intuitively makes sense on the foundry side. You see more chips, more AI,
special 5G chips, chips going into different things, things that are all sort of custom. Can you help us think
about how that provides uplift for KLAC overall over the next few years?

Richard P. Wallace
President, CEO & Executive Director

Yes. Sure. I mean think about the worst-case scenario for us is there's 1 device made by 1 person, right?
And they dial that process in and they lock it in for 3 years, and they don't change anything, right? That
would be the worst-case because, as you know, what they really want to do is dial in the process, get
everything under control and have it be just ramp and then not pay any attention, let the thing run, have
all the CPKs in line.

So the other end of that continuum is lots of process designs. What's interesting about foundry is they
don't force one process. In fact, part of their selling proposition is you have multiple process flows through
a foundry. So if you look -- you can publicly go do this and look at TSMC. You can pick tons of different
process flows, which that means is the large number of change.

center people designing their own chips, because they want to have an advantage in their own design. So
you have a lot of customers, we have -- our customers' customer traditionally is far greater than it used
to be, which is why there's so many designs happening at advanced nodes, when the view was, at some
point, that it was going to keep restricting the number of designs.

That's not what's happened. So that creates more and more flow of process and change, and the need to
manage that is all upside. So we're really excited when we started seeing the number of relevant designs
become more and more successful because that's a factor that favors process control in order for people
to be successful at producing those. Does that make sense?

Bren D. Higgins
Executive VP & CFO

I think he's gone.

Operator

We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to the presenters.

Kevin M. Kessel

Okay. We wanted to thank everybody for their time and interest, and this concludes the call. Charlie,
please provide final instructions.
