THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to The Home Depot Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As
a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.

Isabel Janci
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear,
Chairman and CEO; Ted Decker, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions.
Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to get to your
question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387.

Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations
made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is
provided on our website.

Now let me turn the call over to Craig.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Isabel, and thanks for joining our call this morning. We hope that you and your loved ones are
safe and healthy.

As we announced yesterday, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HD Supply, a leading
national distributor of maintenance, repair and operations products in the multifamily and hospitality end
markets. Before moving to the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to discuss how HD Supply
fits into our strategic framework.

As you know, the MRO customer is an important Pro customer for the Home Depot. We are committed to
better serving the MRO customer and growing in this space. The success we've had with our existing MRO
business makes us confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth in a highly fragmented $55 billion
MRO marketplace. While the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals, I look forward
to welcoming the HD Supply associates to The Home Depot. Richard will take you through the financial
details shortly.

Now let's discuss our third quarter results. Sales for the third quarter grew $6.3 billion to $33.5 billion,
up 23.2% from last year. Comp sales were up 24.1% from last year, with U.S. comps a positive 24.6%.
Diluted earnings per share were $3.18 in the third quarter.

The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for The Home Depot as we saw the continuation of
outsized demand for home improvement projects. Our results were driven by broad-based strength across
the store and geographies.

All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the company
average, and Mexico posted its best performance since the onset of the pandemic with double-digit comps

in local currency. As Ted will detail, both tickets and transactions were up double-digit in the quarter, and
we saw strong double-digit growth from both the Pro and DIY customers.

As we mentioned last quarter, the step change in volume of business that we have witnessed over the last
6 months is not without its challenges, but our strategic investments, coupled with our near-term actions
taken, have allowed us to better serve our customers. Our third quarter performance is a reflection of this,
and as we continue to learn and adapt to meet the unprecedented level of demand we are seeing in the
market.

Actions we have taken across our supply chain, in our stores and in partnership with our suppliers have
helped us to improve in-stock levels, reduce lead times, better manage in-store replenishment and
improve fulfillment options and delivery times. All of this has ultimately translated to over 300 basis points
of sequential improvement in customer satisfaction scores for the third quarter.

Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have continued to support
record-level web traffic on a consistent basis for over 6 months. Sales leveraging our digital platforms
increased approximately 80% versus the third quarter last year, and approximately 60% of online orders
were fulfilled through a store. We continue to invest in our digital assets, introducing new capabilities and
different ways to engage with The Home Depot.

Over the past several months, we have refreshed the digital experience in key categories and are
extremely pleased with the customer response. In decorative lighting, for example, we enhanced the
category experience to offer improved visual imaging and more lifestyle photos of our on-trend lighting
assortment. As a result of these changes and increased marketing effort to better highlight our offering,
we have seen significantly higher customer engagement with the category online, which helped to drive
sales growth above the company average in the quarter.

We also found new ways to leverage our online platform to better showcase our assortment for events. For
our Halloween event, we increased our digital offering and enhanced our presentation, which resonated
with our customers, resulting in the strongest customer response we've had to these events.

We are focused on continuing the momentum of our strategic investments to enhance the interconnected
shopping experience and position ourselves for continued share capture over the long term. Key
components of our One Home Depot strategy, such as opening various supply chain facilities, technology
investments and enhancements to the digital experience, remain on track. And we have now restarted
many of the store investments that were paused at the onset of the pandemic.

Our results through the first 9 months of the year clearly indicate that for many customers, the home
has never been more important. And we hear from them that they will continue to invest in home
improvement through a multitude of different projects and plan to embrace the upcoming holiday season.

As customers engage with The Home Depot, we see a continued blend of both the physical and digital
worlds. As a result, the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One
Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant.

I'm incredibly proud of our associates for the many ways that they have lived our values by serving our
customers, communities and each other during these unquestionably challenging times. Our ability to
grow the business by more than $15 billion through the first 9 months of the year while navigating the
global pandemic and supporting our communities through multiple natural disasters is a direct result of
our associates' extraordinary efforts.

Given the ongoing demands and complexity of the current environment, we continue to focus on taking
care of our people, in part by extending weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution
centers for the duration of the third quarter. Through the end of the third quarter, we have spent
approximately $1.7 billion on temporary pay and benefits in response to COVID-19.

As Richard will discuss, we have now made the decision to transition from our temporary weekly bonus
program to invest in permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. This
will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental compensation expense on an annualized basis. Our

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

orange-aproned associates are the heartbeat of The Home Depot, and supporting them through this time
of uncertainty and beyond continues to be a key priority.

We know that we must remain agile and flexible to execute against the demands of the current
environment. And our third quarter performance highlights key progress that we have made as we
continue to learn and adapt. I could not be more proud of the resilience and strength that our associates
have continued to demonstrate, and I want to thank them and our supplier partners for their hard work
and dedication to serving our customers and communities.

And finally, I want to take a quick moment to congratulate Ted, Ann-Marie and Jeff, who are on the call
with me today, on their recent promotions and expanded responsibilities. Their new roles are among a
number of leadership development moves that we have made as we continue to invest and grow the deep
bench of talent that we are fortunate to have here at The Home Depot.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ted.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank all of our associates and supplier partners for
their incredible effort to serve our customers in this unprecedented environment.

The consistently strong demand we've seen over the last 6 months has been remarkable. For the
last 2 quarters, we have seen comps north of 20% for 25 of the 26 weeks. The strong demand has
pressured supply chains, and we partnered with our supplier partners to make various improvements.
As we mentioned last quarter, the actions we took include adjusting our assortments and planograms,
introducing alternative products and, in some cases, reducing the number of SKUs in certain categories to
focus on the highest demand products.

In addition, we are further recognizing our rapid deployment center network that now implemented
mechanized floor loading in 2/3 of our facilities, meaningfully improving our productivity in those
buildings. As a result of all these actions, we have seen reduced product lead times and continued
improvement in our in-stock positions. The in-stock level in our U.S. stores has improved for 12 straight
weeks. While we are pleased with these results, we are not at prepandemic levels.

We have also revisited customer fulfillment choices, some of which we paused earlier in the year. As
a result, we are starting to reestablish premium delivery windows and expressed car and van delivery
service that covers over 70% of the U.S. population.

During the third quarter, each of our merchandising departments posted double-digit comps led by
our lumber and decor and storage departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10% and comp
transactions increased 13%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by the
continuation of project demand we saw in the second quarter, customers trading up to new and innovative
items as well as inflation in certain commodity categories like lumber.

Over the last 4 months, we've seen significant volatility in the pricing of lumber as the industry works
to balance supply and demand. During the third quarter, the average price of framing lumber was
approximately 130% higher than the same period last year. As we exited the quarter, pricing for certain
lumber categories had fallen from the peaks we saw mid-quarter but still sit well above the levels we saw
this time last year. Despite this significant inflation, we saw strong double-digit comps in lumber in the
third quarter.

During the third quarter, inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket
growth by approximately 260 basis points. Additionally, the strength of our comp transaction growth was
driven by consistently strong in-store and online transactions, continuing the same trends we saw in the
second quarter.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

During the third quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 23%.
We saw strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring
and lumber.

During the third quarter, we saw double-digit growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. And while DIY
sales grew faster than Pro sales, our Pro business posted the strongest growth we've seen all year.

As we look at our different Pro cohorts, growth with our smaller Pro customers has been consistent with
strong double-digit growth every month of the year. Growth with our larger Pro customers is healthy and
accelerated from the second quarter. However, some large Pros still face headwinds related to the current
operating environment, including some customers being hesitant to invite Pros into their homes.

Turning to our DIY customers. We continue to see unprecedented levels of engagement from both new and
existing customers across a variety of home improvement projects. And importantly, as these customers
complete a project, they are gaining the confidence to tackle their next project and reengage with The
Home Depot.

During the third quarter, we saw customers take advantage of an extended selling season for our garden
seasonal categories, resulting in significant growth in categories like hardscapes, soils, riding mowers
and outdoor power equipment. However, garden seasonal were not the only projects our customers were
working on. If we exclude our garden departments from our third quarter results, our comp was still north
of 20%.

We saw customers working on a variety of projects across their home, with categories like garage
organization, ceiling fans, vanities and power tools all posting comps well above the company average.
The customer engagement we are seeing was also evident in our annual Halloween event. During the
third quarter, we hosted our most successful Halloween event with both in-store and online offerings.
Customers responded to our larger assortment of animatronics, inflatables and yard decor as evidenced by
our 12-foot giant skeleton that sold out before October, helping drive a record level of sell-through for the
event.

As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season and
believe we are in a great position for continued customer engagement. During the quarter, we will be
hosting our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. However, this year, they're going to
look a little different as we remain committed to prioritizing the health and safety of our customers and
associates, and promoting a safe shopping environment.

We've adjusted our Black Friday event this year to cover an extended period of time and not just focus on
1 day. Additionally, for both our Black Friday and our gift center events, we've reorganized how we place
and stage our product to assist with social distancing. For example, we've reduced the amount of product
displayed on our front race track, and we've created more space for our gift center presentation. We've
made deeper buys on fewer SKUs to bring great values to our customers. And we've also included some of
our core SKUs in our event, which will help with replenishment as we continue to see strong comps.

For example, featured in our gift center and Black Friday events this year are exclusive power tool
products from our industry-leading assortment of Milwaukee, Makita, DEWALT, RIDGID, RYOBI and more.
This year, we are especially excited about the launch of RYOBI 18-Volt ONE+ HP brushless tools. These
tools have been designed from the ground up to serve our DIY and Pro customers with more features and
performance than ever.

HP tools are up to 20% lighter and 30% more compact while delivering improved power and durability
with brushless motors. The RYOBI ONE+ platform has more than 100 million batteries in our customers'
homes and job sites today. And this new HP lineup brings a strong pipeline of future innovation to the
more than 175 RYOBI ONE+ tools in the marketplace today. Our Black Friday and gift center events kicked
off a little over a week ago, and we are thrilled with the early results.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we hope
you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.

In the third quarter, total sales were $33.5 billion, a 23.2% increase from last year. Foreign exchange
rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $100 million. Our total company comps
were positive 24.1% for the quarter, with positive comps of 21.8% in August, 27.8% in September and
23% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 24.6% for the quarter, with positive comps of 22.6% in
August, 28.5% in September and 23% in October.

Our comps in August and September of this year were impacted by a shift in our Labor Day event. This
year, our Labor Day event fell in fiscal September, and last year, it fell in fiscal August. If we adjust for this
shift, our monthly comps in the U.S. would be 24.7% in August and 26.4% in September. All 19 of our
U.S. regions, as well as Canada and Mexico, posted double-digit positive comps in local currency.

In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.2%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from
last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted during the quarter by several factors, including product
mix and pressure from shrink. Mix pressure from lumber alone negatively impacted gross margin by
approximately 35 basis points in the third quarter. The decline in gross margin was partially offset by the
benefit of reduced promotional events during the quarter.

During the third quarter, operating expenses were approximately 19.7% of sales, representing a decrease
of approximately 30 basis points compared to last year.

Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, during the quarter, we continued
to support our associates with enhanced benefits in response to COVID-19, which totaled approximately
$355 million, resulting in approximately 105 basis points of expense deleverage.

As you heard earlier from Craig, through the end of the third quarter, we have spent approximately $1.7
billion on enhanced associate pay and benefits in response to COVID-19. We've also made the decision to
transition from our temporary weekly bonus program to permanent compensation enhancements for our
frontline hourly associates. This will result in approximately $1 billion of incremental expense on an annual
basis. We began making these adjustments in the third quarter, and we'll continue to make the majority of
them in the fourth quarter on a market-by-market basis.

Second, we incurred approximately $60 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal
protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in
approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage.

Third, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $325 million, an
increase of approximately $48 million compared to last year.

And finally, during the third quarter, we showed strong expense control in other areas of the business and
drove approximately 155 basis points of expense leverage.

Included in this 155 basis points of leverage is approximately 70 basis points of pressure driven by
accrued bonus expense primarily related to our current outperformance for our biannual store Success
Sharing program and store- and field-based management bonuses for the second half. The Success
Sharing and store and field-based management bonuses are in addition to the $1.7 billion of enhanced
pay and benefits in response to COVID-19.

Our operating margin for the third quarter was approximately 14.5%, flat with the same period last year.
Interest and other expense for the third quarter grew by $49 million to $329 million due primarily to
higher long-term debt levels compared to 1 year ago.

In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of fiscal
2019. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.18, an increase of 25.7% compared to
the third quarter of 2019.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $16.2 billion, an increase of $444 million versus
last year. And inventory turns were 5.9x, up from 5x from the same period last year.

Moving on to capital allocation. Our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not
changed. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a
balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and through share repurchases.

Let's take a moment to talk about our first priority. We are committed to reinvesting in the business to
drive growth faster than the market, and the acquisition of HD Supply strategically positions us to drive
accelerated sales growth in a highly fragmented MRO space.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of The Home Depot will commence a cash
tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of HD Supply common stock for $56 per share for a total
enterprise value, including net cash, of approximately $8 billion.

The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals
and the tender of the majority of the shares of HD Supply common stock then outstanding on a fully
diluted basis and is expected to be completed during The Home Depot's fiscal fourth quarter, which ends
on January 31, 2021.

We plan to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and new debt. We also expect the transaction to be
accretive to EPS in fiscal 2021, with potential for significant shareholder value creation over the long term.
During the quarter, we invested approximately $470 million back into our business in the form of capital
expenditures and paid $1.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders.

Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months,
return on invested capital was approximately 41.6%, down from 45.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the
suspension of our share repurchase program back in March.

Turning to the macro environment. The strong demand we've seen has continued. Comps have slightly
accelerated in the first 2 weeks of November, reflecting an earlier start for our Black Friday and holiday
events versus last year. We are encouraged by consumer sentiment and consumption trends, which show
home improvement receiving more than its historical share of consumer spending.

Housing metrics are significantly stronger than when we entered this crisis. Turnover is rising, we see
continued growth in household formation and home prices are appreciating as inventory on the market
hovers near record lows. Our customers tell us their homes have never been more important, and they
intend to continue their investment in the improvement of their homes.

While the current demand environment is strong, it is important to remember that we are not through
the COVID-19 pandemic. And we do not think it is prudent to extrapolate recent trends to predict future
performance. Our main focus remains on meeting our customers' needs while prioritizing safety. And we
believe that the investments we have made over the last several years have uniquely positioned us to
capture market share regardless of the environment.
Thank you for your participation in today's call, and we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So I know you mentioned about the slight acceleration quarter-to-date, but I was wondering what you've
seen in areas where COVID cases have spiked. What do you think the business looks like as it gets colder
and outdoor DIY gets tougher? You mentioned the low 20% ex garden comp, do you think that's a good
proxy for the underlying trend? Or would you expect the large Pro to continue to improve and provide a
benefit?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

So Chris, the first comment would be we see no correlation in the business as it relates to COVID cases. I
mean our performance overall was actually really tight geography-wise, and we saw broad strength across
the store. So we -- as Ted mentioned, we had an extended season because of the weather in garden, but
we were extremely pleased with the performance outside of our outdoor categories. So we feel good about
that. And we've seen the Pro continue to recover and the large Pro recover.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then a couple of follow-up questions on the investment outlook. It sounds like you're making
progress on the store investments again. Will you end up on track versus the original plan? And what do
you think about the degree at which investment dollars and SG&A are down year-over-year in '21 -- year-
over-year in 2021? And then now that you have HD Supply, I was curious, how many of the 150-or-so new
buildings that you've planned to build under the current investment plan related to the MRO? And does the
acquisition of HD Supply impact the outlook for the -- building those buildings and CapEx related to that?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

So with respect to the investment outlook, as we've said in the past, we have deferred certain investments
that principally relate to investments made inside the store. A large number of those investments remain
deferred.

We started the year with a CapEx plan of approximately $2.8 billion. We have deferred less than $0.5
billion. And so while I won't give you an exact number, I would say we will see deferral of, call it, $300
million to $400 million from our original plans in 2020. Some of that may push into 2021, and we'll update
you as time goes on. But I would say that overall, 2021 is going to be very similar to 2020 in terms of
CapEx.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

And as it relates to the HD supply asset base in total, obviously, we'll take a look at that, and we'll
evaluate the combined asset base once this gets approval. And we'll move forward with what we think
the best leverage point is to serve our customers and grow in the MRO space, which is a $55 billion
fragmented market that we're pretty excited about.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

And if I could just take a minute, Chris, on what we've accomplished. While we did push a bit into 2021,
we're just thrilled that we are finishing the investment in our new look and feel of the store. Our sign
packages will be done in all U.S. stores this year. I think that is probably the first time the brand standard
across all the United States stores has been the same, maybe since our first 2 stores opened in 1979.

We've completed all our self-checkout refreshes. We've added storage to most of our stores for online
pickup. We've implemented electric sign -- electronic sign labels in all our appliance departments.
Completely refreshed our paint -- color wall experience in our paint department. We've completed the tool
corral by brand standards in those leading brands in our tool business. And we've also taken that to our
outdoor power equipment, and we'll be done early next year, resetting all our outdoor power equipment,
again by those battery platforms that are leading brands in the industry.

So we've completed a ton of work despite some of the setbacks with COVID this year. The team just did a
terrific job getting all that work done.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So then, Richard, I know you mentioned CapEx deferring in. But I think originally '21 was, from an OpEx
perspective, so source of funds, incremental investment dollars down year-over-year versus being up the
past few years. Do you still expect those investment dollars in OpEx to be down in '21?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

They'll be flat/down in '21, those specific expense dollars with respect to the investment program that
continue alongside the deferred spend in '20.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So you did talk about product mix as the primary factor for the gross margin decline. Was there much of
an impact on gross margins from channel mix as e-commerce has outpaced store growth? Or was it really
all on the product side? Or were there any other factors we should be mindful of?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Nothing in particular, Scot. By far, the big driver was the lumber penetration, the lumber mix as strong as
that business was.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So as we -- just thinking about this kind of going forward, Ted, should we think about if we wind up seeing
any more normalized mix kind of getting back to, let's call it, flattish kind of gross margins, is that the
right way to think about it from a cadence perspective?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

I think at this point, with the level of uncertainty in the environment and the dynamics in the business
today, we wouldn't give any forward expectations with respect to margin. We're running a very healthy
business. We run it on a portfolio basis.

When you -- you bring up channel mix, we run this as a portfolio and have for many, many years, and
you've seen the stability in our gross margin that reflects that. Remember that over 60% of sales that are

purchased on our digital assets are picked up in the store and have an identical mix, in essence, to our
store mix. So that's where we stand. We're very comfortable with the mix of business we see.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

There's a lot of moving pieces with Home Depot's longer-run earnings power between any changes in
consumer behavior, the incremental costs that you're paying your associates, the acquisition of Home
Depot Supply, channel mix, so relative to the 14% operating margin expectation you put out previously,
recognizing that the sale expectation you're not providing longer-run guidance, do you think the business
can now earn a higher, lower or about the same margin knowing what you know today than what you had
thought previously?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I'd say a lot is dynamic, but many things stay the same. I think we have executed exceptionally well
in terms of expense management throughout the year. And I think you can expect that from us in the
future.

I think one thing I will just make sure that we clarify is how the shape of our investments to support our
associates goes from 2020 into '21. So as we said, our expenses through the first 3 quarters of the year
in support of our associates totaled approximately $1.7 billion. We are transitioning the nature of those
investments into permanent wage investments during the fourth quarter.

So if you think about the fourth quarter, we're not going to quite be down to that $1 billion annualized run
rate as some of these programs leak into the beginning of the fourth quarter. We will be lower than the
third quarter run rate. But add it to $1.7 billion and say that 2020 will likely end at a total of $2 billion of
investments in our associates. Of that $2 billion, only $1 billion will remain in our cost base in 2021. So I
think that's the most important fact with respect to our cost base that I'd like to make sure we clarify.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

And Michael, the only other comment I'd add to that is everything that we've been doing through our
investment program is to try to position The Home Depot to grow faster than the market on a consistent
basis no matter what the operating environment is and to deliver incremental op margin dollars as a
result. That's our focus. That's what we're trying to get done.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Craig, that's a good segue to my second question, which is recognizing that it's very hard to prognosticate
how demand for overall home improvement is going to shape up next year, if you had to make an
estimate, what percentage of your categories or your SKUs do you think you'll be ordering inventory down
next year?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Look, we -- first of all, the inventory planning for The Home Depot is on a very short cycle. We plan really
week to week. We release orders every single day. And 70% of what we purchase is domestic goods and
comes from short lead time-type performance. So we'll manage that on a day-by-day, week-by-week
basis based on what we see in demand. And really not looking -- we're not looking to extrapolate anything
at this point from current performance. Our whole focus is on being able to be flexible and agile and adjust
accordingly.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. I guess the heart of the question was do you think home improvement demand is going to grow
next year?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

So look, the only thing I can tell you at this point is when we talk to our customers and we do work on
surveys, the customer tells us that the home has never been more important. Maintenance in the home is
going up as people spend way more time in their home. And they tell us -- there's a significant percentage
of folks that say they're going to do a project within the next 6 months. And so everything that we see at
this point in terms of customer feedback would suggest they're going to continue to invest in their homes.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

At the same time, there's a lot of uncertainty in the environment. There are macroeconomic fundamentals
that we're all going to be subject to. And so I think if you think about it on a comparative basis, as Craig
said, home improvement is a great space to be in at the moment. And as customers -- it's interesting,
you look at the housing dynamics and you say, when customers see their home price appreciate, they
tend to invest more in their homes. Again, we're guarding our comments because of the uncertainty in the
macro environment. And so at this point, we really can't comment on '21, but we do think there's a lot of
confidence with respect to home improvement in our customers' minds.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just a couple of questions. I guess I'm wondering with respect to your inventory, following up on Michael's
question, do you actually think you'd maybe lost sales with the inventory that was a little too lean? And
then wondering how to think about inventory for the fourth quarter. And then the second question I had
is just you obviously have more and more information on your DIY customer than you have for the last
several quarters given the e-comm penetration. I'm wondering if you could give a little more color on what
the general demographic has -- is looking like now, and what the biggest shifts or changes that you've
seen from an, I guess, age or income cohorts?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

On inventory, Karen, it would be hard to gauge some of the lost sales opportunity. That would have likely
been more of a Q2 impact for us because we did go in with a little more conservative approach when the
pandemic hit. As you know, we limited customer hours, limited customer counts and we also pulled back a
bit on inventory.

Since that time, though, between the merchandising team and the supply chain team and the sourcing
teams and transportation team, they really have just done an incredible effort flowing product into the
store. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we improved in-stock levels every week of the quarter. Our
inventory grew over $400 million from the prior year. That was our first year-over-year increase that we
had seen this year. And in pure volume, if you look at our accounts payable, that gives you an indication of
how much goods we have flown into the buildings. It's over $3 billion from our low point.

So the in-stocks still are not exactly where we'd like them to be, but incredible improvement. And the
work the merchants have done, even though the in-stocks still have some ways to go, by working on the
right SKUs with our supplier partners, updating planograms and the like, we're -- we believe we have the
product and the type of items in the store that our customers are looking for.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

As it relates to online trends, you're absolutely right. Our online business, we couldn't be happier with
the performance of our digital assets. And remember, we are an interconnected business. So with
everything I'm about to say, remember that over 60-odd percent of our goods are picked up in our store.
Nonetheless, our interconnected business grew by 80%. The penetration was 13% to the business. The
sales, that translates to nearly $2 billion of sales growth in the quarter for our online business.

Our visits are up dramatically. We're up in mobile, desktop, mobile web. Our conversion is up despite
the hyper growth in app and mobile web that tend to have lower conversion rates than desktop. Our app
downloads are way up. Our active app users are way up. Our orders are up. Our My Account, these are
folks who are setting up an account with Home Depot, so obviously we know them better when they set
up an account, are way up.

Millennials are highly engaged with The Home Depot. You asked about customer profile. Our Pros are
highly engaged. Our B2B website is seeing record volumes and engagement with our Pro customer. So I'll
stop there, but it is a robust interconnected digital environment right now at The Home Depot.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.

Katharine Amanda McShane
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I know there -- you gave your comments on HD Supply, but I wondered if there was any more color you
could give on the source and magnitude of any synergies? And how much debt might be taken or raised
for the deal?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

We're really excited about what the combination of these 2 MRO businesses will bring to our customer. We
think we've got the opportunity to create significant shareholder value creation through that combination.
We're not going to talk about the degree of accretion, but confident that we'll see earnings per share
accretion in 2021.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Kate, what we're excited about is if you -- these are rough numbers. If you think about 130 million
occupied households in the United States, about 80 million of that is kind of owned household single
family. There's 50 million, and that is rental. And of the 50 million, about 30 million, give or take, is in kind
of the multifamily operations-type business.

That is a huge opportunity for The Home Depot to continue to grow not only on the MRO side, but as we
build relationships with customers on the MRO side, we build relationships to be able to participate in
capital refreshes of those facilities as well, which is something we're pretty focused on. So we're super
excited about the opportunity that comes with this MRO space.

Katharine Amanda McShane
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I wondered if I could ask an unrelated follow-up question. Just regards to your seasonal
business that you do in the fourth quarter, is there any way to dimensionalize or size how big of a business
that is becoming for you in the fourth quarter?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

I'm trying to remember off the top of my head. We always -- we talked about seasonal breakout of
outdoor categories. The fourth quarter is the lowest of the year, right, Ted?

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 17, 2020

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Yes. So generally, it's been shifting a little bit this year given the extended garden season and as engaged
as customers have been. But usually, think of Q4 as low 21-ish percent penetration of what we would
deem outdoor business. And that very much is the low point with Q2 traditionally being the high point,
think of mid-30s. So that's sort of the range of changes in the business.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

First, a question for Richard. You mentioned a few macro factors, and I'm trying to extrapolate. It sounds
like you're a little bit more bullish on those than maybe you were in prior calls. Can you give us any sense
-- I know you said directionally getting better. Can you give us a sense of what these inputs could look like
for 2021 just in terms of magnitude, whether it's home price appreciation, housing turnover, et cetera?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

So in my earlier comments, I said we're really pleased with the current level of consumer sentiment and
consumption in the economy. I'm not going to make a prediction on where those macroeconomic levers go
in the future.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

I mean the other thing, Simeon, that I would say is I think the last number I saw is somewhere in like the
2.7 months of supply in housing. And the historical average on that is 6 months, so you'd have to believe
that's going to continue to hold up home values. And I think home value improvements have been the
surprise this year.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

It's -- I think it's a positive housing environment. We're not extrapolating that into expectations for
sales principally because of the uncertainty in the macro environment. So we are optimistic and current
conditions are certainly favorable for home improvement, but there is uncertainty. We'll learn a lot in the
fourth quarter.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then my follow-up, based on the results by customer type, right, the Pro
customers coming back, can you talk about the backlog that you're seeing? Are you seeing the jobs that
are coming back to normal, indoor jobs? And I think it may have been asked earlier, but the transition
from outdoor to indoor as how is that taking place?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

So Simeon, you're right. The Pro has been coming back. We see double-digit comps in Pro. We did last
quarter as well. Small Pro is leading the large Pro. We've seen that large Pro really strengthened in the
larger metro markets. In our services business, if you look at that as a benchmark to Pro's business, we
have one of the larger backlogs of to-be-installed sales jobs that we've ever seen.

And as you'd imagine, a lot of this is special ordered goods. So getting the bespoke special order made
and shipped to the particular job and then getting the labor to install that job continues to be a bit of a

15

pressure and more so in certain markets, leading to that large backlog. But if what we're seeing in our
services business translates to what the larger Pros are also seeing, that would be sizable backlog.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Can you talk about where you are in the supply chain buildout that you've outlined over the past few
quarters, and maybe how much of a delay COVID caused and the degree to which you can make that up
in '21?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Sure. I just -- largely, COVID hasn't had a big impact. And I'll let Mark comment on where we are.

Mark Q. Holifield
Executive VP of Supply Chain & Product Development

Yes. Mark Holifield here. Yes, we've continued to open facilities through the pandemic. I've been incredibly
impressed that the team has been able to keep our program on track in terms of the One Supply Chain
initiative. In Q3, we opened up about 11 MDOs. We now have 3 -- those are market delivery operations.
We now have 3 flatbed delivery centers open, and we've got a very solid pipeline for '21 that we're
working. And so we're very much on track with the One Supply Chain initiative.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. That's great. And then just maybe one for Richard. You spoke a lot over the past year about the
ongoing margin headwind from shrink. And I realize maybe you've been limited in your ability to do some
of the inventory, the physical inventories. But I guess, where are we in that life cycle? It seems like it was
an issue again here in the third quarter. Any line of sight of when you think the shrink flips from -- could
flip from a negative to a positive?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, at the beginning of the year, we said that impacts from our initiatives weren't really going to be seen
until the year 2021. It takes time to roll these out. We did anticipate at the beginning of the year that we
would see pressure from -- on a year-over-year basis. The results through the third quarter have been
essentially consistent with our original expectations.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

A couple. One, Halloween being strong, does that typically act as a leading indicator for Christmas or even
Thanksgiving? In other words, if people are buying the big blowups for Halloween, does that translate into
big Christmas or I don't know [ if you do ] a big Thanksgiving business on that, but does that translate at
all to what we should expect in the fourth quarter?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

I think what we saw in the Halloween business probably is more correlated to what we've historically
seen in storm markets. When you have a hurricane hit -- our thinking years ago was that, oh, geez, we

needed to pull back on all that kind of product because that wouldn't be where the customer focus was,
and we needed the space for rebuild-type product. And what our customers told us was, "No, actually,
we're looking for some kind of normalcy. And we actually want to buy that product from you."

And I think that's exactly what we anticipated and are seeing through the holiday programs as Halloween
was the strongest event we've ever had. So we had anticipated in the beginning of the year -- because
that's a long-cycle product that you purchase well in advance, we had anticipated that the customer would
want to engage in holiday and purchased accordingly.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And so do you have that same expectation for Christmas? Did you purchase that similarly?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes, that's what I mean. We bought into the whole holiday decor for the entire season, Halloween all the
way through Christmas, because we anticipated that customers are going to want some kind of normalcy
in their life.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

The holiday set has been set now for Christmas for several weeks in the store now. And as I said, we're
very pleased with the early engagement and sales in the program.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. Got it. Understood. If I could ask one more follow-up on the Home Depot Supply. Thinking back a
few years to an Analyst Day that you had, I think you implied that you -- or said that your share in MRO
was about 5%, which would have implied about $2.5 billion, and then we add on 3 plus for Home Depot
Supply. You're getting above $5 billion about 10% share. Is that the right way to think about it?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

We think it's about a $55 billion market that we play in with the combination of our current MRO business
and what will be added with HD Supply.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And what do you think your share is of that $55 billion?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

We won't speak on HD Supply's financial information. The transaction hasn't completed yet. We'll refer you
back to theirs. But as Craig said, call ours roughly $2 billion.

Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So with your digital sales up 80% in the quarter, I think that would imply that your in-store sales
accelerated in Q3. And I'm curious if you would attribute this more so to the impact of easing some of

the early COVID restrictions on stores? Or do you think there are other factors like better in-stocks or
incremental demand from Pro customers that you would call out?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

I think it's all of the above. I think we learned how to better operate. We ended up turning control of
constraints in stores over to our store managers who are closest to the situation on the ground versus a
company-wide approach. We did that at roughly the beginning of the quarter.

We improved our in-stock position, as Ted indicated. We saw overall improvement with our Pro customers.
And our smaller Pros have been steady, our larger Pros improved, yet there's still opportunity for them.
And we saw our services business improve overall. So I think there's a number of factors that led to this
performance in the quarter. So we're pleased with the trends that we're seeing in the business right now.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then lastly, on the decision to reacquire HD Supply. Could you talk about why you think the
timing makes the most sense now, particularly with some of their end customers like hospitality and
facilities impacted due to COVID? And on the strategic investments, curious how you would think about
prioritizing that incremental investment dollar across the MRO business relative to your existing strategic
plans.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Look, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, over a period of time, the HD Supply business came down to
essentially the MRO maintenance facility business that it is today that we just put the offer in on. And so
it strategically lines up with what we're trying to get accomplished in the MRO business, much more so
than it did a few years ago. So from a timing standpoint, that's the logic there. And look, we look forward
to -- as we close this deal, hopefully during our fiscal year-end here, then we'll determine the go-forward
approach and how we allocate and prioritize. But we got to get this deal closed first.

Operator

Our final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim.

Steven Paul Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I was hoping to maybe expand on the compensation enhancements for the hourly associates. I don't know
if it's possible, Richard or Craig, if you could discuss whether the investments are concentrated in absolute
wage rates or if there's other sort of aspects of the compensation or benefits that are being changed as we
think about the cost structure going forward.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Now, look, Steven, we believe that our associates are a competitive advantage to The Home Depot, and
they're critical to the overall customer experience. And this investment is essentially in wage. And as we
do everything as it relates to our associates, that's done on a market-by-market basis overall. But yes,
you can think of it as largely -- it's wage.

Steven Paul Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then as a follow-up to that, I mean, should we expect any incremental pressure stemming from
higher implement cost for the full-time associate pool? Or maybe as -- I don't know if you could sort of
discuss, right, is the best way to think about 2021, Richard, you mentioned $2 billion transitory versus $1
