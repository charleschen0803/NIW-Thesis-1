DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the Darden Fiscal Year 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] The
conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Please go ahead.

Kevin Kalicak
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Analysis

Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me
on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO.

As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are
described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call,
which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.

Today's discussion and presentation will include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations
of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 fourth quarter
earnings on June 25 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Given the circumstances,
we will only briefly discuss third quarter results, and we'll spend the majority of the time discussing the
impact of COVID-19.

Additionally, I want to remind everyone about the calendar shift that moved Thanksgiving from the second
quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year, resulting in 1 fewer operating day for our casual
dining brands during the third quarter.

Now I'll turn the call over to Gene.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I want to acknowledge that we are clearly in a time of
uncertainty as it relates to COVID-19. I know you have a lot of questions relating to the future, and we'll
try to answer them the best we can.

First, I want to say thank you to our teams who are doing a great job managing through this adversity.
Additionally, I want to thank them for the outstanding job they did in the third quarter. Our results were
impressive.

As you've seen from our press release this morning, total sales from continuing operations were $2.35
billion, an increase of 4.5%. Same-restaurant sales increased 2.3% and adjusted net earnings per share
were $1.90.

However, today, we're clearly faced with more pressing matters to discuss, given the rapidly changing
environment and ongoing impact associated with COVID-19. To that end, I want to share with you what
the Darden team is doing as it relates to the virus and the impact to our operations. Rick will share some
of our quarter-to-date results and analysis on potential financial impacts.

Turning to our ongoing response. We've established a cross-functional crisis team, led by me, and we're
in close contact with the CDC and other government agencies to ensure we have the most up-to-date
information to inform the decisions we are making. We have developed an action plan addressing business
continuity, operations, communication and supply chain. Our plan is updated as we receive and process
new information. The health and safety of our team members, their families and our guests remains

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

our top priority, and we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of our hourly team members and
restaurant management teams.

Yesterday, we announced that we're implementing an Emergency Pay Program that will cover hourly team
members for 2 weeks in restaurants facing a business disruption. This is in addition to the permanent paid
sick leave policy we announced last week. At this point, we don't see any major impacts to our supply
chain. We have been in discussion with all of our major suppliers, and they are confident that they can
continue to supply our restaurants with safe, consistent goods to maintain service to our guests.

Our restaurant teams are well-trained in food safety, sanitation and managing through viruses. We are
regularly cleaning our restaurants with products that are on the CDC list of approved cleaning agents
for COVID-19. We are confident that we will be able to maintain a steady flow of these products into our
restaurants. We are committed to keeping our restaurants open, where permissible, to be able to provide
meals to the community in which we operate, whether that be off-premise or dine-in, where permitted.
And I'll reiterate that we are committed to the health and safety of our team members and guests by
offering limited or no-contact curbside pickup, and practicing social distancing in our seating configurations
in all locations where we are permitted to operate our dining rooms.

While we have a strong balance sheet and a strong cash position, given the material declines we're
seeing in our business, we will have to make dramatic change to our cost structure and cut nonessential
spending. I'd like to emphasize that this is a rapidly changing environment, and as such, we are not able
to reasonably estimate the impact to our business. The analysis that Rick will be providing are theoretical
in nature and won't be able to predict the duration or scope of the impact at this time.

Now I'll turn it over to Rick.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that we actually had a pretty
strong third quarter, with same-restaurant sales of 2.3% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90. But
obviously, that is behind us, and we're now focused on dealing with the unfolding situation. Instead of
going through the detailed financial results for this quarter in my prepared remarks, we have most of our
usual financial discussion slides in the Additional Information section of our presentation.

Turning to our results so far in the fourth quarter. The shift in business momentum has been swift after
announcements from state and local governments limiting restaurant operations. For context, Darden's
same-restaurant sales were positive 3% in the first week, the second week was basically flat, and the
third week was down almost 21%. Same-restaurant sales for our third fiscal week ending March 15 by
segment, where Olive Garden was down 18.7%; LongHorn, down 15.9%; Fine Dining, down 27.7%; and
Other Business, down 27.5%. Our presentation has trends by week for our segments.

Turning to our current week sales. Through yesterday, same-restaurant sales are down roughly 60%. As
of 4 p.m. yesterday, 60% of our restaurants are mandated To Go only, 16% have mandated other capacity
constraints and the remaining 24% have no mandates, but we are choosing to operate them at reduced
capacity of approximately 50% while practicing social distancing recommended by health officials.

To that end, we've made the following decisions in conjunction with our Board: First, we have announced
that the Board has suspended our quarterly dividend payment. The Board intends to review our quarterly
dividend policy as developments warrant. Second, out of an abundance of caution, we're fully drawing
down our $750 million credit facility to further shore up our cash balance, resulting in approximately $1
billion on our balance sheet. Third, we are limiting cash outflows by more aggressively managing costs
and significantly reducing CapEx. Finally, given the level of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the
future impact of COVID-19 on the broader U.S. economy and any specific impact to our company, we have
withdrawn our previous fiscal 2020 guidance issued December 19, 2019.

In the absence of specific guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we want to provide EPS sensitivity
for the quarter. Assuming most restaurants have partial operations, such as To Go only, you can assume

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

that for each percentage point decline in sales for the fourth quarter, which is 14 weeks, diluted earnings
per share will decline approximately $0.06 to $0.08.

During these uncertain times, it's important to understand the strength of our balance sheet and history
of our cash flows. To that end, when looking at our historical operating cash flows, we've been able to
generate enough cash to more than fund all of our needs. And while I can't predict the level or length of
any reductions to our sales, assuming a sales decline of 50% for the entire fourth quarter would result in
negative operating cash flow of approximately $300 million for the quarter, including change in net

[Audio Gap]
As I mentioned earlier, we have approximately $1 billion in available cash. Given that, I believe we'll be
able to weather this disruption to our business. And with that, we'll take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

As the country's largest casual dining company, it certainly makes sense that you'd be having discussions
with the government right now. It's also my understanding that the industry, particularly the casual
dining segment, has been the united front in asking for some sort of a direct relief plan. Could you talk
about some ideas that are realistically being considered even if you're not counting on them for Darden's
survival?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we -- and I have been in contact with the administration and members of Congress to help them
understand the unique challenge that we face in the full-service sector. The priority of those discussions
have been on developing a plan to be able to continue to keep our team members on our payroll. Trying
to develop a plan, which would use government money to pay them and not have to separate with our
190,000 team members. That's been the focus of our discussions at this point.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And is there a mechanism that they have decided on or even thought about to get that done?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

No. I believe that -- I mean, at this point in time, we're early in the discussion, and there's just a lot
happening in D.C. But they are well aware of the situation that full-service, casual dining, company-owned
companies are really facing, company in the different than franchise.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett.

Jeffrey Daniel Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

You did touch on it, but what is your monthly cash burn rate in a scenario as you outlined, where the
restaurant dining rooms are closed and you're only able to serve off-premise? And as a follow-up to that,
I'm just curious if you think you can keep that off-premise number at Olive Garden anywhere close to
that. I think it's $14,000 to $15,000 per week in a normalized environment.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Jeff, in a take-out only scenario, we would expect the variable margin to be positive. And so that's very
important for us is to make sure that we have positive variable margin on takeout, but our total EBITDA
will be negative. We do believe that we can build and we're seeing build in To Go sales at Olive Garden and
at LongHorn Steakhouse, significant growth in To Go during this time period.

I will say on a fully closed scenario, which is what we talked about a little bit ago, a fully closed scenario,
our run rate cash burn rate is about $40 million to $50 million, but we think a full close is unlikely, closing
everything, including To Go. Any variable margin -- I'm sorry, one more thing. Any variable margin we get
from the take out really helps offset that fully closed cash burn rate.

Jeffrey Daniel Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

That's helpful. But that $40 million to $50 million, that time period is over a month, is that correct? Or it's
shorter.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

That's $40 million to $50 million a week, assuming we're fully closed. Now we can probably take that cash
burn rate down below $40 million, but that's just a range that we have. And that's assuming we're fully
closed, again.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs.

Katherine Irene Fogertey
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Great. Can you give us a little bit of color about how many people you would need in the restaurants if
you're running To Go only? And then you kind of alluded to you were seeing a big boost at Olive Garden
and LongHorn around To Go. Could you give us some more granular numbers about how that comp trend
has moved in the 3 weeks like you split out the overall site?

And then just finally, I know that you guys have not partnered with third-party delivery before. But just
wondering, given this very unique set of circumstances here, does it make sense to maybe look at even a
short-term solution on that front to help get food to customers?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

It's taken us on average 6 to 10 team members in our To Go only restaurants to operate. I would suspect
-- I think it's been all over the place and every day it's changing dramatically. But I think when I looked
at it yesterday, our off-premise business was growing about 20% versus last year. So it's picking up as
people change their behaviors.

As far as third-party goes, I would say that everything is on the table. However, what we're focused on
right now is ramping up and using our team members to be able to keep them on our payroll and develop
our own delivery capabilities, which our teams are ramping very, very quickly.

Katherine Irene Fogertey
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

So just so I understand, you guys are looking at doing your own fulfilled delivery in certain markets?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

We're doing it now.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler.

Nicole Miller Regan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

How was the conversation with your lender, if you don't mind sharing, please? And then what is the intent,
in your opinion, please, for lenders to deal with restaurants at any level? In the past, I would understand
that they would let the ability to draw down on the revolver and also amend covenants as needed. It's

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

going to be important, again, maybe not for Darden because you've already had the conversation, but for
many, many of your peers going forward. If you could talk us through that, we'd really appreciate it.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Nicole, we've had some really good conversations with our banks. We've got long-standing
relationships with them. They were with us during the crisis in 2008. And so we just -- as we said, as an
out of an abundance of caution, we drew down our revolver. They said they'd be there if we needed them
before we did that, but we decided to do that just to get in front of anybody else that might want to.

As in the terms of our covenants, we haven't gotten to a point, where we're breaking our covenants,
and so we haven't had those discussions. And even with our stock price today, we'd still be within our
covenants.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners.

Brett Saul Levy
MKM Partners LLC, Research Division

If you could talk a little bit about what have your conversations been with landlords now that you're not
the sole owner of your properties? And you talked about labor over the first 2 weeks. How are you thinking
about it over the more intermediate period of time, the following 2 weeks, the following 2 months?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Brett, we've had no conversations with our landlords at this point in time. We have stopped
all construction of all new restaurants, and we're negotiating with those landlords to push off the
commencement of rent. As far as labor goes, we -- again, we've implemented our Emergency Pay Policy
for those that are being impacted from disruption standpoint. What we do into the future will really
depend on what kind of relief we may get from the administration to help pay our people. But that's yet
to be determined, and we continue to have conversations. I'll have conversations with the leaders in
Washington as soon as I get off this call. So I really can't give a whole lot of guidance to that.

Brett Saul Levy
MKM Partners LLC, Research Division

No. That makes sense. And just on the store capacity, what is your anticipation? What are you hearing
from other jurisdictions that are currently either fully open or at half capacity? Do you have any sense on
how we should think about the next 2 weeks in terms of just ongoing capacity within units? And then I'll
let the queue have it.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Brett, the dynamic of this crisis is changing hourly. So I don't want to try to predict what is going to
happen. All I can do is that we are going to react. I am in contact with the governors of the largest states
to talk to them about how we believe that our environments, if we practice, creates good social distancing,
are some of the safest places to be, and we'll continue to have those conversations. But we are not in
control of that. We will react to what the local government wants to do, and we'll do the best job that we
can. But I have no way of predicting what's going to happen.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.

Sara Harkavy Senatore
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

I have a question. If you could give maybe a little bit more insight into some of the consumer behaviors
you're seeing with respect to whether it's geographic dispersion or something else? Obviously, the whole
country is watching this and there's clearly a humanitarian cost. But to some extent, are you seeing
different behaviors away from kind of the epicenters of the disease in the country on the coast? For
example, it looks like some of the data we see suggest that where your restaurants are in terms of
population density or what parts of the regions of the country may make a difference.

I ask only because as we try to think about how behaviors might change as this spread. I'm just trying
to get a sense of, do you see differences in different parts of the country, depending on how -- what the
immediate impact is? Or is it more just everybody is kind of responding to the news that they're seeing,
and it's really not distinct anywhere? So any kind of nuance you can share as we try to think through how
this might play out over time.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

I would say that, obviously, the parts of the country that were impacted first -- were down significantly
before other parts of the country. Again, I would say, more towards the middle of the country, you're
seeing a little bit more of a normalized behavior. And then most of the Northeast is pretty much shut
down, except for off-premise, so that stuff. And the numbers are very difficult to read at this point in time
because we haven't had the chance to bifurcate our sales report to areas that are open for business with
a dining room with social distancing and those that are just open for To Go. So our ability to analyze that
has been a little difficult just because it's changing so dramatically.

But overall, you could see it as business travel started to decline, all the business centers took a major hit.
And now with areas closing down, I can't say consumer behavior has changed. It's just -- it depends on
the situation.

Sara Harkavy Senatore
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the...

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Sara, just one thing. Just to give people an understanding of KNAPP region, I'm going to give you a range.
So for the week that we just ended, the best KNAPP region was one that's not having any forced closures,
et cetera, and that was Texas. That was down 29% roughly in the casual dining space. And the worst-
performing KNAPP region was down 61%. So no matter what it is, all of these regions are down just
because, I think, people are practicing their own social distancing. But that gives you a perspective on the
casual dining business, the range of impact.

Sara Harkavy Senatore
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

That's very helpful. And then just quickly on the cost, the cash flow, cash burn piece. This is probably a
naive question, but as we think about kind of the outlays, obviously, you have rent and occupancy that
you talked about still paid, and then you're taking care of the people. Are there any other big buckets
I should be thinking about as I think about what -- where the sort of cash outlays might be going,
irrespective of what your revenues look like?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

You talked about most of them already. If you think about our rent expense on a weekly -- on a monthly
basis, it's about $20 million of the $40 million. And so -- I'm sorry, restaurant expense. Rent is about $8
million, and so that's the highest nonsalaried expense in this cash burn -- I'm sorry, and that's weekly, $8
million a week. Manager salaries, somewhere around the $10 million. But that can move if we have a very

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

long, prolonged impact or if something happens on the government side. So we could take that down, if --
we want to make sure that our people get paid somehow. So that's -- those are the big buckets.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO.

Andrew Strelzik
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Kind of understanding the survival mentality right now. I guess I'm wondering how you're thinking about
advertising in this environment? You've kind of long touted your robust digital capabilities. Is there
anything you're doing in terms of mining that data to try to manage through the current environment?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Andrew, with the sales results we're seeing now, we are focusing any advertising that we do on To Go,
especially for Olive Garden and LongHorn. But we have dramatically reduced our advertising spend.
Without getting into too many other things that would be competitive, we have significantly reduced
our advertising spend or we plan on significantly reducing where we can. But it would be focused on --
anything we do would be focused on our To Go experience.

Andrew Strelzik
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And is there any more color you can provide on just what we should expect from CapEx?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Basically, the only CapEx we'd have -- we're focused on curbing any capital spend. We're managing it
aggressively. And that really includes stopping all nonessential capital spending. As Gene mentioned, we
are basically shutting down new restaurant construction where we can. And so that cash burn number I
had told you before includes CapEx.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.

John William Ivankoe
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I have several, if I may. Firstly, what is that nonessential CapEx number? I know -- not the number that
you necessarily want to sustain, but I mean, how close to 0 could you actually get while like continuing to
keep the operation where you want it to be?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Very low single-digit millions a week.

John William Ivankoe
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. All right. Wow. Yes, it's really -- it just shows how extraordinary this environment is. And then
secondly, and this is just going to be from just a restaurant operations perspective. I mean, some
numbers are kind of thrown out, no gatherings above 25 people or 50 people. I mean, the numbers kind
of seem to be getting lower. I mean how do you handle that from a practicality perspective within the
restaurant? I mean is there a number of which you say, let's -- we're going to have more than 25 people
or 50 people, whatever it is, including a staffed restaurant. Is there at any one point in time is kind of the
first point.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

And secondly, just because I haven't seen it, I mean, how do you practice social distancing with servers
and bussers, and what have you with the people that have to have closer than 6 feet contact with your
customers? And then finally, is there any thought of moving to things like disposable types of dishware,
just so you -- the cleanliness aspect or the kind of contact aspect can be as minimal as possible?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

It's a lot in there, John. You got it all in. Let me see if I can remember some of that. Well, first thing we do
is once we get below 10 or less, yes, we basically go right To Go. Most of our order ins are 50% capacity
or a high number like 100. And how we execute that is we put someone at the front door and we count.
And we have the number of employees who were working on -- in those environments, limited menus. So
we're -- we've got less employees in the building. We have some high-volume restaurants with limitations
of 100 people in the building that are still doing some fairly good numbers. So I feel like we're really filling
a need that consumer -- the consumer wants.

As far as social distancing with our team members, I mean, it's a challenge. Most importantly, we're
working on hygiene. People are washing their hands, we're sanitizing every table after every visit. And
we've instructed our people to really keep their face back and be able to reach with their hands, and be
able to serve the guests the best they can in that environment.

To date, we -- out of our 190,000 team members, we have no confirmed cases. We've had a great
protocol where we've got significant people -- significant amount of people that aren't allowed to work
because they may have some sort of symptoms, but we've got great processes in place. We deal with
much more contagious viruses all the time, and we feel our dining rooms are some of the safest places
right now. And there are other places that are open and operating that are nowhere near as safe as our
dining rooms.

And if you don't mind, Gene, I mean, you did kind of talk about in the -- let me see if I can have the
language right, a dramatic change in your cost structure. I know we talked about it on the restaurant
side. Is there anything on the G&A side that you'd like to point out at this point of temporary versus
structural, may you -- what -- but maybe some discretionary spend within the G&A side that does not
involve headcount or possibly does involve headcount?

Eugene I. Lee

John, other than me not taking a salary, yes, there's opportunities. We've cut all travel. We'll continue to
look at our staffing levels in this support center. I'm not going to make any comments. All my people are
listening. We're going to have to make -- there's going to be some sacrifices that are going to have to be
made for the organization. And we'll continue to look at that and evaluate that as the -- as we get a better
understanding of what we're really facing. And that changes daily.

Dennis Geiger
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Gene, just wondering if you could provide any perspective on kind of how you're thinking about the
industry, and broadly, the smaller change in the independents within this environment in particular, maybe
relative to Darden's brands? I know the focus here is on the immediate and in the near term, and I know
you don't have a crystal ball. But just any thoughts that you've got perhaps on how you think Darden's
brands are positioned? Perhaps if we can look a little bit past and coming out of some of this relative to
the competition. If you care to share any of that?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

No. I think we're too early on this -- in this crisis for me to have an opinion on that. I think that the full-
service casual dining business is an important piece of the overall economic engine of the United States.
You look at just the 6 top chains, we employ over 0.5 billion people, and these are great jobs. And people
love working for us and consumers love us. And I think that we're all innovative and we're creative. I think
that we're going to fight as hard as we can to get our share of the off-premise business in the time. And
I believe that we'll all come out of it, the bigger ones, in a strong position. We all have great people. Our
people love working for us. Our customers love us. And we just got to manage through this, and I think
the industry will be fine.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co.

Brian John Bittner
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Rick, the sensitivity analysis you gave us for the fourth quarter. I think you said every point in comp is
worth about $0.06 to $0.08 of EPS. I'm assuming that includes things like the Emergency Pay Program
to cover hourly workers and whatnot. But can you just help us better understand, what are you doing on
your core operating cost per unit when we think about that sensitivity analysis? I think you did a great job
of explaining the cash burn, and I think that's pretty straightforward. But just trying to understand these
cost assumptions in that same-store sales sensitivity analysis a little bit more.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Brian, the $0.06 to $0.08 does include the emergency pay that we had mentioned. As you think
about -- we're taking a more detailed look at every restaurant expense line right now. I don't have the
answer for you now, but the cash burn isn't that different than the P&L burn in our -- in the scenarios that
I gave you. We have ways to reduce that number even more if we need to. And so we're continuing to
look at it. But remember, we have -- after we get the revolver drawdown, we have $1 billion of cash, and
we've got a $40 million cash burn a week. So we've got a lot of cash to be able to cover this for quite a
while if we have a full shutdown.

So we're -- but we are looking very hard at every expense, figuring out ways that we can reduce those
expenses. Some of them are easier than others to reduce. And some of those take conversations with
other people, which we haven't had yet. But one of the easier ones is some of the daily contracts that
we might have in the restaurants, some of the services that we do, trash pickup, et cetera, because the
restaurants aren't nearly as busy. So we're focusing on every expense with the priority right now to ensure
that we get our people paid until something happens that we can't anymore.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.

Eric Andrew Gonzalez
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I'm just curious, if we can go back to the off-premise conversation and maybe talk about what you're
doing differently that maybe you haven't done in the past. I know you mentioned that you're -- that
everything's on the table. But have you considered maybe lowering the threshold for smaller delivery? And
then what your current stance is on third party, if that's changed at all? And then just secondarily, on the
-- on this dividend. I was just curious when things do return to normal, how will you determine the size
of the dividend? Is that -- would you bring it back to the prior level? Or would you think about maybe the
payout ratio on trailing earnings basis?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

I'll start. You get the last one. As far as off-premise, we've already ramped up. We're doing delivery. We're
bringing down the threshold where we have the available people to make those deliveries. I mean think
of us at this point, or at least within the next 24 to 72 hours, we'll be pretty much delivering Olive Garden
wherever people want it to be delivered to.

As I said earlier on third party, everything is on the table. But right now, my obligation is to keep as many
of my people working as possible. And I want -- I think that we can ramp up our own delivery much
better. And I'll let Rick talk about the dividend.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Eric. Yes, as we mentioned, we did suspend the dividend. And all I can tell you is the Board is going to
reevaluate that dividend when the conditions change. I can't tell you where we will be, what the dividend
will be. But I will say that in our capital returns to shareholders, the dividend is one of the most important
things that we do to return capital to shareholders.

My question, Gene, is on the pay of the hourly workers. I know you did the right thing. It seems, to
implement this emergency pay. But I just wanted to confirm the length of time that, that covers. And then
once that expires, what your thought process is on how you keep these employees engaged for when
times do get better down the road.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. David, I think -- no, the time commitment right now is once the disruption happens, it's 2 weeks. But
that is subject to change, depending on what happens with these relief packages from the government.
We know that the government is going to start sending people checks directly and not come through us.
That has to be part of our calculation and when we think about our people. We're going to try to keep
people employed, maybe through a furlough program, where we can still have -- they can still have access
to their benefits, they don't lose their tenure. We're really, really trying to work through keeping our
people engaged, so when it's time to ramp back up, that we can ramp back up quickly. But we have to

directly, then that has to be a part of our calculation as we think about our people.

David E. Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then, Rick, just in terms of the cash priorities, I'll be the optimist in thinking that you'll work
through this short-term period and then return to some sense of normalcy. So I guess what's -- what are
your priorities, once you get on the other side of this? Would it be to pay down debt? Or would you be
looking to reinstate the dividend sooner rather than later?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

David, thanks for the question. One of the things that we have said is the dividend is very important to us.
Even with the debt we are taking on, we feel comfortable with that level of debt if we need to keep it all.
What we will do is look at the cash flow forecast going forward and prioritize if we can, the dividend

[Audio Gap]

Priorities of capital are maintaining our restaurants. So we have to continue to maintain the restaurants,
make sure that they look great, then the dividend, then the unit growth and then share buyback. That's
what we've talked about for years. That hasn't changed. And we don't think this situation is going to
change that. So again, capital outlays; maintaining our restaurants; dividends; new unit growth, maybe at
a more tamed level, depending on what happens going forward; and then share buyback. We will likely if
-- pay down this revolver to get back to where we were before, but that's all in the calculus.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.

Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Rick,

[Audio Gap]

clarify the comments around sensitivity. I think you said this week, comps were down 60%, down sharply
from the 20% last week. So just to connect that guidance to your -- or to forward guidance, you said if
comps are down 50% for the fourth quarter, cash burn would be $300 million. I'm assuming that's relative
to the $1 billion you have to try and demonstrate your sustainability. But can you compare that to the
comments you made of down $40 million to $50 million per week? Are those all apples-to-apples? Or I
just want to clarify those details.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Those aren't necessarily apples-to-apples. The $40 million to $50 million per week, remember, is assuming
that we are completely closed, and that's on a run rate basis. The down 50% scenario that we gave to
result in $300 million includes some of those run rate costs, includes some of the emergency pay. And it
also includes the wind down of our negative net working capital somewhat, not all the way. But remember,
the restaurant business is a negative net working capital business, and so as sales slow, we start giving
back some of that working capital credit that we have. And over time, that if we're closed completely, that
working capital goes to -- goes away from a negative balance.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

Understood. So when you say the $40 million to $50 million per week burn, that assumes 100% closed.
You're not talking about just the in-restaurant. You're talking about this restaurant, front doors locked?
You would burn $40 million to $50 million a week? Got you.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We're talking the door locked and nothing -- every light off.

Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got you. Okay. And then just to clarify that you said comps -- if comps were down 50% this quarter, I
think that was the frame of reference you gave at $0.07 per quarter. So you're talking about EPS reduced
$3.50 or so from the prior estimate. So that means that the $0.06 to $0.08 sensitivity change, if comps
fall more aggressively, that doesn't vary. Where comps are down 5% or comps are down 50%, you're
assuming there's no kind of bell curve on that. We should just assume a $0.06 to $0.08 per comp point for
the fourth quarter.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. That's a good assumption. I think $0.06 to $0.08 for every comp point -- remember, for the full
quarter. And after first 3 weeks, we were only down 6% roughly. So -- but that assumes 50% for the
entire quarter.

Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

But ultimately, just my last question. I mean, qualitatively, when the virus fades and we're all hopeful
that does soon. But any reason the business model and the earnings don't bounce back to full strength?
I mean, implying no material change to, let's say, fiscal '22 earnings? I mean, most people value this
company on future years. Just trying to make sure that any changes you're making to today wouldn't
necessarily change the long-term earnings growth dynamic from here.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Jeff, what we are trying to do is to make sure that we come out of this even stronger than what -- than
where we were when we came into it. But it all depends on what happens to the consumer and the length
and depth of this crisis economically. As long as people continue to get paid, we think there's a better
chance that the bounce back is a quicker bounce back. If unemployment gets to some pretty high levels
and people aren't getting paid, that's a different story. But that said, if those things happen, and the
inflation that we have been seeing for the last couple of years probably goes the other way, too.

So we haven't looked 2 years into the future. We're looking hourly and weekly right now. But we believe
that our position helps us become even stronger when we come out of this. But we can't comment
necessarily on what the margin structure is going to look like in 2 years.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Hey, all. There's 10 people in the queue, and I want to get to everybody. We have a hard stop at 9:30.
We've got to get back to taking care of some things. So if you could keep it just to one question, that

My only question is just trying to understand the 60% that you talked about in the last week. I believe
many jurisdictions have only limited dine-in sales as of kind of Monday. So does that really just include
half of the impact of that? Trying to kind of really get the -- down to the run rate of sales.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Jake, most of those jurisdictions started Monday. We saw a little bit of a slowdown from Monday to
Tuesday, but Tuesday to Wednesday was about the same amount, so about down 60%. So as long as it
stays that way, we hope that, that will continue to be around that number, but we can't comment on what
we actually think is going to happen. That said, we're getting better and better on our To Go business, too.

Andrew Michael Charles
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

It looks like you have a small presence for Olive Garden in the Seattle market. And obviously, this has
been the site of the first U.S. outbreak and perhaps a leading indicator for the rest of the country. So
I'm curious if you can talk about the progression of sales in recent weeks for this market to help with a
potential analog for the broader market. And then, Gene, any best practices you learn from the Seattle
market to help extrapolate to the rest of the country, giving you a little more time here?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Jake. I would say that the Seattle market, except for the downtown area, held very tough,
and sales hung in there for a while until we started to close down the dining rooms. It was a very -- it
was okay in aggregate. I'm making that comment based on looking at big groups of numbers or looking
at the individual numbers in the specialty brands. I don't know if that we really learn anything that's
going to help us throughout. I think the biggest challenge we have right now is how do we really use our
human resources and our creativity to ramp up our off-premise businesses. And I have a lot of faith in our
leadership, and our folks operationally to be able to really make this a real focus and keep this business
growing throughout this crisis.

you could just give a little bit more color there about some of the options that would be available?

Ricardo Cardenas

Chris, we're hoping not to need any additional options, and that's why we pulled down our revolver to
get roughly $1 billion in cash on our balance sheet to get us through this. That said, we have excellent
banking relationships. We've been discussing other options with our banks. I don't want to get into the
details of that right now. But if we believe that, again, to be cautious, we need a little bit more. We think
we have access to more without getting into any of the details.

And I also appreciate all of what you're providing us at this tough time. Rick, you talked about KNAPP
at different times. You talked about your own sales in the most recent week. Can you just clarify, do
you think your trends are consistent with KNAPP? Are you outperforming, underperforming? We're all
starting to get a sense of the benchmark for the industry. Historically, Darden has outperformed KNAPP,
particularly just in some more challenging times. Can you just maybe -- if we then true-up those numbers,
can you talk about qualitatively if you think you are outperforming or underperforming peers?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

I would -- we don't have the KNAPP for the most recent week that I just told you about. So it's hard for
me to say whether we are outperforming then. But I believe we were outperforming before that, and we
wouldn't -- we would hope to continue to outperform. We have a lot of room to be able to grow our To Go
business. And the comment that I gave earlier was based on KNAPP regions, so different regions of the
country. And we don't have that level of data yet.

Percentage of your base now with the acquisition of Cheddar's, that you skew towards tourism or travel, if
you could give us an estimate on that? And then I had a follow-up on -- the follow-up when we come out
of this, Gene, how do you think the process would be if, God forbid, you did have a employee come down
with COVID, say, in July or August. Would you close down the store? Is this going to be something that is
going to be treated greater than other viruses that might enter the building and cause closures of stores,
you believe?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

No, John (sic) [ Matt ], I think that depending on the situation, how long the -- when did the employee
work? How many days prior were they out before they were diagnosed? What I'm seeing in other
businesses is that retail establishments are not closing. We would do a -- another level of cleaning if that
was the case. But I wouldn't expect major closures over having an employee diagnosed with COVID-19.

Matthew James DiFrisco
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then on the tourist travel skew, if you don't mind?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Matt, we don't have that in front of us. But I can tell you one of our biggest states is Florida. And
that we are still operating under our own capacity constriction -- restrictions of 50% utilization of our
restaurant, even with Cheddar's. Cheddar's was primarily a Southeast brand. And we haven't seen as
many mandated closures in the Southeast as we've seen in other parts of the country. That said, tourism
is likely down. But that's also in what we've had in the last week. So if you think about the last couple of
weeks, it was a big spring break time. And the week that we're in is a big spring break time. And then the
other thing is the impacts that we're seeing are much more pronounced in Fine Dining than they are in the
casual space right now. And that's in our presentation.

Got it. And then maybe just variable margin, you talked about it. Is there a minimum hurdle at which
variable margin is positive for To Go mix? Is that 5%, 10%, 15%? Is there a level at which that doesn't
become variable margin positive?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Well, I mean, there -- if we do very little To Go business, and we have someone sitting there waiting to
take the order, that's where the variable margin gets negative. But our variable margins are pretty good in
To Go. It's just a stairstep. It's not a straight line on To Go because you've got somebody manning phones
or something like that.

That said, if our To Go business gets to be too low and we look at it on an individual restaurant basis, if
our variable margins are negative, we probably end up closing that restaurant. But it's still too early to
determine that. We're also using -- we've got managers in our restaurants that they can help. They don't
have as many things to do in the dining room, so they can do some To Go. And so we're able to maybe
run a little bit fewer hourly employees during this time frame and use managers in some of this To Go
