CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Centene Corporation Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jen Gilligan, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Jennifer Lynch Gilligan
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021
earnings results conference call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah London,
Vice Chairman; and Drew Asher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host
this morning's call, which can also be accessed through our website at centene.com.

Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-
looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking
statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent
Form 10-Q filed today and the Form 10-K dated February 22, 2021, and other public SEC filings, including
the risks and uncertainties described with respect to the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business
and results of operations. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its
estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some
point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.

The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures, with the most
directly comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our third quarter 2021 press release, which is
available on the company's website under the Investors section. Additionally, please mark your calendars
for our upcoming 2022 guidance meeting to be held on December 10. We will invite sell-side analysts to
participate in person in New York and ask others to participate virtually.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's Third Quarter Earnings Call
today. As you will notice today, we are evolving our presentation format to a streamline version and with
essential facts and commentary. I'm pleased to have Sarah London and Drew Asher joining me today.
Brent Layton has a conflict that could not be avoided, but you can expect him to join us on future calls.

First, on the quarter. We were pleased with the results and the fact that the matrix were straightforward
with minimum noise. In the quarter, we generated revenue of $32.4 billion, an HBR of 88.1% and adjusted
earnings per share of $1.26. Drew will provide additional context.

Overall, the numbers reflect a return towards normal utilization, while still covering reasonable amounts
of COVID costs, which seemed to have peaked in August. Importantly, our performance provides a strong
foundation for our value creation plan, and we remain committed to our margin goals.

Further supporting our strategic progress during the quarter, we announced a series of organizational
changes, including appointing Sarah London as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Brent Layton
as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

I would also like to acknowledge that David Steward, an 18-year veteran of our Board of Directors, retired
to pursue personal business interest. We do not plan to replace his position as we continue to work on
refreshing and streamlining the Board to a size of 9 to 13 members.

Turning to the current landscape. Overall, the portfolio is performing well. We delivered a strong
membership increase in Medicaid, our position for continued growth in Medicare, and we continue to stay
the course in the marketplace. Sarah will provide further details.

We are working closely with states on the timing of redetermination, which has so far been extended
until January with the opportunity for additional extensions 3 months at a time. As redeterminations do
resume, I would like to remind you that not all states will be doing so at the same time.

In addition, we look forward to offering members who no longer qualify for Medicaid the opportunity to
enroll in our marketplace product. We expect that advanced premium tax credits will keep costs in line
for these members, and we value the opportunity to support continuity of care and preserve provider
relationships, which, in the long term, leads to higher quality of care, which is much more cost effective.

Looking ahead to 2022, there are several additional factors we continue to monitor and evaluate. These
include the pace of the RFP pipeline, ongoing growth in Medicare, the opportunity for improvement in
marketplace launches as well as the COVID landscape overall. We will provide full detail on these factors
and their potential impact as headwinds and tailwinds at our Investor Day in December.

In addition, we are committed to achieving an investment-grade rating and a disciplined capital
allocation framework that takes into consideration our priorities, including investing in our business, debt
management and share repurchases.

Before I close, I would like to highlight the importance of vaccine mandates in stopping the transmission
of COVID and protecting those who cannot yet safely receive inoculations, particularly the immunologically
compromised and young children for whom vaccine access is getting closer, but still pending. Centene
has been a leader on this critical issue mandating vaccinations as a condition of employment. We also
continue to support our members in assessing the vaccine to national outreach and campaigns and
creative participation, such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame and NASCAR.

I would also like to remind you that this platform for vaccines has been in development for the past 25
years, and scientists are indicating it's likely one of the safest vaccines ever developed.

In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the sustained momentum across the
enterprise. We remain focused on executing across the value creation playbook we have in place. As
always, we intend to continue to provide transparent updates as we progress through our initiatives, and I
look forward to seeing many of you at our December Investor Day.

Finally, I'd like to thank all our employees for their unwavering commitment and service throughout this
unprecedented times. Thank you for your continued interests in Centene, and I would turn the call over to
Sarah.

Sarah M. London
President of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology & Vice Chairman

Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide highlights of our product line
performance before touching on the early progress we are making around our value creation plan. During
the quarter, we continued to build on our market-leading position and are experiencing solid growth
and good outcomes. In Medicaid, our business continues to perform well. Membership increased to 14.8
million, aided by continued suspension of redeterminations and the go-live of our business in North
Carolina.

In Marketplace, with more than 90% of our membership receiving some form of subsidy, we maintained
our low income focus and our commitment to providing health care access and affordability to our
members. At the end of the third quarter, our Marketplace membership was 2.2 million, and we are
pleased with the progress of our clinical initiatives as we head into the fourth quarter.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

Looking ahead, our 2022 Marketplace offerings reflect the diverse and evolving needs of end better
consumers. We are introducing a group of new products designed to optimize flexibility, access and
affordability. In addition, we plan to grow our coverage map by entering 5 new states with Marketplace
products.

As we continue to monitor policies and plans around the return of Medicaid redeterminations, we believe
that our enhanced footprints within both Medicaid and Marketplace position Centene well to support our
members with options for coverage continuity.

In Medicare Advantage, we continue to see a compelling growth opportunity for the company. We are
expanding Centene's footprint to reach 48 million Medicare-eligible adults across the country, which is
more than 75% of eligible beneficiaries. Today, Centene serves more than 1.2 million Medicare Advantage
members across 33 states. Beginning in 2022, the company expects to offer plans in 327 new counties,
representing a 26% increase and 3 new states, including Massachusetts, Nebraska and Oklahoma.

Now turning to our value creation plan. As we outlined this past June, we have embarked on our strategy
to leverage Centene's size and scale and drive margin expansion through SG&A efficiencies, medical
management initiatives and strategic capital deployment. We are focused on generating sustained growth
and margin expansion. And although it is still very early, seeing the enterprise-wide commitment from the
outset has given me confidence that we are on the right track to achieve our goal. Brent, Drew and I are
leading this effort, and we believe we now have an organizational structure in place to drive this forward
across our business and functions.

On the SG&A front, we have identified opportunities across the company where we believe we can be
more efficient. This isn't about cost-cutting, it's about positioning the company for long-term success. For
example, we piloted new technology within our call centers for use by Centene employees. This technology
trial yielded significant reductions in cycle times and now will be rolled out enterprise-wide.

Another opportunity we've mentioned as a value creation target is pharmacy. As we alluded to in June, we
are now taking steps toward consolidating down to a single PBM platform and rationalizing those platforms
we view as nonessential. We began this work in Q3 and look forward to providing more detail around this
overall program in December.

In addition, we are progressing on the review and potential sale of certain non-core assets as part of our
portfolio optimization process, which has taken on an increased focus as part of the value creation plan.
Again, we are in the very early stages and as we continue to leverage our size and scale to our benefit,
these are just a few of the many levers we are pulling to achieve our adjusted net income margin target of
at least 3.3%. Let me remind you that as we progress through these and other initiatives, particularly in
2023 and 2024, we anticipate seeing a greater impact pushing us toward our goal.

Before handing the call over to Drew, let me provide a quick update on the Magellan transaction. We are
still awaiting one final regulatory approval in California and continue to expect the deal to close by the end
of 2021. We continue to work with the regulators to move the transaction to completion.

Now let me turn the call over to Drew to provide more details on our third quarter performance and our
updated outlook.

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Sarah. This morning, we reported third quarter 2021 results, including $32.4 billion in
revenue, an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and adjusted diluted earnings per
share of $1.26. Revenue grew by $3.3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020 and total membership
increased to 26.5 million, up 5% compared to a year ago. Our Q3 consolidated HBR was 88.1%, right on
track with our full year guidance.

At a webcast presentation in mid-September, we provided insights into the first 2 months of the quarter.
As a reminder, in July, we saw subsidence in pent-up demand in our Marketplace business, followed in
August by a spike in COVID cost due to the Delta variant. Consistent with national data, our COVID cost

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

peaked in late August, dropped throughout September and the sharp drop of COVID cost continues in
October. While the Delta variant had a higher peak, as measured in authorizations compared to January
2021, it peaked and fell rather quickly. With our diversified enterprise, we were able to manage through
this given our steady performance in Medicaid and Medicare. Accordingly, we are maintaining the midpoint
of our consolidated HBR range for 2021, just shrinking the width of the range since we're 3/4 through the
year.

Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% in the third quarter, with higher short-term variable incentive
compensation costs compared to Q2 given the positive trajectory of the business. While we are getting
some SG&A leverage on our growth in 2021, there's a lot more to come over the next few years as we
execute on the value creation plan.

One item to point out from a mix standpoint, Circle, a well-positioned ASC like hospital enterprise in
England has an SG&A rate in the 30s on service fee revenue of approximately $1.4 billion. This has an
approximate 30 basis point mathematical impact on our consolidated SG&A rate for Q3 2021 and going
forward.

Continuing on highlights of the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations in the third quarter was strong
at $1.8 billion. With respect to unregulated cash, we had $2.7 billion at quarter end, which includes the
$1.8 billion we borrowed to partially fund the Magellan transaction. We expect to need approximately $2.3
billion of unregulated cash to close Magellan in the fourth quarter.

Debt at quarter end was $18.8 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 41.2%, inclusive of Magellan financing
and excluding our nonrecourse debt. Our medical claims liability totaled $14.1 billion at quarter end and
represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 48 in Q2. This 3-day increase was driven by the timing
of state-directed payments, claims payments and state fee schedule changes.

You'll see a couple of items in our GAAP to adjusted EPS reconciliation, a $309 million onetime gain as
a result of our acquisition of the remaining 60% of Circle in early July 2021 and a write-down of our
investment in RxAdvance of $229 million in the quarter as we are simplifying our pharmacy operations.
Both of these are noncash items.

Before we get to updated 2021 guidance, I want to comment on the recently announced rating year
2022 Star scores. This will drive 2023 Medicare revenue. We are certainly pleased with over 50% of
membership and 4-star contracts and our first 5-star contract. Rating year 2022 benefited from the
continuation of disaster provisions due to COVID with an expectation of those provisions sunsetting and
upon reviewing the in-process results of our quality program, we expect rating year 2023 scores to drop
followed by a subsequent jump in rating year 2024 scores. This essentially has the effect of providing
some fungible investment dollars for calendar year 2023.

We've updated our full year 2021 outlook, including a narrowed adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.05 to
$5.15. This outlook incorporates revenues within a range of $125.2 billion to $126.4 billion, increased by
the inclusion of Circle and expected state-related pass-through payments of $500 million. It includes an
expected HBR of 87.6% to 88.0% and an SG&A ratio of 8.2% to 8.6%, 20 basis points higher than the
prior guidance, with the largest driver being the mixed math on Circle as we just discussed.

While we still have a quarter to go to finish 2021, the strength of our diversified enterprise has enabled us
to manage through the volatility of COVID, pent-up demand and resulting 2021 Marketplace pressure. This
enterprise strength will only improve as we execute on the value creation plan over the next few years.

With regards to 2022, consistent with our public comments in September, we continue to expect modest
adjusted EPS growth next year. We look forward to providing more details around 2022 expectations and
going more in depth into the long-term value creation drivers during our December 10 Investor Day.
Thank you for your interest, and operator, you can now open up the line for questions.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin at Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

Question on sort of 2022 top line. And I know the June Investor Day, I think you talked about $124 billion,
a pretty stale number at this point. But I'm curious, specifically as to sort of how you think about that
top line just directionally next year? And specifically, as we're starting to see a little bit of the competitive
environment for both MA and exchanges in the open enrollment period for next year?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

I will give you the bridge on Investor Day to walk you across to the full results. But as Drew and others in
this room have indicated today, we see continued strength in our Medicare product, Medicaid and we see
-- we think we're holding our own and doing better in the Marketplace. So on balance, we see growth in
the top line, obviously, and some modest growth in the bottom line coming from that.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

Got you. And just a follow-up. So if we thought about that as sort of mid-single-digit top line growth and
something very similar on the bottom line, is that kind of what you guys are talking about in terms of
modest growth?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

I think that's a good place to be right now. Yes.

Operator

Our next question today comes from Matt Borsch at BMO Capital Markets.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes, I was just hoping maybe you could sort of revisit the headwinds and tailwinds for next year? I'm not
looking, obviously, guidance isn't going to come until your December 10 event. And maybe if there's a
particular focus there, sort of the magnitude at least directionally of the headwind you expect from the
Medicaid redeterminations?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll start, and Sarah and some others can jump in. But we've said that we saw there's a headwind
there, but we're not sure of the timing. It will vary by state. And depending on the state of the economy
and where things are, it could be continued 3 months at a time, so we're not going to be precised on the
timing.

But we see it mitigated by the fact that with the advanced tax credits and things supporting the
Marketplace that individuals will be able to move over to our Marketplace as well as maintain their
network, their relationships with physicians, which will be a mitigating factor. And as we get closer, we see
how it's all developing. In December, we hope to be able to give you additional detail.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

It appears our next question today will come at A.J. Rice at Crédit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I would just be curious, you guys have talked now for 2 quarters about this idea of reviewing non-core
assets as well as today, you've got more explicit commentary about the pharmacy benefit management
restructuring. I know you're probably not going to say what you're looking at doing on the non-
core assets, but do we have a sense of timing? Is that something that will happen over the near to
intermediate term? Or is that more of a long-term review?

And on the PBM restructuring, is that -- I think before you talked about maybe 23 relevant contracts were
coming up for renewal. Is something based on your announcement today making that a more near-term
opportunity to realize savings? Or is this still sort of something that will impact '23 and '24?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

I'll start, and Drew and others can jump in, Sarah, but the evaluation and what we're doing with non-
core assets to start at any time. It's an ongoing thing, it's not something in the future, but I expect as
we achieve the expected results from what we're doing and you can stay tuned, you'll see it starting to
happen sooner than later.

And -- but once again, we're not -- it's not how fast, it's how well. And we're sure that we get -- we
maximize the value and protect the individuals involved in it. So -- but it's something that -- it's not --
we're not talking to look for this in '23, '24. It could be -- you should expect some indications of what's
happening sooner.

Sarah, do you want to add something?

Sarah M. London
President of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology & Vice Chairman

I would just echo that we're actively in the process and as Michael said, I think there will be more
information coming both in the short term and on an ongoing basis because this is part of the discipline of
looking at the portfolio overall.

On the pharmacy front, I would say, we're very focused short term on logical consolidation as we talked
about as well as rationalization of non-core platforms. And as we've said before, we have an RFP launching
in 2022 that's more focused on the long term. This, I think, is a great example and sort of microcosm of
the value creation opportunity. And so our plan is to actually go through this in detail in a case study in
December, so that you can understand all of the moving parts.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck at Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

If I understand what you've been saying so far around utilization, it sounds like the Medicare and Medicaid
businesses have been performing relatively well, but the exchange businesses are still seeing pressure.
Can you comment a little bit more about what exactly you're seeing from an MLR and cost structure
perspective? And then how you feel like your pricing for next year would reflect that? Have you caught
everything? Should we expect normal margins next year? Or is there a reason to believe that it hasn't
been fully reflected yet?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

Thanks, Kevin. This is Drew. We certainly expect to make progress towards our 5 to 7.5 pretax long-term
goal for marketplace next year, and we sort of price to sort of move in that direction.

With respect to the quarter, as I mentioned, we saw subsidence in pent-up demand in July, which was
good to see. Actually, Marketplace took it the hardest in terms of the August spike in the Delta variant of
COVID, but it retreated pretty quickly. So there was still pressure in the quarter on Marketplace.

But you're right, the strength of Medicare and Medicaids were carried through the portfolio as a whole.
And we look forward to the expansion that Sarah mentioned in Marketplace and some of the new
products that will address some of the competition. And we expect to make margin expansion progress in
Marketplace next year as one of the tailwinds going into 2022.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes, I guess one of your competitors signaled that there was maybe lower visibility than normal in the risk
adjustment on the exchanges this year because of the special enrollment period. I guess how do you feel
about that this quarter and your visibility into that this year and next?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, you're right. We managed and we sort of tracked the 4 cohorts of the Marketplace business, the
renewal cohort, the new cohort in AEP, the SEP, special enrollment period pre-May and then the SEP May
plus, when the subsidies, the enhanced APTCs were in place.

And so we can track the med cost drivers. And you're right, because it's a partial year for those new
members, you have a more limited risk adjustment opportunity, both in terms of having the acuity
reflected in risk adjustment and then just the calendar of having them less than 12 months. But we expect
them to roll into next year with the full year of that opportunity.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

There's also some COVID-related costs that were not subject to risk adjustment. So that has an impact on
it as well. So it's not a typical year. It was really atypical in a lot of ways.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Justin Lake at Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

First, a quick follow-up on Kevin's question. Drew, can you -- I think you had talked about the fact that at
least at the high end of the MLR range, you're assuming that exchanges might be kind of breakeven this
year? Can you give us an update there?

And then one thing I noticed on the accruals for medical cost payable. Looks like your reserves grew
pretty significantly in the quarter relative to premiums. Is that just trying -- Drew, you kind of take over --
taken a little bit more conservative view on kind of how you set that? Or was there something mechanical
there?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the last point, it was a little bit more mechanical. I mean, clearly, reserve strength is an important
factor of running a good business. But we outlined the 3-day increase sequential as there's pass-through
payments that are sitting on our balance sheet that need to get to their ultimate homes. And then there's
some timing of pharmacy invoices and other things, sort of mechanical that's driving that 3-day increase
sequentially.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

And then on Marketplace, you're right, we priced for margin expansion off of this year. As Michael said,
look, this is a choppy and difficult year in Marketplace with the various COVID impacts, including the pent-
up demand in Q2 and the risk adjustment changes that CMS made earlier this year. But the good news is
we maintained our HBR guidance. We've got a great portfolio, a diversified portfolio across the businesses.
So we were able to withstand those headwinds in 2021 that we expect to flip into tailwinds going into
2022 in the Marketplace business.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Randy Giacobbe with Citi -- I'm sorry, Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Again, just to Justin's question. Can you give us a sense of exchange margins and where they are
this year, I guess, first? And then second, you talked about redetermination, both in terms of sort of
timing around sort of the PHE. Just want to understand that a little bit more in terms of state discretion
around that, I guess. And then the last piece of it, can you give us a sense of how you view profitability
between Medicaid and HiCCs generally? So if you do recapture those lives, how we should think about the
economics of that?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the margin question, we're below our target. That's obvious this year, and we need to make
progress towards that in 2022 with respect to Marketplace. And then you're right, there is an opportunity.
We're sort of pegging the redetermination timing. We mentioned this in that September conference that
was webcast in the summertime of 2022. That's consistent with the CBO's baseline update in July.

But thereafter, as Michael mentioned, it's going to be a state-by-state sort of determination of the duration
of that redetermination process, but it's great to have an expanded footprint in Marketplace. And you're
right, we need to sort of price for those members in 2023 to come into the marketplace business and
make sure we're -- we've got attractive products for them.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

I just want to add to one question in terms of -- I'm not going to try and guess how a state will determine
when they're going to do something. We have enough experience to know that it's not that predictable,
and it could be a new director besides that to do it now. There's just so many different variables, it's just
an individual judgment that -- it's not a science that we can hang our hat on.

Operator

Our next question today comes from Scott Fidel at Stephens.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I wonder if you can talk a bit about the current staffing pressures in the broader health care market? And
whether that's having any impact on any of your businesses? And then how that's influencing provider
contracting and whether you need to make any adjustments for that? And then just as a follow-up, just
wanted to clarify on Josh's question. Michael, I think you did say that you think that mid-single-digit revs
and EPS is a good placeholder for now. Just want to -- actually for 2022, just wanted to clarify that --
actually your view on that, yes?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

I'll take part and others can jump in. Yes, that's a good place to start for a placeholder now until we get
together in December. Relative to staffing, yes, we're feeling pressures. We have some -- we think some

solutions that will work for us and we're making work, but I'm not going to, for competitive reasons,
disclose it all.

And the other thing it's done is -- we're accelerating our use of AI and we're updating our systems
and capabilities so that we're becoming more efficient, which will have the benefit also longer term of
contributing to our margin expansion. And so using some of these techniques that Sarah and others
have developed and the team, it's freeing up nurses and others to do higher-value activities and case
management. So we're facing some of the same issues. Just we're fortunate to have the size, scale and
versatility to be able to deal with it.

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

On the 2022 question, once again, it's probably best to wait for that bridge because Magellan will be a
piece of it, the annualization of Circle. So probably better to wait and see all of the pieces rather than to
make a broad estimate of 2022.

And then once again, I want to mention -- I mentioned one of the tailwinds being improvement of
Marketplace margins. In fairness, I want to remind you guys of what we said in past conferences on a
couple of the headwinds, Medicaid reversion to the mean on MBR, on HBR as well as pharmacy carve-outs
in a couple of our states, which are not insignificant in terms of the revenue and bottom line impact. So
those are all factored into our assessment of modest adjusted EPS growth for next year.

Operator

And our next question comes from Lance Wilkes at Bernstein.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes. I had a question for you, Sarah, and it was really related to strategic investment spending as kind of
a component of the margin improvement plan. And I was just interested in maybe the overall implications
for CapEx expenditures, for strategic investments like digital and value-based care. What would be your
priorities and the magnitude of investment? And then on the non-core divestitures, are the benefits of that
proceeds, then you can use for something? Or are the benefits of that getting rid of sort of money losing
or lower-margin businesses?

Sarah M. London
President of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology & Vice Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Lance. Great question. So as we think about the value creation plan, as Michael has already
touched on, a big piece of it is driving efficiency in our operations. And so obviously, focused on agility and
data and working towards leveraging Artificial Intelligence, automation we've talked a lot about, that's a
huge priority and we think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit there.

So making sure that we have the right talent and we have the right tools. Obviously, Apixio is a piece of
that, but we think there are others. There are pieces of that, that we are developing ourselves. So that,
I think, is a real foundational piece of all of this. And then being able to reinvest the savings that we get
from those efficiencies to continue sort of the flywheel of value creation is also part of the plan.

And then relative to the divestitures, I think the answer varies -- will vary on a case-by-case basis. And
in some cases, that has to do with positioning assets in such a way that we think they will be beneficial
to longer-term strategy in different areas, whether that's around provider enablement further domains
that we think are important as we move to value-based arrangements or core tools that we think will have
a greater benefit to the broader industry. So it really is on a case-by-case basis. And as we get through
those, our intention would be to provide a broader rationale for all of that decision-making.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

I'm going to give you one example on AI and things that I've been talking about to some extent. And
we're rolling this out. It takes a nurse 18 minutes to go through a chart to preauthorize on average. We
now have AI and systems in place that, that same decision approving it can be done in 1 second. Think
about that. And think about the fact that we will have a satisfied member who's sitting there. The doctors
who's saying, "My goodness, it was approved before I could finish typing the request."

Now if it's a no, there will still be human intervention because we're not going to have that. But I think we
were talking yesterday in technology. Probably 2/3 of these cases are approved using the AI. We've rolled
it out to 5 or 6 states now. So it's well tested.

But that's an example. So all of a sudden, we now have the ability to take a nurse and move her from
the routine -- from the monotonous reading charts to doing things in case managing, and that creates a
much more productive environment. I just used that as an example that makes it real as to how we're
overcoming the labor issues.

Our next question today comes from Ricky Goldwasser at Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Sir, couple of follow-up questions here. First one, just for clarification. Drew, I heard you both say 2022
EPS growth is going to be modest, but then I also heard you say mid-single digits. So I just wanted to
make sure we're thinking about it correctly. To me, modest is low single digit versus mid.

Secondly, on the PBM and consolidation into a new platform, I'm assuming that, that CVS that you work
with in the past. But I think I also heard Sarah, you're saying that you're going to launch an RFP in 2022.
So just want to clarify that and what would be the time line for that?

And then the new question is just if you can give us examples of the new products that you're introducing
in the Marketplace? I think you've been talking about some exciting new things that you're putting in the
market. If you can give us some details around that?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Ricky, this is Drew. Let me start with your first question. The modest adjusted EPS growth next year
takes into account everything we know sitting here today. I think you're referring to the mid-single-digit
reference was -- goes back to our June Investor Day, that's on the revenue. That's sort of long-term
organic revenue mid-single digits. And I think a question was asked earlier that maybe conflated the 2. On
the PBM opportunity, Sarah?

Sarah M. London
President of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology & Vice Chairman

Yes. So as I said, in the short term, we've been focused on consolidating with our existing external vendor.
And then you are correct, we are launching an RFP in 2022 that would award 1/1/2023. And so the goal
there is to make sure that we are staying sharp relative to our external partners and getting the greatest
economic benefit where we are leveraging an external partner for our core capability.

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Let me jump in because I'm the guy who loves doing these RFPs for PBM services. Yes, we would launch
sometime in 2022 for the -- our contract ends at the end of '23 for 1/1/24, and that's going to be a huge
opportunity for an external PBM.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

On the new products, I'm going to be a little tight lift on it until it hits the Marketplace. But I'd say, it takes
advantage of our systems capability, the broad and effective networks we have, I think will put us in a
competitive place without following the joint race to the bottom.

And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter at Wells Fargo.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the exchange discussion for 2022. So obviously, a lot of data has become
available in the past couple of days. It seems like you're consistent with your comments, much more
focused on margin, perhaps more so than others in the Marketplace. I was hoping you could discuss
what you're seeing across the market at this stage? And whether you think there's a conclusion that you
reached about the outlook for membership growth as you think about 2022?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, you're right to point out that we tilted a little bit more towards margin than we have in the past in
terms of our pricing posture, but we're still well positioned in a number of markets. And it's -- look, we're
just in the AEP now. It's too tough to call whether we'll grow a little or shrink a little. But the important
thing is to maintain the base and drive margin expansion as we roll out and test some of these new
products and provide what we think is an excellent value proposition to the growing population eligible for
exchanges, thanks to the special enrollment period and the enhanced advanced premium tax credits.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

We did well doing this special enrollment period, very well, in fact. And I remind you that the advanced
tax credits have tended to minimize the pricing advantage that we may have. And so, on balance, I'll say I
want to be cautiously optimistic that we'll be -- that people will be pleased with the results we achieve.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And just a quick related follow-up. I just wanted to ask about the recent announcement that you launched
a virtual-first plant and the exchanges in partnership with Teladoc. Any sense you can give us on the
longer-term strategy there? And maybe also talk a little bit about the cost difference that provides you
versus traditional offerings?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

May I ask Kevin to go ahead?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Kevin Counihan, you're on the call.

Kevin, are you there?

We have 2 virtual care products. First, we have -- in the Marketplace, we have our Ambetter virtual access
product that we're piloting in 4 states. And the second one, which I think you're referring to, is the virtual-
first product that we're piloting for employers.

The things that they have in common is 24/7 access for urgent care, prevention, screenings, and care
management, $0 cost for virtual care via the Teladoc network and also access to our in-network providers,
as needed. So we're -- there's a lower price point for each of these products, and we're excited about their
introduction.

Our next question today comes from Gary Taylor at Cowen.

Gary Paul Taylor
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Just had a couple of questions. Thinking about the potential headwind from the Medicaid MLR normalizing
or returning to mean, Drew. How do we think about the year-to-date sort of retro state adjustments you
called out? I think beginning of the year was kind of thinking that would be $400 million. I think, last
quarter, it was up to $675 million. We know some of those are expiring like in Michigan, but do we just --
I guess the conclusion is just that the underlying Medicaid medical expense benefit to you this year is still
larger than those retro adjustments?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, those are starting to tail off. You're right. It was $675 million in Q2. At the end of Q3, our full year
forecast is $820 million. And while some of those risk corridors carry into the first half of next calendar
year because it coincides with the state's fiscal year, those, we expect largely to sunset the COVID era risk
corridors and other mechanisms.

So you're right. That's been the governor on the underlying stronger utilization performance in Medicaid
during the pandemic and coming out of it. So obviously, that mutes the forward impact. But we still do
think there'll be sort of a reversion to a little bit higher HBR as we look ahead in Medicaid. I think it's
responsible to assume that.

Gary Paul Taylor
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And would you say the same -- not to the same degree, but when we look at year-to-date performance
and Medicare Advantage across the industry and some of the deferred care there, that also seems like
a potential place where you could see some resetting or normalization of MLR? Is that something you
contemplate in your '22 outlook also?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Not so much in terms of Medicare Advantage. That's -- if you look at the delta COVID -- the delta
COVID impact in the quarter, because the high vaccination rate of seniors, actually the peak in Medicare
Advantage was actually below the January, whereas Medicaid and Marketplace were above that January
peak. So I'd look for more steadiness in Medicare Advantage, we expect to grow that business.

And then as I stated, I think at the June Investor Day and on the Q2 call, that becomes a margin
expansion opportunity for '23 and '24 as we can impact those bids, looking at those future calendar years.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I don't want to [indiscernible]. But we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. These are the
kinds of things we like to talk about at our Investor Day, and we'll have much more clarity, we would hope,
over the next couple of months, we can give you some really good information for your models.

Operator

And our next question today comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I guess, one, I wanted to follow up on Ricky's questions about the PBM RFP. And I don't know if you would
be willing to frame any kind of sense of magnitude around the savings opportunity, the margin expansion
opportunity that you see there? That's question one. And then I guess, just a very quick follow-up for
Drew, would just be the free cash flow performance in the quarter. It was great, Drew. I guess do you just
see this as kind of a catch-up? Or can you talk about maybe what's sustainable here? Or if there's kind of
to be a free cash flow reversion below net income that we should look forward to?

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the PBM RFP, we've stated a number of times, we've got well over $30 billion in pharmacy spend
across our products. And obviously, that's grown as the business grows. And you're right to point out,
and actually, if you look at our slides from the conference in September, it's certainly one of the value
creation opportunities with sort of a stair-step benefit 1/1/24, despite the fact that every year we push on
pharmacy costs and do market checks to improve the performance of the business. So we'll have to wait
and go through that process to see the value.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And when you look at the combined basis, the scale of our PBM purchases, the drug purchases.

Sarah M. London
President of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology & Vice Chairman

Yes. And I would just add. And again, I think we'll go through this in great detail in December. But when
you think about potential savings, it's not just from that RFP process, right? It's also the fact that we're
streamlining in terms of a vendor partner that we are rationalizing non-core platforms, which will result
in SG&A savings. We've got operating model opportunities there that we'll go through, and then a lot of
process automation opportunities within the PBM space. So when you think about the value that the PBM
work can drive to the value creation program, it's -- I think it obviously is inclusive of the RFP, but it goes
beyond that.

Andrew Lynn Asher
Executive VP & CFO

And then on the cash flow statement -- sorry, go ahead.

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I wanted to jump in with a quick PBM follow-up and maybe phrase it in a different way. I say besides cost,
what other factors are going to be important to you guys as you think about the process on the RFP?

Executive VP & CFO

Well, quality is always at the top of the list. Execution, the complexity of operating sort of a complex
customer such as Centene, I mean, that's pretty critical as well.

And then on the cash -- sorry, I was going to head to the cash flow question. The cash flow obviously is
driven by changes in the balance sheet. And so there are some things on the balance sheet represented
by that 3-day increase in DCP that will be paid out in the future. So you have to take that into
consideration when you take a look at our cash flow statement.

Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the
conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Yes, I have -- a member of the team here has indicated I misspoke when I said we're going
to be dropping the Board from 9 to 13. That number is actually 9 to 11, down from the current 13 , which
is a 12 now. So I wanted to clarify that. So I thank the people for -- we look forward to our Investor Day
in December when we can answer more of the questions with more detail and certainty. And stay healthy,
and have a good quarter. Thank you.
