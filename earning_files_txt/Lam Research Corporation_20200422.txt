LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Lam Research's March quarter earnings conference call. At this time, I
would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Tina Correia
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference
call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial
results for the March 2020 quarter and our outlook for the June 2020 quarter. The press release detailing
our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can
also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, along with the presentation
slides that accompany today's call.

Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying
slides in the presentation for additional information.

Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless
otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's
earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will
be made available later this afternoon on our website.

With that, I will hand the call over to Tim.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Tina, and welcome, everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well in these
very challenging times. Against the evolving backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lam delivered solid
financial results in the March quarter. I want to start by discussing how we are managing through the
current environment.

The impact from the globally spreading virus began to materialize in our manufacturing and supply chain
operations in the latter part of the March quarter as shelter-in-place orders went into effect across many
regions. We've responded effectively to these disruptions. And while near-term predictability remains
more difficult than usual, I am pleased to say that our essential manufacturing facilities and labs are
operating, allowing us to focus on critical customer deliverables. I am very grateful to our Lam employees
and partners around the world, who with tremendous commitment and dedication have risen to meet
extraordinary challenges.

Our focus at this time is concentrated in 3 key areas: first, our top priority remains the health and safety
of our employees, our partners and their families. From the start, we have actively sought the best
available guidance to formulate our response plans. And we are complying with all public health directives
in the locations in which we operate. All employees that can execute their roles remotely are doing so. And
through our expansion of our IT infrastructure capabilities, we have maintained a productive remote work
cadence.

To protect our employees that are working on-site at Lam locations, we have implemented rigorous safety
practices, including on-site temperature monitoring, mandatory use of personal protective equipment and
strict social distancing protocols.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

Second, we are executing our business continuity plans throughout our manufacturing and supply
chain network. Our capabilities are still limited compared to normal operation. But as the pandemic has
impacted different parts of the world at different times and to different degrees, we and our supply chain
partners are successfully leveraging our global footprint to support our customers' most critical priorities.
Past investments we have made to complement U.S. production capability with operations in Korea
and Taiwan have proven valuable as both of those countries have reported earlier stabilization of local
COVID-19 conditions. Similarly, we have worked closely with our suppliers on their challenges in specific
regions, and we are beginning to see signs of improving material availability.

Third, we are focused on increasing the capability and expertise of our regional field teams to meet our
customers' ongoing installed base needs, including installation of newly shipped systems. We anticipate
the cross-region travel will be discouraged for at least the near future, and therefore, we are working
closely with customers to significantly enhance remote support capabilities using advanced data collection
and information sharing technologies. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with how our teams have executed
to mitigate the impact of this global pandemic on our employees, our customers and our business.

I also recognize that we are very fortunate in this difficult time to be able to give back to our employees
and the communities that have helped us build our strong company. In early April, we announced the
creation of a $25 million relief fund to provide direct and immediate assistance to employees and others
around us most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am happy to say that in only 3 weeks, more than
half of our committed relief funds have already been deployed to help people affected by this crisis.

I'll now transition to our results in the broader industry environment. In the March quarter, we delivered
revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings per share of $3.98. Both results were below our original guidance,
which we whipped through late in the quarter as we saw production and supply constraints emerge due to
shelter-in-place orders.

Customer demand in the quarter was unchanged from our original view. We believe that our revenue
in the near-term will be determined primarily by the capacity of our global manufacturing and supply
chain network, as social distancing restrictions are expected to continue for the next several months in
locations in which we and our suppliers operate. While we are currently seeing improvements in both our
own operations and those of our suppliers, risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 crisis remain.
Consequently, we will not be providing our usual financial guidance for the June quarter. Doug and I will,
however, provide our best assessment of the environment in our comments in Q&A.

From our perspective, customer demand for equipment continues to remain very strong in the first half of
2020. We believe that WFE spending is largely being driven by customers investing in strategic initiatives,
including both foundry and memory technology transitions that will be critical to both capability and
competitiveness when global markets eventually emerge from the effects of the pandemic. The equipment
industry is currently supply constrained. We exited the March quarter with record backlog and would
expect to fulfill this unmet demand over the coming months.

Looking beyond the near-term impact, we remain strong believers in the underlying fundamentals
and resiliency of the semiconductor industry. Semiconductors have become so embedded into nearly
every industry, that we expect broad portfolio semiconductor equipment companies such as Lam, to see
offsetting areas of strength and weakness to help support results. This was our experience through the
trough of the recent industry cycle, where we saw increased foundry and logic spending offset memory
weakness.

Despite a 40% decline in memory spending in calendar year 2019, our revenues held up well compared
to prior cycles. As we assess the potential future impact of COVID-19 on our business, recent customer
commentary points to cloud and enterprise strength as an offset, at least in part to the weakness that
may be seen in more consumer-oriented end markets like smartphones and auto.

The need for equipment and capacity to support work-from-home initiatives is causing cloud service
providers to increase CapEx, creating the potential for a surge in server demand. Third-party estimates
suggest that cloud capacity would need to increase tenfold to service the peak workloads seen as shelter-
in-place rules went into effect. Although these heightened workloads are likely a short term phenomenon,

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

this event will underscore the need for companies to invest more in infrastructure and business continuity
capabilities as the data economy and our dependence on technology continues to expand over time.

The PC and server markets account for nearly half of DRAM and NAND bit demand on average. And
when you also consider that memory customers underinvested in capacity additions in 2019, causing
the industry to exit the year with supply growth well below long term demand, we believe there is
good reason to be confident in the healthy fundamentals of the memory market, near-term uncertainty
notwithstanding.

Longer term, our focus is on executing the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day event in March. Our
growing installed base business serves as a strong and stable foundation for company performance. And
as we committed, we have started disclosing our customer support business group or CSBG revenue
this quarter. Doug will cover this in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that in the March quarter, our
installed base revenues grew faster than installed base unit growth, consistent with our objective to
increase revenue capture per tool with additional value-added service offerings.

Within CSBG, we also continue to see strong activity in our Reliant business, which grew for the seventh
consecutive quarter and reached yet another record level. At this point, we see our CSBG business poised
for another growth year in calendar 2020.

From a share gain perspective, we are executing well on both penetrations and defenses so far this
year. In etch, we've seen wins across all segments: DRAM, NAND and foundry and logic. At our Investor
Day event, we launched our innovative new Sense.i etch platform targeted at both widening our lead in
critical applications and strengthening our competitiveness in the semi-critical space. COVID-19 related
manufacturing and supply chain disruptions have set our schedule back by a month or 2 from our original
plan. The customer pull for Sense.i has strengthened since launch. Sense.i was designed to deliver
advanced equipment intelligence, data analysis and self-maintenance capabilities to minimize required
on-site human intervention with the system. Customers have a heightened awareness of the value these
advanced capabilities can deliver, and we expect they will look to accelerate their adoption of smart fab
technologies. Sense.i is well positioned to deliver both the technology and data collection capabilities our
customers need to be successful.

In deposition, we're focused on served available market expansion opportunities that we believe, can be
accessed by accelerating conversions from older process technologies to our highly productive enhanced
atomic layer deposition, or ALD solution set.

We continue to execute on these opportunities in the March quarter with additional ALD metallization
wins for advanced logic nodes, and new dielectric gapfill penetrations in 3D NAND. In both cases, we
displaced older process technologies from our competitors with a more extendable Lam solution. Overall,
we are confident in the strength of Lam's position in the market and our opportunities for growth when the
current crisis subsides.

So to wrap up, the company is executing well during a very difficult time. Our global teams are working
tirelessly to mitigate operational impacts from COVID-19. And while near-term visibility is low, we believe
that long-term secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable WFE growth across
cycles. Thank you all again for joining and for your support.

I'll now turn it over to Doug.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today and what I know is
a challenging time for all of us. I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. As you're aware,
given the uncertainties with business disruptions around the world related to COVID-19, we withdrew
our March guidance on March 17. Despite the operational challenges, we delivered solid results in the
March quarter. Our revenues for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion, down $80 million from the December
quarter. The decrease was entirely due to production interruptions. Customer demand remained strong
through the quarter. I'd point out that we're exiting the March quarter with a strong level of deferred

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

revenue at $726 million. This was partly due to shipments that occurred at the end of the quarter that had
back ordered materials.

From an earnings per share perspective, the March quarter came in at $3.98, which was driven by strong
gross margin performance, focused expense management as well as a favorable tax rate. From a system
segment perspective, as expected, memory investments increased in the March quarter. The combined
memory segment increased to 56% of system revenues, rising from the December quarter at 52%. We
saw increases in NAND spending with investments focused on 64, 96 and initial 128-layer devices. DRAM
spending continues to be focused on node transitions, primarily on conversions to 1y and 1z. NAND was
the majority of memory investments at 40% of systems revenue, with DRAM coming in at 16%.

Foundry revenue strength continued with customer investments there focused on 7 and 5 nanometer.
As a percent of system revenue, foundry represented 31% of systems revenue as compared to 36% in
the December quarter. December quarter was the all-time high systems revenue level for our foundry
business. March was the second highest.

The logic and other segment was fairly flat in both dollar and percent concentration quarter-to-quarter
coming in at 13% of system revenue. Logic spending is driven by 10-nanometer, image sensors and other
specialty markets.

The China region continues to invest and came in at 32% of total revenues for the March quarter. The
majority of the China revenue again came from domestic Chinese customers. Also, as Tim noted, our
customer support business group revenue continued to grow in the March quarter. This is the first quarter
we're disclosing the specific revenue amount. You've likely seen the tables in our earnings release. The
installed base business came in at $856 million, which is an increase of approximately 3.5% from the
same quarter a year ago.

Gross margin for the March quarter was 46.3%. The strength in the March quarter gross margin is related
to customer and product mix. Gross margin was somewhat negatively impacted from lower-than-expected
output as well as increased spending in manufacturing and the supply chain. And just a reminder, our
actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volume, product mix and customer
concentration, and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter.

Operating expenses for the March quarter were $486 million, which was essentially flat with the December
quarter. The March quarter has normal seasonal increases as it always does at the beginning of the
calendar year.

We managed other variable expenses down during the quarter as we addressed the COVID-19 impacts on
our operations. We maintained our focus in critical business projects for our customers, with 2/3 of our
operating expense focused on research and development.

I also want to highlight for you that the benefits and cost of our deferred compensation program are
no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. As I've discussed in the past, we hedge this plan to
mitigate the exposure to the income statement with the OpEx offset to this historically showing up
in other income and expense. You can see the impacts of the market fluctuations related to deferred
compensation program in our GAAP reconciliation tables in the earnings release. These hedging offsets
remain mismatched in our GAAP results.

Operating income in the March quarter was $673 million, and operating margin was 26.9%. Our non-GAAP
tax rate this quarter was 8.3%. This rate was lower-than-expected due to incremental deductions from
equity compensation related to exercises during the quarter. We will have fluctuations in the tax rate from
quarter-to-quarter and we expect our rate for calendar year 2020 to be in the low teens level.

Other income and expense was up in the March quarter, coming in at approximately $30 million in
expense. The main components of other income and expense line are interest income from our cash and
investment balance, offset by interest expense related to our outstanding debt.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

We did have a small amount of incremental interest expense from the drawdown on our revolving credit
facility that occurred late in the quarter. You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate
quarter-to-quarter based on several market-related items like interest rates and foreign exchange.

Let me now move on to capital return. For the March quarter, $164 million of cash was deployed in
dividends and $146 million in share repurchase. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we have a long-term
plan for capital return of 75% to 100% of free cash flow. We have approximately $1.8 million -- excuse
me, $1.8 billion remaining on our $5 billion Board authorized buyback plan. In the current environment,
we will be slowing our buyback activity. It is likely we won't buy any stock back in the June quarter.

Diluted earnings per share, again, came in at $3.98. We ended the March quarter with diluted shares of
approximately 148 million shares, which was down from the December quarter level. This is the ninth
consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact
of a little more than 1 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you that dilution
schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your
reference.

Let me now move on to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted
cash, increased in the March quarter to $5.6 billion from $4.9 billion in the December quarter. The quarter-
to-quarter increase was due to strong cash flows from operations of $541 million as well as a $1.25 billion
drawdown on our revolving credit facility. We also had debt maturities and redemptions of more than $600
million in the March quarter that obviously reduced the cash balance.

Our strong balance sheet and cash generation capability continue to provide robust liquidity. DSO
increased to 80 days versus 72 days in the prior quarter. The increase is largely due to the timing of
collections and invoiced, but not yet revenue shipments that occurred at the end of the quarter. And I
would point out on the first day of the June quarter, we collected more than $370 million. Inventory turns
were 3.2 in the March quarter compared to 3.7 turns in the December quarter. Inventory was higher due
to the fact that output slowed from the COVID-19 situation.

Noncash expenses included approximately $40 million for equity compensation, $50 million for
depreciation and $17 million for amortization. March quarter capital expenditures were $51 million, which
was a decrease from $62 million in the December quarter. Ending headcount as of the March quarter end
was approximately 11,000 regular full-time employees, which is an increase from the December quarter of
approximately 300 people mainly to support field and factory operations.

For the June quarter, although we're not providing official guidance, I'll share some things for you to
consider when thinking about our June quarter financial performance. We are seeing the following
dynamics. Capacity limitations are coming from our supply chain as well as adjustments in factory
operations to maximize output considering social distancing challenges. We plan to add resources during
the quarter to increase our output capability. Demand remains strong. We are output constrained. These
capacity challenges will negatively impact revenue and gross margins. If our current assessment of our
output capability turns out to be correct, revenue in the June quarter should be higher than March. There
is obviously uncertainty around that statement.

The CSBG business remains resilient. Our priorities are the health and safety of our employees and
partners as well as taking care of our customers. We will spend incrementally in these areas. We will
actively control costs in other areas. Interest expense will be up from the revolver drawdown, and share
count is likely to be flat.

So to summarize, we see continued strength in foundry and logic going into the June quarter. We also
see -- excuse me, memory demand continuing to strengthen. The long-term outlook for our business
continues to be solid and consistent with what you heard from us at our Investor Day in early March. That
concludes my prepared remarks.
Operator, Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And glad to hear you're all healthy. First question, I guess, revolves around the demand side. And
obviously, you talked about supply constraints. How are you, I guess, prioritizing customer demand? And
have you seen any demand disruption given the uncertainty to COVID? Or just too early to see anything
works out on that front?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I guess we -- C.J., we are working very, very closely with all of our customers to help prioritize
shipments in the order of greatest need for the customer. So you can imagine critical R&D programs,
where there's a technology conversion that requires a one of a kind tool, specific capacity bottlenecks that
are critical to their factory output or deliver to specific customers of theirs. And so one of the great things
about Lam having built very strong customer relationships over all these years is that we really partnered
with them to understand their priorities. And we do have fair flexibility within our own operations to
prioritize certain tools ahead of others for a specific customer. And so I'd say it's through very, very close
coordination with the customers we are trying to meet their needs. It's -- I guess, I would say, maybe the
simple answer is we've seen no demand destruction, no change in demand. One could say maybe that's
-- it's too early to see that. But we really haven't sensed in any conversation with the customers today, a
change in demand. So our focus is really on how to get the tools to them that they need.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Very helpful. As my follow-up, I guess, on the supply chain side, is that more upstream in your ability to
produce the tools, get parts, perhaps issues in Malaysia? Or is it more logistics of getting the tools actually
to customers? And then I guess as part of that, Doug, if you could help at all, how do you think about the
implications to gross margins as you obviously bring on more resources to satisfy customers' demand in
this crazy world?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

I'll take the first part of that. It -- I'd say some of the supply challenges, they're kind of across the board,
but clearly I think most people are quite aware of the control orders that are in place in Malaysia, which
is -- tends to be for many equipment companies, a large subsystem supplier. Lam, we've -- one of our
strengths, both operationally and financially, has been a supply chain operation that allows us to do what
we call merging transit. And so therefore, some of the subsystems never actually come to Lam facilities.
They arrive directly at customer sites. If those don't arrive obviously, the system cannot ship complete. So
it's across the board. Materials coming into our facilities, which we feel are operating quite effectively right
now, but also coming out of major subsystem suppliers in places, as you noted, places like Malaysia and
others. So that's quite extensive.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, C.J., I mean, I'll give you a little flavor of how we're running things in areas that are probably going
to be a little bit of a drag on gross margin. And I won't quantify it specifically, but I'll give you some stuff
to think about. Basically, what's happening is, given the need to have social distancing, we're needing to
space people out further away from one another in the factory environment. And obviously, that means

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

we can generate less output per square meter, per square foot, what have you. So essentially, what we're
trying to do, C.J., is moving into incremental space where we have it, take some incremental space where
we have it and bring incremental people into that other space. Obviously, in an environment like that,
you're doing everything you can take care of the customer and generate revenue for that matter, but
you're going to be less efficient in terms of your ability to be super-efficient on the gross margin line.
Other things that are going on, as I'm sure you're aware, freight logistics is more expensive right now.
It's up a decent amount in certain areas. So we're having to spend more to get materials coming into the
factory as well as giving them to customers. I'm not going to quantify it for you specifically, but the way I
would want you to be thinking about it is we've been in the gross margin range over the last 5, 6, 7 years.
I think what you're going to see is we will trend towards the lower end of where you've seen our gross
margin over that time frame. I don't think we'll go below the range we've been in, but I think we will be
towards the lower end, given the dynamic I described.

Operator

We'll take our next question from John Pitzer of Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Appreciate all the color you gave, given the uncertainty. Doug, I'm just kind of curious, can you quantify
what the supply impact was to revenue in the March quarter? And is it going to be larger in the June
quarter despite June revenue being up? And do you expect to kind of get most of these behind you by the
end of the June quarter, so as you go into the second half of the calendar year supply is less of an issue?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. John, I'll take you back. Our original guide was $2.8 billion, plus/minus $200 million. And we kind of
realized the last couple of weeks of the quarter and our limited ability, we might end up ending below the
low end of that range, and we did. So that was the impact. We came into the quarter expecting to be able
to deliver $2.8 billion and I'll remind you that as we began last quarter, we basically said, again, demand
is actually stronger than that, but it was the beginning of things beginning to break out in Wuhan, and
we knew there was going to be some supply chain impact. So that's kind of what went on there, John.
Now obviously, we're getting much better at operating in this environment. We brought the factory back
online. We got people back to work. We're hiring people. We're moving into incremental space. So I think
we're going to be able to mitigate it better than when it just kind of fell in our lap. And based on how we
believe we're going to be able to operate and get more output and execute our business continuity plans,
I think revenue will be higher in June. Demand continues to be much stronger than that. This is a supply
situation.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And Doug, by the second half, do you think you will have mitigated all these supply issues or not? Second
half of the calendar year?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I hope so. Yes. I mean, we're executing our business continuity plans. It's not going to take us longer than
a quarter to get those in place. I hope, and Tim can maybe comment on this as well.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, I think as I commented, we're continuously seeing improvements. Most important thing that
we prioritized as well as I believe our supply chain did is, first, to establish a stable source of supply
and production capability at a level that clearly is less than 100%, but stability being the key. We have
customers, as I mentioned, with critical projects, critical production bottlenecks. And so that what -- we

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

wanted to ensure that we were avoiding beyond, of course, in any way endangering employees or our
supply chain partners. But beyond that was endangering somehow taking a step back and moving too fast
and then having to come back and not actually build a supply at that stable level. So I think day by day,
we're able to inch that stable production level up. And I think as we exit this quarter, we'll be at a higher
production output capability for sure. And as Doug said, probably working off this stronger customer
demand over the next several months.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And maybe just one other comment as I was thinking, will Tim talk, John. Obviously, we have a plan to
execute to a number, and we know what that number is. The reason we decided not to formally provide
guidance to a number is we're just concerned things could change. This is a very dynamic and fluid
situation. That's really why we decided not to give you a hard number right now.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, Tim, you guys did a good job in the March quarter, pulling some
levers on OpEx and bringing OpEx down. But clearly, you still have a lot of investments on your plates for
future growth. So I'm just kind of curious on how you're going to manage OpEx through this environment?
Should we think about it growing in line with revenue? Or are there more levers on SG&A that you can pull
but keep R&D growth continuing? How should we think about that dynamic?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, clearly, we will continue to prioritize R&D. We laid out some pretty aggressive plans, where we
see really great opportunities for the company at our Investor Day related to new system introductions,
continued progress. I mentioned a couple of them today, new etch platform, new ALD progress. We
will continue to fund those to the fullest that we can. We are seeing, of course, some very nice OpEx
offsets. We're not traveling. And so there are elements of the expense lines that are coming down quite
dramatically. So we're going to be prudent. We're not going to spend where we don't have to. A lot of
discretionary spending around meetings and events and other things that kind of normally take the course
of our normal business, those will not be occurring and we'll be reallocating that money to R&D and other
things to ensure we come out of this stronger than we went in.

Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Doug, I just want to follow-on to that question and see if maybe you could quantify the constraint in June.
And obviously, we know what the constraint was in March. But if you could meet all the demand in June,
can you give us a sense of maybe where revenue would be? Would it be sort of in excess of $3 billion,
maybe $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Tim, I know you were going to come in with a question like that. I'm not going to give you a number,
but demand is very strong. And I'll simply remind you, what we originally guided in March was $300
million higher than what we delivered at the end of the quarter. Demand didn't change. And I specifically
mentioned the $700 plus million in deferred revenue because that's stuff that shipped, but it was an
incomplete system. It wasn't a fully functional system. Obviously, that stuff is going to revenue. So there
is decent upside to demand. It's just -- we're in a supply situation right now that we're working our way
through.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just on the suspension of the repo. The stock is down a good bit. You have a very
strong balance sheet. I get that maybe the topic of share repo right now are not that great. And maybe
that's the answer, but you are typically pretty supportive of the stock and opportunistic around the stock.
So can you maybe comment as to why you put retail now and maybe it is just the optics of it, but if you
can give us some comments there.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes Tim, a little bit of it is optics. A little bit of it's just being prudent, right? I think every CFO in the world
today is focused on liquidity and making sure you have the utmost liquidity. And I'm highly confident in
the cash generation capability of the company. But it just felt like the prudent thing to do to just kind
of take a pause on the buyback, get focused on conserving cash, poke our head up to see where end
demand ends up. I do think at the end of the day, there will be some demand disruption. We're not seeing
anything from customers yet. But when I look at the consumer-facing semiconductor companies, their
business is beginning to be impacted. So I just -- I want to get a little more time behind us, Tim, and
assess what might actually this look like at the end of the day. And just trying to be prudent with the cash
right now is all.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great job on the business execution, just given the supply chain challenges. Do you guys characterize the
demand environment for your systems is remaining strong? Any way you can somewhat qualitatively or
quantitatively describe this demand? You did say that you started this quarter with record backlog. Did
your systems bookings actually grow sequentially in the March quarter?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

You want to take that, Tim?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Sure.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, go ahead.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean, they did. I mean, it's -- our comments about -- I mean, I guess the best way to look at it
is we gave on our January call, our outlook for the year. Now we're not reiterating the year because we
recognize, as Doug just said, there's a fair bit of uncertainty about how things may play out with the
macroeconomic environment later. But that outlook for the year that we spoke of and the strong demand
at the January call, that's the demand we're talking about being unchanged, which means through this
first half of the year, the continued strength in foundry and logic, the strengthening demand in memory
because recall memory underinvested, we exited the year really in a situation where we felt very good
about the need to add in the demand space and also eventually in the DRAM space. And we haven't seen
those plans change and that demand remains kind of at the same level it was in January. And which

means that we have a full order book, and we're -- really, our challenge is how to get these tools to
customers. And I would say 100% of my conversation with the customers right now are about how to get
the tools they need to them. And I think that will continue for some period of time. And as Doug said, we'll
reassess after that period to see how demand is being affected.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And just maybe one incremental comment for me, Hal,. I mean, our customers are investing in very long
lead time items. I wouldn't have expected anything to change. We're just monitoring and trying to be
cautious about, obviously anything that is a consumer-facing business at the end of the day isn't going
to be as strong. We haven't seen anything move through from our customers yet, but we're just -- we're
trying to be aware of what's going on in the environment, I think, is how I'm thinking about, how Tim's
thinking about.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

I think we -- something of this magnitude, it would be -- we have to recognize that there could be some
changes that we just don't see yet, but we're giving our look on the demand that is in front of us at this
point.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then on the innovation and design win pipeline, just given the short-term place here in the Bay
Area, wondering if this has slowed either internal projects or collaborative engagement with customers
at your -- either your research facility in Fremont or some of your other labs globally? Or are the labs
considered an essential business process under state or federal guidelines and they are being staffed by
the Lam team?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, they are and they are staffed. And as I mentioned in my comments, they're operational. But just as
Doug spoke to, Lam is being -- our top priority is safety of our employees and others working in our labs.
And so we've implemented very strict social distancing protocols, which does limit the overall number of
people who can be in the lab at any given time. And so I would say we're not the labs clearly at our full
capacity before -- as before this event, but we are operating. We're able to prioritize critical R&D programs
for customers. I did mention in my comments some of these projects, they probably have taken, say, a
1-month delay or maybe a 2-month delay because of not only the couple of weeks where we were shut
down due to shelter-in-place, but then the restart here through the local orders and social distancing.
So -- but we remain focused on them, and I would say that in the long-term sense of R&D projects and
how they play out over time, this is not a -- it's not a major disruption to their schedules. Now your other
comment is just on how we're engaged with customers. Clearly, travel is more difficult. But one thing
Lam is focused on over the years is building strength in our regions. And so we do have a lot of process
engineers and hardware engineers that are deployed out into the region and engaged with customers. And
in most cases, our customers have continued to operate in a way that's not dramatically changed from
before. And so we're able to engage with them on-site on those critical projects.

We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar of Cowen Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And congrats on good execution in these tough times. First question for Doug. Doug, China sales were
very strong. Is there anything you can segment it between how much of it was memory versus foundry?
How much of it is domestic versus multinational? And I had a follow-up for Tim?

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I'll give you a little color, Krish. Yes, 32% in the China region, a little bit over half of that local
Chinese customers. Maybe like 60% might be a reasonable way to think about it local versus the global
multinationals. We've got a broad-based set of customers in China, NAND, DRAM, foundry. So it isn't one
or the other, Krish, it's brought across all of that spectrum is the way you should think about it.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tim, just a big picture question, given that you have been in this
industry for a while, and Lam has a broad suite of product. If and when demand slows down, where do
you think you'd see first? It would be in the productivity products like single-wafer thing? Would it be
within upgrades of the customer business group? I'm just kind of curious where you think or would it all
happen at the same time that it really doesn't matter picking it?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, it's a great question. I mean, in fact, I think if we look just to last year as maybe an example, and
I'm not saying who knows, I mean, the future could be different than the past. But when we saw things
slow down, say, in the memory market, and I talked about the fact that memory spend was down almost
40% last year, we actually see, in those cases, customers turn to how can they get and extract the most
out of the installed base they have. So we tend to see things like advanced services and upgrades actually
increase during those periods. So that's the strength of our installed base business and why we're so
focused on it is because we believe that it is actually one of the areas that can help you weather a worse
market condition. Obviously, capacity additions would fall away. But again a lot of what we're looking at
are technology conversions, ongoing strategic investments from customers, a lot of the investments that
we've talked about in China and other places, is very long-term and strategic. And so I don't -- I think
those would probably be the last places to see R&D, technology, strategic investments, those would be the
least affected.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I understand visibility is limited. But when I hear you saying that capacity situation is slowly improving
and your customers' CapEx plans are not really changing, I'm curious, what is your best guess on where
WFE can land this year? Even qualitative comments, would be very useful. Are there certain areas where
you think it could be more resilient than others? Just any way to say, directionally where it can be this
year would be extremely useful to us?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Vivek. We were debating how much to say about this. I mean, we came into the year expecting the
beginning of memory recovery, continued strength in foundry and logic, all of that is still how I see things,
how we see things, I think. But I think it would be remiss to just come in and tell you, it's exactly the
same as it was a quarter ago. Something is going to get softer, although we're not seeing it yet, honestly,
from what we're hearing from customers. To quantify it, I don't know, kind of hard. We said mid-high 50s,
90 days ago, probably low mid-50s might not be an unreasonable way to think about it right now. I do
think we're going to see softness at some point and things that are facing the consumer. I don't know,
Tim, anything else you'd...

14

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

Yes. No, I think that's a reasonable way to look at it. The other is, and maybe I thought maybe where
you're going with this is, at some point, we must resolve the supply issues, otherwise, they start to affect
the actual WFE that can be executed in the year. We can't pile everything up on to the customers in the
back half of the year as a makeup because that's not possible from our own manufacturing, shipping and
also the installation and the customers' digestion of that equipment. So I don't think we're quite at that
point yet, but we would be where at some point to a certain, if it couldn't be executed simply because
of the supply constraints. But if things continue to progress, and as Doug said, we see the June revenue
higher and us working through the backlog that I spoke to, then I don't know that we see huge issues with
constraints on WFE.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

All right. And on the services side, thanks for providing that disclosure. Do you think that proportion
kind of remains for June and the following quarters, so kind of 1/3 from the services group? Or is there
something about the current macro environment that impacts that ratio one way or another?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

That's a hard one, Vivek. I mean, what I see happening over a multiyear time frame is the equipment stuff
has a little bit more volatility to it and sometimes can accelerate, in which case -- I mean, the installed
base business is just kind of a slow and steady grower in some ways along with the installed base. So a
lot of stability there. I think as total revenues pick up, probably equipment will pick up a little bit more
quickly, at least over the next couple of quarters, I hope. And so the percent would go down, but it will
ebb and flow. I mean, historically, how we described it as 25% to 30%. And obviously, if you do the math
on what we just saw, it's more than 30%.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

But I think that the reason why we -- I mean, obviously, we finally felt it was very important to disclose
more details on this business is because the new system shipments and CSBG in any particular quarter
are not so directly linked. That's why we like the business so much. And so I would start to recommend
people not think about it as the percentage of our business as much as -- it is a business that we've
said we would expect to grow every year. And it has multiple components that give it resiliency from the
spares and upgrades and advanced services and Reliant systems. And so I think in and of itself, maybe,
it does depend on the growth of the installed base, but that comes a little bit -- there's a lagging time
indicator there as tools have to ship. They have to go out of warranty, then they start to consume parts
and upgrades and such. So I think we're disclosing it, so you can start to think about it as a business
that's growing kind of on its own.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Atif Malik of Citi.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

First one, have your lead times stretched in the current environment? And if yes, by how much? And as
my follow-up, Doug, you talked about $8 billion to $9 billion domestic China spending in January. And
given the strength in March, are those expectations looking up for the full year in terms of demand?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I'll let Tim take the lead time question, first.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2020

Yes, I guess, let me take that one. They clearly have stretched. I mean, that's what we're talking about
relative to supply challenges and our own challenges. So lead times have stretched out. I don't actually
want to quantify it for you on this call, though. I mean it's something -- again, it's competitive reasons,
but you can imagine, it's -- lead times have stretched out, and that's why we're in conversation with the
customers about how to get them their high priority tools closer to the original lead times that we would
have originally provided.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Atif, what we've said about local China WFE is that in 2019, it was a little bit above $6 billion or above
$6 million (sic) [ above $6 billion ], and we expected an incremental $2 billion to $3 billion. Still kind of
how I think about it, obviously. I don't know that a whole lot has changed in that regard.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

If you compare to the midpoint of the guidance there, there's a $300 million shortfall. What end market or
geography were most impacted? It looks like China still have pretty decent growth, but Taiwan was down
quite a bit, which is different than what the big foundry guys over there saying. Any color there would be
great.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I don't know that there's any unique geographic distribution between what wasn't able to be supplied
versus what we did ship. Nothing is in my head, Sidney, to give you an answer that said it was this or that
specifically.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's -- the way I would think about it and maybe back to even the previous question a little bit
is that each of our -- we have a lot of different products. And the makeup of the supply chain for those
products is not the same. And even the manufacturing facilities for those products are not all the same.
And so I would say it was less about any particular customer not receiving a big chunk of tools as much as
certain tools, the lead time having pushed out a little bit and those tools kind of slipping out of the quarter.
So certain tool types were impacted, I would say, more so than us as a result of where their supply chain
was heavily concentrated.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. My follow-up is, if your June quarter revenue does come in the way you expect, which you think is
higher, I guess they're still 2 more quarters to go for the year. But what are your thoughts on bit growth
for DRAM and NAND and maybe leading edge foundry capacity additions, I guess, based on how you think
that the second half of the year is going to be?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Hard to answer, Sidney. I mean, first thing I'd tell you is our view of the long-term good demand really
is unchanged. Now having said that, obviously, a lot of bits are consumed in the mobile space, and that's
gotten probably softer given the more direct exposure to the consumer. That's offset, though, by what you
see going on in the hyperscale space, which is also a decent consumer bits, right? The work-from-home,
whatnot and the stuff Tim had in his script about the likely uptick there, those 2 are going to offset. I don't

know that I'm ready to quantify it for you just because there's so many moving pieces unless Tim wants to
quantify?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

No, we debated it, but no. I think the challenge is, as we said, we do recognize there will be areas of
strength and weakness. And as Doug has said many times, I think we need to see how, obviously, later
in the year, macro is really affecting consumer spending in other segments of the market. We wouldn't
sit here today and say that this kind of economic disruption would have no effect. And so just hard to
quantify. I think we just have some comfort in knowing that we feel like we came out of -- we come into
this year and ended this economic disruption without having been in a situation of like a lot of spending
last year. So if there's one silver lining, it's that there was underinvestment last year, so we enter in a
pretty good space from that perspective?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. The trajectory of bit growth was declining as we exited last year, and that continues into the first half
of this year and the second half will depend on the investments that occur. So maybe something to think
about Sidney.

Operator

We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Going back to your prior WFE growth expectations, could you provide us any color on just how we should
think about? What was baked into that for capacity expansion versus technology transitions?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Joe, we didn't -- I didn't break it down specifically. What we said was continued strength in foundry
and logic. That is what we're seeing. And then some level of a recovery in NAND, read that to be -- last
year in memory, the spending was pretty much all about just node conversions, almost no wafer capacity.
And that created a situation where the rate of supply growth continued to decline through the year such
that our view was it was below where demand growth was going to be in both NAND and DRAM, right?
We had inventory adjusting, pricing getting better, all that kind of stuff. I think the real question that's on
all of our mind is, okay, what is demand going to do this year? I'm not going to wait into that one quite
yet. So that's what we saw. We saw NAND beginning to pick up a little bit, probably adding a few wafers.
DRAM, no. DRAM really was a continued trajectory that we saw in '19 through most of '20, maybe a little
bit of an uptick. And I think we're just going to wait and see how this plays out to assess what's going to
happen there. But that's what we were seeing 90 days ago. That's what we described 90 days ago.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then on the strength in China, I mean, it sounds like it could have been even stronger in the
March quarter. Is that fair? And then I guess if that's true, do you expect that to grow further in the June
quarter, just given that some of that could have slipped into this quarter?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I don't know that it would have grown as a percent, Joe. I mean, the supply issue was across every
geography, quite honestly. So if you think in percentage terms, I don't know that it would have been all
that different. Everything had challenges around supply. And then just to frame what we see going on in

local China, again, we expected -- not expected, last year was a little above $6 billion, and we saw an
incremental $2 billion to $3 billion in China, and that's still pretty much what we see from local China in
terms of WFE. That was a statement of WFE. Operator, we'll do one more question.

Operator

Your final question will come from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company.

Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

First question, just trying to reconcile the lower revenue for you guys out of Taiwan in foundry when TSMC
put up a record CapEx number in the March quarter. Is that just sort of a timing when TSMC recognizes
CapEx? Or do you have any thoughts on that? And then a second question, the social distancing that you
put in place in the manufacturing operations, does that slow your cycle times for an extended period of
time and reduce your sort of quarterly revenue capacity? Or do you think the plan that you put in place to
try and expand footprints can get you back to where your manufacturing output was, say, before we went
into the COVID downturn?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Okay, great. Let me take both of those. The -- relative to Taiwan and your questions there, I think there's
no story other than just timing. I mean, it's -- as Doug said, we had systems impacted in that first quarter.
So I don't think there's anything there. From the capacity perspective and social distancing, that was
part of what Doug was speaking to. Clearly, within our factories, once we've implemented strict social
distancing, we can have fewer people in the same area and space. And so to that extent, our cycle time
does stretch out. Some tasks take longer than it uld have otherwise. And so our overall capacity out of an
existing space does decline from what would have been pre-COVID. Now we're finding ways to reroute our
lines and actually gain some of that capability back. But at the same time, as Doug also mentioned, we
have access to additional space, and we're moving and expanding into some other areas to recapture that
capacity. That takes a little bit of time, but we clearly will execute those plans. And as we see -- if we see
demand continuing to hold up as we would expect and we need that capacity, we will continue to grow our
output.
