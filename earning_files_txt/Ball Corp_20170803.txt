Thank you, Malika, and good morning, everyone
This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's second quarter 2017 results
The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements
Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied
Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases
If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball
Information regarding descriptions of our segment reporting, year-to-date depreciation catch-up recorded in the second quarter that relates to the finalization of the fixed asset values associated with last year's beverage acquisition, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release
The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations
Now, joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And also, we are welcoming Dan Fisher to our quarterly earnings calls
Dan assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer of our Global Beverage business late last year, and he's doing a fantastic job leading this
Given where we are and where we are going, we thought it's important for you to hear from him on many of the activities that are occurring in this business
I'll provide some brief introductory remarks and comments on our food and aerosol segment
Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance
Scott will discuss key financial metrics
And then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the back half of 2017 and beyond
Our second quarter results from operations were right on top of our expectations despite challenging U.S
tinplate performance
Volumes in our U.S
food can business declined low double digits in the quarter, and tinplate manufacturing inefficiencies led to lower absorption and redundant costs in the quarter related to the closure of our Weirton, West Virginia cutting and coating facility and contemporaneous startup of our new Canton, Ohio cutting and coating facility
We're disappointed about the performance we experienced in this segment
However, we believe the underperformance is behind us and expect each of the remaining quarters for our food and aerosol business to be up year over year due to the incremental progress we've seen at our Canton metal service center, improving manufacturing metrics, and the ramping up of new aluminum aerosol capacity in Europe and India to keep up with our customers' growth
Supply and demand is very tight in the global aluminum aerosol business, and our team is living hand-to-mouth during the second quarter, lending support across regions to one another as they tried to keep pace with the expansion of our highly sustainable and lightweight ReAl product line
Going forward, we will continue to generate cash from our tinplate operations and continue to invest in our growing global aerosol business
I'll let Dan Fisher review the global beverage can business in a moment
However, one year into the largest acquisition in our company's history, we are seeing the growth in comparable EBITDA and free cash flow materialize in global beverage
Initial transformational actions are driving synergies and cash flow is on the rise
We're not without our challenges, particularly in some of the more volatile regions in which we operate, but our three largest regions, North and Central America, Europe, and South America, are all on track, so far so good
Combining the expected improvement in both food and aerosol and our continued progress in global beverage, and then layer on current and expected growth in our aerospace business over the next several years, and we remain confident in our team's ability to deliver on our commitments while behaving as owners to ensure the best long-term outcomes for our company
With Dan, Jim Peterson, and Rob Strain at the helm of these businesses, we're in very good shape
To highlight some of the work being done during the second quarter, we further improved our G&A cost structure with the ramp down of the Charlotte, North Carolina, regional support center
We ceased beverage can production in Reidsville, North Carolina
We negotiated with the Works Councils in Recklinghausen, Germany and ceased production of beverage cans and end in those facilities on July 31. We saw month-on-month improvement at our Canton, Ohio metal service center
And our aerospace business cleared critical program milestones, hired more staff to service contracts that will ramp up through the second half of 2017, and stayed on time and on budget with facility expansions
Our multiyear value capture plans are on course
And as previously mentioned, we expect to recognize $150 million of the expected synergies by the end of 2017. And balance sheet optimization programs are producing benefits equal to or better than our expectations
Our plans for 2017 and beyond are right on track to capture planned cost savings and grow comparable EBITDA, cash flow, and EVA in all of our businesses
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan
Great
Our aerospace business reported improved second quarter results, driven by solid contract performance and the continuing ramp-up on new contracts
The team cleared a couple of significant program milestones in some big programs during the quarter
And even though the contracted backlog is down slightly, please don't read anything into that, as the U.S
government has not been making decisions on outstanding proposals as it continues to focus on other priorities and backfill open decision-making positions in the various defense and intelligence communities
Our aerospace business is winning in the marketplace, and we'll see a nice step up in the segment earnings year over year during the second half
Now as we look forward, we are on track to achieve the financial benefits from the acquisition
Our aerospace business is hiring people at a rapid clip to staff the work won to date, and our food and aerosol team has a mandate to attack costs and improve manufacturing efficiencies to the Ball standards that we expect
As Scott mentioned, our 2017 comparable EBITDA and free cash flow goals are intact and will be driven by global beverage demand, synergies, and aggressively managing the balance sheet
By 2019, we continue to believe that we can generate $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow
When we announced our intentions to acquire Rexam, we said that we would rapidly delever, capture synergies, spend necessary growth capital on high-returning projects, and then return our remaining free cash flow to our fellow shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and that is exactly what we are doing
And with that, Malika, we're ready for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
And, George, to answer your question about the customers and profit pools, I think that's where you're really going, yes, we continue to see our customers using our containers, particularly on the specialty side, to change the profit pool opportunities that they have in front of them
And whether it's soft drink here in North America, whether it's beer both large and small in South America and even Europe, we continue to see that
And we continue from a – from our position, we continue to try and push that because I think it's important that we're driving value and volume into our customers, because if we can help them with the price points that they have and improve their profitability, it's better for the can and it's better for Ball Corporation
I think just to give you context, let's just focus on the inventory for a moment
The demand side of our business has been good in those three main regions
We have had, as Dan said, some volatility in some of the other regions
But the ability to use our system as a network and the plant floor systems that we've talked about and being able to optimize the days on hand of not only raw coils, but also finished goods, and having better capability, being able to predict the demand profile of our customers, that all helps drive down inventories
On the receivables, we've done some creative things with some of our customers to help drive the DSO down in there
And then on the payables side, we've been working with our suppliers too, so it really is all across the board
I'll just add on to that, but Dan raised a very good point because while overall literage was down, we've seen smaller pack sizes on the can go into Brazil at a higher rate than some of the larger sizes, so that's one thing
On the glass, obviously we're not in the glass business
We shouldn't comment on it, but we do know that Dan had said that the can is up while the overall beer market was down
Okay, thank you
Good
Let me just jump out ahead of that and Scott can talk about the euro, but I want to be clear here
A year ago, when we gave out those ranges of free cash flow and EBITDA, we said that if things go our way and we get some tailwind that we're going to be at the upper part of that range
And if we start to encounter some headwinds, we could be at the lower end of the range
We talked about the three largest regions, North and Central America, Europe, and South America, all doing well and on track, and aerospace as well
Where we've been having our challenges, quite frankly, is on the food and aerosol side, where we are down year to date when we expected to be up, and that's not an immaterial amount
We expect it to get better, but we've got to get some giddy-up on the manufacturing side of that business
And then on the EMEA side, Dan just talked about the 50% carbonation tax in Saudi Arabia
There has been a 40% increase in retail price points in Egypt because of the devaluation
Those are material headwinds to us
And despite that, we still think that we're going to be in the $1.175 billion range on EBITDA
As it translates into cash, it gets down to, you have to look at interest expense and all those things that mutes some of the impact on the euro exchange and a lot of the working capital and just running our balance sheet much more efficiently with this combined organization
That's where we're getting the benefit there
So with that, Scott, if you want to say anything more about the euro?
And we expect to – the synergies plans are on track, and we expect to accelerate those plans in the second half, as we said in our earnings release
Typically we're not going to get into that
Quite candidly, I don't think it's helpful because every region has a level of volatility, and certainly South America does when you think about politically what's going on there
But what we've seen is steady progress despite economic and political difficulty down there
As you know, the second quarter and even the third quarter are seasonally slow quarters
And I don't off the top of my head have month to month and I don't think it would be relevant anyway
But the can, we wish it was stronger, quite honestly, but to be up a few percent in a seasonally slow quarter in a place where the economic and political discord continues, we'll take that
It's a little bit better than what we had anticipated six months ago
Thank you
Usually it would be – because remember, Recklinghausen, for example, didn't stop producing until the end of July
And when you close a plant, there's always a couple months thereafter where you get some kind of cost tail, if you want to call it that
So I would think about Reidsville will get a little bit in the third quarter, a little bit in the fourth quarter
Recklinghausen is probably more fourth quarter, but more importantly it's 2018 and beyond
We talked about this before
It's unfair to look at that because it's an apple and a pear, because we have a network now
In the past, we only had several plants, and so the on-season versus off-season fluctuation in margins was greater because when you're spreading your G&A and your fixed costs over a smaller amount of plants, it just becomes more volatile
When you have a network of 13 plants all throughout South America, it becomes a little bit more consistent
Obviously, we just lapped the 12 months of the acquisition, so I think as we go forward that will become more clear as you see looking forward
Thank you
In December of last year, when we had our Investor Day, we did talk about that we have a multi-year program, Dan, to look at and optimizing our footprint from a cost and flexibility point of view, and none of that has changed
Dan talked about, even in Europe, Recklinghausen allows us to get more flexibility and take a high-cost plant out
We think there are more opportunities like that going forward, and we've also said that our plans are going to be accelerating at this point in time as we go into the second half
And so conceptually, we're continuing to look at these things all the time
Good morning
I'd hesitate a bit because then you play left pocket-right pocket, but what I can tell you is we expected the second quarter to be flat to up relative to year over year, and we were not
And the vast majority of that was related to cost inefficiencies
Well, it definitely is a longer-term process
And recall at the Investor Day, what we talked about is – I mentioned even earlier on this call about profit pools and improving the profit pools
There's a wide variety of ways you can do that
Obviously, different can sizes, price, tighter call-offs, ordering call-offs with our customers
There's a whole host of things
To answer to your question directly, is on the specialty side, back not six months ago I think we told the world that in North America we were making – and don't hold me to this – but approximately 25 different types of cans
We're at 30 now
We're at 30 because we continue to see growth in the opportunities of really differentiating on behalf – for our customers and on behalf of our customers, I would tell you, so we're having some good success there
And the standard 12-ounce containers on a global basis, as you know, that's a very competitive spot where we compete with others
We're trying to be leaders in that, but you also have to be realistic, and I think it's much more longer term
As contracts come up, we have to recognize the regional supply and demand and the regional competitive dynamics of that
But on the standard containers, it is more competitive
But as I said on the specialty, we're seeing more and more opportunities
You just have to be a hunter for them
Thank you
The short answer is there's no facts that we can point to that says there has been meaningful improvement in China in terms of the oversupply situation
I think anecdotally and from a tone perspective, it feels more constructive
But it's premature to declare any kind of victory there
We do know that the can market continues to grow, particularly on the beer side, but you're also seeing more can penetration in alternative drinks, whether it's herbal teas or energy drinks, et cetera
We know that very little if any new capacity has been brought on stream, and so we've slowly been whittling away at that overcapacity
As we look out several years, it's up to us to be able to try and push some of these new categories because that's going to create the incremental demand that will soak up the excess capacity
So while nothing meaningful has changed as we see it here right now, I think our tone as we look out over the next three years feels a little bit better today than it did say six or nine months ago
It's a good question
No, we did not see any meaningful competitive pressure
Let me talk about the volume declines because I think it's important to parse out
There are really three fundamental things that led to the food can declines
Number one, there was some timing with some customers that I wouldn't read into too much
We typically quarter to quarter have timing issues of this, and it actually was a headwind to us in this quarter, but we expect to make it up
Another one, we have a large customer experimenting with an alternative substrate
And it's premature to say if that's going good or bad and it's not for us to do that, but that really started to hit us
It's not in the traditional fruit and vegetable categories that we talk about, so that was a hit
And I would expect certainly through the balance of this year that we're going to continue in that specific situation that volumes are going to be a bit soft as they experiment with this alternative substrate
And then we have another large customer in the private label area that's been experiencing their own difficulties, which has been impactful
So what I would tell you is, as we sit here right now, we've got a headwind in a couple of different things, one of them meaning the timing of it I would not worry about, but the other two that we are keeping our eye on
And we expect volumes to be down, but there is no competitive issue relative to other food can suppliers
Yes and yes, and what I mean by that is we were investing in new technology in our Canton, Ohio facility, and that was coming up at the same time that we were shutting down our Weirton, West Virginia facility
And what happened was we ended up not coming up in Canton nearly as fast as we were expecting to or would have liked, and that created the redundant cost
That is largely behind us
And as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect the second half, the quarter-over-quarter improvement to start showing up on that
In terms of your longer term, this is a business that structurally is not growing, and you have to recognize what it is and who you are
I mentioned that we're running that business for cash, and we continue to have opportunities to take out costs
Let's not forget though, however, even though year to date we're down a little bit, we expect to be up quarter over quarter
The margins in that business are not terrible
It still generates returns in excess of our cost of capital
It doesn't generate returns at our 9% after-tax threshold, but we see a line of sight of being able to get to that
And that's where the additional longer-term cost takeout will continue to occur
I think it's a little bit of both, and I think it's premature to talk about that
I think if you go back and read the transcript of the call in its entirety, you'll get a sense of the various areas we're looking at
We talked about footprint
We talked about commercial
We talked about plant floor systems and the operating side of it
So I think it's all – and we're right on track relative to what we thought
We knew it would take some time, particularly in Europe, as Dan alluded to, on certain initiatives
We knew it would take some time to transfer some of the G&A, and now we're focused on reducing that G&A
And so all the plans that we talked about at this time last year are largely coming to fruition
The other things obviously we're working on is, as Dan said, from a cost perspective, the optimization of that manufacturing is the most important
But there's a bunch of surrounding G&A that remember back – Debbie, you'll remember this
Back in 2013 plus or minus at Ball, we went through and we reorganized ourselves within Europe to go from a regional structure where we had four and five pools of G&A to a centralized that had one European G&A
We are doing the same thing right now, and that affects all the back-office support things, and we have a shared center office that we've opened up in Belgrade, Serbia that we're going to be moving a lot of the transactional processing to that, and there's a whole host of other things
The most important is get the cost of goods sold line right
Then also the other thing that we haven't talked about which is important the way we think about this is really leveraging the specialty and growing the specialty and creating those profit pools for our customers where we have much more of an emphasis on that than the business we acquired historically did
I think, Debbie, when you look at the seasonality, the business we have now is not different than the business we used to have
It's just bigger, and that's what Dan is alluding to
All right
Thanks, Debbie
Yes, we can
Chris, I'll just add onto that
Forget about the journal entries of all the accounting that goes around the acquisition
This is a great cash generative business, full stop
Nothing has changed by that, and it's very consistent in terms of its cash generation capability
That's why a year ago we said with confidence that we are going to integrate these companies
We're going to drive the synergies
We're going to flow cash
And in the absence of good investments, and we've had some good investments and will continue to, we're going to give it back
Nothing has changed in that perspective
And we have a line of sight
As Scott said, we said once we have a line of sight that you can look out over the next 12, 18, 24 months in terms of the cash generative nature of this and you see how quickly our leverage comes down
Why don't I take that first? You really have to go around the globe
I'll let Dan talk about the opportunities in terms of geographies and where we see future demand growth that can help
But we continue – as you all know, over the last decade here in North America, for example, we've actually been able to take much of our 12-ounce capacity and capability that was underutilized and convert it to specialty
We're finding that the facilities we acquired, and we knew this, but it's a little bit more difficult to do it in the existing walls of the facilities we acquired
And so we are taking a fresh look, not only here in North America, but also in Europe as well
That's why when Dan talked about Recklinghausen, it was old capacity that was very difficult to convert
That was one of the reasons why we did that
But you should rest assured that we're going to continue to invest because there is growth even in some of these "more mature" markets, that we're going to have opportunities
Because whether it's sparkling waters, whether it's the teas here that continue to grow, energy drinks, even wine, as Dan alluded to, we continue to see good opportunities here in North America and in Europe and outside of that
Maybe, Dan, I'll turn it over to you and let you talk about geographic growth
Thank you
And Dan
And even – I'll go a step further
Even if you think about our Russian business, that's fundamentally a dollar-denominated business, and so it's helpful on the margin
But it's also – you mentioned the steep rise over the last couple months
Who's to say it's not going to reverse itself in the near term as well? So there is some benefit to it
We're not counting on perhaps where it is today, all that benefit showing up, and so there could be a little upside there, but the currency markets just have been very volatile recently
Well, number one, there has been no chop
What I said in my prepared remarks, just so we're clear, is we had $1.4 billion in backlog and it's off about $150 million or so just because we've been burning that down as we've been working on that work
We haven't been awarded new contracts just because of government priorities
There's a number of senior staff level people that the positions haven't been filled yet, and so that has slowed down and pushed to the right the formal award winnings
But as I mentioned on previous calls, we have more opportunity in front of us than we've ever seen at Ball Corporation with our aerospace business
Nothing fundamentally has changed with the customer, meaning the U.S
government, other than the decision-making in the government bowels, so to speak, has been a little bit slower than it has been in the past
Okay, thank you
George, let me hit the food business head on
First and foremost, you've got to play the cards that you're dealt
And this is a business that, as you said, let's put this in context
We could have great improvement in that and it doesn't really move the needle at Ball Corporation
Having said that, we own it, and we've got to the best we can with it unless there is something left to do – something else to do
We think the best course as we sit here right now is to continue to drive out the costs and continue to run up the cash
We do see a line of sight getting to the 9% after tax
But remember, that really has more to do with our compensation system, so we're well aligned on that
It's generating returns for our shareholders because it's generating returns in excess of our real cost to capital
We are always looking at our business about how to maximize it
Recall that we've been in a variety of businesses, and we've gotten into businesses and we've gotten out of businesses
We just passionate about it, and it needs to perform
We do think there's a line of sight to getting there, and that's the strategy we're currently pursuing
Okay, great
Thank you, Malika, and thank you, everyone, for participating and we look forward to talking to you as we go forward
