WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Wabtec Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Kristine Elizabeth Kubacki
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With us
today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, Pat Dugan; and Senior VP of Finance, John Mastalerz.

Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures were posted on our
website earlier today and can be accessed on the Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com.

Some statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our
business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking
statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentation. We will also discuss non-
GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you
consider these metrics.

Before we begin, I'd like to extend wishes of health and safety to everyone on the line as we continue all
to manage through this COVID-19 pandemic.

And now I will turn the call over to Rafael.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. We had a solid first
quarter that was only possible due to the perseverance of our employees working in conjunction with
customers, suppliers and key stakeholders. These are unprecedented times that have forced us all to flex
and adapt. And for that, I want to sincerely thank our Wabtec team members in our factories and in the
field supporting our customers as well as all of those working remotely for all that they're doing to deliver
in the face of incredible change.

This COVID-19 crisis reiterates the appreciation for the work our team members do every day, supporting
essential rail services that are critical to overcome this crisis. Their work around the world has allowed our
sites to remain largely operational, although we had some facilities down in places, including China, India
and Europe. As a company, operating in the midst of this pandemic, there are some key essential priorities
I'd like to highlight to you. So please turn to Slide 3.

First, we are committed to protecting the health and safety of our workforce, and we are taking
significant efforts across our plants and sites. In many cases, we're going above and beyond the CDC's
recommendations or any local government requirements. These actions include daily temperature checks
at many of our facilities, limiting plant floor activity by rotating schedules, removing noncritical staff
from the factory floor, restricting access to work areas, enhanced social distancing, deep cleanings and
increased disinfection efforts, among other activities.

Second, we're focused on maintaining our operational capabilities. Roughly 8 weeks ago, we assembled a
COVID response team comprised of global business and functional leaders. They meet daily to assess and
respond to the extraordinary challenges at hand and implement contingency plans across our operations
and supply chain. They assess government mandates as well as any impacts to our business in real-

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

time and take decisive action to ensure Wabtec is proactively positioned to manage through today's
extraordinary challenges.

As I shared earlier, we have an incredible responsibility to help keep people and product moving during
this crisis. During the quarter, we began to feel increasing impact of the COVID-19 disruption across our
supply chain as well as our operations and our customers' operations.

Throughout the pandemic, over 80% of our 160-plus global manufacturing sites have largely remained
operational. Those that experienced disruption were primarily due to the customer shutdowns, supply
chain disruptions or government-mandated lockdowns. This includes countries like China, which had
several sites impacted in February, but they were all back in operations by mid-March. We had operations
in countries like France, Italy and Spain, which were required to close for several weeks in the first and
second quarters, and they're mostly all back up and running now. And it also included countries like India.

However, in those regions that were on lockdown, all Wabtec service locations, field service technicians
and warehouses remain in operations to support transportation of essential infrastructure as required by
the governments.

In the United States, rail and passenger transportation has been squarely recognized as critical to
essential operations. As such, all of our major manufacturing sites and services and parts locations across
Pennsylvania and Texas and most other locations have remained open and operational throughout the
pandemic.

Third, we are focused on cash and preserving the balance sheet by working to reduce CapEx by more than
40% versus our prior guidance of $200 million. In addition, we are quickly aligning working capital for the
volume environment and targeting improved cash flow conversion.

Overall, our financial position continues to be strong. At the end of the first quarter, liquidity was about
$1.2 billion, and we recently took additional measures to further enhance liquidity by adding a new
undrawn $600 million credit facility after the end of the quarter.

Fourth point. Prior to the onset of the pandemic, we were laser-focused on reducing costs and delivering
on our synergy targets ahead of schedule. For example, since a year ago, during a period of top line
revenue growth, the company reduced headcount, including contingent workers, by more than 1,500
people and have begun to consolidate operations, reducing our footprint by 6% and removing over 1
million square feet across our operations. We're on plan to reduce our operational footprint by another 9%
in 2020.

We also have captured significant sourcing savings from the merger. We've discontinued several shared
services contracts with GE, and we've continued to drive lean across our operations to enable more cost-
effective and efficient throughput. We saw the results of those actions realized in the first quarter. And
while we anticipate a change in the volume assumptions for near-term synergies, we have a pipeline of
actions and we remain committed to deliver our synergy targets for the year.

Today, given the rapidly evolving situation and the uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of the
COVID crisis, we have withdrawn our previously issued annual guidance. We will continue to take the
necessary measures to control what we can, to protect the long-term viability of the company, continue to
invest in key technologies and capabilities and deliver shareholder value for the long term.

And you're seeing that focus, along with the strength of this franchise and our experienced managed
team, in our first quarter results. As noted on Slide 4, in the midst of a challenging market that included
operational and supply chain disruptions in China, India and Europe, we delivered a solid operational
quarter.

Sales were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 15.7%, driven by strong execution against cost
and synergy goals. This yielded $0.97 in adjusted earnings per share, a testament to the team's execution
in the midst of a challenging market. Included in our results, we estimate over $0.05 of earnings per share
loss due to the impacts of COVID-19, primarily in China and Europe during the quarter.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Cash used for operations was $82 million. However, this was in line with seasonality and the onetime
outflows due to previously announced restructuring, litigation and transactional charges.

Our multiyear backlog of about $22 billion continues to provide visibility across both Freight and Transit.
And as we continue to help support our customers during these times, we are adjusting timing and
specifications on some deliveries as needed and remain confident in our backlog.

Looking across our Freight and Transit segments, we saw several dynamic market conditions throughout
the quarter, many of which we related to the COVID-19 crisis. In the freight factor, North American carload
volumes were down about 5% in the first quarter and intermodal was down over 8%. This was largely
driven by weak global macro conditions.

Carload volumes have further deteriorated in the second quarter as the crisis has accelerated its impact
on the global economy and supply chains. This will have a near-term impact on demand for services
and components, which will improve as freight recovers. At this point, it is very difficult to predict where
carloads will settle for the year given the direct dependency on restarting the economy.

In terms of the North American railcar builds, all builders in North America have taken steps to slow
production lines in 2020. And the industry forecast now indicates that railcar builds for the year will be less
than 30,000 cars.

As you're aware, some of these conditions were present pre-COVID and the collapse of the global oil
market, but we had already been taking actions to adjust capacity as outlined in our investor conference in
early March. To be even more proactive, we are taking additional actions to align all of our operations for
the new realities we face.

Reflecting on the quarter, despite of the challenging global freight segment dynamics, there were some
bright spots. Our Digital Electronics sales were up double digits versus the prior year. This gives us further
confidence that the business can grow in an average faster than the overall Freight segment.

Our modernization deliveries showed good momentum, which were up on a pro forma basis versus
last year, along with steady international locomotive deliveries, which helped to offset North America
locomotive and freight car build declines as expected.

Transitioning to the Transit sector, the COVID-19 crisis and global shelter-in-place orders have had a direct
impact on passenger transportation and near-term service levels in some markets. This disruption to
services and the impacts on our customers' operations will have a corresponding near-term impact on our
OE and aftermarket sales.

However, as I shared earlier, most of our Transit manufacturing facilities remain operational. Overall, we
believe the long-term market drivers remain strong, including the need for sustainable transit solutions
and projected growth in both ridership and urbanization. And as viral restrictions ease, we will see
infrastructure spend also recover.

I'd also add that we delivered strong margin improvements across the Transit segment in the first quarter.
While sales were down 7%, adjusted income from operations was up 14% due to improved mix and early
evidence of the actions to drive margin rate improvement.

Finally, as noted earlier, across both the Freight and Transit sectors, we have strong multiyear backlog.
This helps provide stability and visibility to evolving environment demand.

With that, I'll turn things over to Pat to provide more color on the first quarter.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Rafael. Turning to Slide 5, you can see that we had a good operating quarter despite an
increasingly challenging environment. Sales for the first quarter were $1.9 billion, which reflects a 21%
increase versus the prior year.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Increased year-over-year sales were mainly due to the merger of GE Transportation, along with higher
Digital Electronics and Services sales, offset somewhat by decreased revenues in Freight, Equipment,
Components and Transit, as well as a negative impact due to foreign exchange.

For the quarter, operating income was $217 million, and adjusted operating income was $303 million, up
30% year-over-year, mainly driven by higher Freight sales and good performance in Digital Electronics,
the realization of synergies as well as a better mix of sales and better operational performance in Transit.

Although there are limitations on visibility into the full effect of the pandemic, we estimated the COVID-19
impact on our customers, suppliers and operations during the quarter negatively impacted our operating
income by approximately $15 million or $0.05 in earnings per share.

For the quarter, adjusted operating income excluded pretax expenses of $86 million, of which $69 million
was for noncash amortization and $17 million of transaction and restructuring costs. Please see Appendix
B of our press release for the reconciliation of these details.

Now looking at some of the detailed line items. SG&A was $243 million, including $16 million of the
restructuring and transaction expenses I just discussed. Engineering expenses increased to $49 million,
due mainly to the addition of GE Transportation. And amortization expenses were $69 million. But
remember, starting this year, we are excluding amortization expense, which is all noncash from our
adjusted operating income.

For 2020, we still expect noncash amortization expense to be about $280 million. Other expense was
$15 million versus $8 million of expense a year ago. The variance year-over-year was due to severe
fluctuations in the FX rates late in the quarter, most notably from the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.

Income tax expense was $38 million. Adjusted income tax expense was $63 million for an adjusted
effective tax rate of about 25%. We expect the tax rate for the full year to still be about 26%.

In the first quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.58 and adjusted earnings per diluted
share of $0.97. The details that bridge GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.97
can be found attached to our press release.

As of March 31, our multiyear backlog was roughly $22 billion and our rolling 12-month backlog, which is
a subset of the multiyear backlog, was $5.6 billion. Our backlog continues to provide visibility across both
Freight and Transit.

Now let's take a look at the segment results on Slide 6. Across the Freight segment, sales increased to
$1.3 billion in the first quarter. This increase was due to the GE Transportation merger, which added $506
million. Organic sales decreased $108 million, primarily due to lower sales of freight car components due
to the decrease in car builds, along with lower sales in freight equipment due to the timing of deliveries.

Segment operating income was $162 million, and adjusted operating income was $241 million, for an
adjusted margin of 18.5%. I'd like to note that the margin in the prior year quarter benefited from the
timing of deliveries after the close of the GET merger. Finally, Freight segment backlog was $18 billion.

Across our Transit segment, sales decreased to $629 million, driven by disruptions stemming from the
COVID-19 virus. Organic sales declined $34 million versus the prior year but were also impacted by FX,
which reduced sales by an additional $18 million.

Segment operating income was $69 million for an operating margin of 10.9%. The adjusted operating
margin for the segment was 11.9%, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year. This
improvement is evidence of some early success in the plans and actions the Transit team outlined at our
Investor Day in March.

Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. We entered the year with a very different
expectation of what has ultimately transpired. And while the pandemic presents uncertainty and many
challenges, Wabtec is essential to a recovery and we are confident that our solid financial position and
ability to generate strong cash flow will enable us to emerge stronger.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

From a cash flow perspective, the quarter played out about as expected. While our cash flow from
operations was a negative $82 million in the quarter, we had about $80 million of onetime impact due to
prior year restructuring, litigation and transaction charges, which we had identified in our last earnings
call. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was about 2.6x, flat with year-end.

Our total liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $1.2 billion, down from about $1.6 billion at the end
of the fourth quarter. This $1.2 billion does not reflect the new $600 million, 364-day credit facility that we
entered into as part of our liquidity planning subsequent to the quarter end, which further strengthened
our liquidity position. We have also stressed test our balance sheet under a variety of scenarios and expect
to remain in compliance with all of our covenants.

In terms of the working capital items I typically review, they are the following. As of March 31, receivables
were $1.2 billion and inventories were $1.8 billion. Payables were $1.1 billion. All roughly consistent with
the end of the fourth quarter. Our unbilled receivables were $523 million, which were more than offset by
customer deposits of $603 million.

Now turning to Slide 8. I'll describe some of the actions we are taking to further strengthen our financial
position.

First, we are lowering our costs across the business. We are swiftly aligning our operating costs with
volume realities, while remaining focused on achieving our synergy targets. We are taking further
actions to lower our fixed costs by driving down SG&A, eliminating discretionary spend, suspending merit
increases, implementing a hiring freeze since January 1, along with other actions.

Considering our cost structure, about 85% of our cost of sales are variable. And within SG&A, about 15%
of our costs are variable or semi-variable in the short term. We expect the incremental cost actions we are
taking to drive down SG&A.

Second, we are aggressively managing cash and looking to further strengthen our balance sheet. We
expect improved cash flow conversion as we reduce our working capital levels in line with the volume
environment. We are also reprioritizing some of our 2020 spend to essential and critical items. We've
evaluated expenditures that can be paused or canceled, and we are targeting to reduce CapEx by more
than 40% versus our prior guidance of $200 million of capital spend.

In terms of capital allocation, our approach remains consistent with what we've said at our Investor Day,
and we will continue to smartly invest in our people and the business. We certainly recognize the current
uncertainties of the macro environment but believe our framework allows us to be flexible and make
discretionary adjustments as necessary.

We, like many companies, are focused on our business and balance sheet. We are targeting to reduce debt
levels and to increase liquidity. We did recently announce our dividend payable on May 22. But for the
short term, we've paused our share repurchase program.

Keep in mind, we have no major debt maturities due until mid-June of 2021 and remain confident in our
ability to access the markets, given our financial profile. We are already taking steps to identify solutions
to retire or refinance debt well ahead of maturities, including the opportunities from government stimulus
programs and other long-term forms of issuances.

With that, let's move to Slide 9, and I will turn the call back over to Rafael.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Pat. So as you heard throughout today's call, the company performed well and delivered a solid
first quarter despite a weakening environment. As we go forward, we remain committed to executing on
our strategic plans as communicated during our Investor Day, and we will continue to carefully assess the
markets in which we operate. This includes reducing costs, aggressively managing cash and enhancing our
liquidity position while focusing on what we can control.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

We'll also lean into the strong long-term fundamentals of this company. This includes our $22 billion
multiyear backlog, recurring service revenues, broad aftermarket reach, significant installed base,
technical capabilities, expansive international footprint and a proven leadership team with deep industry
domain. In addition, we will continue to invest in technologies and capabilities that will advance our
competitive advantage and drive the long-term growth.

These are the tangible differentiators that will help us successfully manage today's market headwinds over
the long term and will help us emerge as an even stronger and more resilient company.

Before I turn the call over to questions, I want to personally thank each and every member of the Wabtec
team for all that they are doing. Every day, I hear stories about people jumping to action to ensure
we keep our customers' operations moving and critical medical supplies flowing into the hardest-hit
communities.

But I also hear stories of team members going above and beyond to make a difference in our
communities, like our technology team who are using additive technology to produce thousands of
face shields for health care workers and first responders, or our teams in Tennessee and in the U.K.
who quickly provided radiators for generators at the University of Southern California hospital and East
London's ExCel, Exhibition Center, which both delivered emergency medical care during the pandemic.

These moments and so many more are like them are the stories that fill me and our team with pride. And
these are the stories that demonstrate how we will emerge from this crisis even stronger.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kristine.

Kristine Elizabeth Kubacki
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. [Operator Instructions]
With that, operator, we are now ready for our first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Rafael, you had talked about your European and Asian sites from a Wabtec perspective coming back
online. But could you maybe talk about how the recovery is playing out in those regions on the demand
side? I suspect there's a little bit of a lag there.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Sure. I think a couple of comments there, Allison. Number one, I think, as of today, of our 162
manufacturing sites, we only have 2 that are still closed. And they've got, I'm going to call, specific plans
to be open within the next 10 days. So I think that's encouraging to see from that perspective. Of course,
I mean, as sites resume, I think we're dealing with a lot of government restrictions still. So that's to
be observed. And we're staying very much in line with our customers to understand how that pace of
recovery will take place.

And I think if you talked to most of our customers, they would describe as volumes really bottoming
between what I call the month of April and May and starting to really see a recovery through the end of
the second quarter and through the second half of the year. So I think that's probably the best description
of how we're seeing recovery ahead of us. But we do expect a significant impact in the second quarter
based on the bottoming of that volume.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Understand. And then that $15 million profit impact for the quarter from the closures, is there any
way to help us understand what percent went to Freight versus Transit there?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Allison, I would say that the majority of it was in the Transit area. The impact was really kind of disruption
to our operations and the ability to maybe complete and ship and recognize revenue on orders or -- both
from a supply chain or inflow of components, but as well our own operations and having the people there
and get things completed and things out the door. So the majority of that was in Europe and Asia.

Operator

Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Maybe to start with the balance sheet. Pat, you mentioned you've stress-tested the balance sheet and
expect to stay in compliance with your covenants. But is there any color you can provide on the EBITDA
downside scenarios that you're modeling as you think through that? And if possible, maybe talk about the
range of free cash flow outcomes in 2020 as you think about the different scenarios that you're assessing?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. It's a little bit of guidance in -- kind of wrapped in there. But what
we've done is, just as a reminder, our covenant ratios are about, for this quarter and the next, at 3.5x and

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

then it reduces to 3.25 debt-to-EBITDA on a kind of a bank basis for calculating that -- those covenants.
We've done a variety of scenarios. We've looked at percentage drops of kind of like a -- most likely a
deeper case. We've looked at changes within quarters where one quarter is more drastically affected than
others. And for the -- and we've -- as we've come out of those views, our covenants, we are staying within
those.

We feel like our cash conversion is aligned with what we gave in terms of guidance in the Investor Day,
a 90% cash conversion that will most likely improve because of working capital management. And so
all those things have really given us the opportunity to see strong -- we're confident in our strong cash
performance and meeting our covenants.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, just because things are changing so rapidly here, I was wondering
if you could provide any updates on the quarter-to-date trends you're seeing in the business, just maybe
from a revenue perspective.

And also, I think everybody is looking back to the last recession as a proxy. Obviously, the business has
changed a lot with acquisitions. Is there a way to think back and, I guess, look at the pro forma business
and what the aftermarket business did in the last recession on an organic basis as we think about kind of a
downside scenario for the aftermarket?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So Justin, let me maybe start here. Number one, I think just with regards to cash flow conversion, we see
an opportunity here to increase debt conversion from the 90% above that we've guided into our Investor
Relations, so just keep that in mind. The second piece here is, as we look into the first quarter, I think
as you think about aftermarkets, and I'll break it down here on the Freight side, it grew 8% against pro
forma.

So I think we've seen at least a couple of bright spots in the business. And the Services is certainly one
of them. Digital Electronics is another one. I think we've talked quite a bit before about the fact that
we've got -- our international fleets are growing. I think we see -- especially across customers, there are
some that are being less impacted, especially you're more dependent on agriculture or specific single
commodities versus dependence on what I call global trade or general cargo intermodal. So I think
that's playing differently across different geographies that we serve. And of course, there's different end
markets, too, for that context. I think we see mining potentially less impacted than the overall freight
market.

So we remain confident in terms of the long-term view for some of these segments. We do again expect,
really based on the discussions we've had with our customers, to see bottoming of volume between here
and the months of April and May time frame, with recovering starting to happen in the later part of this
quarter and through the second half of the year. Pat?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would just -- it's a difficult comparison to previous crisis. I mean not everything is the same. This
is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen in our lifetime. I just keep coming back to the strength
of our aftermarket and service business, which will be disrupted, as Rafael talked about, but is obviously
critical to any kind of recovery and part of the essential businesses that still operate, and in some cases,
operate with some strength. So we feel good about the business, the core business, the base business and
the cash flow that it'll generate.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

The last thing I would add there, Justin, is just we're confident about our backlog. We're staying very close
with customers. And through that process, of course, there's the impact in terms of shipments based on
some of the impacts we've had and our customers have had through the second quarter. But I think the
backlog gives us a strong confidence about the long-term views and the fundamentals of the business.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And Pat, on the quarter-to-date part of that question, is there anything you can share on how the business
has trended from a revenue perspective or just looking at aftermarket?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's a little preliminary to be talking about our -- about the quarter and what -- how we performed in
April. I understand the desire to get a little bit of direction there, but it's a bit early. I can say that what
we've been doing is, is focusing on some KPIs, looking at, again, our confidence in our backlog and how
that's evolving, and looking at our kind of cash performance on a daily, weekly basis. And so far, we feel
that, that performance kind of supports all the comments about our confidence and strength in the overall
view of backlog and cash flow.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Maybe just drilling down a little bit on the cash flow and working capital. It sounds like there's some
efforts as the year goes on to maybe improve the working capital sort of dynamics. Can you talk a little bit
about sort of the first quarter and sort of dynamics within working capital, and then how that may sort of
improve as you move forward through the rest of 2020?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we talked about the impact of those onetime items that really did impact our first quarter. We had
about $80 million worth of cash outflow, which are working capital items. But that cash outflow related to
prior year reserves and accruals that were paid in the first quarter, they were restructuring, transaction-
related. They were litigation-related. So that $80 million did impact Q1. You look at the rest of kind of the
working capital performance in Q1, you do have a seasonality there. We have these outflows that happen
in Q1 specific to some comp and benefit-type things, some incentive-related reserves. And then you also
have a very good performance in Q4 that probably impacted our Q1 a little bit.

And what you'll see throughout the year is that our working capital, where we anticipate kind of the
normal performance where you -- it becomes a source of cash throughout the rest of the year. And then
you layer into it the impact of a business that we've talked about, the disruption that's occurring related
to the virus and our operations and revenue, and you would anticipate that the working capital would
become a bit of a source of cash over the course of the rest of the year. So we feel like that working
capital performance and for the remaining quarters will help us drive our cash conversion up for the
remainder of the year.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay, okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that color. And then just maybe thinking bigger picture about the
Transit outlook and maybe how we can think about sort of government budgets, just sort of potential
longer-term changes post COVID-19, are there any sort of beginnings of thoughts around how this
business might look and sort of the shape or trajectory of this business might look in sort of a 3- to 5-
year window? I know it's early on in this process and we're still sort of learning about it, but kind of

curious maybe, Rafael, your thoughts around how this business might evolve over time, if it will be sort of
impacted.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think what I'd say is the short term, I mean, certainly, ridership has been impacted. But as we look
at really the restarting of economies, I mean -- and if you look at some of these transit systems and
implementation of what I'll call safe distancing, it's going to demand more trains, more investments. So
we're certainly looked at as, I think, a positive for the Transit segment. So I think we continue to see
demand there, and it's certainly part of also a commitment of continuing to, I think, moving things in a
better way. So I think we're bullish there.

And I'll just take the opportunity to also mention, as we think about some of the dynamics on the freight
side, I think we also see, I think, potentially some opportunities playing out of this, which would include
elements of -- I think some of our end markets really valuing a lot more reliability in terms of their supply
chains. And there could be an element, especially for North America, in terms of nearshoring or onshoring
some of the supply chain. So those are probably, I think, a couple of things that we could see out of this
that would certainly drive volumes and trends up for the end markets we serve.

Operator

Our next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So a lot of the North American freight railroads talked about -- I think they still want to do locomotive
modernization. Some may actually use the downtime to do more, but they're also, like everybody
else, cutting capital expenditures. Where we stand now, Rafael, how does that impact the outlook for
modernization this year? Are we looking at fewer modernizations or in line or up?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think at this point, we see our continuous commitment to the modernization program is a big part of how
you drive efficiency and productivity into the customers' operations. And I'll probably add to that some
of the elements of our Digital Electronics business as well. So we're seeing a commitment there. And I
think there's continued opportunity to play that also internationally. And I think we're currently discussing
a few opportunities to drive upgrades internationally as well and continue to grow from the opportunity to
highlight it end of last year.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

But it's too soon to say whether modernization revenue would be -- directionally, how it would look
relative to your expectations a few months ago?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I'd say -- I mean, we're confident about the backlog and I'd say we've walked into this year with that
backlog fundamentally secured. And it was the same with regards to new locomotives, which was
expected to be down. I do want to remind you that, for the first quarter, and we had -- I mentioned that
before, we expect that both new locomotive shipments and modernizations to be lower. So that was even
pre-COVID. But I think we remain confident about dynamics of demand for mods in the business.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Got it. And just one more question. If you can just talk broadly about the impact of lower oil prices on the
different part of your business.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So if you think about lower oil prices, I think as far as the freight market goes, it really calls for
about 7% of what North America railroads transport. That's probably where we would see most of that
impact. I'd say, less than 1/3 of that 7% is really tied to any variation of, what I'll call, price of oil per se.
So it's less about that. And I think the one area to watch out is some of the energy markets that we serve
with our products, and that's an area that we'll continue to watch.

I think as we really follow with customers here on how they're seeing volume ahead, I mean, we're very
much committed to make sure we're taking the necessary cost actions to adjust the different parts of the
business to face these new realities.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Yes. And I'm glad you're all doing well. I'm wondering if you could talk about the opportunities to
accelerate the cost-reduction targets as a result of the weaker demand environment. Anything that you
could do to come out a step ahead on the strategic front out of this lower volume environment. And if you
could talk about your expectations for synergies, savings cadence over the course of this year given the
evolving playbook that would be helpful.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Let me start, and I'll maybe pass it on to Pat. I think I'll probably start with just SG&A is down for the first
quarter about 70 basis points. Hopefully, you've seen that a lot of these actions were taken in the back of
the year. So if you look at '19, we were actually growing volume above 5% and we took more than 5%
headcount down during that time. So we are committed to take the necessary actions. They're challenging
and tough actions, but necessary to the environment we have. And we're going to continue to do that.
We've had announcements in terms of reductions in some of our key sites, and we'll continue to move in
that direction.

Earlier on, we talked about CapEx, and we're implementing more than 40% reduction. I want to balance
that with the following comment. I think a lot of that CapEx reduction was tied to projects that we have
volume associated with it. So we're either deferring or postponing some of these as we gain better
visibility ahead. I think I do want to, again, emphasize our commitment to R&D and continue to invest on
some key programs that will be differentiators for us, as we highlighted in the investor conference we had.

I think the other element has been really consolidating footprint. Last year, we did about 6% of footprint
consolidation, and that was about 1 million square feet. We're going to be executing on another 9%, so
that's also going to be an element of how we continue to drive costs down. And we're -- as I think about
the synergies per se, we're absolutely committed to the $150 million of synergy through the year. We do
recognize there could be an element of impact associated with volume. But again, I think we're continuing
to take further actions to make sure that we deliver on that. Maybe, Pat?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would just add, we're trying to be very disciplined about what we measure as synergies versus just
adjusting the business for the volume realities. It's -- we're doing both at the same time. And so if you --
to go back to your kind of original question is, is there anything we can do strategically to accelerate? We
had already accelerated the synergy plan, that we would hit our run rate a little bit earlier.

14

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

We're going to continue to execute on all of those expectations, all those plans, and that they can and
will be looked at as maybe done a little bit earlier based on volume. But nothing that we want to really
highlight at this point in terms of giving a number or anything plan-specific. All I can tell you is that we are
working on everything we can to make -- to ensure that we -- and we expect to get those synergies, but
to do more in terms of additional cost because of the change in the environment.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Expect us to use every lever in the business, and we'll continue to evaluate those and make sure that we
exercise those as we look into new realities ahead.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. I appreciate the color. And then in terms of Services and Electronics specifically, how discretionary
are aspects of those product lines in this type of environment where volumes are down 20% for your
customers? I'm sure they're also targeting OpEx reductions as well. Can you just talk about how critical
the Services are? Do you expect to continue to outperform in your Services versus Freight volumes? Just
high-level comments there would be great.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Well, first of all, there's certainly an element of impact there as customers park locomotives,
especially in North America, in the light of volume bottoming. I think we said before I think we have a
younger fleet, a fleet of locomotives that's more productive than our competitors' locomotives. So I think
we're better positioned in terms of being able to navigate through this downturn.

And I think a lot of the solutions that we have in the Digital Electronics, even though, to your point, some
of that could be discretionary spending, I think a lot of those play strong in terms of allowing customers
to get really lower costs, lowering expenses and ultimately getting the benefit with a relatively short term.
And so we continue to expect strength on those product lines.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I just -- I'm going to just reemphasize what Rafael just said is that the service side of our business
helps our customers drive efficiencies and reduce operating expense. It's really -- it's some of the premise
of PSR, but it -- and you would think that, that would continue as we go through the rest of the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So can you help us think about the -- with Transit ridership down at least so much in the near term, is that
having more of an impact on OE or aftermarket? How do we think about margin mix within Transit right
now? I know there was a comment in the release about committed to segment margin improvement, does
that apply to both of the segments this year?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So I'll maybe start. So I think as you think about Transit, I mean, I think we're seeing the end
customers continue to be committed to what I'll call the projects per se. There could be an element of, I'll
call, impacts of what I'll call services for the short term just based on, well, ridership being down. I think,
again, we're probably going to see -- and as we talk to customers, I think there's an expectation that the
bottom of that has really happened between here, the months of April and May. And I think ridership is

15

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

expected to be ramping back up as we go into the later part of the quarter and into the second half of the
year. So I think that's one element.

I think a lot of the dynamics, what you saw in the quarter, per se, I think that referred to over $0.05 we
got on the impact on EPS. I think a lot of that came really associated with our inability to ship due to
shutdowns. And those were either to our own plants, especially in -- I'll probably mention here India and
parts of Europe. And well, of course, we have customers impacted through that as well. So in some cases,
the inability of customers receiving some of these shipments. But again, I think we're -- we have a solid
long-term view here for the business, and we're confident about strong fundamentals. Pat?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think kind of getting to your question about where -- what do we think about the impact of Transit
ridership being down. I think kind of near term, you're seeing a little bit of a mix of fewer trains running,
but maybe some pent-up demand for some maintenance and services and safety stock. So I mean some
of that is definitely occurring. I think the kind of more longer-term impact is that of a quarter or more of
a lower ridership will is to be seen. And part of the reason why we talk about our top line guidance the
way we have is we still have to see how this unfolds. But long term, our -- the areas that we're operating
in are heavily dependent and continue -- and will continue to rely on Transit. And in some way, it may
become opportunistic as everybody kind of figures out what transit looks like in the future.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

And I think when you reflect on the margin improvements, I think we're continuing to see the quality of
the order intake. Margins continue to improve there. So the orders are coming in. And the other piece is
we're seeing operational improvement in the business. That speaks to improvement on on-time delivery,
reduction on cost of quality. Of course, these comments are pre-COVID, and I mean, we'll be assessing
how COVID will be impacting some of that. But we're committed to the margin improvement on the Transit
segment.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then I want to sort of see if maybe we can get a little bit more color. I understand you won't
give us April revenue, and that's fine. But we're lapping GE, we don't really have any KPIs to track, there's
not great sort of comps. Like directionally, is there any sort of color on sort of how to think about revenue
right now, down mid-single, down high single, double-digit strong double -- like any sort of directional
color just because it's -- with you guys, it's particularly tough right now relative to some of the other
companies.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I appreciate the question, Scott. I don't -- with kind of pulling the guidance, I think, for the year, I
think it's a little bit difficult to put anything out there. April for us is still being kind of accumulated and
looked at. We feel good about -- as we're measuring where our backlog is and our cash flow performance,
is that we feel like it's well within some of the scenarios that we had outlined. But nothing that we really
want to talk about kind of publicly right now in terms of guidance.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Perhaps in the Q, maybe an update on April would be helpful.

I think mentioned mining being less impacted than the overall freight market. Could you talk about what
you saw from the industrial business in the quarter and how you're thinking about demand there for the
rest of the year?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think when we think about the impact, I think, certainly, the energy markets is the one that we're
probably more concerned about and the impact there as we serve some end customers on that regard.
We're working very closely with our mining customers and staying very close with Komatsu here, and I
think we continue to see opportunities for the services of that business. And I think we're seeing certainly
less of an impact there. I'd -- anything else you would add here, Pat?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

No. I mean, I think that some of the industrial markets are really -- they're tied to oil and gas or our heat
exchange business and some of our turbocharger business, and we've seen some decline in the quarter.
We imagine that, that decline will be sustained a little bit with the price of oil.

Saree Emily Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then you talked about continued strength on the Freight services side. I was just
wondering if you're seeing any of the rails perform more in-house services given the lower volumes.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Could you repeat that again, please?

Saree Emily Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

You talked about continued strength on the Freight services side, so I was just wondering, in your
conversations, if you've seen any of the rails perform more in-house servicing.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I'd say, no, we haven't seen any significant change to that. I think, in fact, we have some opportunities
here to help the railroads potentially driving efficiency through that process. So if you think about mods
and some of the elements of things that we do on the services side of the house, so I think that's a
continued opportunity for us. We don't see that as an impact to our revenues right now.

So I'll say our sites resumed operations today in India, except for one of them, which I think we have a
clear line of sight to starting back up within less than a week. And I think we're going to be watching really
closely here. But right now, things seems to be really moving in the right direction, and we would have the
ability to catch up for the year. And even as we look at it in the quarter, there has been, I think, potentially
some opportunity to partially recover some of the volume lost there in terms of shipments. Does that
answer your question?

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. And then also, you commented on kind of quantifying the COVID-related drag on the
quarter as being about $0.05 or $15 million. Can you just comment what exactly you're including into that
and how you would break that down between Freight and Transit?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We didn't view it as -- when we were talking about this, this is not something we added back. We just
highlighted it for -- just for exactly this question. I mean, mostly, it's revenue impact to our operations
in India, the ability to get some of our loco build finalized. But I'll also point out, we have a pretty sizable
Transit business in India that was also impacted. And again, it was just the timing of shipments and --
production and shipments in the quarter at the end of the quarter.

The rest of the impact is European operations, where shutdowns or partial shutdowns occurred. And again,
maybe something -- things weren't shipped and the revenue recognized, or our inputs components from
suppliers didn't arrive in time and we weren't able to complete the project.

So all those things kind of added up into the $15 million worth of EBIT impact. We did not have a lot of
-- we had some, but nothing worth highlighting of like cleanup costs or any kind of things like that. We
clearly were taking the appropriate steps to protect our employees, to make sure that any kind of cleaning
or any kind of disruption that way were viewed. But the $0.05 that we're talking about here are really
revenue disruptions.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just one more clarification on the 9% footprint consolidation. Was that incremental to your
previous plans? Or was that kind of what's expected to achieve, the synergy targets you guys are putting
[ out ]?

million that we're committed to deliver in the year.

On the confidence in the backlog, maybe you could just talk a little bit about this. I just want to see, have
you had customers come in and have discussions about shifting? Maybe you could talk to us and give us
some precedent in prior downturns, how has that committed spending been and is the -- is that tied to
production schedules in terms of the backlog? Can they shift delivery times and push that out? Just want
to understand how the time frame works on that backlog as well.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Yes. So I think you bring a great point. I mean this is not the first downturn we're going through. We will
operate and work very closely with customers here, and we're confident about that $22 billion backlog at
this point. We're, of course, working with customers as COVID has impacted operations, so there could be
a shift in terms of when some of these projects are shipped. But overall, confident about delivering on that
backlog.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. Just can you expand a little bit on that, Rafael? Have customers come and asked for delays? I just
want to understand the commitment on that.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think the backlog is largely -- again, I think we're executing through that backlog. The elements of delay
are really associated with some of the dynamics we've seen in the quarter. A lot of it's due to our, I'll call,
own inability to catch up on some of the elements of this delivery, just based on the shutdowns we've
been subject to, or customers' ability to also be receiving or executing through that. So I think, again,
back to my original comment, the confidence on the backlog is there. And we will always be working with
our customers proactively on that regard.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

But no comment directly on if customers have come and asked for delays or what the negotiations like of
that? I think I'm just trying to understand how that...

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

So Ken, I mean, I think some of it -- we're constantly in conversation with all our backlog and all our
customers about the timing of deliveries and so it does have an impact. And when we kind of look at
the current year, right now, we have a lot of confidence in these -- in the current scheduling in terms
of manufacturing and delivering, but it will -- you do have this kind of constant demand on us and
our customers to kind of work on when and how we're going to deliver the backlog. So it's not kind of
simple as just saying, well, have they all of a sudden just showed up and asked the question, this is how
everything unfolds every year.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then just on the second part of that, was that -- is it tied to your production schedules? Do they
-- can they shift the delivery times? Is that part of the backlog discussions you have?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think there's a mix, there's an element of, I'll call, long-term orders that we're certainly executing
through it. There could be delays there. I think the area where you could see some variations really tied
to more transactional volume associated with potentially fleets that are being parked and maintenance, to
some extent, that's going to be deferred due to the fact you're not utilizing equipment. And most of that
impact is certainly going to be felt here, I think, in the second quarter, based on my earlier comments of
bottoming of volume between the months of April and May time frame. And we do expect that to resume
as we go towards the end of this quarter and the second half of the year.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up, you -- on Courtney's question before about the 9% footprint consolidation.
Maybe just expand on that a bit. Are you doing any structural changes now that you look at post-merger?

19

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

And given the downturn in demand, do you see like yourself accelerating some of these structural
changes? Or are you saying, with $150 million, you're sticking with the target, maybe accelerated that
plan within that target, but there are no new moves that you're putting within that, that are clear now that
you've got downturn and can make bigger changes?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So certainly, I think volume reductions allow us to potentially look at, I'll call it, accelerating some of
these elements. And I think when I go back to our comments of staying committed to deliver on the $150
million of synergies for the year, there's certainly an element of that. And despite of any, I think, volume
reductions we're seeing there on the synergies, especially if you think from a sourcing perspective, there
could be, I'll call it, an impact there. I think we've got areas of opportunities here to continually to take
action on.

Our next question comes from Jeff Gates with Gates Capital.

Jeffrey Linn Gates
Gates Capital Management, Inc.

Yes. I have a question. If I look at the GE business that you purchased, can you talk about the seasonality
of that? And it looks like the first quarter from the pro formas you gave last year show that it's typically
very seasonally weak in the first quarter. And I'm just wondering, what is it about that business that
makes it so seasonal?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Jeff, I think the seasonal aspect of this business, and Rafael may add on to this, is that -- is the service
side. I think our customers have a kind of overweight in the loco areas, the service business, into the third
quarter and not so much in the first and in the fourth. And so that's the real seasonal element about it.

But when you kind of look at it over a multiyear period, you do have the impact of projects and that which
is OE and is driven by customer demands and expectations, their own fleet strategies for new equipment
and then international projects, too. So that can kind of create some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in
terms of revenue recognition. But the true seasonal part, which is the service of North America and
international locomotives, tends to be very heavily weighted into Q3 and not so much in Q1.

Jeffrey Linn Gates
Gates Capital Management, Inc.

But am I thinking about it correctly that the GE business, the first quarter is more seasonally weaker than
the legacy Wabtec business?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think if you were to look historically, I think there could be elements of like weakness in the first quarter.
But back to Pat's comment, it's really more tied to time of projects than anything else. And as I look into
specifically this quarter, we did have both elements of not just lower shipments on new locomotives, but
we also expected lower shipments on the modernization side. And those were even pre-COVID. So largely,
again, project-driven.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

And I would add one other element. And I don't know how many periods or what periods you're
comparing, but there's -- if you go outside of the numbers that we've provided, you have different
revenue recognition standards, and that would maybe exaggerate some of the seasonality. But I think that

20

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

it's fair to say that Q1 is seasonally -- is lower on the service side, Q3 is a little bit higher. Wabtec, on the
other hand, which is doing freight car service and maintenance, maybe a little bit different. But now it's a
much smaller percentage of the total business, where that seasonality would be more Q1 and less in Q3.
So a lot of things to kind of add and subtract from the [indiscernible].
