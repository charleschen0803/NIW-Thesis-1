IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the IDEX Corporation First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer.
Thank you. You may begin.

Michael John Yates
VP & Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for
IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX first
quarter 2021 financial highlights.

Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the
3 months ending March 31, 2021. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during
today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com.

Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer.
The format for our call today is as follows: we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of our
business, an update on our M&A activity and an overview of our order performance and outlook for our
end markets; Bill will then discuss our first quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our
outlook for the second and -- quarter and full year 2021; finally, Eric will conclude with an update on our
sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the
call for your questions.

If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay, beginning
approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660 6853 and
entering conference ID number 13712089 or you may simply log on to our company's homepage for the
webcast replay.

Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are
subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release in IDEX's filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now the call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Mike. Once again, our teams across IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we've
achieved together. I don't think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state
of the world a year ago. Our diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve us well. We're
seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point. We continue
to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our
expectations 90 days ago.

Although tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we're keeping
a close eye on. Our day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial
sector moving forward. Customers are more confident in their outlook but are now trying to balance the
surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments.

As for COVID, the conditions vary widely around the world. In the U.K. and the United States, the
vaccination rate has been remarkable of late. In China, much of life has been continuing as normal for
many months now. The situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a
serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic
has had in our businesses.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

The quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of
parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles in a variety of staffing challenges, this was far
from smooth sailing. Recognizing all of that, I want to thank every IDEX employee on this call for their
efforts in the past quarter. I'm proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve
these results. The operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off.

Pivoting a moment to capital deployment. With the closure of the ABEL Pumps transaction this quarter
and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night, covered in more detail in a moment, we
have started off 2021 on a strong note. And we'll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A
capabilities. We recently allocated some of our most talented resources towards focused strategy and
business development roles, and we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess,
win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX.

Our deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX
style of competition. We seek to both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses as well
as established positions within new market niches where the capabilities of our teams will drive the most
value for customers and shareholders. We are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy
towards these efforts.

Moving on to Slide 7. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum Group from EagleTree
Capital for $470 million. Airtech engineers and manufactures high-performance regenerative blowers,
pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps. Airtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA
margin in the mid-30s range in 2020. It is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax
benefits.

Within the IDEX family of businesses, they complement and expand upon the solutions provided by Gast
Manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower, air moving products and systems that include air
compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems. While there are some overlaps in the solutions
they provide, much of Airtech's product lines will be complementary. They will remain separate businesses
within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise
leading to further innovation. This deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter, will then create a
$200 million pneumatics platform within our Health & Science Technology segment.

Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. The positive momentum in order trends continued in the first
quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially, allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the
quarter. Most of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels. I'll go into more details in a
minute. Organic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all-time high for us.
Q1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019.

As we look across our segments, Health & Science Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products
delivered strong organic order growth, with Fluid and Metering Technology slightly lagging. As growth
rates in HST and FSDP begin to naturally level off, we expect FMT will drive additional growth due to the
return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year.
These commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and
the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers.

On Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets. To level set, we entered the year
cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery.
Our day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year, and we continue to leverage our
diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the
pandemic. We are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels. Many of our markets
have fully recovered, and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of
the year.

As I mentioned earlier, we're not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply
chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end
markets.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, industrial day rates continued to increase throughout the
quarter. As I've mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large CapEx projects resume, but
the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back towards 2019 levels. Agriculture
continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong. Our water
business is stable. We continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic on municipal funding
as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill. Energy markets continue to lag 2019
levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector.

Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We experienced solid growth across almost all
of our markets, semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and
winning share with our differentiated technology offerings. The overall automotive market faces many
challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance. Our AI and life science
markets are on the rebound as the impact of the pandemic in the United States has improved. The
industrial businesses within the segment are seeing a similar result to FMT. Day rates are improving, but
projects are lacking.

One last item for HST. We do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been taking -- talking about
in this segment, specifically around testing. The end product application is yet to receive FDA approval
which will impact volumes for this year. We do believe that the strength in the rest of the segment will be
able to offset most of that risk.

Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment, dispensing continues its rebound as large
retailers free up capital and work through pent-up demand for equipment. Much like our automotive
exposures in HST, the auto recovery in FSD at BAND-IT is driven by new platform wins, coupled with an
improved market. In Fire & Rescue, we continue to assess municipal budget headwinds, especially in
Europe and India as budgets have not been released, delaying tenders. The U.S. market has been better,
and we are optimistic about the impact of our businesses from increased infrastructure spending.

The other ligand category in FSD is primarily BAND-IT's energy and aerospace exposure along with some
industrial applications in Fire & Rescue. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and are focused
on ensuring the stability of our supply chain. This persistence in global supply chain issues threatened
to create choppiness in the back half of the year. Despite these factors, we are confident enough in our
outlook to raise our organic growth expectations for the year.

With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year.

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q1 orders of $711 million were
up 10% overall and up 6% organically as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders
grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide.

First quarter sales of $652 million were up 10% overall and 6% organically. We experienced growth across
all our segments, with over 75% of our business units increasing year-over-year. Strength in semicon,
food and pharma and dispensing were the notable highlights in the quarter.

Q1 gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 44.9% but was up 110 basis points sequentially. The
year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, inventory step-up
associated with ABEL, mix and onetime inventory reserves. The inventory reserves were associated with
our pandemic-related electrostatic sprayer businesses not materializing at the rate we expected. Excluding
acquisitions and the inventory reserves, gross margin would have been flat to prior year.

First quarter operating margin was 23.9%, up 40 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating
margin was 24.3%, up 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the increased volume and the
impact of cost actions taken last year, offset by the gross margin pressure I just mentioned. I will discuss
the drivers of operating income in more detail on the following slide.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.6%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20% due to a decrease
in the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This drove a $0.05 headwind on EPS for the
quarter. First quarter adjusted net income was $115 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.51, up $0.18
or 14% over prior year. Excluding the $0.05 tax headwind, adjusted EPS would have been up $0.23 or
17%.

Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $95 million, up 32% compared to prior year and was 82% of
adjusted net income. The strong performance was driven by higher earnings and the continued impact of
our working capital initiatives.

Moving on to Slide 12. As Eric mentioned, we entered the quarter cautiously optimistic about the pace
of growth coming into 2021. We knew that we were structurally well positioned to take advantage of
improving market conditions from the cost actions and discretionary controls we put in place last year.
Adjusted operating income increased $18 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 6% organic
growth contributed approximately $13 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. The
impact of previous discretionary cost controls contributed $5 million, and we were able to net $4 million
from price productivity, partially offset by inflation.

After accounting for $2 million of negative mix, our organic flow-through was extremely strong at 58%.
Flow-through was then negatively impacted by the $3 million charge related to the inventory reserve
I discussed on the last slide and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting to a reported flow-
through of 32%. As we highlighted in prior calls, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to
drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We have already started those investments and expect the
associated costs from these initiatives will reduce our organic flow-through in subsequent quarters.

With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. I'm
on Slide 13. For the second quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.63, with organic
revenue growth of 18% to 20%, and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The second quarter
effective tax rate is expected to be about 23%, and we expect a 2% top line benefit from the impact
of FX. Corporate costs in the second quarter are expected to be around $21 million, with the increase
primarily driven by the M&A investments we discussed earlier.

Turning to the full year outlook. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from $5.65 to $5.95, up to
$6.05 to $6.20. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 6% to 8%, up to 9%
to 10%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 1% benefit to
top line results. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are
anticipated to be around $55 million. Free cash flow is now expected to be 115% to 120% of net income.
And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $74 million for the full year.

Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs or earnings associated with future acquisitions or
restructuring charges. ABEL Pump is now included in these estimates, with the deal closed in the first
quarter. Airtech is not included in these estimates. We will update our guidance accordingly once the deal
closes. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 14. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to share an
update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. We recently published our second
corporate social responsibility report. This report is our first to adopt the sustainable Accounting Standards
Board's sector standards, also known as SASB. We have increased our disclosures in key areas, including
health and safety, diversity and environmental impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank
Denise Cade, our General Counsel and her cross-functional team for their outstanding efforts to bring our
hard work and commitments to light.

Diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be a point of emphasis in our evolving company culture. Since
we last met, an outside facilitator conducted anonymous focus groups with employees from around the
world, from which we learned and were able to begin developing more targeted goals for the company. We

are currently planning training sessions for all leaders to help them understand and become comfortable
fostering dialogue on these important issues. We are addressing our talent management processes,
including our assessment of existing talent and our consideration of new talent through recruiting to help
ensure our processes are free from unconscious bias, and we are assessing our purchasing practice to
expand our use of diverse suppliers.

IDEX is a decentralized company with a diverse collection of businesses. Our superior economic model
depends upon problem-solving and decision-making at the point of impact, closest to our customers. Our
collective work within this important area, as outlined in this report, is an essential component of our next
phase of business growth.
With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So let's just talk about what's embedded in guidance here. Obviously, a really strong first quarter. Second
quarter guide seems where the uptick in guidance comes from, between the first and the second quarter,
maybe a little less movement in the back half of the year relative to prior expectations. So just kind of
want to understand what the trajectory you're thinking about through the year is, how you're viewing the
recovery, how much of what I just mentioned is true? And what are some of the puts and takes you're
thinking about? Because obviously, the tone that you're striking is cautiously optimistic as you move in the
back half of the year, I just want to make sure I have all those things balanced.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Well, thanks, Mike. I mean, look, it -- I mean it's an interesting time, as I said in the opening
comments there, I mean, we've got this broad-based momentum which we feel really good about. And it's
got the little chapters that lie over it, whether that's shutdowns coming out of Christmas, terrible weather
in Texas in February, supply chain stuff now, and I think that's going to be the story as we go. And then
that lays over the IDEX story, which always kind of had our second quarter as a high point for us. And so
we see that momentum lining up nicely on our typically seasonally adjusted second quarter.

And in the back half, I think that's going to be a story. We've got some projects and things that we know
about on the inside that we feel good about. We think the momentum certainly will continue, but we would
suspect we're still going to have a lot of these challenges out there that we'll have to navigate around. And
of course, then, I think the typical seasonal patterns that we see around summer shutdowns and things
in Europe are embedded on top of that. So it's an interesting story with very broad-based support, early
momentum, these kind of episodic challenges that we have to navigate around that we feel confident and
we will.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So on those challenges, supply chain inflation, price/cost dynamics, maybe talk about how those are
impacting you? When do you think there's, call it, peak pain from your perspective on all these things
hitting, was that -- I mean first quarter margins were obviously excellent. Second quarter implies still very
good. So just talk about how you're managing effectively. I mean you did a ton of work coming into this to
prepare for a lot of these challenges, but I'd certainly like to understand how it's impacting you and how it
phases through the year?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, sure. Well, look, we -- this is where our model and our talent really helps us. I mean we've got a
lot of local sourcing, very close to where we produce, very close to where we sell, so we have kind of an
inherent advantage there. And we got really, really talented teams that used, frankly, a lot of the lessons
of the year's worth of severe acute phase of the pandemic to make some smart moves around supply
chain to prepare us for this.

That being said, I would say on the inflationary front, it's kind of spotty for us. I mean remember, we're
a little further down the food chain. We don't buy a lot of giant quantities of base material, we buy things
that have been converted. So it does have a little bit of a lag for us. And so we see the same things
others are seeing, where we buy lots of metals, there's some inflationary pressure, electronics, a few

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

other places, but we're navigating around those. On the freight side, that's certainly a challenge, both on
the price, frankly, more on the availability side. We're no different than anybody else trying to find sea
containers, trucking, trains, port facilities that have to unclog, all of those things. Our model helps us, our
folks help us.

I think as we go further out, the inflationary pressure, I actually think that's going to ramp up a bit for
everybody. One of the things that you can still appreciate, I see it in our own businesses is, today, we still
have a little bit of a benefit of, our people are good scavengers. They'll go around and they'll find some
things over here, find some places over there, take advantage of some inventory shelf stock. Eventually,
you kind of get back where you're right at the end of the factory, and then you're kind of dealing with
what everybody else is.

So we're planning for that. We're making all the moves that we need to. And certainly, of course, all of
this for us, you can never tell the story without talking about price capture. And so we've got these things
aligned. And as you suspect, we're always trying to manage that spread and taking advantage of the
price capture side as we sell and then executing the heck out of a difficult environment on the back end
to maintain that spread as we go and doing it all with our customers' top of mind and considering and
remembering the lead time requirements that we have, kind of where we sit, the criticality of what we do,
that's what drives all of it.

Michael John Yates
VP & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Mike. So we were pretty comfortable relative to where we're sitting right now that we've maintained
our historical price cost spread. Where we have seen some businesses, the inflation has ramped up here
more quickly. They've gone out proactively with incremental prices or surcharges to our customers. So
our commercial teams are actively working with their supply chain teams to make sure that we have the
ability to continue that spread as we progress through the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

There were a couple products cited in the prepared remarks, COVID-related that were looking like they
were lagging in terms of initial expectations. I know last year, that was part of an IDEX initiative. There
were $25 million to $100 million potential revenue, new COVID products. It sounds like this -- 2 of these
were in that bucket, the HST, the COVID tester and for FMT, the electrostatic sprayer. So just give us an
update to those COVID-related initiatives, how many -- not all are going to come through, we get that, but
just where does that stand in terms of expectations?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So I'll kind of start back in the beginning and just walk this from high to low. I mean we originally
talked about that range pretty quickly that moved to about $60 million. That was split pretty evenly
between 2020 and '21. So now we're kind of talking about a $30 million bucket for this year. And the 2
biggest components in there were the electrostatic sprayer application, which we talked about and you
saw in the margin walk, I'll come back to that in a second, and then the COVID testing, the diagnostic
application which was always a little bit more back-end loaded. And as you noted and we noted in our
remarks, we've got some pressure points around both of those related, frankly, to the improving situation
that we see across the globe in terms of vaccination rates and some other things.

On the sprayer front, that's literally as binary as some -- a change in thought, a change in thought that
was part of the CDC guidelines around the need for standardization, not being as high as previously
thought, at a time pretty coincident with some of our launch planning. So as you suspect, we've taken a
slightly different view of that business. I think it's a good product line. There are still plenty of places, a lot

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

of it involved in transportation where that's still going to be an essential piece of it, but it's no doubt going
to run out slower.

I do want to pause just for a second though and point out the positive aspect of that. That was one of
our hardest hit businesses in terms of their core markets that rallied massively quickly, put together a
business and put together all this product and got it ready to, frankly, live our mission and try to make the
world a better place. So we celebrate that one, and we're going to leverage that capability going forward.

On the other side, on the testing front, it's a little bit more complex. We've got some issues on FDA
approvals with our partners, and we have this backdrop of vaccinations and things rolling out across the
world. But I must tell you, so I think we're viewing that a little less favorably as we go forward, again,
with an eye towards what happens in the back half. Though the world still is not at the recommended
level of surveillance testing, we're underneath it by more than half. And we still think this has a role to
play, but we want to at least point out that there's an impact of an improving world to a couple of these
applications. But overall, couldn't be happier with how our teams responded and put together the solutions
here.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

All right. That's really helpful. And look, we'd much rather see you take these shots on goal because that's
good initiative, and there's always some positives that will come out of it in terms of product development
and other market opportunities. So I appreciate all that.

Second question, Just -- it's more for Bill, just in terms of expectations on incrementals for the balance
of the year, and I really appreciate how you highlight the organic drop-through to separate out like
the inventory reserve taken, so just the expectation here, both on reported incrementals and organic
incrementals? And what is baked in on guidance here?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, yes. So maybe I'll speak to the organic. Obviously, really healthy. We look at core organic flow-
through at 58%. I think relative to increasing guide, where we're at with our reinvestments, discretionary
cost add-backs, that's probably going to moderate around the low 40s as we progress through the second,
third and fourth quarters. If you do the math, that's really what's implied with the revised EPS guidance.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.

Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just want to go back to your comments on the industrial, more around that big project focus, just want to
make sure I understand it. It sounds like it's -- the first half's still really slow. Second half, you're getting
some expectation that, that could improve. Any color there? Is it sort of confidence from customers
increasing quality of inquiries? Any color you can provide on that side?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, absolutely. I mean it's an important piece of the business, especially as we think about the rest of
the year. I think actually the situation is changed there. The daily order rates, of course, we pointed to
that momentum, and that's a great sign. That's a great sign that the system is working and that the
momentum is there. The project side, I think, has shifted from one of confidence in a lack of belief in, let's
say, an improving outlook in the world and all of those things. That's actually quite favorable now.

I think now it's actually caught up in a state, a zone of people just trying to execute it. And I look at
my own businesses and see some of that same thing where some things -- larger projects we've been

thinking about, a lot of people that would have been moving those along are trying really, really hard
to ship product, get things going, understanding bets on inventory, all of that. So as we engage with
customers, particularly right down that fairway of industrials within SMT, this is the difference in tone. You
see a lot of optimism, but you also see a lot of very, very busy people. And that's especially true of the
nature of the kind of projects we have. These are kind of those medium-term expansions of facilities and
things like that.

So we're pretty confident, very confident that those are going to come back. In some ways, we just maybe
get a little bit more space to work on them, continue to see the momentum that's already out there and
then the lines cross, and we think that's an important part of our story going forward.

Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then just next, M&A, it sounds like a pretty active pipeline, 2 deals so far. I
guess, two things. One, how are you balancing that managerial capacity to handle some of these incoming
properties with activity increasing? And then second is really around leverage, any change to sort of that
comfort level? And if there's some, I would say, more interesting opportunities that come along here, just
any thoughts there?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. No, great questions. Well, so a couple of things. And just capacity, in general, as you've seen in the
comments for a couple of quarters here, we've been building that all along. A lot of the optimization we've
done with IDEX over the last 5 years gave us the muscle that we're now leaning on as we think about
looking for acquiring and integrating companies. So that's something just at the foundational level.

Relative to the 2 transactions that we have here, they're both very good standalone businesses that --
while they're going to require some integrative activity, these are well positioned, in good shape and, let's
say, a lighter touch in terms of demand from IDEX talent across the board. And so bottom line is, I feel
confident that we could continue to work the funnel that we have, with the intent that we're driving. If we
were to kind of lap this experience again in the back half, I wouldn't see that as a problem in terms of our
teams being able to go out and work on acquisitions.

I will tell you, as you suspect, we always filter these. There are some properties that if we said yes and
we were successful, they take a lot more work than others. And we would factor that in, and we're always
pretty aware of that. But right now, in very good shape with an intentional build on the bottom side, and
on the top, 2 transactions that very fortunately are in kind of great shape out of the gate.

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

And then relative to your second part of your question, I would say, we still think our balance sheet is
most efficient at about 2.5x. So relative to the capital availability we have on hand plus additional leverage
for us to go deploy another $2 billion post the Airtech closure is extremely reasonable. So we have more
than enough capacity to go after the things that Eric just mentioned.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.

Connor Joseph Lynagh
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to talk about the Airtech acquisition. Just wondering if you could sort of provide an overview of
why you found this to be an attractive asset, how we should think about the market structure and the
competitive positioning of the firm?

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

CEO, President & Director

Sure. Well, this is an exciting transaction. This is a really, really phenomenal company, and it sits very
nicely next to the Gast business that we illustrated there on the opening deck. In the nature that they're
both involved with very, very specialized air handling applications, but they're highly complementary, so
the strengths of Gast in different areas of compression are then balanced very nicely with the regenerative
blower side and the specialty in the valve piece of Airtech. So they fit together seamlessly.

What I really, really like about these businesses is they're both filled with incredible domain experts who
have just got phenomenal abilities to innovate. Airtech has got a great growth track record. As I said in
my opening comments, it's very profitable, very close to end markets that we're extremely interested
in. On the Gast side, we've got some of that as well. And frankly, we've got a lot of channel strength in
markets that I think are going to complement that business.

And then we've got a toolkit. We've got a talent base, a cultural base and an 80/20 toolkit that we know
when you apply to IDEX-like businesses, particularly ones of high quality, can drive the whole thing
further.

Last piece of it is there's other things out there in this world that could be interesting that the 2 businesses
together may unlock for us that are part of our -- the funnel and things that we're thinking about as we
consider capital deployment in the future. So the suite of options, but around a -- all of it centered around
a super attractive business that we could not be happier with.

Connor Joseph Lynagh
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, understood. Maybe just to dive a little deeper on that, could you help us understand sort of the big
end markets that the business serves and just how you think about longer term ex-COVID normalization
type growth within the business?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Sure, sure. I mean the business has got -- it's similar to Gast in some respects. It's got kind of an
industrial core that serves as a foundation piece, both financially and in terms of scale. And then in
the markets that they've picked, they've done some nice things in alternative energy. They've done
some great work within some specialty medical applications, some very interesting things around some
technologies that are going to be important for the world going forward, industrial tech.

So they just -- again, it's a lot like IDEX. The many of them are industrial like applications, but they really
leverage being up at the tightest end of the tolerance and duty spectrum. And this business has a great
filter in terms of how they bring those about. So a lot of it's going to sum up to general industrial, but
when you pick at it, that next level has always been the most important for us, and you just see incredible
little niche applications that line up really well with their capabilities and the financials of the business.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

A couple of questions. First, with respect to HST, it looked like that business delivered a pretty nice
breakout performance from an operating margin standpoint. Can you talk about what's sort of driving that
and how you feel about the sustainability in that profit performance that you delivered here in Q1?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, sure. I'll take the first stab on it, and then Eric can add. No, I think relative to the actions that we
took last year to restructure some of these assets and then the mix of the businesses within the portfolio

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

that have performed extremely well here over the last couple of quarters. So the combination of, hey, a
much better foundation to build off of. They did have significant growth and then the mix of sales within
the different businesses were the primary drivers. So I'd say, we would look for them to be at this level of
profitability here, going forward.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Got it. And then just as a follow-up to the price cost sort of question that came up earlier, how much price
were you guys able to realize in Q1? And how much incremental price realization will you need in the
balance of the year to keep that price cost spread where you want it?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Well, so we were just north of the point, in Q1. That was fully in line with what we saw on the inbound
side. I honestly think it'll -- we're going to aggressively target to ratchet that up a bit, but we always
do that with the indicators that we see and thinking a lot about the ultimate spread that we realize. So
I don't know that we've got a number of pegs, but we have a method that we peg, that sort of is very
active, follows along, takes advantage of the short lead times that we have and the way that we are able
to execute price.

So I guess the shortest answer would be probably north of where we are here. A lot of it's dependent on
where we see some of the underlying commodities and things heading for us, but always mindful of where
that spread is. But ultimately, we want to keep that as a net positive item for the company.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen.

Francisco Javier Amador
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Francisco on for Joe. Are you guys seeing any impact specific to the semi shortage, whether it's
specifically on that end market or any other markets that are sort of feeling the pain like automotive?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean we -- we see it in both fronts. So there are those occasions where end customers have
certainly got some issues. Automotive is the easiest one to point to. That's the more recent coming
into our world in the first quarter. We look at -- we think of that -- our exposure there is very much
programmed by program, so it literally comes down to kind of, are they making trucks versus cars? And so
we've seen some of that into the mix in Q1, and we talked about that.

From our side, we don't have a ton of computerized elements for the products we make. We see it
in sensors and some displays and some other places, so it's out there. And we're navigating just like
everybody else, but It's been -- frankly, we've been able to move around it, work around it and bring it all
together here.

Francisco Javier Amador
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then can you expand a little bit more on the dispensing side? Are you seeing
replenishment there like just expanding on the demand in general?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think -- yes, I think on the dispensing side, you see a couple of things coming together. I mean
you've -- one of the big drivers there has always been sort of life of the fleet. And we were coming up

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2021

at a point where that -- we knew that, that was going to be refreshed. On top of that, of course, we
had a pandemic where frankly, there -- even while we were locked down and shut down, there was a lot
of painting going on, and you saw a reluctance to say, well, let's go interrupt that stream with capital
deployment.

So now that we've kind of passed through that, you've got kind of those 2 things coming together, and
you've got economies that are opening up on a global basis. Remember, this is a really global business for
us. We're doing business all over the world here. And so we're seeing kind of a bunch of positive forces
come together, all in one place, on a business that has this potential over time. It does tend to hit some
cycles and some valleys. And right now, it's hitting many positive cycles.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.

Walter Scott Liptak
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on the good quarter. I wanted to see if we can get some insight on the M&A pipeline with
the Airtech deal. Was this a deal that you've been working on for a while? Clearly, there's a nice fit with
Gast and maybe a sector to go after, but was this a broker deal? Was this something that was kind of went
through a process or have you been working with Airtech for a while to try and get something going?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean like a lot of the companies that are out here, we've known about Airtech for a long time. And
honestly, I kind of watch them as they've grown very, very well over the last half decade or so. So they're
under private ownership. A lot of things came together. And I will tell you, it moved pretty quickly in this
particular case. This is, as you might imagine, one of the easier businesses for us to get our heads around.
And then as we did that and saw the quality of it, It moved quite a bit faster than some other transactions
just because of a lot of those things lining up well for us.

Walter Scott Liptak
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. Okay, great. And then in the past, you guys have talked about the valuation multiples of M&A deals.
I wonder, how do you feel about the multiple that you'll be paying for this one? And you mentioned 80/20
is like a value add that you can bring to the business. Is it too early to start talking about where you think
-- what you think you can do with it?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Well, look, it's a very strong business. Valuations are high now. We're pleased with the transaction, that's
why we did it. I'd think from an 80/20 perspective, it's interesting. This many ways, I think it's going to
-- this is representative of the sweet spot of what 80/20 can do. You've got a business here that's a lot
like ours in terms of, it's filled with these incredible problem solvers, full of passion. What 80/20 helps
you do is just understand what are the things you're going to go after, why is that and how can you get
disproportionately more of your resources over on the things they do the best.

I mean it's a very simple framework and a thinking process that becomes intuitive over time, and we're
excited to introduce it and work with the Airtech team on how it might help them improve an otherwise
already good business. You can use it for other things in different businesses that are in different states,
but this one is very much around continuing to help a really strong business grow even better in the future
and think about -- and use it as a lens to think about the combinations and synergistic elements between
the 2 companies together.

Relative to the multiple, obviously, we focus on the returns, and this is a high-quality business that we
think is going to be -- drive returns well in excess of our cost of capital here as we proceed over the next
couple of years. So although it's a little bit on the higher side on the print number. Long term, this is a
phenomenal transaction for us.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Nice quarter for you guys. I apologize I was sort of jumped on and off the call here. I have need -- If I ask
a question that's been asked, I apologize in advance. Did you mention Airtech sales specifically?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, we did. In the opening comments, around $85 million.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

$85 million. Additionally, Eric, I noticed that you put in your market sum up, life sciences is sort of
recovering. And I know a couple of companies that are out there, be it Alumina, Danaher, which are
proxies, Alumina, I think a customer, but really had blowout first quarter results in some of their markets.
And I know it's not perfectly like-for-like, particularly with Danaher, but I was just curious as to why you
have that in recovering as opposed to not recovered.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Well, a couple of things. Like a lot of things with IDEX, it comes down to where we play and the products
that we have there. So a lot of companies have a lot more consumable exposure than we do. And so that
would be -- very clearly, that's the piece that recovers first and a lot of the elements that are embedded
in life sciences. Let's just take the kind of classic IVD space. As things open up and people go back in for
testing, you get a lot of action on the consumable stream, but it takes a while before you're going to do a
large-scale box replacement, and that's what we supply.

So we've got a mixed bag here. We've got some places like that where we're going to have to wait, and
we certainly have some exciting stuff, especially on the microfluidics side and some of the stuff around
AI as it involves itself in vaccine development and therapeutics because that's in a different place. But
when you put it all together, we sort of use this category to say recovering, but not quite there yet, and
we understand the elements that we're going to have to find their way in there for us to move it into the
next space.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Right, right. I guess by just a little bit different space and things then move around within the space,
would you be surprised if on the next quarter call that if you didn't have life sciences up a notch into the
recovered zone?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

I'd say we considered the arrow to be moving in that direction. A lot of it would come down to the IVD
placement of machines, some of the CapEx that's in that part -- whether that's a quarter from now or
later, I don't know, but it's hard to imagine that it wouldn't improve. I mean all the dynamics would
suggest that we would follow much of what you cited there in those other companies.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Got you. Okay. Yes. So another question again on that same page, Fire & Rescue. And this morning, one
of your customers reported a pretty robust fire number, which surprised me, it might have even surprised
you. I know that sort of muni spending and related was a bit of an area that you were watching coming
into the quarter. It sounds like you kind of still are. Could you update us a little bit on that market? Is
there potentially maybe a refresh that's needed there as well given the number that, that customer
reported this morning? Or is that maybe just sort of like -- it was sort of like the final good quarter and
maybe you think it slows down from here, just on fire?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Well, I mean, I certainly couldn't talk too much about what they said or what they may be seeing, but
I will say, it's an interesting space because you have a lot of things going on here. You've got, obviously,
the municipal spend profile side. And a lot of that, we're going to have to wait and see where that goes.
There are so many elements that are moving around concurrently. There's federal efforts to backstop
things. And that side of it, there's some regulatory pieces, so we'll see.

And then you've got this dynamic certainly in this market where we've seen even ahead of some of the
more recent supply chain stuff that we're talking about globally, a very unique to that industry challenge
around trucks and chassis and things. That sort of capped off some of the potential on the sales side
for end customers. So as that works itself out, that's going to be ultimately good for us. We'll see how
successful people are with that. And then we'll have to see where the market itself, the municipal market,
rides along underneath it. And then you always have to throw in for us. I hate to do -- add more and more
variable, but this is a really massively global business, and so they don't all move in step. Things going on
in China and India and emerging markets are not necessarily the same as what we would see here in the
Midwest.

So there's a lot of things working together. I think it's safe to put it in the recovery. It has improved,
not quite back where we would expect it to be and think it will be ultimately. And then we will, like you,
wonder a lot of these things coming together here to paint a clear picture as we go.

Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.

Matthew Steven Mooney
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

This is Matt on for Nathan Jones this morning. I wanted to ask about orders. Orders were up 6%
organically and 10% in total. Can you talk about kind of the cadence of orders through the quarter? What
segments and end markets drove the improvement in order rates and then how daily order rates trended
so far in April?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean, honestly, you can kind of take the entire company and say, in generally, it improved as we
moved through that first quarter. I will remind us again, each month had its own chapter of externality,
but I guess all of them were somewhat equal. So broad improvement, kind of marching through the
quarter and as we're looking at April, I mean I don't see anything that would change the story here. Bill,
anything you'd add?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

No. I guess from what drove the orders, obviously, all of the businesses within HST did extremely well.
Within FMT, obviously, we talked about, that's probably the group that's still lagging a bit across the

portfolio outside of Banjo that had a phenomenal quarter and continues to outperform relative to the
dynamics in that market. And then within FSD, BAND-IT and dispensing, dispensing specifically did
extremely well with Fire & Rescue, improving relative to some of the things that Eric highlighted based on
Scott's question, still a little bit slower than the balance of the portfolio.

Matthew Steven Mooney
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask a follow-up with muni. What are your assumptions on muni budgets and
spending? And then what are the thoughts on the infrastructure spending bill and potential impact to the
muni market?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So look, I think we've got muni spending and generally in kind of a steady as she goes category until
we know more and see it. The infrastructure stuff is interesting as you suspect, probably like everybody
else, you kind of go and peel it back headline by headline, then you've got to really work on a variable
of timing like when do we think that, that would find its way here. And as always, a lot of it is pretty
unclear. So just that turn in itself, if it means roads and bridges, it means one thing for IDEX, if it means
underneath in sewers and lead pipes and things like that, that's different. And it's hard for me to see how
clear it is until it starts to become more actionable, which then I think supports -- I think it's going to take
a while to run out.

But I would say, in general, the fact that it exists is a positive element that should help of many IDEX
markets. So we view it that way. We'll continue to paying it as we get some insight into things and start to
see driving trends within the business, we'll surely call it out.

Operator

There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing
remarks.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Thanks so much. Hey, for those external to IDEX, I always want to thank you for your support
and interest in the company. We know there's a lot of IDEX employees on a call like this as well. And
so frankly, I want to thank you again for your hard work. It's paying off. Clearly, as we've talked about
here, there's more hard work to come, but we've got a resilient business. I think our positioning in these
attractive niches continues to serve us well, and we've got a team of people that are second to none here.

So I think you can hear, we're pretty optimistic about the path forward. We know there will be challenges,
things that are unexpected that will come up along the way. But we're excited. We're excited about the
momentum that we're seeing, where it will take us. We're very excited about the story here with bringing
Airtech into the IDEX family alongside ABEL Pumps. And we're working hard to continue that momentum
as well on top of it as we go forward. And we'll look forward to talking to you all along the way as we
make progress. Thanks so much.
