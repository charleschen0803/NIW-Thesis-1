FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the FICO quarterly earnings call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this
conference is being recorded Wednesday, July 29, 2020. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to
Steve Weber. Please go ahead.

Steven P. Weber
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's Third Quarter Earnings call. I'm Steve
Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO,
Michael McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the
prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order
to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation
may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those
statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions
and the company's business operations at personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular,
in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the
SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations. This call will also include statements regarding
certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation
G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and the Regulation G schedule are available on the
Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay
of this webcast will be available through July 29, 2021.

And now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I hope you
and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this pandemic. We continue to work
primarily from home. Most of our offices are remaining closed. I'm pleased to say that this model has
worked very well for us. Our productivity metrics remain very strong, and we're able to innovate, meet
development deadlines, serve our customers and implement our solutions. We posted some slides with
our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll be referencing some of those slides during
our presentation today. I'll go over the results of our third fiscal quarter, and discuss what we're seeing
in the markets that we serve. I am pleased to report that we had another very strong quarter, which
demonstrates the remarkable resiliency of our business.

As shown on Slide 2, we've reported revenues of $314 million, flat with the same period last year, which
was our highest revenue quarter ever. We delivered $64 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of
$2.15 per share. We delivered $77 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.58. We also
delivered $99 million of free cash flow in the quarter, the highest single quarter in company history.

As you can see on Slide 3, we continue to have ample liquidity. We actually reduced our total debt
by about $20 million from the end of our second quarter. We generated $106 million in new bookings
and have a very strong pipeline of deals as we move into the fourth quarter. Our software revenue
was down 8% this quarter, due to the difficult comparison to last year when we had large application
renewal revenue. This quarter, the Applications segment was down 15%, primarily due to lower upfront
license revenues. Decision Management Software was up 22%, primarily due to increases in recurring
transactional revenues. In the Scores business, we had another record quarter despite the volatility in
the credit markets. Total revenues were up 14% versus the prior year and totaled $132 million. B2C
revenues were up 21% this quarter, with strong growth in both myFICO and indirect partner channels. On

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

the B2B side, revenues were up 12% over the same period as last year. This is especially encouraging, as
this is an area that can be highly volatile in uncertain economic times. We saw strength in the mortgage
markets throughout the quarter, with volumes up due to low interest rates. In auto, volumes were down
significantly at the start of the quarter and improved over the balance of the quarter. For cards and other
unsecured lending, marketing and originations volumes were down throughout the quarter, as financial
institutions slowed new card acquisition efforts.

Obviously, there's still a great deal of volatility in these markets with record unemployment and furloughs.
We also continue to innovate in scores. Last month, we introduced the FICO Resilience Index. An analytic
tool that complements the FICO Score and helps lenders, borrowers and investors to identify the financial
resiliency of consumers across FICO Score bands to make more informed and precise decisions in
assessing risk during rapidly changing economic cycles. In general, in a down economy, access to
credit goes down as lenders try to mitigate the credit risk. The FICO Resilience Index can be helpful in
navigating through changing economic cycles. The desired outcome is a system that is even more precise
in assessing and pricing risk and less prone to broad credit restrictions and risk pricing, which can tighten
the flow of credit during an economic downturn. As we navigate through the current economic climate, I'm
extremely pleased with the performance of our business. Last quarter, we retracted our full year guidance
due to widespread economic uncertainty. We now have additional data points, but markets have yet to
stabilize. So while we won't give formal guidance, we are offering additional visibility into how various
metrics are trending as we finish our fiscal year.

If you look at Slide 4, an updated version of what we showed last quarter, you'll see how we performed in
Q3 and where we stand year-to-date versus our original guidance. We're trending well in Scores with both
B2B and B2C, ahead of our original guidance. On the software side, we're slightly behind in transactional
and maintenance volumes, as reduced economic activity has slowed volumes. We also have risk in license
sales and services revenue. Our fourth quarter tends to be the highest sales quarter for us, and we have
a strong pipeline of deals. We see clients accelerating their digital transformation plans where we play
a central role. But again, with the uncertain economic environment, it's difficult to commit to specific
revenue numbers. On the expense side, we're spending well below what was embedded in our guidance.
As a result, we will likely have some savings versus what we expected at the beginning of the year. While
there are still many moving pieces, we now believe it's likely that we'll be able to hit our previously guided
pretax income and net income numbers. In many ways, this is the most difficult health and economic
environment we've ever faced. At the same time, we have a very resilient business model, and we're
actively managing the business to work through the near-term difficulties with an eye toward our long-
term strategy.

I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial
details.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $314 million, flat with the prior
year and up 2% from the prior quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $920 million, up 8% from the prior
year. Our Applications segment revenues were $141 million, down 15% versus the same period last year.
This decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower license revenue. As you may recall, we had a very
large license component in Q3 last year due to renewals, which under ASC 606 accounting standards
require upfront revenue recognition, even though we build a customer as an annual subscription. Software
applications billings for the quarter were $61 million, flat versus last year and up 27% from our second
quarter, where we had significant COVID-related disruptions and sales efforts at the end of March.

In our Decision Management Software segment, Q3 revenues were $41 million, up 22% over the
same period last year. The increase was primarily due to SaaS-subscription revenues in our Decision
Management platform. DMS bookings were $29 million in Q3, down 22% from the previous year, but
up 25% from last quarter. Finally, our Scores segment revenues were $132 million, up 14% from the
same period last year. B2B was up 12% over the same period, and B2C revenues were up 21% from Q3
2019. In our third fiscal quarter, 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

region generated 14% and the remaining 7% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from
transactional and maintenance sources represented 79% of total revenues in the quarter. Consulting and
implementation revenue were 14% of total revenues and license revenues were 7%. Revenues derived
from our cloud-delivered software-as-a-service, or Saas, were $77 million for the quarter, an increase of
11% over the prior year. That included $61 million of transactional software revenue and $16 million in
professional services.

Bookings for the quarter totaled $106 million, down 3% from last year, but up 26% from last quarter.
These bookings generated $16 million of current period revenues, a 15% yield. SaaS bookings were $40
million for the quarter, down 12% from the previous year, but up 31% from last quarter. Our operating
expenses totaled $231 million this quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter. This is due primarily to
decreases in travel, marketing and other discretionary expenses. We expect Q4 expenses to be moderately
higher. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 34% for the quarter. GAAP
net income this quarter was $64 million, flat with the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $77 million
for the quarter, which was up 1% from the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was
about 16%, which included $5 million of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation
activities. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 9% to 11% for the fiscal year. As a reminder, our
recurring tax rate before these excess tax benefits is approximately 25% to 26% globally. Free cash flow
for the quarter was $99 million compared to $61 million in the same period last year, an increase of 63%.
Free cash flow this quarter benefited from a large reduction in working capital year-over-year, primarily
related to unusually high accounts receivables at the end of Q3 in 2019. Free cash flow for the trailing 4
quarters was $297 million.

Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $126 million in cash, which is up $19
million from last quarter due to cash generated from ops, partially offset by share repurchases. Our total
debt face value is $938 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%. At the end of the quarter,
we had drawn $103 million on our $400 million revolving line of credit. We further drew on that facility to
pay for the $85 million maturity of senior notes in July. Our leverage ratio, as calculated for our revolving
line of credit was 2.16 and our covenant, as you may recall, is 3.25 on the revolver. We bought back
157,000 shares in the third quarter for $54 million at an average price of $343 per share. And today, we
announced the new Board authorization for $250 million of share repurchase. Finally, as Will said, because
of the current uncertain economic environment, we are not providing formal financial guidance for the
remainder of fiscal '20.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for some final comments.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

As we work to finish our fiscal year and build plans for fiscal '21, I'm confident that FICO is well positioned
for the future. We're built to withstand economic downturns and are taking steps to manage through
current uncertainties without sacrificing our commitment to our strategic initiatives. As I've said before,
we are stewards of remarkable assets, and we have a great team dedicated to helping our customers
solve their most difficult problems. And the value of the analytics solutions we provide, both in Software
and in Scores is more important now than ever.

I'll turn the call back over to Steve to manage the Q&A.

Steven P. Weber
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer
Thanks, Will. We will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line.

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first question is just on the B2B Scores business. I think the 10% grow felt a little bit light to us. I
was just hoping you could walk us through what that mix between price and volume was there maybe
versus the last quarter even? I feel like you guys have been missing the pricing element or the mix of your
different lending categories in there.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Manav, I don't know that we've ever broken out the mix between the volume and the price. The
volume was a little bit lighter as you'd expect over a quarter like this one, so some of that was price.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

And Manav, I guess just to maybe give you a little more directional view on that. Look, we happened to
report earnings after Equifax and TransUnion, also after Visa, and you can see some of the trends that
would underlie our results in the B2B Scores business, particularly on the origination side from what
they're showing. Obviously, mortgage volumes were very, very strong. Auto volumes seem to be picking
up, but for the quarter, were down. And on the personal loan and credit card side of things, we're seeing
the same things that the bureaus saw in the period. Now that bureau data also seems to suggest that the
trend is improving, but -- that's certainly no assurance that that's going to maintain itself. And of course,
when you look at the pricing across the 3 segments, I think you understand well the strategic pricing
actions we took in the -- what is our other category, credit cards, personal loans and so forth. And that
category suffered the worst in terms of volumes, but the pricing actions helped mitigate that.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just in the B2C side, I mean, that's a pretty impressive number. Is
there any onetime deal activity in there, like you signed some new clients and so forth?

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

No. That's a pretty clean number. We are genuinely seeing consumer interest in their credit score and how
they can track it and improve it in this environment, and it's showing both directly in myFICO.com and in
our partner B2C sales.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe just one last question. Will, in your conversations with clients on the software and
even on the Scores side, are you starting to hear any kind of major budget issues where maybe you could
see more delays on the software side and maybe more pressure on the pricing side?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

No. We really haven't had that. I think things are moving a little bit more slowly than they have
historically. I think there is this kind of additional care being taken with everything that our customers

do. That said, they are full steam ahead on digital transformation, on upgrading their solutions, and we're
front and center there. So we really haven't experienced slowness there.

Operator

We have a question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.

William Arthur Warmington
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So Equifax and TransUnion both indicated improving results in June and July and I know you guys are
typically lagging those results by maybe 45 days, and so I wanted to see whether those improvements
that they're describing are showing up in your results? Do you see -- did you see them in the June results?
Are you seeing them in July?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

So you're absolutely right that our stuff lags them by roughly 6 weeks. We get some real indication. And
on basis of that, I'm pretty comfortable saying that our stuff will track theirs. But it's -- again, it's not
final. These numbers aren't final.

William Arthur Warmington
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. The -- also on the B2C, to follow-up on Manav's comments that looked like a very strong quarter.
TransUnion noted though, since they're a big supplier in the indirect space, that they were a little
concerned about the second half of the year just because they were concerned that the aggregators are
not seeing a lot of demand from the banks, meaning the banks are not very aggressive these days at
trying to add new accounts. And so I just wanted to touch base on whether you felt comfortable with
those volume -- with that level of growth continuing because you can see the inside much better than we
can. So...

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Well, look, we're pleased with the growth that we had, and it's always hard to forecast the future in an
environment like this. The one thing that's clear, though, is consumers are more focused, more interested
in what's going on with their credit score than they've ever been before. And we're seeing it at myFICO
and we're seeing in our partner consumer stuff. And so I would hope that, that trend would continue. But
again, we don't know.

William Arthur Warmington
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. How has been the demand for UltraFICO and the Experian Boost? How has that been?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

So Experian Boost is doing very well. And as you know, that's -- I mean, it's boosting the FICO score. And
so there's a benefit to FICO every time boost happens. UltraFico is lagging that, and largely because of the
success that we're having with boost.

William Arthur Warmington
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And I wanted to ask on the software side, you guys have been making some outsized investments
in software now for some time. And I wanted to check in just to see whether you felt like the time was
approaching when the rate of investment in software was going to start to slow?

William J. Lansing

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

President, CEO & Director

I can't make that promise, Bill. What I would tell you is that -- what we're seeing is tremendous appetite
for our new solutions and for our new Decision Management Platform, and deal size is getting bigger and
we now have banks that are adopting our solution, our Decision Management Platform solution, and then
building all kinds of use cases on top of it. So we feel like we're being vindicated in the strategic direction.
At the same time, we -- it does require investment. We continue to pour investment in. When will margins
improve? There'll be some margin improvement over time as we scale up our SaaS business and have
more multi-tenant and returns to scale. So there'll be some benefits there. And I think professional
services -- as our products become simpler to install and a little bit easier, the proportion of professional
services will go down, which will also be a margin improvement. So those are the factors, but I can't give
you a time line. What I would tell you is that we will continue to invest at this rate as long as it feels like
those are smart decisions, like those are intelligent decisions given the appetite of the market for our staff.

William Arthur Warmington
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

You mentioned the banks adopting some of the DMS Solutions and then building their own solutions on
top of that. I know from time to time, you've talked about how you've developed your own -- some of
the new generations of your products are actually being built on the DMS Platform and you use a lot
of tools internally to do that. There was some talk about sometime over the maybe the next 18 to 24
months, taking those tools and turning them outward, meaning that you'd have this whole ecosystem
similar to salesforce.com or Workday and having developers being able to develop customized tools on
that platform. Does that -- is that time line still? Is...

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that -- we are very focused on that. And this year, 2021, this coming year will be the year when
our APIs are available on an outward basis and borrowers and resellers and others will be able to build
solutions on top of our platform. So that's very much part of our strategy. It's the way that we intend to
reach other verticals besides financial services. It's a way for us to go down market, and basically solve
the problem that we've always had, which is very limited distribution for extraordinary IP.

Operator

We have a question from Jeff Meuler with Baird.

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Sorry, if this is introductory, but I wasn't aware of kind of Bill's line of questioning about the 45-day lag.
So I just want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. So are you saying that you have not yet been
paid for the credit pulls at the bureaus in June because it's not only that it's reported to you like in arrears
at the end of the month, but you're actually paid kind of on a lagged basis and you recognize revenue on a
lagged basis?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Mike, do you want to answer that?

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

I can take that. Yes. No, we don't recognize revenue on a lag basis. We don't get the final report for
June until some period, days, not weeks, after the end of the quarter. But we take an accrual base for
an estimated revenue that in conversations with those customers, we determine is appropriate for the
quarter. And historically, it's very close, and for revenue recognition purposes it means that we're able to
match revenue in the quarter with revenue recognized. Cash flow-wise and billing-wise, we have -- we're

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

not going to go into our payment terms with individual customers on a call like this. But our payment
terms with the bureaus are normal course and speed for a relationship like we have with them. But we do
get those reports, so we -- in arrears, as mentioned before. So we don't know. We genuinely don't know
what is happening in July at our Bureau partners. We'll know in a couple of weeks. Does that help?

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's helpful. Yes, it does. And then just the expenses in the Scores business, what's driving that? And
I guess, was curious if you're leaning in more on marketing spend for myFICO or if there's some mix
shift going on, where you have some more expenses to the bureaus for like tri-merge premium, myFICO
products or something?

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

So much of it is that we're investing in the FICO Resilience Index, as Will mentioned briefly in his remarks
and maybe he wants to talk more about that. We haven't dramatically increased marketing for the other
parts of our business, but development work, the outreach work and the implementation work around
the Resilience Index as well as other innovation steps that we're taking in the Scores business is primarily
what's driving the increase you see there.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

And then one small factor is that with myFICO as the volumes go up, our expense goes up because we
have a cost of goods sold in myFICO.

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Right. Right. Got it. So I know that net revenue retention isn't a common metric that you give. But just
curious if you can help us understand or size up the land and expand on the DMS platform solution? Like
are there enough historical examples or time series where you can help us kind of understand? How big
does the customer tend to come on as a new engagement for a DMS Platform? And then I don't know, 2
or 3 years down the road, just how much more additional product or revenue are you generating off of
them?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

So what we're -- I mean, I would say it's early days. And so it's -- we don't have a lot of data points
around which to build a conclusion. That said, it looks really good. So what you have is a situation where
the very biggest banks, our biggest customers, absolute top-tier banks, they have super complicated
systems, and they still buy some point solutions, and we have not yet had a top 10 bank stay to us, yes,
we're adopting the FICO Decision Management Platform for all of our consumer-facing decisioning. That
hasn't happened yet. However, it is happening with a tier down. And so I would say, 2 years ago, we
had some small banks that were doing it and said, yes, we're going to standardize myFICO decisioning
platform and then we're going to build all kinds of different credit decisions around that. And now we're
moving upmarket. And so we have some pretty good-sized banks that have made the decision to adopt
it. And sometimes, it's -- they'll start with a point solution they were in the market for and recognize the
expansion opportunity. And sometimes they do it very deliberately with a view to putting a whole lot of
different use cases on top of the platform once it's been adopted. So the dog is eating the food, we're
pretty happy about the way it's going.

Operator

Our next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham.

Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I just wanted to start on the Decision Management piece of the business. It seems like you've had some
nice growth there for several of the last few quarters. Is the SaaS momentum kind of rolling strong
enough where we can expect this growth to be able to continue? Or were there any like large chunky deals
in there that we need to be mindful of? I just want to make sure we're thinking about that piece of the
business.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I think that it is fair to think that the growth will continue. I mean this is -- it's -- obviously, the number
is a little bit volatile because it's a smaller part of our business still. And so on a percentage basis, it
can move quickly because we're dealing with smaller numbers. That said, there is -- we have ever more
solutions on top of the platform, it's very much our future, it's the way our salespeople are selling it, it's
the way the banks are buying it and it is a very different world than it was 3 or 4 years ago. So while we
still have -- we still have sales of legacy product and our legacy solutions will be around for a long time to
come because they're best-in-class at what they do. The Decision Management Platform is really picking
up steam.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

And let me just add a little technical nuance for that. It's a good question because under the ASC 606
accounting rules, it can create some distortions in revenue when you sell an on-prem subscription product
for 3, 5 years. That on-prem portion, in most cases, needs to be recognized all at once upfront, despite
the fact that it's a subscription. But if it's a SaaS sale, it is recognized ratably as we bill and deliver it. So it
can be lumpy for that reason alone and not reflecting the underlying health of the business. Look, if there
are big whoppers like that, that we've had to pull forward in any particular quarter, we'll do our best to
call those out. This quarter, it was a normal mix between the types of revenue recognition and sort of the
growth is pretty normal.

Kyle David Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. That's really good color. And then just a follow-up on the margins. Nice to see the upside there
this quarter. And I mean, can appreciate the color you guys have provided in the slide deck on some of
the travel, entertainment and those types of expenses, which are obviously a bit lower right now. I just
want to see, have you guys -- when -- as we've gone through this kind of COVID process, have you guys
found any other expenses that you might be able to rationalize, that might lead to some longer-term cost
savings for whenever the world gets it.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a good question. We wrestle with it ourselves. I am -- we're of a view that some of these savings
are here to stay. We don't imagine that we will ever go back to the level of travel we had before. I think
that all of us, not just FICO, but our customers and our -- everyone involved is now way more adept
at using Zoom and doing more video. And what we're finding is we can have comparable, if not more,
contact with our customers with less travel. And so -- and it's, obviously, more efficient and a much lower
cost. So I would imagine some of it's going to survive in a post-COVID world. That said, it is unnaturally
low right now. So you can expect it to go up from the level it's at now, you can expect it to be lower than
it was a year ago on an ongoing basis.

We have a question from Brett Huff with Stevens Inc.

I had a quick question on the helpful chart that you guys put, I think it was Slide 3 or 4 where you had
some red boxes and green boxes. Just want to make sure I understand the red boxes and that there's
some risk to those numbers. But it seems that the Scores boxes -- the Scores number is 63 and 18, those
seems like hittable targets and wondering, are those not green boxed because they're a little harder to
predict? Or kind of what should we imply, given that it seems those might fall in the green box category?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I'd say it's a little hard to predict. It's -- call it, conservatism on our part. It's a little harder to predict.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then a quick update on the progress that you guys are making, which I know
varies a little bit by product on the SaaS-ification of the products. I know you've got some already SaaS-
ified, originations manager and et cetera. I know the Falcon and the update to TRIAD is coming out and/
or near live. Can you just remind us of where we are in each of those products kind of coming out with the
full GA SaaS product?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

We're more than halfway through the process. If you look at our -- our top franchises. So as you
mentioned, originations manager is now on the platform. The new version of TRIAD, which we call
Strategy Director is now on the platform. Blaze, our rules engine, is now on the platform called Decision
Modeler. So we're making progress there. There's -- I'd say, the 2 biggest ones that aren't there yet are
Falcon and Debt Manager. And those will be -- those will take longer. I mean Falcon we're working on it,
we have another release coming very soon, but it's a -- that's a massive undertaking.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And then last question from me is the license revenue from Falcon was down quite a bit. I know some of
that was from -- I think it was down 66%. I think some of that was from the difficult comp, is there any
color you can give us that might be -- help us kind of see the COVID impact rather than the tough comp
impact? I'm not sure if you told us kind of what the numbers were on a year-over-year basis, if I go back
to that script.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

We don't break out the volume part of it, but the volumes are down somewhat, a bit, but that's part of it.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And the vast majority of it was the renewal comp. We just had a couple of whoppers in the third
quarter of last year that all had to be recognized upfront, and those only happen once in a while, and
certainly not this quarter.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We have a question Surinder Thind from Jefferies.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Actually, I had a question about the Scores business. And just kind of following up on an earlier question
about the volumes. Generally, I mean, industry volumes that are kind of widely reported, whether it's
mortgage, auto or credit, they've generally been fairly good predictors of the Scores revenues. But based

on kind of what I would call incredible results that you guys -- really good results that you guys posted
this quarter, from my perspective, there seems to be a bit of a disconnect in some of the segments. And
so when I look at like the mortgage volumes for industry that was fairly consistent with what the bureau
has reported, but then they've reported auto and credit data that was much stronger than what the
industry data would suggest. And do you have any color in terms of other types of activity that could have
made up for that delta? Or any color there might be helpful. I mean, as an example, if I was to look at
some of the bank data, their marketing activities, their credit card originations...

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would say that, that -- in general, I don't really have an answer for you. A narrow thing would be
the fact that we do less lead gen than some of the bureaus. So you'll see less there.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then another follow-up question. In terms of just the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force put out
some recommendations a couple of weeks ago related to credit scoring. And one of the recommendations
was that the credit scores being more inclusive of using alternative data, which would suggest support for
your newer scores, so FICO 9, FICO 10 and is there any potential revenue benefits from you guys that you
guys would experience if clients were to upgrade to, let's say, the newest versions of the Scores? Or are
you somewhat agnostic as long as the clients continue to use FICO Scores?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I'd say it's more of the latter. We're agnostic. I mean we encourage people to move up to the latest and
greatest scores. Not because we charge more for them, but because we think they'll get better results.
And so no, I wouldn't say that there's -- don't expect a revenue uptick as they migrate to newer scores.
No.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then one other question in terms of -- are you able to provide any color in terms of the
percentage of revenues that maybe that is scores that's maybe less volume-driven? That might be more
relationship driven, such as like monitoring type of revenues or any color around ballpark figures that you
might be able to provide?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I'm not sure I follow the question. I mean, all of our scores revenue is driven at some level by volume and
a little bit by price.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I guess what I was trying to get at was if we were to use just credit cards as an example, obviously,
there's originations volumes, there's the marketing volume, but then there's the monitoring piece. And so
I'm assuming monitoring would be more based on like the headcount that certain bank would have. And
so that would be less subject to, I guess, the COVID environment in the sense that they would want to
continue to monitor all of their accounts.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We see continued interest from our bank customers and monitoring closely. I mean, if anything,
they're more vigilant and more focused than ever.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

But maybe to [ hit ] you more correctly, those account management volumes, which is what we call them,
are also based on the number of scores pulled. So there's no real difference in the volume driver there for
account management versus originations.

Operator

And there are no further questions at this time.
