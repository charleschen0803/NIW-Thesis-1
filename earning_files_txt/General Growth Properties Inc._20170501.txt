Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone
Earlier today, we released our first quarter earnings
I'd like to highlight a few items
Company FFO per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.36, consistent with our guidance and consensus
Our core business in the first quarter yielded same-store NOI growth of 2.9% and EBITDA growth of 3.7%
Our guidance for 2017 is $1.56 to $1.60 per share or a midpoint of $1.58, consistent with consensus
Our board declared a dividend of $0.22 for the quarter, representing a 16% increase from the same quarter last year
Operating metrics remained strong given the portfolio's high quality
The portfolio was 95.9% leased at quarter-end compared to 96.1% a year ago, the decrease primarily due to tenant bankruptcies during the quarter
The related store closures affected 1.2 million square feet within our portfolio
To-date, we have re-leased nearly 80% of the space
Looking back over the past couple of years for perspective, in early 2015, there were also a number of tenant bankruptcies, and the portfolio was 95.8% leased compared to 96.2% leased in the first quarter of 2014. By the end of 2015, the portfolio recovered to 96.9% leased
We anticipate a similar recovery this year given our leasing progress
, there's approximately 8 billion square feet of total retail square footage
1.2 billion square feet is considered high quality, of which we control 100 million square feet in our top 100 retail assets
Leased up 100 accounts for approximately 95% of the company NOI
Investors should invest with companies that own the best retail real estate in the U.S
The best real estate wins in the end
Let me expand
The same-store NOI growth for the A assets in our portfolio for the year will be 4% including the bankruptcies
Please note that 80% of our NOI is from the A assets
NOI weighting each asset for sales and lease spreads more clearly shows the high quality of the portfolio
NOI-weighted sales was $705 a foot, up 1.8%
And NOI-weighted lease spreads were up 15.5%
Total sales less anchors as reported in our supplement increased 0.9% to $21.3 billion
The apparel category, which accounts for approximately one-half of total sales and one-half of inline GLA decreased by 1.8%
Excluding apparel, sales increased 3.8%
Sales growth by category: electronics, up 4% or 5%; food, up 2.5%; home furnishing, up over 3.5%; health and personal care, up 3.3%; sporting goods, up almost 3%; miscellaneous, which includes theaters, mall entertainment, supermarkets, and other, were up 6.7%
The 3.8% sales growth in the non-apparel category tells that we are capturing more than our fair share of total sales
Our view on the retail property landscape is that high-quality centers will continue to win and thrive in this environment
We see it every day in our leasing activity
Our business shopping center offer options in almost every major market, and we are seeing a continued flight to quality as they consolidate in the best locations where productivity can be maximized
We're experiencing demand from grocery stores, cinemas, innovative entertainment venues, fitness center, and the list goes on
GGP's regional shopping center exhibit diversity of tenants and location, and access to 700,000 consumers per center compared to the other retail relative formats that offer diversity of location with concentration of tenants, reach about 300,000 consumers
Once again, GGP's regional shopping centers exhibit diversity of tenants and locations
In March, Primark opened at Staten Island Mall
Traffic increased over 10% from the prior weekend, and this increased level has been maintained
Also, Lidl, a German supermarket operator, will open soon in the recaptured Sears space
Lidl operates over 10,000 stores throughout Europe and is bringing their concept to the U.S
beginning with eight states
The expansion and redevelopment of the center is progressing according to plan
They're adding approximately 235,000 square feet and are currently 85% pre-leased
I think it's useful to share with you how we are thinking about proportioning the expansion at Staten Island Mall
Entertainment will be 54% and will include an amphitheater and Dave & Buster's
Apparel will be 17% and includes ZARA
Food and dining will be about 20% and will include Shake Shack
The remaining space will be taken by a variety of personal care, home furnishing, and other tenants such as Apple Bank, Ulta, Z Gallerie
We're opening four new lifestyle and fitness centers through our centers
They're going to Quail Springs Mall in Oklahoma City in a box that was previously occupied and owned by Macy's, The Shops at Bravern in Bellevue, Washington, Baybrook in the Houston market, and Southwest Plaza in the Denver, Colorado market
We announced that KidZania will open at Oakbrook Center, West of Chicago, and Stonebriar, north of Dallas, representing their first locations in the U.S
Please note we are creating new space at both Oakbrook and Stonebriar as both centers are currently 99% leased
We look forward to doing more with KidZania
At 685 Fifth Avenue, we enter into a lease with TAG Heuer to occupy the last remaining available space
The asset is now 100% leased
Our redevelopment activity is progressing as well
We anticipate breaking ground shortly on our ground-up development named The SoNo Collection located in Norwalk
Demand from retailers has been very strong, and as a result and in discussion with potential institutional partners, we're increasing the scale of the project
The leasing activity so far has produced rent numbers consistent with our expectations and demonstrated of a regional shopping center with sales productivity well over $700 per square foot
We are about 50% pre-leased
Institutional investors cannot get exposure to high-quality regional shopping centers and are eager to invest in a ground-up development
More parties have provided us with a letter of intent
We anticipate investing $300 million to $400 million annually by acquiring, redeveloping, and re-tenanting anchor space
Our portfolio includes 65 million square feet of anchor space; 17 million of which we own today
The redevelopment of department store boxes is a key element of our long-term earnings growth, and we view this as a compelling opportunity to generate incremental income and improve our centers
Our last vacant department store box is located at Coral Ridge Mall in Coralville, Iowa and has been leased to HomeGoods, Marshalls, PetSmart and Ulta
We have no vacant boxes left
Our capital allocation decisions reflect the value we see in the portfolio
We view our own stock to be attractive at this level, and we were active buying it during the first quarter
There is a wide discount between public and private markets
The sum of the parts is far greater than GGP's current stock price
We are reviewing all strategic alternatives to bridge the gap
On the people side, I'm very proud to announce two key promotions within the GGP team
Rosemary Feit joined GGP in late 2004 as a General Practice Attorney and is our new Executive Vice President and General Counsel
Jared Chupaila came to GGP also in 2004 as a result of the Rouse acquisition when he was Property Manager of Fashion Show in Las Vegas
Jared moved into leasing and is our new Executive Vice President of Leasing
Rosemary and Jared are trusted members of my executive team
They each represent GGP's core values, are admired by their colleagues, and natural leaders within the organization
We prioritize our five constituents: communities, retailers, employees, consumers and shareholders
We are proud of our investments in sustainability over the years, not just because it helps keep operating expenses in check but because it's the right thing to do
GGP is now amongst the top 10 companies in the U.S
for solar energy capacity
In closing, high-quality retail properties should continue to gain market share
The divide between high-quality retail real estate and the rest is getting wider
The best centers are thriving and will continue to do so
As an owner of retail real estate, we must constantly evolve to attract tenants and customers
You see it in our leasing activity and the evolution of our tenant roster
Names at the top a decade ago have changed and have been replaced with tenants today that have an emotional connection with their customer and are profitable operating from our centers
Our centers have 400 national, 600 regional and 1,700 local
These are all unique tenants
Michael will now review our financial results and guidance
So, as I mentioned in my comments, Alex, 80% of my NOI comes from the A assets that are growing at 4%
A assets trade from mid-3s to low-4s
You do the math
The break-up value is far in excess of where we trade today
We're evaluating all alternatives, and we will pick a path in the near term by looking at assets on both ends of the quality spectrum
There is no sacred cow
We could sell assets and dividend cash
We could sell asset and buy back our shares
We will get value to our shareholders
The break-up value is more than the current market capitalization
The business is strong
We will pick a path soon
Alex, I might just add, reemphasize what I said
Do we know and keep a track on retailers that have a potential of filing for bankruptcy? Yes
That is the reason why up to 1.2 million square feet, almost 1 million square feet has been leased
So what we tend to do is to look at the weaker retailers and we try to prelease that space and we put those leases on a shelf awaiting if and when a retailer files for bankruptcy
And so, the reason we're ahead on the leasing front is because we've projected that
But we never know when that's going to occur, so we never put it into guidance
We put limited into guidance, as Michael said, because that event had occurred in February
Vince, probably a small amount that's in there for some smaller guys
Some people have announced large store closings that not only impact us a little bit
We're trying not to give too much guessing here, Vince, because it can go a lot of different ways
We have a little bit of cushion in there but not a lot
So, I almost reversed it and sort of sit back and say, what are the other categories that will actually increase
I mean, food has gone from 6% to 13%
It's projected to go to 20% by 2025. Food currently is 30% in all Asian regional malls
So, you could start to see food go up
Entertainment, movie theater sales hit a record $11.4 billion last year
I mean, this is an industry that was threatened a decade ago and is now on the rise
And as we've shown you that we've done almost close to 60 movie theater deals in our properties and you're starting to see entertainment sort of rise
There's a function of what you see coming into play
By default, I think apparel will go down
How much can it go down more? My guess is another 10% or so
So, sort of stabilize at about 40%
I think we've actually said previously, we're at about 13%
We think about 15%, 16% is about the right time right now
You should be aware that Americans spent more in restaurants than in grocery stores for the first time in 2016.
There is no sacred cow
So, the A's are generally about 10% of NOI, and the B's are generally 13% to 14% of NOI
Well, we've chosen to be prudent here
We've chosen to seek out institutional investors to come in and be our partner
The institutional investor base is eager to acquire more A centers
There are no A centers in the market for sale
They've elected to be part of a ground-up development such as Norwalk
And in discussions with them, because there are so few of these, the question is, should we increase the size of the project from about 200,000 square feet to 300,000 square feet
We're evaluating that
The leasing activity, as I mentioned, if this project was 300,000 square feet is pre-leased to about 50% today
The mix so far has been a combination of entertainment, fitness, restaurants, apparel, electronics, home furnishing
I will actually venture to say, of that 50%, a larger percentage has been non-apparel
We've said it's an 8% to 10% return
The rents we are getting today would demonstrate that the retailers feel that the sales productivity of the center will be in the high-700s
So, they sort of are not anchor deals, and they're not inline deals
They take about 60,000 square feet
They do terms I think as a 20-year term
And we get, I would sort of sit back and say, a return of at least 6%, if not slightly higher
I think business is as usual
We don't start unless it's pre-leased
We've actually maintained that our Seritage venture produces still sort of 7%
The non-Seritage is between 8% and 10%
So, I think we've maintained exactly in that sort of wheelhouse
The tenant demand is there
Again, these are the better quality assets which is where most of the redevelopment is occurring and there is a demand for space as evidenced by even in a trailing 12-month leasing spread actually inched up a little bit even though I'll continue to maintain guidance of spreads at 8% to 10%
They have inched up
So, it sort of speaks to a flight to quality to good real estate
Hi, Craig
So, we have 12 Seritage JVs, four are under construction, and I said I think in my previous call, the various other ones have dates and time lines, and 9 out of the 12 so far are pre-leased
So, we hope to see starting construction on another five hopefully in the next 12 months
As it relates to the other acquisitions, as you know, both in the case Tysons and Stonestown Galleria in San Francisco, we recaptured the Macy's boxes, and they sort of have a sale leaseback for three years I believe
We are making headway in Stonestown
It's virtually 100% now leased
We hope to recapture it a year ahead of schedule, again, showing the demand for A quality assets
And in the case of Tysons, again, we have very good leasing progress
Again, I fully expect by year-end, we'll be 100% leased on the Tysons box
Hi, Michael
As I mentioned, I don't want to be repetitive that there's no sacred cow
We will look at all alternatives, okay? We've done the math and we looked at our top 80 assets, and we find that after a while, we are all in the real estate business
There is a demand for space
And we know that the math of just the value of the A asset is so much in excess of what we create today
It will be naïve for us not to look at all options available to us to create shareholder value
And I think we've said this in numerous investor meetings
As a matter of fact, at the Citi conference, we said it in almost every meeting, but I think it takes a sense of urgency when devaluation is not being appropriately met in the marketplace
So, we will evaluate one of multiple paths to go on, and we will make some decisions in the near term
It will always involve the board because any decision over $100 million requires more consent, okay? So, it will be management's recommendation, and the board will review and approve our path forward
Brookfield, like any other investor, cares about shareholder value creation, and we will evaluate what's the best way to bridge the gap between the value as we see of the company, okay, and where it trades today
I think it's a little bit of both
I think it's quality real estate and the retailer wants to maintain their position in the shopping center
They would have to pay the appropriate rent and maybe in the short term, a slight hedge up in occupancy costs, maybe
We've seen that with retailers
I mean, it was actually turned around, and Talbots is a great example
Talbots continued to pay rent while they were in a turnaround
They've done a fantastic job turning around their business
It was important for them to maintain their position of real estate and decided to take the difficult pain while they were in the turnaround process
I'm only giving you a success story
Jill, very similar
Again, I'm very proud to say that these are power retailers who have turned their business around and move forward
I would also sit back and tell you that there are power retailers eager to expand as they have seen the carnage of the tenants that went bankrupt who have been in a weak position for long periods of time such as Limited, such as Wet Seal
And so, we are actually seeing other retailers who have performed, stepping up and increasing their size and scale in the shopping centers so that they can actually take advantage of the lost apparel sales from the bankrupt retailers
So, I think it's a little bit of both
I think the better assets will continue to perform
And I think what we see is – what we don't break out is between the A assets and the B assets that the carnage is more felt in the lower-quality assets than the higher-quality assets
And as I demonstrated there's a big delta in NOI weighted in sales is 705 to non-NOI weight is 591. So, you can just sort of appreciate that that sort of apply even for apparel in the higher-quality assets versus the lower-quality assets
And we're not NOI weighting at 1.8%
So, traffic has been steadily building through the year
So, traffic is slightly up, in our shopping centers, only a handful of them have sort of calendared, if you will, so you get the year-over-year comp
But we will tell you that we see – if I would suggest to look at the amount of traffic in the first quarter, the first quarter had January at 30% of the traffic, February, 30% of traffic, March had 40% of the traffic, and April is building ahead of March
So, we're actually seeing traffic build
Again, the best function of showing you that the centers are performing well is actually sales have picked up
So, the ones that obviously liquidated like Wet Seal and Limited, it's across the board
For the ones that have not – I'll give you a little example, Payless Shoe announced bankruptcy
Thus far, we only have two closures of the 80-odd Paylesses that we have
Rue21 announced a list of 400 closures
Thus far, we only have 14, and so they tend to be in the lower-quality assets
Yes
At this moment in time, it's been and we've maintained – that's been 7%, and the large reason for that is obviously half the space is being leased back to Sears
All I'm going to say is that it doesn't – NOI weighting highlights the quality of the portfolio
Spinning assets doesn't mean that that could not be one of the options, that we were the first people to spin (43:19)
So, you could say in this cycle, we invented the spin
And so, the answer is you just lose whatever X hundreds of millions of dollars of cash flow
It really doesn't change your portfolio
The investor base needs to see a higher-quality asset without appreciating that NOI rating does the same thing
And from our perspective, like I said, the way to value the asset pool is to figure out how we demonstrate that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole because at the end of the day, we're in the retail real estate business
And the disconnect that exists between the private and the public market is extensive
I actually gave you that on the A asset, the market price is in the mid-three to the low-fours
You take 80% of my NOI and do the math, you'll see that we're in the real estate business
And at some stage, the market will appreciate the value of the real estate, and it may be that we need to demonstrate how we show them that
And again, it's our job to create shareholder value and we are focused on it
Well, we've already identified for 2018 and 2019, right? So, right now, we've identified we control the real estate
We are in the redevelopment process
So, to get that sort of $30-ish million in 2018 and the same $30-ish million in 2019 of incremental NOI is already in development, right? So, to effectuate that in 2018, you have to be well under construction today
So, over the last six years, we believe in good corporate governance and in a rotation of our Board of Directors
As you may remember or may not, in 2010, 2011, we had John Schreiber, Cyrus Madon, Sheli Rosenberg as part of the board, and they will pivot out in the last couple of years
So, we actually feel that it's good corporate governance to rotate our directors
And we are actually very happy to have Janice Fukakusa who was the CFO of RBC and (46:39) who was Head of Real Estate of (46:42) to be new board members after our annual shift
Michael, I think it's up to us to sort of think a path
Just for the sake of discussion, if you sold an asset and you dividended up the cash to your investor base and they believe they're going to invest their money, all it does is it takes it off the top
If you buy back a stock, it's a whole different animal
So, I could take a very extreme situation and say, let me sell 80 malls and dividend out $25 in dividends or some math better than that
And then I have 50 assets using $0.5 billion of cash flow with a zero stock price or, say, $0.25 stock price
I don't know the answer
All I'm trying to demonstrate is that if the market doesn't value the real estate, it's our job to make sure that the investors get their appreciation either in the form of dividend or some form of demonstration that we are in the real estate business and relatively to be valued appropriately
So, I don't really have an answer
All I do realize is the disconnected part is so wide
It is up to us to demonstrate to the market that there's a real estate value at stake here
It's just the management and the board
Michael, we have just started the process of evaluating the path that we want to take
The disconnect has widened as you can all appreciate in the last 30 days
So, when we went out to put the project of Norwalk to find institutional investors, each one of the four institutional investors that presented a proposal to us for Norwalk inquired what's the asset sales or JV partnership in the built stabilized assets
And they did tell us in discussions how they view the market pricing to be
As a matter of fact, if you speak to most of the institutional investors and ask them which is the best performing asset class within that portfolio, it usually is super regional malls that have produced over the last 20 years the best return
And we continue to see that today
If I actually just look at the A's and the higher-quality A's, it's actually as the quality increases, that growth rate goes from 4% to 5% even in this environment
Thanks, Michael
Thank you for joining the call
Please contact Michael or Kevin with any questions you might have
We look forward to seeing many of you over the next couple of months
And I'll see you at ICSC and NAREIT
Have a great day
