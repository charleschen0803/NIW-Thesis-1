Presentation

Operator

Greetings. Welcome to the Federal Realty Investment Trust Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Leah Brady. Thank you. You may begin.

Leah Andress Brady
Senior Manager of Investor Relations

Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. Joining me on the call are: Don Wood, Dan G.; Jeff Berkes; Wendy Seher; Dawn Becker;
and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.

A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated
events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such
forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and
its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and
we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental
reporting package that we issued tonight, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial
disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial
condition and results of operations. [Operator Instructions]

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our second quarter results.
Don?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Well, thank you, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. To quote Seinfeld's Frank Constanza, "We're
back baby," and it seems to me we're the real estate of choice. Let me just cut to the chase here and
summarize where we are in 5 of these points. We killed it in the second quarter at $1.41. We raised our
2021 total year guidance by over 10% at the midpoint. We raised our '22 guidance, the only retail real
estate company to give '22 guidance, by the way, by 5% at the midpoint. We covered our dividend on a
cash basis in the second quarter and raised it again for the 54th consecutive year. We had record leasing
volume, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history.

So we'll put more meat on the bone for each of those points and others, but that's where this company is
as we sit here in the first week of August of 2021, and we're feeling great about our market position. At
$1.41 a share, we exceeded even our most optimistic internal forecast by $0.20 a share and we're up 83%
over last year's worst COVID-impacted quarter, of course, was the second quarter. In a nutshell, we didn't
anticipate the bounce back in nearly all facets of our business to be so fast and so strong, and we didn't
anticipate some of the onetime deals that we were working on to be executed so quickly.

We talked about the pent-up demand on the last call in the form of strong traffic and leasing demand, and
that has continued unabated ever since, no pun intended. The quarterly financial impact of that optimistic
consumer meant that we, one, collected more rent in the second quarter from prior periods than we
thought; two, we had significantly less unpaid rent in the quarter than we thought; three, we had fewer
tenant failures than we thought; and four, we have far higher percentage rent from COVID-modified deals
than we thought. And as I said, we covered our dividend on an operating cash basis in the second quarter
way ahead of our expectations.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Of course, all that means that we'll significantly raise 2021 earnings guidance and raise 2022 earnings
guidance as well. As we've said all along, visibility toward '22 earnings was ironically better than 2021.
That has proven to be the case, and Dan will talk you through guidance details in a few minutes.

And while this quarter's earnings were as strong as they were, in large part, because of the collection of
big rent dollars, both past and present, the real story here is the unprecedented amount of leasing that
was done and what it means for the value of our real estate into the future. Our properties are in demand
across the board. We did 124 comparable deals in the quarter, more than we've ever done in any quarter
in our 60-year history, for 558,000 square feet at an average rent of $37.34 per foot, 8% more rent than
the deals they replaced. We signed another 9 noncomparable deals, mostly in our new developments at an
average rent of $44.71 per foot. That's 570,000 square feet of space leased in 1 quarter alone, 25% more
than our pre-COVID quarterly average.

You might remember that we did almost as much last quarter, too. So when you put the 2 quarters
together, the production in the first half of 2021 is both staggering and unprecedented for us. Big kudos
here to our leasing, our legal, our support teams, nearly 1.1 million square feet at an average rent of $37
a foot, 8% more than the previous leases, growing through annual rent bumps over the next 8-plus years.

That's really just the tip of the iceberg here. Another really interesting consideration is the breakdown of
all that leasing between deals to renew tenants and deals with new tenants. Traditionally, 2/3 of the deals
we do in any 1 period hovers around 2/3 renewals and 1/3 new tenants. Well, not in these post-COVID 6
months. It's actually nearly flipped, roughly 40% renewals and 60% new tenants.

So what does that mean? And why is that important? Well, first, it means that we lost a heck of a lot of
tenants during COVID. And since it costs more to put a new tenant in the space rather than renew an
existing tenant, our current tenant capital is higher. On the face of it, that seems like bad news, but you
got to dig deeper. Because what it also means is that our properties are in high demand from today's
relevant and well-capitalized restaurants and retailers that are all trying to improve their sales productivity
post-COVID through better real estate locations. We've always been pickier than most in terms of the
tenants we choose to merchandise our centers. When you couple that with the execution of the broad
post-COVID property improvement plans that we've talked about over the last several quarters, that
higher capital outlay will result significantly higher asset value tomorrow.

I mean think about it in a post-COVID world. Major market's first-tier high-quality suburban shopping
centers with more than a smattering of new post-COVID relevant tenants doing business in revitalized
shopping centers and mixed-use properties focused more on outdoor seating, on curbside pickup, on
covered walkways and improve placemaking than ever before. Places that are more fresh, more dominant,
more relevant in a myriad of ways in the communities they serve for years and years to come. The value
of our real estate, net of capital, is going up, and the prospects appear to be better than they were before
COVID.

Also, consider that at quarter end, our portfolio was 92.7% leased, yet only 89.6% occupied. That 310
basis point spread, or nearly 780,000 square feet of space representing roughly $30 million in rent, is
the largest spread we've had since 2005. You might remember how 2006 and 2007 turned out, which
obviously bodes well for the future, assuming inevitable tenant fallout occurs at historical levels. And by
the way, just 3 years ago, we were 95% leased.

Okay. Onward. I hope you saw also the major acquisition announcement that we made in the press
release on June 7 that laid out the 4 deals that we closed during the quarter. Overall, we have an 80%
interest in the combined income stream, Grossmont Shopping Center in Greater San Diego, Camelback
Colonnade and Hilton Village in Greater Phoenix and Chesterbrook Shopping Center in McLean, Virginia.
Gross asset value of $407 million for 1.7 million square feet on 125 acres of land in prime locations in
these markets, and we strongly believe that pricing today would far exceed what we negotiated in the
middle of COVID.

A presentation that we put out ahead of NAREIT and our investor -- NAREIT investor meetings in June
focused on these acquisitions in depth, including the very unique potential redevelopment opportunity at
Grossmont since we control virtually the entire 63-acre parcel from a tenant perspective in less than 5

years from now. Separately, we have another deal under contract currently that we hope to close on in the
quarter -- this quarter.

On the development side, residential and office leasing activity is also picking up on both coasts. It's
really gratifying to see Pike & Rose quickly maturing, coming into its own and becoming the go-to place
for lots of things in the region. In Montgomery County, Maryland, a county that's not doing a lot of office
leasing these days, our Phase 3 office building, 909 Rose, is 77% leased with another 11% under executed
LOIs. So nearly 90% committed at the point at rents in line with pro forma. That's strong in this office
environment with mostly 2022 rent starts there.

Big quarter up at Assembly Row in that we received our certificate of occupancy for the retail portion
and half of the units in Miscela, the 500-unit residential building that's part of the Phase 3 development.
Tenants began moving in, in July, and initial leasing pace is exceeding our expectations. 145 units are
already currently leased at rates that approximate our lease-up underwriting, and that seemed to be
getting stronger with each week that passes. Assembly Row is the mixed-use project in our portfolio that
got hurt the most during COVID and took the longest to begin to bounce back, but now it feels like it's
recovering as fast as the others.

Office leasing in the PUMA-anchored building is also picking up, with serious negotiations underway for
the first time in over a year for a large portion of the remaining space. Nothing tangible yet but a good
sign, nonetheless. Similar situation in San Jose with our 375,000 square foot spec office building under
construction and nearing completion, remains unleased for the time being. And at CocoWalk in Miami, it's
all about getting tenants open as we're fully leased on the retail side and mostly leased on the office side.
Tenant openings will continue through the remainder of this year. We look forward to hosting an investor
tour in Coconut Grove early next March. More to come on that.

In Darien, Connecticut, construction and leasing are moving forward on time and on budget with the newly
built Walgreens opening during the second quarter ahead of schedule. That's important because it makes
way for the remainder of the demolition of the old shopping center and start of the residential over retail
component of the project. Good stuff happening up there, too.

Let me pause there, stop. That's about all I have for the prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Dan, and
we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone.

The unexpectedly strong results of $1.41 per share in the quarter, not only blew way 2020's year-over-
year comparison, but was a 20-plus percent sequential gain over first quarter and more than 20% above
our forecast and consensus.

Given the big beat for the quarter, let me take a little time to put some color around the broad categories
of outperformance that Don outlined. $0.13 of outperformance was driven by collection-related items.
$0.06 of upside was from improved operations, with $0.05 from one-timers that were above our forecast,
which collectively totaled the $0.24 beat versus our previous quarterly guidance.

First, some detail on the $0.13 of upside from collection. Rent collection for the quarter, net of percentage
rent, was almost 200 basis points ahead of expectations. Prior period rent collection was $7 million versus
$4 million in our forecast. Our percentage rent for the quarter was almost $3 million above forecast,
highlighting the strength in consumer traffic across the portfolio.

Second, the $0.06 of operational outperformance was driven by our occupancy essentially staying flat,
which was roughly 50 to 100 basis points better than we had expected. And improved hotel parking and
specialty leasing revenues all exceeded forecast.

The third category of $0.05 of onetime items above forecast were attributable to term fees, bankruptcy
payments, loan reserve reversals and other miscellaneous payments all collectively exceeded our

expectations. Please note that we do not expect the $1.41 to be the run rate for the balance of the year.
Even $0.09 of the results are not expected to be recurring. And as Don mentioned, we are in the midst
of delivering 500 units of residential at Assembly Row, which will be dilutive over the next few quarters,
amongst other items, but we'll address that later when we get to guidance.

Let's take some time and revisit collections. Our collectability's impact was more than cut in half to $6.4
million versus the $14.8 million we had in the first quarter on the strength of prior and current period
collections, net of abatements. Rent collection in the quarter surged to 94% or 4% from the 90% level
as reported on our first quarter call. With abatements and deferral agreements totaling 4% of billed rent,
our unresolved rent now stands at just 2%. Of the $39 million of deferral agreements negotiated to date,
$17 million have been repaid, representing about 90% of the scheduled deferral payments. The remaining
repayments of $22 million are set to be paid back over the next few years.

Elections for cash basis tenants improved substantially to roughly 80% for the quarter, up from 66% in
the first quarter, a very strong signal. For occupancy, the continued pressure that we expected during
the second quarter never really materialized as our tenants remained resilient. With the record-breaking
leasing volumes across the portfolio, economic occupancy should steadily climb higher from this point
driven by 310 basis points of spread between leased and occupied that is embedded within the portfolio.

Other strong leasing metrics to note, our small shop leased occupancy grew almost 200 basis points to
85.7% from 83.8%, a huge movement for that metric in a single quarter. And with respect to our lifestyle-
oriented retail assets, whose performance was hardest hit during COVID, the spread between leased and
occupied has grown to 440 basis points, driven by strong tenant demand and signaling a sustainable
acceleration in this segment's recovery.

Comparable property growth rebounded in a big way for the quarter, up 39%, an unprecedented result
and obviously, a record for Federal. But also no better evidence of a lack of relevance for this metric in the
current environment, whether it's positive or negative.

Now let me move to guidance. We increased our guidance for both 2021 and 2022, taking 2021 up over
10% from a prior range of $4.54 to $4.70, up to a new range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share. This implies
13% year-over-year growth versus 2020 at the midpoint. And we are taking 2022 up 5% from a prior
range of $5.05 to $5.25 to a new range of $5.30 to $5.50.

Let's review some of the assumptions behind the improved outlook. For 2021, as I mentioned, the $1.41
per share results for the second quarter will not be a run rate for the balance of the year. As I mentioned,
$0.09 of that 2Q results is onetime in nature. Term fees and bankruptcy-related income will not recur at
the same level, and note that we have very few term fees in the pipeline currently.

While current period collections should continue to climb modestly higher, prior period collections are
forecasted to trail off for the remainder of the year. Also consider the previously mentioned dilution,
roughly $0.03 per quarter from the residential at Assembly and other developments that we'll be
delivering in the second half. We also expect increased G&A and property level expenses of $0.02 per
quarter as the cost of doing business has increased post COVID. However, we do expect accretion from the
second quarter acquisitions of roughly $0.02 per quarter. So this revised guidance implies an increase in
our FFO forecast for the second half of the year of '21 of almost 10%.

For 2022, the improvement in outlook is driven by: One, a faster return to pre-COVID collection levels;
two, a stronger occupancy due to the record leasing activity we've seen; three, a full year contribution
for Grossmont, Chesterbrook and Phoenix; and then continued improvements and contributions from our
development pipeline, although we continue to await tangible leasing at Santana West. It feels like that
will not contribute to FFO until 2023.

Also note that there is a level of pragmatism in these numbers. By all reports, the COVID variants are
keeping the virus with us longer than we would like. And we are still anticipating some level of tenant
fallout as PPP money and other government subsidies fall away in impact-selected tenants' ability to
operate profitably. And lastly, getting rents started on our record levels of new leasing activity will be a
paramount focus for the operating teams here at Federal.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Please note there is no benefit assumed in our guidance in either year from switching tenants back from a
cash basis to accrual basis account.

Finally, let's move to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity and leverage. On the heels of deploying
over $325 million on acquisitions and over $100 million on new process development during the quarter,
we continue to have ample total available liquidity of $1.3 billion, comprised of $300 million of cash and
an undrawn $1 billion revolver. With $125 million of mortgage debt scheduled to be paid over the next 90
days, we will then have no maturing debt until 2023.

And lastly, we continue to be opportunistic selling tactical amounts of common equity through our ATM
program. We sold $140 million at a blended share price of about $117.50 for the quarter and a forward
sales agreement in order to manage our liquidity over the next year. Our remaining spend on our $1.2
billion in-process development pipeline is down to $270 million with an additional $60 million remaining on
our product improvement initiatives across the portfolio.

Given the surge in our EBITDA, our leverage metrics returned to significantly stronger levels as well. Pro
forma for our 2Q acquisitions and $175 million of forward equity under contract, our run rate for net debt
to EBITDA is down to 6.2x. Our fixed charge coverage is back up to 3.7x. And our total liquidity climbs pro
forma to $1.5 billion. Our targeted leverage ratios remain in the mid-5x for net debt-to-EBITDA and above
4x for fixed charge coverage.

Now before we get to Q&A, let me quickly mention that in the wake of covering the dividend this quarter
from AFFO, yesterday, our Board declared an increased quarterly dividend per share of $1.07. Given the
surge in traffic across the asset base, the resilience and quality of our sector-leading real estate portfolio,
the strength of our balance sheet and the sound forward-looking decision-making and management,
maintaining the dividend through another challenging economic cycle now looks likely. This should
provide Federal shareholders with further peace of mind that with an investment in FRT comes a reliable,
uninterrupted, steady, stable stream of current income as part of their total return.
And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess what I want to focus in on is the small shops. The 190 bps seems really strong. Most of your peers
are showing just the reverse. They're showing an increase leasing by the anchors, reasoning being they're
national and they can move faster than the small shops; and two, sometimes you need these anchors in
place to push the small shops. Maybe you could say what you did differently to drive the small shops? Or
what is it indicative of from the small shop side?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Thanks, Craig. Let's just turn that over to Wendy. Let's see what Wendy thinks about that.

Wendy A. Seher
Executive VP & Eastern Region President

Craig, yes, I think that we continue to see kind of that really strong, steady demand from our anchors,
whether it's Target and Home Sense and REN, which was new to market, we continued to make those
deals as we always have historically. So really strong strength there. But what I'm -- just as you pointed
out, what I'm really excited about is the fact that our small shop leasing has been terrific.

A lot of demand for our properties. Very broad-based between all of our property levels, and we continue
to do deals with those best-in-class partners who have always been on our small shop side, whether it's
Nike or Athleta, Starbucks, Ulta, to name a few.

What I'm really kind of intrigued about and really speaks to the strength of the real estate is the kind of
retailers who maybe have a little bit more of a conservative expansion program, and they're selectively
choosing best-in-class locations across the country doing very small increments of growth that really
differentiate your property types.

And that -- those names like Levain Bakery and Blue Bottle Cafe and Oriana, Room & Board and Simon
Pearce, and I could continue on and on, are really what I'm excited about are the kinds of tenants that are
selecting our properties in the neighborhoods and areas that we're in.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I know Don gave a breakout of 60% new, 40% renewed. Were you seeing a similar ratio? Or was it
even higher new tenants in the small shop?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Well, I'm not sure, Craig. We can go back and look at it. I would expect that to be commensurate either
way, but I'd have to go back and look at it. I'll tell you, the new deals on the small shop side have been
spectacular. And so that's going to be a good -- that's going to be a big number. I just don't know if it's
bigger or smaller than the anchors.

Jeffrey S. Berkes
President & COO

Yes. Craig, it's Jeff. And just to put a pin in it and really this is what Wendy's saying, but a differentiator,
obviously, between us and our peer group is the lifestyle and mixed-use properties of -- what's said in

the prepared remarks, the leasing in those properties has been exceptionally strong, and the bulk of the
leasing in those properties are, by definition, small shop tenants. So we're just very pleased with the level
of activity there and the quality of the deals that our leasing teams have been able to get done in that
portion of our portfolio.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. I mean I was really surprised to see the lift in small shops.

Operator

Our next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just have a quick question on -- in terms of cash on hand. I mean things have obviously improved
quite a bit. It still seems like you're running with about $300 million of cash on hand. I mean how should
we be thinking about what's, I don't know, like a normalized level for the current environment of cash?
Should we expect that to drop off to something more pre-COVID-like? Or do you anticipate running with
something more elevated over the longer term?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

It's a good question, Mike. Yes, look, we've run through COVID with higher levels of cash. I think we're
still above kind of the stabilized level of cash that we expect to need, expect to run with. I think over time,
we'll run that down. And my expectation is that maybe it's $100 million, maybe $150 million of cash on
hand, versus kind of what we used to run, which was kind of more in the $25 million plus/minus.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And one clarification. When you were talking about before the upside in the quarter, you just said
$0.05 of one-timers above what you assumed. What was the total amount of what you would consider to
be the one-timers in the quarter?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Roughly about $8 million of one-timer.

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

$0.08, Dan.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Or $0.08, sorry, I misspoke. $0.08 worth of one-timers in the quarter, and we had forecasted something
obviously lower than that. We did expect the -- obviously, the Splunk term fee net of the straight line, and
we did expect the repayment of our money act loan, but we were surprised by a lot of other activity that
came through in the quarter that we don't expect to recur going forward.

Operator

Our next question is from Katy McConnell of Citigroup.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

I'm wondering if you could comment on, based on your current fundamental outlook, how you're thinking
about the opportunity to start additional phases of development in the near term? Or even potentially new
ground-up sites as opposed to pursuing more acquisitions? And just how you're thinking about the yield
differential there?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

I love the question, Katy. I'm not sure if you've been in our senior executive meetings over the past few
weeks, if you're spying because those conversations are front and center. And look, the -- it depends,
right? When you look at a place like Pike & Rose, for example, this is a property that we're really, really
happy with the office leasing that's been done in the first building, in the building we're standing in an 909
Rose. Could there be enough demand here to effectively start another building in time? It's possible. So
we're talking about that, looking at that. Could we find a big-enough tenant that could anchor it? I don't
know, all that stuff is the kind of thought process that we go through in each of these big projects.

Do we want to start a brand-new ground-up in the next year? I said no, we don't. We frankly have plenty
to do on the existing ones that we have. And when you look at the acquisition trade-off, if you will, versus
development, I think there was a window. And I think we jumped through that window during COVID
where that difference was really attractive and pointed you toward acquisitions.

That's changed a little bit now. It's still early in the recovery. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But
with us, it's not about turning one stick at on and the other one off, it's about adjusting based on what it is
that we find. So I hope that's helpful in terms of where we'll be going forward. And obviously, any time we
have a deal to announce, we'll certainly announce it on either the acquisition or the development side.

Mary Kathleen McConnell
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And I know you mentioned you had one additional acquisition in the pipeline as of now. Any other
comments you can share as far as what's in the pipeline beyond that? Or what you've seen as far as

Our next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Don, you talked about the wide spread between the lease and the occupied. I'm wondering, A, how quickly
can that close? And maybe if you or Dan could just talk about what is implicit in your 2022 guidance for
either an average occupancy or perhaps a year-end occupancy by 2022?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Sure, Steve. I'll take the first piece and Dan, if you can take the numbers second, that would be great. But
the -- when you see all the leasing that we've done, and it goes back a little bit to Craig's point, a lot of it
has been small shops. And the small shop stuff tends to happen quicker effectively than the anchors. So
that stuff should be starting to help us later in 2021 and a lot in 2022. The anchors have a longer tail. And
so there, you should see more benefit coming in '22 and even a few as far out as '23 there. But they are
more focused towards -- or more weighted toward those small shop deals that do go faster.

Now look, the difference between, obviously, new deals versus renewals, renewals are there right now and
keep that income stream going. The new stuff that's coming in is, in a lot of places, too, part and parcel

of kind of our property improvement plans and our redevelopment plans. So as a result, you'll really see a
big -- a really upgraded portfolio over the next few years as a result of this.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

And with regard to guidance, what's embedded there is, I think, some modest continued improvement
through the end of the year. It should get back up above 90% occupied by year-end, and then probably
over the course of -- 92%, to get into probably somewhere above 92%. Will we get to kind of that full
spread of 310 basis points? We'll see. But the guidance is roughly kind of 92% to 93% by the end of '22.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And maybe just as a follow-on for you or for Don. When you think about -- you guys obviously took
a lot of pain in the downturn and are starting to see the snapback. When would you sort of guesstimate
that your NOI would be back to pre-COVID levels? Is that a '23 number? Is that kind of by the end of '22?
How do we sort of think about that pace of recovery?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

I don't know what to tell you about that, Steve. It's certainly something that we've talked about a lot. I
would hope for it to be there in '23. But let me throw something else out at you that maybe is a little bit
thought provoking.

If you took our portfolio today, and you said, all right, historically, this company has certainly been a 95%
leased portfolio, and you took all of the capital that we've spent in development projects to date and
acquisitions that have been made, et cetera, and other capital that's not yet producing income, and you
simply said, "All right. Finish up. Let's get this thing leased back up to 95%, whenever that happens. Let's
get all that development with tenants full." We'd be over $7 a share.

So this really comes down to a notion of we're not sitting here trying to focus on getting back to 2019
levels. We're sitting here saying, look, we're putting money out in places we think that are smart. We've
certainly been hit by COVID, obviously, delayed in terms of -- and certainly in the markets and the asset
types that we have all the way through even more so. But getting back to something that was just okay
back in 2019 hardly seems like it should be the goal. So I don't know when we get to what I just said, but
that's where we are aiming, man, and we're trying hard.

Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

First, congrats on being a Dividend King. I wasn't even aware of that. I knew about the Dividend
Aristocrat. So Dividend King is pretty cool.

Don, following up from Steve's question, last quarter when I asked you about '22 and said, "You wouldn't
put out '22 unless you thought that you could beat it," which is what you've now done. And listening to
Dan talk about what's not in the number, meaning like your tenants who are cash basis now, you're not
assuming any of those people go back to being straight line, which means that's a boost, that's an upward
bias to earnings, plus you killed it on this quarter, there's no reason to think that you won't outperform on
further quarters.

Again, why should we stay within your guidance range for '22? Why wouldn't we do -- be above it?
Because what you do is you run the team to always outperform. You don't put something out there unless
you think that you can achieve beyond that. And if you're telling Steve that you don't think you'd be back

to peak NOI until '23 and you just covered your dividend basically a full year earlier than you thought,
again, it sounds like there's some good upside to '22.

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

How in the world, my friend, could I possibly answer you the same way I did last time when I have to sit
here and say, from last time, Alex was right. I mean that's hard for me to do well. Hard for me...

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Can you say that -- Don, Don, Don, slow down. Say that louder and slower.

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Well, now you're getting greedy, Alex, okay? So I said it one time. And do I believe what we were doing
was sandbagging? I do not believe that. I believe what we were doing is assessing the situation as best
we could at that time. And I believe that things have gotten better a whole lot faster in our markets. But
at the end of the day, Alex, you are right, dude. And there's dude again. And you didn't use dude back on
me, which I thought you should have in that particular spot, but nonetheless.

So with respect to where we are now, I'm going to say the same thing to you. We've done the best we can
to kind of lay out where we are, lay out the probabilities of hitting our numbers. I don't know what Delta
does. I don't know what the situation -- where the situation goes in the country, the way we are -- the
way we move things through. But I do know when you sit and you look at our forecasting and what it is
that we see happening, we are clearly improving faster than we thought we were before.

Will that happen again? I don't know. Maybe I got to get you in here to do the forecasting for the
company. But that's -- I don't have a good answer beyond that for you.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I mean, to that point, I mean, one, the straight lining is a positive; two, you have your experiential
tenants who are coming back; three, there's the improvement in occupancy. I mean it just seems like
there's a lot of stuff in there that's upward bias, and each quarter, everyone exceeds. So I mean that's the
point is I think I've answered my own question, but you've answered it.

So the next question is, as far as the new -- the -- you said that 60% of the people coming in to your
portfolio are new tenants. Are those simply relocations from other centers? Are they new to market? Are
they tenants looking to expand? Like, just a little bit more color on what that new demand is.

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Yes. The new demand is very broad-based. It's all of the things that you said and more. And frankly,
Wendy kind of touched it when she was talking about some of these tenants who are well-capitalized
tenants that are not -- they're not volume guys. They're not trying to do 250, 300 stores, 500 stores, et
cetera. They are selectively picking locations to have brick-and-mortar outfits that supplement their online
businesses, et cetera. We're getting our fair -- more than our fair share of those type of tenants. That's a
real positive thing. They're new to market in a lot of cases. They're effective. They're newly capitalized in a
lot of cases.

One of the things that is most important here to think through is that obviously, COVID cleaned out
weaker tenants, and they did that earlier. That's the April and May and June and July of 2020. And you
know that list by heart. The notion though of what happened over the next year and who you want to
have in your centers, particularly if you're spending $10 million and $12 million and $8 million on a center
for a property improvement plan, you want new blood in the retail because you can't just have a nice

place to sit outside the same old tenants that were pre-COVID and average or are average now because of
their sales.

So you're seeing -- we've said it from the beginning that the demand is broad-based and the demand is
largely tenants trying to improve the real estate locations that they're in. Why? Because they're trying to
improve the sales that it is that they do, which is why they can pay the rents that we charge. It's all about
that relationship.

Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.

Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just on the guidance, again, what are the assumptions that you have built into the 2021 guidance that
would get you to the low end of the range versus what it would take to get you to the high end?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

For the most part, I think it's just the range of a lot of the things that we talked about in the numbers,
whether it be continued upward surge in collections, how much additional prior period rent we are
assuming that rent trails off from it was -- yes, we've had pretty steady prior period rent collection of $7
million, $8 million and $7 million over the last 3 quarters. We expect it to trail off to -- in the second half
of the year to about $3 million and $2 million, respectively. There could be some upside there from that
perspective.

Yes, we are likely to increase -- we are successful with an acquisition, we'll bump guidance slightly from
that perspective. But it's all the reason -- all the outperformance we had. We're expecting term fees.
We had $3.4 million net in the quarter versus $1.8 million net last year. We're not expecting -- we're
expecting maybe $1 million this quarter. That's an area of some upside. To the extent we're higher than
that, that's up towards the upper end of the range. So that's some of the pieces that get us from the top
and the bottom.

Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

That's helpful. And it's really admirable that you put out 2022 guidance. As we think about your prior
guidance to the current one, your '20 -- the gap between your '21 and '22 guidance kind of shrank this
quarter. And some of that's explained, I think, by some of the onetime charges, but what are the other
changes in assumptions next year that are reflected in that?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Well, no, Michael, all I was going to say and may I add to this, like, what you're basically seeing is a faster
recovery. So all of the things that were assumed are simply happening faster. And so when you look at
kind of what we had put out in '22 initially, obviously, there was a run rate from '21 that rolled into '22, to
the extent that run rate is better in '21. It inures or some of it accrues to '22 also. And that's basically all
it is.

We stay with the methodology that we use in our multiple year forecasting. And we make that consistent
each quarter that we update those assumptions. That single biggest change is what I'm saying, and that is
simply a faster recovery than what was there.

BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I was just hoping to spend a little time on the lease spreads. I guess based on current demand and your
lease expiration schedule, how do you think spreads will trend into and maybe through '22? There's a
slight dip sequentially in the spread in the second quarter despite the strong momentum. So I don't know
if that was mix related, and your expirations kind of jump up next year in terms of the dollar per square
foot. So just curious if you have any context on how those spreads may evolve into and through '22?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

I guess what I'd say to you is a couple of things. First of all, we're a relatively small company. And so in
any particular quarter, there's always going to be rather significant variation. I laughed a little bit when
you said there was a decrease in the second quarter to first quarter. I think one was 9 and one was 8. To
me, that's exactly the same, just so you know.

In terms of the -- and in both of those quarters, there were still deals, obviously, that were rolled down.
There were other deals that were rolled up in a more significant way. That's basically what happens in
most quarters. There is a mixture of those 2 things. The probability that it will stay in those single-digit
numbers is highest. That's where we're most comfortable effectively in kind of running -- pushing rents
and seeing what we can do in any one period.

And again, that it definitely, definitely depends on the mix of any particular quarter, which you don't get in
a bigger company. If you've got a much bigger company with more of a commodity product and kind of do
the same type of deals over and over again, that's a great thing for consistency. But we are trying to bring
in more value here.

Juan Carlos Sanabria

Great. Sorry, I should have been more clear. I was focused on the new lease rate spreads, but point taken.

Donald C. Wood

Got it. And then just on the acquisition side, any thought or color you could provide about potentially
further expanding into new markets, whether it's the Sun Belt or maybe Texas, about how you're thinking
about that and conversely what could be used as a source in terms of potential calling or dispositions? Or
that's not really the focal point for funding, it'd be more just match funding with equity at this point?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Hey, J.B., do you want to take that to get started?

Jeffrey S. Berkes
President & COO

Yes, sure. I mean we are -- and I think we've talked about this in prior quarters and in NAREIT. We are
looking at some new different markets to expand. I think, as we put it, the number of ponds that we can
fish in. And you saw us go into Phoenix, and we're looking at other markets as well right now. We don't
really have anything to talk about. When we do, we will.

I think Don said earlier, we're really happy we got the deals done, that we did get done when we got
them done. The market has tightened up quite a bit. So as always, we'll be careful and conservative and
hopefully, get some deals done.

Every time we do a deal, we do a deal on a cash basis. That always causes us to look at the existing
portfolio and think about disposing of an asset or 2 that maybe doesn't keep up with the rest of the
portfolio in terms of its property level NOI growth. And when we have cash acquisitions to -- that will allow
us to do that and make those dispositions on a tax-neutral basis, we will, but really, not a lot to talk about
in that regard right now.

With regards to funding, as we always are, we're very balanced and opportunistic in how we'll look at it.
And to the extent that the investment sales market offers us an opportunity to sell some assets at really
attractive pricing, we'll take advantage of it, and we'll let you know when we do it.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

How has -- how has office interest materialized, especially for Santana West? And thanks for the color on
your HQ and also the traction that you're seeing at PUMA. And I do know that Santana is still a bit away
from delivering. But I also believe it was almost fully leased with an LOI prior to the pandemic. Has that
potential tenant or other anchors like them perhaps reengaged? Or are you seeing any traction there?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Jeff, this one is all you, buddy.

Jeffrey S. Berkes
President & COO

Well, to answer the last part of your question directly, the potential tenant that we were close with pre-
pandemic, no, they have not materialized, and we don't expect them to now that we're starting to come
out of the pandemic. Activity out here in Silicon Valley, the office leasing perspective has definitely picked
up in the last 60, 90, 120 days. Tours have started again. You probably all heard about the deal that Apple
did a few weeks ago for 700,000 square feet, which is a great sign for the market. There are several other
large users that have requirements and are conducting tours, including tours of 1 Santana West in coming
days and weeks. We don't have anything to talk about. And again, we won't until we will. But I can tell you
that activity has picked up quite a bit.

What's great and what we're really happy about as it relates to 1 Santana West is there's very, very little
supply in Silicon Valley right now, and particularly, new supply that's amenitized. So that makes us feel
good about our prospects for getting the building leased. There's not a lot that we're competing against
right now.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

No, it seems like a great asset. And work with me here. So all high-quality retail assets seem to be
generating a ton of demand, all right? So this strong of leasing in a post-pandemic environment, I mean,
like, I don't know who could have fully seen this. So okay, Federal, strong leasing, solid spreads and the
highest ABRs. Now what's going on here, Don? Like, what dynamics or shifts can you share that you're
seeing? Because really, I just want to stop talking and listen for another minute, if you would let me.

Donald C. Wood

or Jeff, anybody that wants that. I mean, look, there is -- if you're -- just be a retailer for a minute, be

a restaurant for a minute and have gone through what just happened in this country over the last 18
months. And frankly, what was happening, the pressures that were on you for the 3 and 4, 5 years before
that.

And so here you are now, in many cases, recapitalized; in many cases, with a different level of competition
than you had before. And you're in a position where you can reset. And effectively, that's what's
happening. If you've got the chance -- I mean, Wendy can tell you, man, if you sit on Rockville Pike in 1 of
the 4 or 5 shopping centers that all aim for different parts of the consumer on Rockville Pike that we own,
there have been tenants that have been trying to get on to Pike for years and years in the right type of --
the right type of centers.

We've been over 95% leased for Rockville Pike for much, if not all, of that time, except for the last 15
months. There is an opportunity that has not been here. So there's an opportunity to improve your real
estate in a very, very well-located first-tier suburb of major cities, and you've got a landlord who is openly
and anxiously improving those shopping centers for a post-COVID environment, why would you not
choose to go there? Where would you choose to go instead?

Because at the end of the day, it's not about the rent. It's about the profit there. And effectively, higher
sales, better margins, a more affluent customer, in better real estate, with a landlord that's investing
side-by-side with you seems to be -- and you're in there with a new balance sheet, seems to be a pretty
smart choice for a lot of tenants, including and especially those small shop tenants that Craig Schmidt was
referring to before and that Wendy went through in detail.

So I hope that's helpful. That's what we see happening in the markets that we're in, at the properties that
we're in. That's why the investment in the properties to be post-COVID investments are so important to a
retailer. They've got to be partners with their landlord.

Wendy A. Seher
Executive VP & Eastern Region President

The only thing, Don, I would add to that is that as -- you summed that up so well in terms of how
the retailers are thinking. And now think on the flip side of how we're thinking, it gives us the equal
opportunity to strengthen our assets and more merchandising with forward thinking of who is well
capitalized, who's relevant, who's going to meet that post-COVID world and what -- how should we make
our investments in our properties. So it's really a benefit to both sides.

Don, and this kind of follows up on Derek's question, but I appreciate the comments you've made about
sort of the demand being pulled forward. But I was curious as to the conversations you're having with your
-- the tenants you want to have in your shopping centers, are they expressing interest in thinking about
not just the this year, next year deals, but the future out years, are you seeing the sustainability of this
demand with those kinds of tenants?

Donald C. Wood

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

CEO & Director

8.4 years, which is about a year more than you kind of used to see from us. And I think what you're trying
to -- what they're trying to do is plant flags that effectively get them to the next decade. Now certainly,
as a portfolio goes from 89% leased to 92% to 94%, et cetera, it gets harder and harder and harder to
be able to do that. So in some respects, it's -- in a lot of respects, it's constrained by the supply that's
available to them.

And that's kind of why when everything is great in the industry and everything else, a rising tide lifts
all boats because you got to find the best spot. But that's also especially at a time like this when those
tenants are trying to take advantage of an opportunity that they have not had for years. So that's kind of
what I'm seeing. I don't know, Wendy, if you want to add anything to that or...

Wendy A. Seher
Executive VP & Eastern Region President

I think the only thing I can add is when I -- I don't know how long you're thinking. But when I look at the
pipeline, it is still very robust. So I don't see that we've done a lot first and second quarter and when we're
just -- it's robust. So right now, it's -- I'm confident.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I think my comment really relates to anecdotal conversations I've had with tenant rep brokers who
have talked about their clients not really thinking about '21 and '22 openings, but thinking about '23 and
'24 openings, and that their volume of activity has ramped considerably. And that was really how I was
thinking about it.

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Yes. Look, Chris, but that is what happens to it. I mean it -- this stuff takes time. I mean I was thinking
before when somebody asked the question, the difference between the high and the low end of the
guidance. One of the things that we didn't say was, are we going to be able to get with all this leasing, are
tenants open faster than assumed or slower than assumed? And that's not totally in our control. As cities
with permits, there's retailers that have different plans of their timetable, et cetera.

So the lag in our business, obviously, between signing a lease -- or signing a lease is not the end of the
process. Getting that rent started is the end of the process. And that is a complex thing to do. In a lot of
ways, it takes some time. So that's part of what you're hearing from those tenants also is the lead time to
be able to lock up space for a true post-COVID environment.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then, Dan, I just wanted to follow up on the collection side. The abatements were down
sequentially from $10 million to $7 million. I'm just curious as to whether that thought was driven by --
driven by tenant fallout? Or is that driven by them moving towards paying rent?

And then kind of alongside that is also your ABR under cash basis, looks like it went up, call it, $10 million
quarter-to-quarter. Is that predominantly new deals? Or are those legacy leases moved to cash? Just give
me a hand on that?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I'm going to ask you to repeat the question, Chris, and do it one at a time.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Okay. Sorry about that, Dan. So on abatements, you went from $10 million to $7 million. Was most of the
drop related to this tenant fallout? Or was it related to tenants primarily moving to paying new rent, so the
abatements sort of going away?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Moving towards paying us rent.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then the second question is related to the ABR that's under cash basis. The percentage of
your commercial leases under cash basis remain the same quarter-to-quarter but the volume of ABR was
up considerably from first quarter to second quarter. So it generated about a $10 million delta on gross
ABR that's under cash basis. And so I wanted to understand whether that was predominantly based on
new deals that you had signed or whether there were some legacy leases that sort of contributed to that
increase in the ABR under cash basis.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. That distortion was driven by the acquisitions. Obviously, we acquired $325 million or $400 million
worth of assets that had 1.75 million square feet. Obviously, that's going to skew some of the data there.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

So Don, on development, I believe I saw an entitlement request that Pike & Rose to potentially add lab or
R&D space there. Can you provide some color on how potential construction costs and investment yields
compare between traditional office and lab space near your major developments and whether that's an
asset type you may pursue at other locations as well?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Greg, first of all, I love that you're looking at that stuff and seeing what's going on around here. What
we're doing is trying to make sure that we uncover -- and we're real estate guys. So we're trying to
uncover the highest and best use for the real estate that's here at Pike & Rose and certainly, up at
Assembly Row and other places. And certainly, when you look at life sciences and you think about
Montgomery County, Maryland, it's an important business that's here, that with a little bit of luck expands,
and by the way, expands to places where the tenants value the amenity base that other office type
tenants value in these locations. And the same applies to Assembly Row.

Now at Pike & Rose, are we anywhere near being able to answer your specific questions in terms of
the economics on it, whether it's viable, does it make any sense? No, we're not. We're in that early
exploratory phase, but we're in the early exploratory phase because we believe there is something
potentially there. I've got nothing more to say about that at this point other than the entitlements in this
-- on this 27 acres could certainly be used for that use and similarly, at Assembly Row.

So -- and Assembly Row could be closer because that business is -- that business, in terms of Boston and
Cambridge and Somerville, is even closer to fruition than it is here. But in neither case, am I really ready
to talk to you about the economics because we're not sure what we got yet.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Okay. That's fair. And then you also mentioned that lifestyle centers are having a bit of a resurgence in
tenant demand. Could you also discuss the level and type of demand you're seeing among the other asset
types? And if there's any noteworthy trends by geography, that color would be appreciated as well.

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

No. I don't -- I wouldn't do it necessarily, but I can't really do it between power centers or grocery-
anchored centers or regional centers because it really does -- does depend on the geography. There is no
question that even in the second quarter, we were operating in markets which were still -- I wouldn't say
locked down like they were in January and February, but only coming back and coming up and building in
terms of their resurgence. But that -- it was so strong in all of them, that we had to -- we just feel really
good about talking about it.

The only thing I would say is during that period of time, this second quarter, weather had a lot to do
with it. So Boston felt like it was a few weeks behind New York, which felt like it was a few weeks behind
Washington, D.C., et cetera. That's the -- as that weather changed and as those restrictions came off, holy
cow, was there pent-up demand. And that has -- that's continued.

It's interesting. We're talking a little bit -- I'm going off on a little bit of tangent, but you gave me an
opportunity, so I'll do it. When you think about the Delta variant itself and what's going to happen with
respect to it. Obviously, we don't know. But we do know a few things. The open-air format is fantastic.
And in the markets where we're at, which has been a big disadvantage as they all closed down in 2020,
these are markets where the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country.

They're also the markets, and this is important, where mask wearing is accepted. There's not a stigma to
it otherwise. So the notion, like, we see a lot of people wearing masks at our shopping centers and our
properties, but they're shopping just fine because they're comfortable with that. So I don't know how it's
going to play out, but I do like the fact that, really, in these markets, both East and West Coast, that the
vaccine rates are among the highest in the country because I think that's an important thing for the long
term of this mess we're in.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And just a quick follow-up because you mentioned pent-up demand. And I'm curious on guidance.
How are you guys thinking about this level of leasing activity and how much of that might be pent-up
demand versus more continued and sustainable tenant demand?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Yes. There's certainly some. But as Wendy has said a couple of times here, the pipeline is full. We've got
a bunch of deals to do yet. Will it be as robust as that second quarter or the first quarter? I doubt it. I
mean it's hard to maintain that level of activity, plus I think half the people would tweet, they've been
working on their asses off. But nonetheless, the ability to see elevated levels based on historical levels for
the foreseeable future is real.

Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

I know it's a long evening here for everyone. Just making sure I understand the signed not open pipeline,
the 320 basis points. You said is around $30 million of ABR. Is that correct?

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Correct.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

So it's about 5% -- 5% of that POI?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Of total rent -- of total rent.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Total rent, yes. So is that about 5% of your POI, ballpark figure?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. That's about right. That's right.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Yes. So look, it's a solid number, but it looks like you've pulled forward a lot of your NOI pickup
already in this past quarter. So you got another 5% to go. Just making sure, you've also indicated, Don, I
think you said you hope to get back to 94%, 95% occupancy, that suggests another 3% or 300 basis point
pickup from the current levels. So is that another 5% potential NOI impact going forward?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Yes, of course, Floris. I mean at the end of the day, if this is a 95% leased portfolio, and as I said earlier,
with the development filled and the capital that we've spent fully performing, I don't know when that
would be, you're talking about over $7 a share in earnings for the place.

So yes, you bet. Now ask me the day we get to 95% occupancy. I'm not sure I can give it to you, or when
we're fully leased up on the development, that's happening obviously. But yes, your model makes sense as
to the way you're looking at it.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

So let me ask you the follow-on on that. So obviously, your NOI goes up, your NAV should be going up
as well. Does that make you think, "Wait a second, maybe I should hold off on tapping the ATM until my
stock price gets up a little bit more?" Or would you still be comfortable raising more capital at the, say,
$1.17 level -- at these -- with these results behind you?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

So you know the answer, what it's going to be for me. This is a balanced plan, man, and the ability to
effectively raise a little bit of capital in most markets along the way is something that doesn't surprise
investors. It keeps everybody -- it matches beautifully the money that's spent out. The idea of letting
leverage get way up because there may be that day that you can do it and then you do a big overnight,
that's not our model.

And so we need those investors, and I think we have them but we need more of them who basically
appreciate that steady, balanced approach toward equity raising, debt raising, dividend payment, what you
get when you get the high-quality assets effect.

Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies.

Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I just had one question. In terms of the tenants that have a payback plan beyond 2021, what percentage
of your ABR is that? And then when do the plans finally conclude?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Linda, you've got people moving papers around all over the place around here. Just give us a second.

Beyond -- what we have outstanding, roughly half of that should be paid back by the end of the year. And
beyond that, it's another chunk in '22, with the balance -- with the balance in '23 and in '24. So you're
probably looking about 1/2 -- 1/2 in the balance of the year, a 1/4 in '22 and then the balance, beyond
that.

Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

What percentage of your ABR is on that kind of plan?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

I don't have that right at my fingertips. We can provide that to you offline.

Our next question is from Paulina Rojas-Schmidt of Green Street.

Paulina Rojas-Schmidt
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

There is clearly a lot of interest -- investor interest in the open air center these days. How do you think
investors are looking at lifestyle centers? And how has the level of comfort with the category change in
recent months, in your opinion?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

I don't know. The -- when you look at retail real estate, the big investors that we talk to are very
interested, obviously, in the cash flow prospects of the particular asset, the particular real estate. When
you look at lifestyle, I think what has become very clear during this -- during these last 6 or 8 months is
that those type of assets -- and I don't know what we really mean by lifestyle. In my mind, that we are
talking about largely our mixed-use properties and larger assets set that also include a residential or office
component associated with it.

I know that demand that we're seeing from tenants and therefore, the understanding of that from
investors is very strong. The notion that -- the notion that -- we all know that grocery-anchored centers
are very popular right now to effectively look at based on how they worked out through COVID. But in
terms of when you sit and you say, "Where is your growth over the next 5 years or 6 years or 7 years?" I
know how we feel, and I believe the investors in this company appreciate the higher growth potential of
those types of centers.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Yes. Your portfolio, of course, has a mix of some property types. But if you could break up your portfolio,
how far from pre-COVID is the NOI from the 30% of your portfolio comprised by lifestyle centers?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

It's still 15%, 18% off, I think.

Operator

Our final question is from Katy McConnell of Citigroup.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

It's Michael Bilerman here with Katy. Don, I guess as you listen to all your peer calls and review there
leasing stats, pretty much every public company has been reporting pretty record leasing, strong
pipelines. And I wanted to know whether you and your team have noticed any shift in the marketplace
between public and private landlords in their share of sort of leasing that's going on, if there is a market
share shift that is occurring to the better quality assets that the REITs own and the better capitalization
that the REITs are -- and whether that shift is real or it's just sort of on the margin?

And if it's real, does that alter the landscape at all and then provide -- and I don't know what happens
to all those centers that are not getting the leasing. Do those become acquisition opportunities or
redevelopment opportunities? I don't know whether this is a thing that's happening or not?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Boy, Michael, that's a great question. And I wish I had more than anecdotal evidence by it, but let me give
you the anecdotal stuff that I see. I mean -- and it kind of ties back to what I was saying before in terms
of retailers making longer-term investments. They're trying to set themselves up for the next decade
post COVID, and they want to be with landlords who are with them. And what that means with them is
care about who they're merchandising next to, care about whether they're investing in the properties to
effectively attract customers with a placemaking perspective, a curbside pickup.

And I mean curbside pickup, I cannot tell you how many tenants ask about it. Whether they use it or
not, that's another question. But it's a critical thing to figure out whether the landlord is in it with them in
trying to make them successful as businesses. If you're a private company that is undercapitalized, and
I've got to make that distinction because a well-capitalized private company, and there's a bunch of them
that you and I know that are not disadvantaged at all, and then darn good at what they do.

But if you are a private company who is undercapitalized and trying to kind of milk the cash flow from the
existing shopping center, I think you're in a serious disadvantage post-COVID. And so that -- depending
upon the marketplace, who's in the marketplace, who's willing to invest or not. I do think that is a
sustainable trend that will widen the gap, if you will, between better real estate and less invested real
estate.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Do you think that there's a shift -- like, your example on the Pike & Rose -- on the Pike example, are
tenants just signing leases because it is available now and they know they want to get into the better
space with better quality landlords but they haven't let their other lease expire. And so macro retail
statistics are going to start eventually showing this depressed level of overall occupancy just because it's
more of a tenant moving around with maybe a slight uptick, given some of the new tenants coming into
the marketplace?

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

I don't have an opinion on that. Do either of you, guys? Because they're -- when they're signing leases, it
is for a move, generally. It's not to milk the old store that they had in the market and add another one. So
it is -- now I will say that we'll try to incentivize them to leave early and effectively use this period of time
to create an economic deal that makes sense for them to leave early or something.

But it's not -- no, I don't -- I don't see it being extra deals, if you will, that are going to wind up with
closeouts in the old places down the road in any significant way. At least I don't see it that way. I don't
know, Wendy's shaking her head.

Wendy A. Seher
Executive VP & Eastern Region President

I agree. I agree. It's more strategic. It's more timing, but I don't see tenants just leaving their other
stores and having 2 years left on their lease. It's just -- it needs to match up most of the time with the
quality of tenants that we're dealing with. I mean...

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Yes. Now historically, Publix was a good example of a company in Florida that would do that. Publix would
leave a store, go dark in a store and open one -- open one across the street, if it was better -- it was
better real estate, better landlord, et cetera. So I mean there's always exception, I guess. There's always
one-offs, but I do not see that or we don't see that as a trend.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

I mean, like, it's just such an unusual market to go through, right? Sorry, Jeff, you were saying?

Jeffrey S. Berkes
President & COO

Yes, to answer kind of the second part of your question, Michael. If you look at the acquisitions we got
done in the second quarter, one of the common threads across those deals was the owner, for whatever
reason, was unwilling or unable to invest capital in the property going forward. And those are perfect,
well-located shopping centers where that's the owner's mentality, those are perfect acquisitions for us.

We like those because we will come in and put in the capital in a great location and show virtually
immediate results in leasing or very strong results in the short term in leasing. So yes, to the extent the
pandemic causes more of that to happen, that will put more properties on our radar screen, for sure.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Great. Well, I appreciate the color, even if it's anecdotal. I know we're not going to have perfect answers
as of yet as we transition to the next phase of this pandemic.

Operator

Our next question is from Tammy Fique of Wells Fargo Securities.

Tamara Jane Fique
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. Sort of given all the leasing activity that you did in the quarter, I guess I'm curious what annual
contractual rent bumps look like on the new leases signed relative to what you were negotiating pre-
COVID?

And then maybe as a follow-up to that, I'm wondering if you are seeing any retailers backing away from
openings or closing stores due to an inability to find labor today?

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

CEO & Director

I guess the first part of your question, Tam, on average, deals -- we still see plenty of deals at 3% bumps,
2.5% bumps. The anchors will still be flat for 5% and then up 10%. And I don't see a difference in the
deals we're doing compared to pre-COVID, I guess, is the big point there. And then the second part of
your question was what?

Tamara Jane Fique
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'm just curious, I guess, given we've heard some -- there are some challenges in some of those smaller
retailers in particular, finding labor. And I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any retailers backing away
from openings or closing stores as a result of that?

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

I don't think so. I mean there is no question that is a current issue, especially when you're talking about
the service businesses and the restaurants and other service businesses like that. But in terms of not
doing deals because of that, no, I don't see that today. I don't see that actually happening now.

Ask me that again every quarter and figure out what's going on with that labor situation because I do
think that has to give a little bit and I think it will just, by the natural -- in the natural course as we go.
But no, not backing off the opening.

Tamara Jane Fique
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just one more. As you think about future development opportunities and just as
we first sit here and reflect on the approaching stabilizations in the current underway pipeline, I guess I'm
curious what projects, either in the big 3 or in the shadow pipeline, you view as most compelling today.
And are higher construction costs having any impact on how you're thinking about future development.

Donald C. Wood
CEO & Director

Yes. Well, the costs always kind of aid what we do. And on the big 3, what we want to make sure we do
as best we can, because these are planned for 15 years in 20 years in terms of their execution on those
things, is to have a good mix of both retail, which brings people to the asset; residential, which we do love
to do in terms of that night and weekend traffic; and a component of office, which adds that daytime.

So we still want to be able to do all of those on our big projects. We're working those numbers all the
time. Construction costs seem to have stabilized a little bit at this point in time. I think that's a general
good sign. We do need to get comfortable with where rents are and whether we're able to make some
money. I think I said earlier in the remarks that there are a number of opportunities, potentially at Pike &
Rose or Assembly, that we see now.

I can't wait to be telling you that there's other opportunities at Santana Row once we get that big building
lease, which I would love to be able to tell you but I'm not ready to do that yet. And the existing projects
that are still being built, like Darien; and income yet to start, like CocoWalk, in full measure, will also
provide -- be providing growth over the next couple of years.

We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Leah
