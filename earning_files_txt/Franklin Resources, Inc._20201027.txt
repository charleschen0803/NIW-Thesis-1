[Operator Instructions]

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources President and CEO Jenny Johnson. Ms.
Johnson, you may begin.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Hello, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2020 results. Today, I'm joined by Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO.

We hope that everyone on this call and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy.

So this year, despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, we made significant progress in moving
our business forward, including closing the Legg Mason acquisition earlier than initially expected. We
focused our efforts and investments in key areas that directly support the firm's multiyear strategic plan to
maximize organic growth, execute on M&A opportunities and position Franklin Templeton to capitalize on
industry change.

The results that we announced this morning reflect a full quarter and fiscal year of Franklin Templeton, but
only include 2 months of the newly combined organization. In that short amount of time and under these
extraordinary work-from-home conditions, we've made remarkable progress becoming one company,
all ahead of schedule. And the strategic rationale for this powerful combination has only strengthened
since we announced the acquisition back in February. We've been able to bring together 2 especially
complementary platforms in a way that creates a more balanced organization. Our global presence has
expanded in key growth markets around the world, and we have created an all-weather product offering
with a greater range of specialized high-quality investment capabilities, all with an eye toward delivering
exceptional client outcomes.

It's important to note that the company we have become could not have been realized alone. Together,
we have significantly enhanced our ability to meet the needs of clients, advisers and shareholders for
many years to come. And client reaction to the acquisition has been consistently positive. We're excited
about this integration, not just for the strategic benefits, but also for the impressive group of people and
leaders we're bringing on board. We were pleased to be joined by so many talented professionals from
Legg Mason with a 97% acceptance rate of employment offers made to Legg Mason holding company
employees.

An integral part of our planning efforts has been the frequent and productive conversations we've had
with the leaders of each of the specialist investment managers or SIMs. We've appointed certain SIM

leaders for global or regional leadership roles in different areas of the company to fully reinforce for
strong alignment, our shared focus and commitment to each other. We're also pleased to report that our
global distribution team is now in place and is already able to cross-sell investment products from both
organizations across retail and institutional channels globally. Our new more neutralized client-centric
distribution structure is designed to increase end-to-end accountability for regional growth and ensure
clients get the most out of their relationships with us. Our specialized investment managers also each
retained their strong institutional distribution capabilities. We have focused on preserving the independent
investment; autonomy of the SIMs, while providing them with the opportunity to benefit from Franklin
Templeton's global infrastructure and investments in technology.

In one exception, Franklin Templeton's multi-asset solutions and QS investors have combined to form
Franklin Templeton's investment solutions. This single best-in-class platform brings together the powerful
combination of Franklin Templeton's active fundamental capabilities with QS quantitative skills to
customize multi-asset portfolios for our clients. The team now has more than 120 investment professionals
overseeing more than $120 billion in multi-asset strategies, creating a sizable solutions business with
scale to compete with the largest full-service providers.

We're seeing the benefits of adding world-class franchises to an already strong set of investment
capabilities. We continue to believe that active management will play an increasingly important role in
client portfolios, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this.

On the performance front, approximately half of mutual fund assets are outperforming their peers over
the standard time period, including over 100 funds rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar. We also have strong
institutional performance with 63%, 69%, 73% and 84% of assets beating the applicable benchmark for
the 1, 3, 5 and 10-year period, respectively, most notably in fixed income and alternatives.

On the sales front, U.S. fixed income attracted record net flows of $5.7 billion in the quarter. We are
pleased to see strong long-term net flows from Western assets, which reached its highest level on both
fronts in over a decade.

Additionally, as of quarter end, Western's total assets under management were $12 billion higher than at
the time the acquisition was announced. Western's investment performance has been outstanding. Our
fixed income pipeline across the firm is strong, would reach $6 billion of unfunded wins and a significant
opportunity pipeline. We recently introduced a new portfolio management team structure for the Franklin
municipal bond team to align portfolio managers with common strategies across the platform. We believe
this will further enhance investment performance that rebounded this year with 85% of assets ahead of
peers for the 1-year period, contributing to positive net flows for the year.

On a combined basis across the firm, our tax-free fixed income AUM has increased to almost $85 billion.
ClearBridge AUM is close to all-time high, standing at $153 billion with strong investment performance and
flows in several strategies.

Royce and Martin Currie strategy also had strong investment performance with essentially flat flows for
the quarter. Franklin Equity Group continues to achieve strong performance and attractive inflows. Franklin
DynaTech Fund generated $4.4 billion and net inflows for the year more than doubling its assets under
management to over $18 billion. Combined with Franklin growth and price arising dividend funds, the
Franklin Equity Group now has 3 funds near or above $20 billion of assets under management.

In terms of global macro, our performance challenges and attrition from Franklin Templeton and
Brandywine Global macro strategies persist. These continue to be positioned for more challenging market
conditions. These strategies also made up some ground on peers and the benchmark in the quarter. It's
undeniable that with Franklin Templeton's Western and Brandywine, we have a true unique position and
extensive capabilities across global macro strategies.

Similarly, Templeton Global Equity and Franklin Mutual series strategies continue to experience outflows
but are well positioned for periods that favor value investing.

With the addition of Clarion Partners, along with Benefit Street Partners and K2 advisors, the alternative
asset class recorded its fifth consecutive quarter of net inflows and now represents $124 billion in

assets firm wide. Clarion is experiencing strong investor interest with an inbound view of over $1 billion.
Benefit Street Partners priced two new CLOs in the quarter, totaling $800 million and received additional
commitments of approximately $300 million. Momentum in our Alternatives business continues to build.
As investors become more and more vehicle agnostic, we are well positioned in the retail SMA segment of
the market where we are now a leading franchise with $103 billion in assets compared to just $6 billion
a year ago. And our expanded ETF offering doubled to over $10 billion in AUM this year. We are also
planning to expand our closed-end fund capabilities.

Turning to financial highlights. Adjusted operating income increased to $429 million, a 58% increase
versus last quarter or 5% from the prior year, largely reflecting the addition of 2 months of Legg Mason.

We are on track to realize $300 million of gross synergies, with 85% of run rate savings expected to be
realized by the end of fiscal year 2021. The cost to achieve these savings is expected to be approximately
$200 million, which is $150 million less than originally anticipated. And we expect to realize approximately
$600 million of cash tax benefit related to the various tax attributes and deductions, which carried forward
in the transaction, a 20% increase from our initial estimates.

Our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with tremendous flexibility to evolve our business.
Earlier this month, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal senior notes due
2030, issuing at a 1.6% coupon and prefunded our intention to call higher coupon junior subordinated
notes, which are callable at par in March and September 2021.

And finally, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their significant efforts to keep our business operating
smoothly during these extraordinary times and for maintaining their laser focus on our clients' needs.
Now I'd like to open it up to your questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Ken Worthington with
JPMorgan.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

With the integration of Legg well underway, can you talk about the integration of the 2 distribution
networks thus far? I think on the last call, you talked about building more agile and regional distribution
organization. So I wanted to hear any updates there. And then you gave a cross-selling anecdote in the
commentary, and I was hoping you could flesh out kind of how you'd expect cross-selling to ramp, given
the integration and maybe what products might be most successful, given what you've learned over the
last couple of months?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Thanks for the question, Ken. So first thing was a decision to more regionalize. So what does that mean?
We wanted to push out more marketing and product and data analytics out to the regions. Historically,
that was done more centrally, and so now there is a portion of it that's completely controlled by the Head
of that region. And as you probably know, we talked about some of the SIMs had taking on leadership
roles, Adam Spector, who was CEO of Brandywine, is now Head of Global Distribution. And Julian Ide, who
was the Head of Martin Currie, is now Head of Europe for us. And so that's just helpful in ensuring that we
understand both how to integrate the global distribution with really how each of the SIMs handles their
distribution. And so it's helpful having people who come from that perspective.

As far as you look at U.S. retail, which is $1 trillion of our assets, Legg Mason came in with a much
stronger footprint in the broker-dealer Wirehouse channel, and we were much stronger in the independent
channel. They -- we now have $103 billion in SMAs. They were very top 3 SMA providers, and so it was
really looking at the capabilities between the 2 organizations and figuring out how to -- and in some cases,
you just had great people in the same covering and same channel, but one has greater penetration in
that. And so our distribution team is really a mix of Legg Mason and historic Franklin Templeton people,
and it was trying to recognize kind of where those prices were. They had strong penetration, say, in the
insurance channel. So there, we bring in the Legg Mason folks.

We have spent, I'm trying to remember the number, something like 1,200 people have participated in
something like 83 webinars that we've done to teach and ensure that there's -- that all the salespeople
have knowledge of each other's products.

So we spent a lot of time with that. You saw the anecdote in the comments. We also had another example
where we had an Israeli institution, where Legg never had any distribution in Israel and ended up winning
a mandate from one of the SIMs. So this takes a little bit of time, but I could tell you that we are -- we felt
really good about how it's operating now and that we found less overlap than we thought we'd find with
distribution when you really got under the covers.

Gregory Eugene Johnson
Executive Chairman

I think I'd just add one thing to that, which is to say, on the institutional side, recognizing how important
the institutional distribution is, given the fact that a big portion of Legg Mason and the rationale for our
transaction was to grow our institutional business, that's staying largely back here. It's organized today at
the specialized investment manager level. And that creates a high degree of confidence with clients, the
stability and continuity in that area of the business.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

President, CEO & Director

And actually, let me add one other thing. You asked the question of how do we get to more positive
flows. As you saw, we had things like the alternatives, we actually have been in positive flows. We think
there is just a huge amount of opportunity for Clarion and BSP in the retail channels. And BSP did a
small acquisition of a REIT. And really what they were doing was acquiring some wholesalers who have
expertise in selling alternatives to the RIA channel. So we think that's a tremendous opportunity for
both Clarion and BSP as well as feedback we've had from wirehouses who feel that they may have a
heavy concentration in the real estate managers that they have, and they'd like to diversify and clear in
coming out of this just a tremendous performance as they were overweighed in things like industrials and
underweight, say, retail.

Western, obviously continuing cross-sell capabilities. We have -- in the SMA side as the income fund is
able to be penetrating more of the relationship that Legg Mason has with advisors and sell SMAs, we
think that's going to be a great opportunity for our income fund. And I do have to say that I think with
the Templeton global bond, they're increasingly nervousness around whether -- they're very much set up
for a risk-off environment, as is Brandywine, and we've seen them perform very well in September. And
as investors may think of them as almost an insurance policy right now to any kind of big catalyst of the
surprise, whether it's an inflation surprise or escalation of U.S., China tensions. And so I think their story
is we're doing a better job of getting out their story there. I think we could, at least, begin to see some
reduction in the redemptions. And again, it's kind of positioning that message as an insurance.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.

Patrick Davitt
Autonomous Research LLP

Could you give us the amount of reinvested distributions in the long-term flow numbers so we can better
compare it to your public comps?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

I think...

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

So we had...

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Sorry, go ahead, Matt.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So we had $2.5 billion of reinvested distributions for the quarter. That compares to $3.5 billion last
quarter, and as you know, $3 billion a year ago. Our plan there, by the way, so we seemed to, of course,
some confusion here was to call out anything that's unusual around those flows. We decided to have a
simplified view of flows in terms of the presentation of it. So we had -- so we have client-driven activity
in, client activity out, and given our size and breadth of our business, we thought that made the most
sense. But we're not trying to avoid discussing reinvested distributions with anything unusual around that
we have planned to discuss it. For example, at year-end, as you know, that's often elevated, and we've
planned to call it out at that time. But that's the number for the quarter. It's $2.5 billion, $3.5 billion last
quarter, as you know, and $3 billion a year ago.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Autonomous Research LLP

Perfect. And on the fee rate guide, is there any kind of money fund fee waiver headwind built into that?
And through that lens, how much has that started to hit in the most recent quarter? And maybe any view
on how it's tracking kind of into the December quarter?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So it's fully included in the projection.

Patrick Davitt
Autonomous Research LLP

Great. And was it impactful in the last quarter?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Not relative to the size of our business. And also, given the structure of our arrangement with Western, it
has the largest portion of our money market business, we have some protection there on the margin. So
it's not a big -- it's absolutely not material at all to our overall company operations.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Crédit Suisse.

Craig William Siegenthaler
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wanted to start with M&A. And so just given the pickup in M&A speculation in U.S. asset management,
we want to see if Franklin would consider doing another large acquisition over the next 12 months,
knowing that you're still in the process of digesting Legg Mason, which probably is an easy on the
organization?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think the way that we'd answer that is that we are absolutely in the flow of what's going on. You're
right, there's a tremendous amount of activity in the industry with some interesting opportunities to
consider, broadly speaking, I think in many ways, the evolution of the industry in terms of some of the
more dramatic ideas that are out there. It's just getting started. But we are -- we're very, very focused on
making sure that we maximize the output from the Legg Mason transaction. I mean we literally doubled
the size of our company from an assets under management perspective. We -- every time when we have
meetings internally, we peel the onion back, and we realize we've got another opportunity internally, either
to be more efficient or to work together to produce more revenue.

So I think that, that's our primary focus. But we are in the flow on these things. We're not shut for M&A
by any stretch, if there was something tremendously compelling in particular, on the distribution side, if
there was something that helped us with distribution further to what we already have, we'll look at it very
carefully. We still have a very strong balance sheet. We're not going to compromise that. We have strong
earnings potential. We're not going to compromise that, given the opportunities we've got to use our cash
elsewhere internally. But it's fascinating times, and we are one of the companies that is quite actively
pursuing ideas in the industry and making sure we keep up with the flow of change.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And I'd just add that exactly, Matt, take a lot for us to want to take on something else before we
digest this one, but you never know. I mean it was -- you're very intentional about keeping a -- having dry
powders in case something else just came up, but the bar is probably a little bit higher on any big deals,

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

but we've also said that we continue to -- we want to grow our high net worth business. And as Matt said,
if there's something that's sort of distribution-related, which tends to be more on the technology side that
we're always looking at those. And then we stay in the flow in the industry because we think the industry
is changing pretty dramatically.

Craig William Siegenthaler
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just as my follow-up on flows, we've seen this really strong migration into fixed income in the U.S. and
then you have a much stronger bond business now with the addition of Brandywine and Western, but your
flows were a little bit negative in the quarter due to global bond. Do you expect the bond migration to
continue for the industry even though yields are very low? And then if you do think it will continue, do you
think Franklin as a company can start to participate just as all the pieces start working together?

Gregory Eugene Johnson
Executive Chairman

Yes. I mean, this is Greg. I would say that you really have to separate out between what Western is
doing on U.S. fixed income side. We've seen a lot of strength in areas like munis. We think that's going to
continue as state rates and possibly federal rates go up. So I think that's very positive. Obviously, rates
declined mostly over the period. So any duration and even credit worked very well, and that's really why
Western stood out. And it'd be a very strong quarter for flows if you just looked at our U.S. fixed income
at $5.5 billion or so of inflows for the quarter. It just gets masked by what is happening on the global
bond side, which really is a category that is very different from the traditional fixed income buyer. And as
Jenny said earlier, I look at the categories and any spike in rates, any contraction in spreads and credit,
we saw that a little bit. We saw that in September. We may see that continuing a bit. And I think that will
help global bond. At the end of the day, any asset category, like, especially global bond competes with
everything else and the returns when you compare U.S. equities and just straight U.S. fixed, it doesn't
look very attractive, I think it can look pretty attractive fairly quickly if you have any kind of move up in
rates, and that's really why we think this is a nice balance to the overall portfolio.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I guess, the first question, Matt. Can you kind of -- maybe just want to understand the tax guidance, in
the 26% rate, which I know you mentioned [indiscernible] compared to kind of the 22% or so that kind
of we're expecting. Should we still expect 22% on an adjusted basis? Or is -- should we use 26% as the
baseline understanding that kind of bounce around from there? I mean, how should we think of that?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

I'd use 26% as the baseline. I mean the business -- our business has changed in terms of -- we've got
a greater portion of our business in the U.S., the higher tax rate, and there are a couple of jurisdictions
internationally where the tax rates have gone up a little bit. So that impacts our overall tax view. So I
think I would use 26% with a view that maybe it could be 25%, but I think 26% is a good number to
put in the model for that. The fourth quarter was confusing. We had a spike in that rate because of the
reasons we mentioned in the prepared remarks. It was just very unusual that spiked it up to 36%. 36%.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Great. And maybe just going back out towards the fee rate guidance. So the 36% to 38% is kind of a fully
consolidated basis. And are you thinking that kind of over kind of the '20 -- fiscal 2021? Or is it kind of
longer term and unlike kind of a exit run rate basis, adjusted, I guess, the 38% change in the quarter,
adjusted for the 2 months of Legg. Is that [indiscernible]?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The...

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

[indiscernible] run rate?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, the 36% to 38% is assuming a full year, so that's the full 12 months combination, if you will. We
think that's a good guide based on, obviously, the very significant mix of business change. So with a much
bigger fixed income business and much bigger institutional business, both that lower fee rates versus
legacy Franklin Templeton, which brings that down. But at the same time, there is opportunity there in the
alternative side where the fee rate is quite a bit higher, and we see some interesting growth opportunities
there.

So you have global bond being -- global bond higher rate being offset by lower rate broader fixed income
business core, core plus institutional. That's what brings it down and then pressure upwards, if you will, is
the growth for the alternative business. So we hope we're on the higher end of it, but we think that's the
natural range for the year.

Operator

Our next question is going to come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just a follow-up on one more question just in terms of the assumptions for your guidance. Do the fee rates
assume any level of performance fees? And if so, kind of what's the baseline? Also, as you think about
your expense guidance and the fee rate guidance you gave, what is the market assumptions that you were
using? Was it flat? Was there some modest growth?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

So we assume flat. We don't assume any market growth in our projections, one. Two, that the fees do not
include performance fee. The average fee rate projection does not include performance fees.

We expect our performance fees to actually go up. They were $10 million for this quarter from 0 last
quarter stand-alone FT. We start to enjoy a larger percentage of performance fees from Clarion after April
next year. So that provides an opportunity, we share 50-50 performance fees with them today, whereas
today, we don't get any. It's 50% on our 83% ownership in Clarion.

So that's an opportunity to get more performance fees. So -- and in previous times, last quarter was
unusual. We had no performance fees from Benefit Street, but we expect that to pick up, for example,
this quarter, it went from $0 to $4 million. We got $6 million from the Legg Mason side, and it wouldn't
surprise us to see that go up quite a bit in 2021.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then in terms of the known redemptions, you called out $3 billion in the prepared comments.
But we also then highlighted that it was not related to the transaction. So I guess what gives you
confidence around that? And then just curious about other potential disruptions that might -- you might
see or have heard about coming from either just normal course of business or the acquisition?

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

President, CEO & Director

So I have to say just on the -- from the Legg Mason standpoint, Legg Mason was a positive flow in
September. They have a much bigger institutional business. So you have lumpier redemption. I think
that's going to be more characteristic than we've seen historically. But we basically haven't seen
redemptions related to any of this transaction. The bigger redemptions have tended to be Franklin
Templeton, as we said, that one that we called out was a low fee sub-advised relationship. There are some
where you're seeing sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East who are redeeming larger numbers for
-- not for investment performance, not for a transaction, just because it's sort of what's going on in the
market right now. So we are optimistic from the standpoint of the integration and how things are going
with clients, but you're always going to have -- we still have the issues on performance in a couple of
areas like global macro, obviously, value. The value index has underperformed 3200 basis points year to
date. So there are some people that are just willing to throw in the talent value. Others were thinking
maybe it's time to -- that, that can switch. So those are always going to be, to the extent they're on the
institutional side, a little bit more lumpy.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

But as a general matter, obviously, we'd rather have no outflows, $12.6 billion, it's not like we're pleased
about $12.6 billion of outflows. But when you think about it, the $12.6 billion is very consistent with
Franklin Templeton's stand-alone outflows from the previous quarter and both last quarter and the quarter
before that. So the percentage attrition across the firm has come down a lot. And it's driven by exactly the
same things that we're -- that are really market-driven, if you think about positioning of those strategies.
And the all-weather point that Jenny has made a few times is an important one in this regard because we
do have some very important strategies under the hood here that we'll do well if the market starts to get
more difficult again. And I'd also say that out of our $11.5 billion of sort of unfunded wins that we have,
we would expect something like $5 billion or so of that to come in, in the December quarter.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.

Michael J. Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just on the multi-asset front, you guys have combined QS with the Franklin Templeton multi-asset
solutions group to create the stand-alone multi-asset solution platform. Just hoping you could talk a
little bit more about the strategy there, what you're most excited about, how you're thinking about the
opportunity set? And then just a follow-up there would be just as you look across the organization entirely,
where else could it make sense maybe over time to think about bringing together some of the investment
teams from Franklin Templeton and Legg to create a similar sort of combined businesses and investment
teams?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

So on the QS and [ SEMAS ], very much a -- kind of the teams got together and really thought about it,
talked about it and said, we could be much stronger together. So this is really kind of organically coming
from those teams.

Today, that combined organization has 120 investment professionals and $120 billion in assets. But what I
think intrigued them on why it made sense for them to come to [ that ] first with QS with an institutional
kind of quant manager, they had a strong track record and things like liability-driven investments, active
quant risk mitigation. Whereas on the Franklin's side, while there was quant capability, it was much more
of really sort of active manager active allocations. And when they -- and they have their own outside
manager due diligence. So in bringing them together, you really bring in those hybrid kind of quant and
active. And when you think about the way the world is going, whether it's models in retail outcome or
models in the retail channel or risk overlay of separately managed accounts, the clients are looking for

being able to have a conversation, almost like an OCIO type of conversation as they're trying to think
through how to build their portfolios, how to position their portfolio. And this just gives us tremendous
capability around that. And we think that, that's sort of the way the future goes.

Gregory Eugene Johnson
Executive Chairman

And I would just add, I mean, I think it -- also from a client service and institutional accounts, having
that capability and just the value-added side of the -- looking at risk overlays and LDIs opening up new
channels like insurance, for us, it just increases the toolbox that we can offer to clients and hopefully,
deepen the relationships. And I also take this as an example. It's the one example of scale, where you
have a large organization, it's bringing all that expertise into one and then hopefully, leveraging that with
clients. We think that's very exciting.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

And just to answer your other part of the question about do we see opportunities to bring other groups
together. We are not focused on merging products together. That is not part of this deal. And as a matter
of fact, you just -- you talk to our CIO of global fixed income and CIO of Western, and they have different
views on sort of the timing on whether or not we'll see inflation or interest rates rise in the long end
of that on the curve. And that's what an all-weather product lineup is, it's that ability to have different
products for different outcomes. And we think that's very healthy. Our distribution team has been selling
equities where, arguably, 2 different managers competing in the same category, you have to have the best
distribution team so they have to be able to discern what the client is looking for and either deliver up 1
option or decide that you're going to answer the RFP with 2 different options in the same category. We've
been very comfortable with that on the equity side. I can say that now we just added that capability on
the fixed income side.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.

William Raymond Katz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So I guess I'm not sure Jenny and Matt yourself, just coming back to your fiscal '21 expense guidance
of $3.7 billion. What kind of sort of G&A assumptions are you playing -- plugging into that number? Just
trying to get a sense of what you're thinking about in terms of normal around travel, entertainment sort of
things that are probably depressed given the COVID-19 backdrop?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

In 2021?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes...

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

I'm going to leave that to Matt.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

The -- so I would say that we built in a sense of again, maybe this is sort of optimistic from my
perspective, but we're building a sense of normalization in beginning that -- in March next year. But we've

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

also built in more in terms of advertising, promotion, these sorts of things that you'd expect us to do as
we've been working on our distribution client franchise.

So our G&A, we have forecasted for about $485 million for the year, which is a healthy number and allows
us to continue to invest in a number of important things and does allow for travel to go back to some form
of normality after the first annualized quarter next year.

William Raymond Katz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I noticed you started to repurchase some stock in the
quarter. So how do you counterbalance sort of reinvesting back into the business versus the return of cash
to investors versus your commentary that we're just in the beginning stages of an M&A evolution?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So you can see when you look at our balance sheet, in fact, we -- last quarter, we ended at $8.2
billion or so on the cash and investments. We now have $5.1 billion cash investments. It's still quite
healthy underpinning to give us confidence to use our income and our income already with just 2 months
of Legg Mason in there is pretty significantly enhanced. So I think what we plan to do at a minimum with
respect to share repurchases and make sure that we offset all of our share grants and then obviously,
we're very focused on the dividend and making -- and you know our history there, and you can expect
that to continue, subject to our Board approving in December, the capital management policy, and then
we have already multiple new requests internally, given the new breadth of our firm to consider co-
investments, seek capital opportunities, other internal growth opportunities. And what I would say is that
as we reach the end, either of a quarter or a year even, we then may do some top-ups in terms of some
additional share repurchases if we don't feel pressure elsewhere.

We also have a higher debt load, as you know now. And we successfully accessed the market earlier this
month, as Jenny mentioned, and we intend to use the proceeds there to refinance much more expensive
notes. We're going to actually save about $30 million on that.

But having said that, if rates stay where they are, maybe we just refinance our notes going forward, and
we expect the current debt load, assuming that our EBITDA stays about the same, because we want to
keep our current credit profile intact. But if rates stay where they are, if rates get more expensive or the
debt market is unattractive, maybe we delever some as well with our cash. So it's really a combination
of those things. And at the end of the day, if we have capacity to buyback more shares given our current
valuation, we'll do it.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just a couple of clarifications at this point. Matthew, on the expense guidance, can you help us with some
sensitivity to revenue assumptions? So I know you said you guys are assuming generally flat markets
in your expense guide for '21. But if the markets were to be higher, can you help us understand kind of
what's the sensitivity to that $3.7 billion with the kind of normalized market returns?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think the $3.7 billion, given the fact that's an adjusted number, of course, the GAAP number could
be higher or lower because that includes S&D, but I'd say, as an adjusted number, that's a disciplined
number that we have some comfort in that, that if the markets go up, it'll still be $3.7 billion. That's sort
of how I would describe it. If the markets come down, it could come down. But I don't see us going up
beyond the $3.7 billion.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. And just another question, I guess, around capital management. Given the valuation on the stock
currently and the free cash flow generation of the business, can you help us understand the framework
around making another acquisition, whether it's something small on the distribution side or kind of
continuously building out the RIA channel, the high net worth channel versus buying back Franklin stock at
these levels?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, yes. Look, I think it's a great question because obviously, the bar for us has to be quite high, given
the fact that every dollar we're buying back of our stock is like buying back 6% dividend yield. So we're
quite focused on that. We won't be doing large stock deals based on our current multiple and dilute.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Oh, yes. To put the high bar. Yes, yes. So yes, we have a high bar for the reasons that I just mentioned
on our stock. And we're not going to do a large transaction using our stock and assets for the same kind
of multiple. But the way I've said is that in wealth management, we think it's a very good use of our
cash because we did 2 smaller transactions. They both ended up being accretive to us in terms of the
execution around that, gave us a little bit of cost savings, revenue growth, it all works out quite well. So
in wealth, there'd be much smaller transactions that we use to continue to grow fiduciary trust. It's on the
alternative asset side that we have to think. There are some interesting opportunities out there and that
would be where we would use our cash and not our stock. So that's how I'd describe that.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.

Christopher Meo Harris
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So you highlighted the momentum you've been seeing in alternatives, but there are some concerns about
real estate as an asset class generally, particularly commercial real estate. So how is Clarion positioned to
deal with the downturn that we're seeing in that particular area?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

So Clarion is overweight industrial. So that area has done very, very well. And if e-commerce demand
goes up, the Amazon needs more storage. And so -- and there's more demand on cloud and things. And
that's an area that they have focused on, and they were really underweight on some of the commercial
real estate. So they are actually performing, they're very, very well positioned right now with the
performance.

Christopher Meo Harris
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just one quick one on the expenses. I know we've got some noise here because Legg was
revenue and profit share and Franklin is more of the traditional model. So if we look at the aggregate
expense base, what is the addressable cost base, if you will? In other words, what are these synergies
being net of -- because I know we probably shouldn't be looking at the entire expense base and we're
more considering that.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

No, no, I think you should. I think you should look at it against the $3.7 million that we've guided for
2021. I know it's very early guidance. But I think it's correct to think of that as being addressable.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just 2 follow-ups. So Matt, given a lot of moving parts with expenses, I'm going to strip you have like a
fiscal 1Q starting point for the adjusted expense level, given the 25% of synergies realized by the end
of September and then the full impact of Legg. And then any color on just the timing of when we should
expect the 85% during the year?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Yes. So the -- on the 85%, I'd say we've made good progress so far. I think we've mentioned that we
already achieved 25% of it by 9/30. We expect to achieve 50% by, we said year-end, but that's probably
going to be more like the end of January. And then I would say the rest of it or the 35% that's left, we
hope to get most of it by June, but there'll be some carefully managed expense reductions on the front
office side, in particular, that we've wanted to spend more time executing upon to make sure we have
that continuity in stability around the group that we've discussed. So I think it's fair to say that we, again,
we've got the 25% done end of January, we get the 50% and maybe we get 75% by the end of June. And
then the rest up to 85% by the end of our fiscal year.

In terms of a normalized -- in terms of normalized, I mean, I think one -- maybe it's useful to walk
through the revenue and expenses associated with what we bought on from Legg Mason. So Legg Mason
2 months was about $475 million of revenue if you include sales and distribution fees. If you exclude sales
and distribution fees, it's about $415 million. So that sort of annual -- quarterize, if you will, into about
$700 million to $720 million or $2.85 billion on an annualized level in terms of revenue. And the expenses,
as you said, it's a bit of a noisy quarter, to say the least, with all the acquisition-related expenses. But if
you exclude the nonrecurring acquisition-related expense items, it was about -- just the Legg Mason 2
months was about $350 million, inclusive of sales and distribution. Excluding that, it's about $280 million.
So I think about it as being -- if you include sales and distribution, it's $475 million minus $350 million
equals $125 million times 6 is $750 million, that's a good one way of looking at it. If you exclude sales
and distribution, it's $415 million minus $280 million is $135 million times 6 is $810 million. So you could
look at it as that, we're adding to, Franklin, including the cost saves that aren't included in those numbers.
Because remember, in the overlay, we haven't included the additional run rate that we expect to achieve
during the year. So maybe -- I think, well, that helps. But if you think about that as being an addition on
top of our business.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. And then one just clarification on the fee rate. Just when I look at the quarter, the
38%, it seems like that was a little lower than expected from like the pro formas. And then even with
Franklin stand-alone around 50. And then if I think about the outlook of the 36% to 38%, if that includes
like another month of Legg, it seems like that's not much of an impact relative to the 38, but I wasn't sure
if there was just something else either impacting this quarter or impacting like the run rate.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

No, nothing in particular. We've modeled it out, and we think they're good guidance.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just one -- most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just 1 follow-up on the capacity
for deals if you're doing them in cash, Matt, like you said, the -- I know it's $5.1 billion in cash and
investments. What do you view as cash available for acquisitions within that? And then also additional debt
capacity, if you should think about what type of cash level you'd be able to do with it?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's probably out of the cash, you see, it's probably $1 billion. Because again, we're quite
conservative. We like to make sure we have the -- as you know, we call it supplemental liquidity, and we
intend to keep that in place. So we're disciplined around that. And so that's how we -- that's probably
what -- if you're looking for an excess cash number that we would consider to be excess, it will be that. In
terms of -- other people would maybe double that number and define it as that, but we wouldn't.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

In terms of debt capacity, our absolute intention and focus is to make sure that we maintain our current
credit profile, which is AA2 rating. As you know, we just accessed the debt markets, and we're very
pleased with our rating and that transaction, and we intend to retain that profile and operate the company
and our capital structure in a way that's consistent with that.

So our debt capacity at that level, we probably have some capacity, and we don't intend to push our limits
whatsoever with the rating agencies without that investors, given what we've described to them. So we're
quite focused on that. The technical capacity to investment-grade is very, very substantial in terms of
debt, but we don't intend to use that.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then, Jenny, just if you could talk a little bit about ESG. Obviously, Legg's
managers had some good traction, certainly at ClearBridge and also Western and also a few other
affiliates. How are you thinking about integrating that through Franklin? Are you thinking about
centralizing that ESG process and leveraging that across the totality of platforms or leaving the ESG
capabilities within the individual managers?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

So with respect to ESG, we think that the framework in which you apply ESG is specific to the investment
team. But the data, we're a member of FASB and trying to get a lot more standardization around the
data. We've actually created a centralized ESG database. So as various teams, if you take our global
macro team, they get 14 different data feeds to build their ESG framework. That data then goes into this
centralized ESG database. Any of the investment teams are welcome to use it as they build their own
framework and model. But we really are working hard with FASB in the industry and Greg participates in
the IPI and ESG and trying to just standardize a lot of the information that people look at and measure to
build their framework. But to answer your question, we think that it is part of the -- fundamentally part of
the investment process.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

All right. That makes sense. And may I squeeze in 1 more quick one?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, you can...

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

[indiscernible] full pitch. Our Franklin municipal green bond Fund is 9 percentile year-to-date, which is our
ESG and the main area. We segued great demand for these [indiscernible]

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

No, that's great. Just on that 97% employment acceptance. Was that in line with what you were thinking,
I guess? And were there any significant nonacceptances from either PMs or key leaders in that 3%?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

So again, that was the focus on holding company and distribution. And I think when we set out, we
weren't sure what percentage of the Legg Mason employees, and I think we ended up both on distribution
and on the holding company making a lot more Legg Mason [indiscernible]. And I think you really could

see that it's a combination of both groups. And no, there was no specific one that we felt like we really
missed. And you were not talking about investment people.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

So Jenny, I think -- sorry, yes, go ahead.

Operator

Our last question for the day will come from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.

Patrick Davitt
Autonomous Research LLP

Yes, that was -- Brian just asked my question. So thanks.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Great. Well, listen, I think I just want to thank everybody for participating in today's call. And just want to
leave you guys with what I thought. What we knew from the beginning has only been further crystallized
as -- and that is that our 2 organizations are really incredibly opined in terms of strategic fit, culture and
our shared focus on delivering strong investment results for our clients. And we look forward to continuing
to stay at the forefront of our industry. And again, keeping that balance sheet flexibility as things evolve.
But really providing unparalleled investment choice and service to our clients.

So thank you, everybody, for participating and be safe out there.
