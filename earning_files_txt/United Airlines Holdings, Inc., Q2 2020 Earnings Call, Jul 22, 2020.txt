UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning and welcome to United Airlines Holdings' Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter
of 2020. My name is Brandon, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. [Operator Instructions] This call
is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed
or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording
of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line. I will now turn the presentation
over to your host for today's call, Kristina Munoz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Kristina Munoz
Senior Manager of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website at
ir.united.com.

Information in yesterday's release and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-
looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future
events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently
available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our
current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed
with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these
factors.

Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a
reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer
to the tables at the end of our earnings release.

Joining us on the call today to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Scott Kirby;
President, Brett Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition, we have other members
of the executive team on the line available to assist with Q&A.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Thanks, Kristina, and thank you all for joining our call today. This obviously is not the environment that I
expected for my first call as CEO. But I have to say that I've never been more proud than I am as a team
at United, and I want to thank everyone for their leadership, support and dedication to the company that
we all love during what is the most difficult time any of us had experienced, both for our airline and our
families.

Our frontline hasn't allowed dramatic reduction in our schedules or headlines about potential furloughs
or new mass requirements to interfere with their commitment to taking care of our customers and each
other. In fact, our customer satisfaction scores in June improved nearly 30 points year-over-year. There's
just no better evidence of our determined commitment to care for our customers and keep them safe.
It's what being united together is all about. And Brett will talk in some more detail about how our core 4
values have informed our industry-leading commitment to safety of our customers and employees.

The second quarter of 2020 was historic for the airline industry for all the wrong reasons. At the beginning
of April, we saw the sharpest, deepest drop in demand in history, far worse than 9/11 or the Great
Recession or any other stress test scenario that anyone had modeled. And near the end of the quarter,
just as optimism about a recovery was beginning to build, we watched demand fade once again as
COVID-19 spiked in the Sun Belt.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

But we'll make it through this crisis. And I've never been more confident that we will make it through this
crisis. I think we'll look back on the second quarter of 2020 as an extraordinary 3-month period filled with
achievement that I wasn't -- that we weren't even sure were possible when we started back in April.

We can't control the course of the pandemic, though we are doing our part to help by leading with safety.
And the United team has been doing an exceptional job of controlling what we can and generating what
we expect will be the best or in this case, least bad financial results of any of our network competitors.

Some of the achievements this quarter included the fastest, most realistic and accurate assessment of the
demand environment; completing the largest debt financing in the history of the airline business backed
by our loyalty program; dramatically reducing our cost structure; and implementing a variety of industry-
leading measures designed to protect our customers and employees from the spread of the coronavirus.

While some of you have noted that previous strengths, including our high exposure to international and
business demand will create larger headwinds for United, those of you who've joined these calls will --
before will not be surprised to hear that our no excuses philosophy is not suspended just because times
are tough. In fact, that philosophy is more important than ever in times of adversity, and it has served us
well because in spite of what could have been easily explainable excuses, the United team pulled together
to overcome them and we expect to deliver the best financial results to the network carrier.

As Andrew and Gerry will discuss in more detail, we expect that our realistic, smart and opportunistic
commercial strategy backed by a dynamic and thriving cargo business, combined with other dramatic
cost-cutting across our company, resulted in United losses and daily cash burn being lower than either of
our network competitors in the second quarter. And that's important because as we've discussed before,
minimizing the depth of the hole we dig in this crisis is critical to preparing United to thrive on the other
side.

I look forward to the day where we're past the pandemic and can stop talking about cash burn. But the
country, the world and aviation are where we are right now. I remain confident that the virus will be
defeated. And when it is, I'm very bullish about our future because I believe the current headwinds related
to international and business travel will once again returning to being important and unique strategic
advantage for United Airlines. And if we can produce leading financial results, even with these larger
headwinds right now, just imagine what we'll do in a healthier operating environment.

My recap of the second quarter would not be complete if I didn't mention how conversations about
confronting systemic racism reverberated through our society, including here at United, like never before.
As a company, we'll have much more to say and more importantly do on this topic in the future. But for
now, let me reiterate that I'm personally committed to using the influence and visibility of my new role at
United to put our values, especially our commitment to equity and inclusion, into action.

Now if you've doubted just how busy Q2 was for United, let me remind you that we also named Brett Hart
as our new President. Brett's been a trusted colleague, valued adviser and a good friend since I joined
United almost 4 years ago. He's been a widely respected leader at United for much longer than that.
It's my honor to introduce him as my partner for the first time on an earnings call in his new role as our
President. Brett, over to you.

Brett J. Hart
President, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel

Thanks, Scott, for that kind introduction. I also appreciate your long-term commitment to action on
diversity, equity and inclusion. And I'm excited about how our partnership can bring about meaningful and
lasting change at United and in the communities we serve.

Let me begin by saying how proud I am of what our team has accomplished over the last few months
in the face of near-zero demand for air travel back in April. While we have a long road ahead of us, we
believe the $16.1 billion of liquidity we have raised since the start of the crisis and our dramatic reduction
in cash burn have set us up to not only survive this crisis but to emerge in a position of strength during
the recovery.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Throughout this crisis, we have never lost sight of the fact that the very first pillar of our core4 is and
always will be safety. With this guiding principle, we have introduced a number of industry-leading safety
measures to do our part to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and to protect our employees and
customers, including requiring all flight attendants and passengers to wear masks, asking all passengers
to complete a health assessment during check-in, offering customers the option to change flights for free
if their flight is expected to be at least 70% full and partnering with Clorox and the Cleveland Clinic, just to
name a few.

Along with our unwavering commitment to safety, at the very outset of the pandemic, our former CEO
and current Chairman, Oscar Munoz, and Scott made it clear that our #1 priority was to preserve as many
United jobs as possible for the long term. To this end, very early in the crisis, we began efforts to reduce
our nonlabor expenses and eliminate any discretionary or nonessential project spend.

I want to thank our over 26,000 team members who have all contributed to reducing our expenses
through early separation program, voluntary unpaid leave programs or reduced work schedule. Our
voluntary separation and retirement programs are almost closed. And so far, over 6,000 employees have
opted to participate. At a time of unprecedented uncertainty, these contributions by our employees were
one of the most meaningful actions that could be taken.

Unfortunately, this crisis has lasted longer and become worse than most experts anticipated. And so these
efforts, while meaningful and appreciated, simply are not enough and only get us a small step of the way
there. We are left to make some of the most difficult decisions in the history of United Airlines, specifically
on the size of our workforce.

On October 1, we are planning to be a smaller team and airline in response to the depressed demand
environment. Transparency and candor in a situation like this, where no one is at fault, is the most core4
thing we can do for our team. We have been in active communication with our unions to identify voluntary
programs that could mitigate furloughs. In this uncertain world, giving our United team members a choice
as much as we can is an important element of our strategy.

These voluntary programs will be balanced offers, which reduce labor costs while providing flexibility to
our team and to United so that when demand returns, and it will return, we have the jobs and the people
ready to go and can avoid as many involuntary furloughs as possible. While this unprecedented health
crisis has changed the way we operate, that hasn't changed the commitment our employees have to
running a great airline. As part of the leadership team, we will continue our promise to do everything in
our power to preserve as many jobs as we can for the people of United.

With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue environment. Andrew?

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Brett. The second quarter was clearly the most difficult quarter in United's history. We acted
quickly and decisively to confront demand changes. In fact, our change in total revenue in the quarter of
down 87% winded up being consistent with our total capacity being down 88%. Our network peers flow
more capacity than United, and we believe our careful management of capacity, pricing and cargo during
the quarter is the primary driver of our good results relative to our network peers in terms of absolute
losses and cash burn.

We feel as good as we can about these relative results. In a world of limited demand, driving our cash
burn down is absolutely a function of the amount of capacity we offer. We clearly have a long way to go as
we navigate COVID-19, but we got off to a relatively good start.

At the start of the pandemic, many feared our outsized exposure to business traffic, international traffic
and our coastal hubs would have been of a drag on performance relative to other network carriers, but
this was not the case as we made smart decisions about capacity. We'll not be focusing on market share
during the worst financial crisis the industry has ever faced. Instead, our focus is on ending cash burn and
returning United to profitability.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

As we look towards an eventual recovery, international demand will be slower to recover than domestic.
When international demand does recover, we believe United's coastal gateway hub will recover quicker
than others, a benefit of having the best U.S. gateways to start with.

Orders are up around the world now, and international revenue is low. We believe at United that we have
already felt the worst of the international passenger revenue decline impact. Borders will open someday,
and we believe United is well positioned to experience the fastest international revenue growth when they
do.

Corporate traffic, which was down 96% in June, will also be slower to come back than leisure, but we
believe it will. We are social creatures. Video technology is proved as a reasonable temporary measure,
but we do not expect it to replace meeting in person over the long term. In fact, we have a hypothesis
that more work-from-home employees may drive increased business travel over the medium term as
some people trade their commutes by cars for less frequent commuting by airplane from a remote
location.

In the short term, we will make appropriate adjustments to our network to reflect less business traffic by
putting a higher proportion of our capacity into leisure and visiting family and relatives market. We expect
the recovery in demand to be jagged. Everyone has a view what the recovery will look like, but we'll not
pretend to be able to predict the path of the virus. We do expect that demand recovery, which stalled in
recent weeks, will begin to recover again when new cases start to fall, quarantines are lifted and borders
are reopened.

However, we continue to believe a full recovery is contingent upon effective therapeutics and a vaccine.
Our best guess is demand, as measured by revenue, will recover over time to be down approximately 50%
and then plateau at that level until a vaccine is widely distributed.

We discovered how disruptive the virus could be to demand very early on in this pandemic, and we
used those learnings to shape our near-term capacity decisions. For April and May, we reduced capacity
approximately 85%. We also temporarily reduced our average seats per departure in May and June by
23%, which lowered our trip costs, helping us conserve cash while the CARES Act Payroll Support Program
supported the salaries of the United team.

In each of our mid-continent hubs, we came up with an entirely new schedule while maintaining the
comprehensive network and sufficient connectivity. Domestic PRASM in Q2 was down by 47%. We did see
steady progress throughout the quarter as our schedule changes were implemented and demand began a
slow but steady rebound. Domestic PRASM performance in June improved to be down only 15%, reflecting
an improved demand outlook even as we are deploying multiple actions to minimize flights operating
above 70% load factors.

We [ updated ] 66 flights per day in June, restricted inventory in flights booked above 70% and blocked
certain seats from sale. While we have very high confidence in the safety onboard our aircraft, we
continue to deploy multiple actions to manage high load factor flights to increase customer confidence.

Our approach for international wide-body long-haul flying has been to leverage our cargo capabilities to
partially offset declines in passenger revenues. For the quarter, international ASMs were down 92%, but
we maintained passenger service throughout the crisis to Australia, Japan, Brazil and multiple points in
Europe, even with increasingly restrictive border policies. We also operated over 3,800 all-cargo charter
flights in the quarter, which contributed to our over 36% improvement in cargo revenue in the quarter,
while our competitors saw their cargo revenue decline. The United cargo team clearly hit a home run in
the quarter, and cargo is on track to have another great quarter.

The recent uptick in COVID cases in late June and early July have temporarily stalled demand
improvements we were seeing in June. Third quarter domestic capacity is expected to be down at least
55%. Domestic RASM results for United in July and August will clearly not be as good as late June, given
industry dynamics, stalled demand and our own capacity increases.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

United's August schedule is already adjusted downwards the other week given recent changes in demand
and our September schedule is still not finalized. Domestic load factors in the coming weeks are expected
to average just below half full, a reduction from the 57% we saw in June.

In the event customers are booked on flights that are above 70%, we will continue to let them know in
advance and offer an alternative flight at no additional fee if they'd like to make a change. We expect
that passenger revenue in the third quarter will fall approximately 83% versus Q2 of down 93.5% with
consolidated capacity expected to be down approximately 55%. Just a few weeks ago, prior to the case
spike, we had expected revenues in the quarter to be down less than 80%.

With the end of the Payroll Support Program, our marginal costs will increase later this year, and that will
impact how much incremental capacity we can add in most -- post summer, if any. However, given a look
at industry dynamics, we expect to have the most conservative deployment of third quarter capacity of
anyone.

My update on past earning calls reported on United's progress on an array of commercial and commercial
customer initiatives. We can't be sure that every aspect of our past commercial and commercial plans will
be relevant in the future. But our team is agile and we're ready to respond to an ever-changing world. We
have proven that over the past few years and we'll prove it again over the next few. Thanks to the entire
United team. Your dedication in these difficult times will allow us to come out of this period strong.

And with that, I will turn it over to Gerry. Thanks.

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Andrew. For the second quarter of 2020, we reported a pretax loss of $2 billion and an adjusted
pretax loss of $3.2 billion. These results represent how this global pandemic continues to materially
disrupt our business in unprecedented ways and therefore, requires unprecedented responses to ensure
we come out of the crisis as strong as possible.

Since the start of the crisis, we focused on aggressive cost-cutting to minimize our daily cash burn and
aggressively pursued opportunities to bolster our liquidity position. Since March, we have raised a total
of $16.1 billion of additional liquidity, largely through debt offerings, stock issuances and the CARES Act
Payroll Support Program grant and loan. Included in our capital raising actions was the truly first-of-its-
kind debt financing using our MileagePlus program, which brought in $6.8 billion in liquidity.

Working with Goldman Sachs, our lead underwriter, we were able to formulate an innovative structure that
allowed us to unlock some of the inherent value in the program. We were able to achieve our key objective
of raising a substantial amount of liquidity at attractive interest rates in a manner which doesn't impair our
flexibility to use MileagePlus to support our business going forward.

I certainly appreciate comments made by one of my peers recently who recognize that this structure
will serve as a model for the use of loyalty programs to raise liquidity by the industry in the future. We
continue to target over $18 billion in available liquidity by the end of the third quarter. We believe this
level of liquidity will position us to manage the airline well if the crisis continues to depress demand far
into 2021 and even beyond, depending on the pace of recovery.

While we view this as enough liquidity, should we desire to raise additional liquidity, we have at least
$9 billion of available collateral value, excluding both MileagePlus and the collateral we expect to hold
available for our CARES Act loan and this additional collateral, we can borrow again, subject, of course, to
market conditions.

Having built up a substantial cash cushion, we will continue to make every effort to preserve our liquidity
until we are out of the crisis. Through the hard work of our employees across the business, we reduced
our second quarter average daily cash burn to $40 million, including approximately $3 million of principal
payments and severance expenses, ending up at the low end of our original second quarter guidance
range.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Over the last 3 months, we have reduced our total operating expenses, excluding special charges, by
54% and eliminated all sources of discretionary spend. What is left is simply what is absolutely needed to
operate the airline and nothing more. We also significantly reduced our adjusted capital expenditures since
the crisis began and have paused all investments that didn't have an immediate return.

In fact, we now expect our 2020 adjusted capital expenditures to be approximately $3.7 billion, down
from our previous guidance of less than $4.5 billion and of course, down from the $7 billion we originally
forecasted before the crisis. We continue to take delivery of new aircraft only when financing is available,
and we've come to an agreement with Boeing that we will not be taking delivery of any new aircraft in
2022.

Our team is working tirelessly to examine how we can further variabilize our cost structure to ensure that
we come out as a stronger industry player once the pandemic ends. One area we do continue to look at
is our overall fleet. We currently have close to 600 aircraft temporarily grounded. While we do not have
anything specific to announce on aircraft retirements at this time, our priority is to remain agile.

Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect our average daily cash burn in the third quarter to be
approximately $25 million with $6 million representing debt principal payments and severance expenses.
This cash burn estimate assumes passenger revenue is down around 83% for the quarter.

As we look to the fourth quarter and next year, nobody had good visibility on the pace of demand
improvement. As a result, our primary focus will continue to be minimizing cash burn for the foreseeable
future. Unfortunately, this means that we will need to bring all of our costs in line with our reduced
revenue, including labor costs. And this has led to the difficult but necessary decision to reduce the size of
our workforce in the fourth quarter.

We believe that when demand returns, based on the work the entire United team has accomplished in
cutting costs to respond to the crisis, we will be in the best position to reach cash burn breakeven, which
we expect will be in an environment where demand and capacity are down around 50%. We will let you all
make your own forecast as to when that will happen.

In closing, I will reiterate that there is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty ahead. But we believe that
United is in a position of strength to manage through what we expect to be a jagged recovery.

And with that, I will turn it over to Kristina to start the Q&A.

Kristina Munoz
Senior Manager of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And from Bernstein, we have David Vernon.

David Scott Vernon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So I wanted to ask you about the head count plans. Obviously, the 6,000 employees that have signed
up for the voluntary out is well below the numbers that have been commented on before in terms of
reductions that might be required to rightsize the network. How should we be expecting this to play out
over the course of the next couple of months? I mean, obviously, the CARES loan closes off in September
or the CARES provisions anyway. What can you tell us about sort of the scope of expected actions here
and the timing on when these announcements might be made?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

David, good to talk to you. What I'd say is the 6,000 voluntary, first, I'd like to thank everyone at United,
all the 6,000. And there's another approximately 26,000 people who've taken temporary voluntary
programs at United so far. So thank all of them for their selfless action and doing what they can to help
United and their fellow coworkers get through this. It's a testament to how much people care about this
company in doing the right thing.

But look, I think of it as there's 32,000 people so far who've raised their hands and taken a voluntary
program. We are still working with some of our other unions as well. So I expect if we get those deals
done, we will have opportunity to have any more. But at least I think of it as that 32,000 number is
probably the more relevant metric because some of those are temporary.

And look, we know that there's going to be a recovery. And if we can keep people temporarily maybe not
on the payroll full time but engaged, connected to the company, certified, trained and ready to bounce
back because the recovery is going to be quick, that's really important to us. So we feel pretty good -- we
feel really good actually about where we are in the voluntary program so far.

David Scott Vernon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

And can you comment on -- I know these are difficult discussions. But as far as kind of the tone and the
tenor and the relationship with labor, can you give us some feel for the status of the relationship there?
Is this -- is it competitive? Is it collaborative? Like how is the tone of the negotiations so far in terms of
mitigating furlough actions and maybe getting some additional help from the labor side to get through
this?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Look, I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the negotiations. But I would say we've been
transparent and honest with everyone from the beginning, including our employees and our labor union
and all of you. And that helps set the foundation.

And this is a situation where our interests are aligned. This is not a traditional kind of adversarial types of
discussions. We all share the goal of getting through what we all know is a temporary crisis and getting to
the other side.

We wish that there was going to be no pain to get through it, but we all now recognize that this pandemic
is deeper, and it's going to last longer than we would have hoped. And because of that, there is going to
be some pain. And so the discussions are about how do we minimize that in the most humane way jointly
with our people. And I feel good -- I feel really good about where we are.

From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth.

Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just in terms of the cash burn improvement sequentially, maybe you could provide some detail there.
So your capacity is up meaningfully and appreciate those capacity plans have a downward bias given
changes in demand. But higher capacity up, call it, 190%, which will drive higher variable costs, and yet
demand feels like it's taken a bit of a step backward. So is this a function of recovery you expect later in
the quarter? Is this cost driven? Or is this all working capital driven?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

It's Gerry. So the short answer is it's a combination of everything. I think you're referring to our prior
guidance, which had third quarter cash burn a little higher than what we're currently expecting. And I
would say, versus when we established that guidance, while demand has taken a turn, it's still a little
higher than what we assumed back then.

We're also doing a nice job on continuing on savings on costs, including -- well, cash costs, so including in
that would be some CapEx that we're saving. So it's sort of a combination of everything that has driven us
to be able to refine our forecast and estimate a lower cash burn than we assumed a few months ago for
the quarter.

Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then just for a follow-up. Appreciate the long-term commentary about sort of plateauing it
down 50% until we get a vaccine. But what is the path from down 83% to down 50%? How do we get
there? Is it you expect corporate to maybe perk up a little bit as we get beyond summer leisure? Or what
is that path from down 83% to down 50% look like? How do we get there?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Yes. Duane, I'll try that. I don't think we know what the exact path will be, and we acknowledge that we
don't know what the exact path will be.

But what I would say is we've been reasonably accurate, very much center of the fairway and forecasting
both the course of the pandemic and the impact of demand so far. And we expect it to be jagged like this.
For what it's worth, I also think that while we took a step back in the last few weeks, as Andrew said,
that has plateaued, I think that we, as a country and a society, have learned some lessons about what we
should do, particularly wearing masks, and that we'll be more up from here.

The kind of demand that I think is going to come back -- but one, also, I think it's important for people to
understand, and I said this earlier on TV today, that an aircraft actually is a uniquely safe environment.
And that is confusing to people because you hear all -- you hear about being in indoor spaces and the
transmission of a virus, but aircraft are designed to have airflow that goes from the ceiling down to the
floor and out. And that air is taken -- either 50% of the air that's coming back into the cabin has been
refiltered through a HEPA-grade filter and 50% is coming from the outside. And that, combined with our
mask policies and our cleaning policies, makes an aircraft a uniquely safe environment.

And so for people that are wanting to go on a business trip or on a vacation or to visit family and relatives,
one of the safest parts of their journey is going to be on an airplane. And that's really important for us
at United and for the industry. To get back to that 50% level, I think we're going to have to get people
understanding that flying somewhere instead of getting in a car and driving for 13 hours, you're safer
actually flying. And I very, very much believe that to be the case.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

And we're taking additional steps announced this week to make sure the whole travel process is safe,
including in the airports or before the engine start on an airplane. All of that, I think, will allow a
reasonable recovery in visiting family and relatives. A lot of other leisure travel is not going to get back to
100%. My guess is I think Disney World sounds like they're doing a great job, but it's not going to be at
100% capacity.

Business demand, I think, will start to come back. The small kind of group stuff will start to come back,
but we're not going to have 180,000 people show up at Consumer Electronics in Las Vegas this January
like they did last January. Those kind of meetings just aren't going to happen. Companies are not going to
have their top 500 salespeople come in every year at the end of the year for a big party and a celebration
until we're past the pandemic and there's a widely available vaccine.

So you add all that up, I think we're going to be on a gradual trajectory from today's level of demand
up to 50%, where we'll plateau. And then I think there'll be a rapid recovery once we get to kind of a
widespread vaccine. I'm not sure how long it takes to get to 50%, but that's a very expansive answer of
how we get to 50%, why we think it will be 50% and what's important to get there.

Operator

From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay.

Hunter Kent Keay
Wolfe Research, LLC

So you had 196 wide-bodies at year-end '19. Knowing what we know now, which admittedly isn't much,
do you think you have more or less than 100 in the fleet at the end of 2023?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Andrew?

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

I guess I'll take that. Scott described how this is going to come back. And by the way, I think our
international gateways are going to come back quicker. And I think our international gateways naturally
have a lot of freight that other gateways don't have, which you see in our numbers, so the answer is
more.

Hunter Kent Keay
Wolfe Research, LLC

More than 100. Okay. Got it.

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes.

Hunter Kent Keay
Wolfe Research, LLC

And then if you fly the same amount of capacity in the fourth quarter as you do in the third quarter, can
you generate more revenue in the fourth quarter than you do in the third quarter, knowing what you know
now about like corporate and VFR mix and all that stuff?

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

What I would say, Hunter, is we're -- we did a pretty good job of it in Q2. We've got a little bit ahead of
ourselves in July, but that's really based on how demand changed and some -- the pricing environment

that we see out there. But I think the answer to your question is yes because we're going to get better
and better at forecasting this.

And we're now getting results in that we're looking at every day about where we're making more and
less money, both domestically and overseas and we're refining the forecast. And we're tilting our capacity
more towards what we'd say VFR market and leisure market, which is also going to help. So I think as we
optimize and refine the schedule, we can continue to push the numbers in the right direction.

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

And Hunter, I want to take a minute to brag on the commercial team. Andrew may not have been as direct
about it. United Airlines and our -- the whole company, but led by our commercial team, has done a better
job, I think, than any airline in the entire world at being -- recognizing what the pandemic has meant
for demand and taking advantage of opportunities where they present themselves, whether that was for
passenger demand.

Andrew mentioned some of the places internationally where they -- we're the only airline flying. Our
cargo team, led by Jan Krems, 36% increase in cargo. I mean who would have ever thought we could do
something like that? And I know some of the stuff that they're working on, that is creative. And I have
confidence that the United team uniquely is going to be able to find opportunities to more appropriately
match capacity to demand but also to uniquely outperform by finding the pockets of demand where there
is real opportunity.

Operator

From Vertical Research Partners, we have Darryl Genovesi.

Darryl J. John Genovesi
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Can you guys just give us a sense -- your OpEx was down 54% in the second quarter. Can you just give
us a sense of how that number paced intra quarter? And then to that end, give us a sense of how you're
thinking about the Q4 cash burn, either in your 50% revenue scenario or in the scenario where nothing
gets better like the framework that you gave with Q1 results?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Gerry?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. For the third quarter, I would say that number is going to be around down 45%, just given where we
are with capacity. Too early to tell going forward until we sort of set capacity beyond the third quarter, but
it gives you kind of a sense of where we are.

Darryl J. John Genovesi
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then, I guess, Gerry, just on the nature of this CapEx change, is this driven by United or is it
more related to slippage on the MAX recertification? And does the $700 million that you're taking out of
2020 now show up in 2021?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

The answer is no. The $700 million does not show up in 2021. It's really 3 things. It's the impact of our
agreement to move aircraft out of 2022. So instead of taking a fair number of MAXs in 2022, we're now
committed to take 0. That has an impact on predelivery deposits.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

There are also a couple of aircraft -- some number of aircraft that were in the capital expenditure forecast
that were Embraer 175s later this year that we now expect will be taken by a regional partner. So that's
out of our CapEx. And then there is also just a little bit of other work done. So that's what brought the
number down.

I would point out that of that $3.7 billion we're now forecasting for the year, about $1 billion of that is
actually the present value of aircraft lease expense. We're taking a fair number of these new aircraft under
operating leases that we are accounting as CapEx, the present value of those leases. That's about it.

But if you factor that out, and you remember that $2 billion of CapEx was spent in the first quarter, so
excluding the leases, our CapEx for the last 9 months of the year is down to about $700 million.

Operator

From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker.

Jamie Nathaniel Baker
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Gerry, can you give us some more clarity on the air traffic liability right now in terms of its composition
and whether there's been any appreciable increase in refund requests following the flattening demand in
the quarantine here in my home state?

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Jamie, it's Andrew. It's just shy of $5 billion. But there are some stats that are -- what's coming in as far
as new revenue and what's coming in as the redemption of EETCs and other instruments like that. And it's
about 2/3 new revenue and 1/3 redemption of previous tickets.

Refunds, as we get further and further into the pandemic, less and less of the booking curve was -- are
booked, obviously, in the past, that's affecting us now. So the refund rates are coming down. And those
numbers, I think, are all kind of moving in the right direction. But roughly a 2/3, 1/3 split and just shy of
$5 billion right now for ATL.

Jamie Nathaniel Baker
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. Second question and probably for Gerry. Now that loyalty has been successfully monetized,
can you share the collateral that you've pledged or believe you will pledge in the event that you draw a
treasury loan? And also, with the remaining unencumbered asset, what looks like, should we draw that
loan?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I expect that we would use as collateral for the CARES Act loan, if we choose to take it and draw
down the available route slots and gates. And so I mentioned that the remaining collateral, not counting
MileagePlus or the pool of routes that we're going to hold available for U.S. Treasury, is at least $9 billion.
And that's a combination of remaining routes, hard assets, equipment and the like as well as equity in
assets that are encumbered but where there's availability of second lien.

I should point out, that does not include some other assets that other airlines have actually used
successfully as collateral. For example, the United brand itself has value. It does not include the brand. It
does not include the value of the domestic hub network. Those are things that have real value. We have
not included those yet, but we do know that since other airlines have used those assets, that would be
available on top of the $9 billion I just described.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Helane R. Becker
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So I have 2 questions. My first question is, when you're looking at your bookings and people who are
actually flying, I know, Scott, I think you said that there wasn't a lot of corporate travel. But are you
seeing that your high-value loyalty customers are flying? Or is it just more one-off customers who may not
be as tied to the airline because they're not loyal members of MileagePlus?

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Helane, it's Andrew. Actually, the good news on that front is we are seeing an ever-increasing rate of
our premier members in the frequent flier program flying again, maybe not for business but for personal
reasons. So they're getting back on an airplane.

Obviously, if you go way back to April, that number was incredibly low. But we're seeing really nice
progress in that front. So it's all moving in the right direction. Is it back to where it was before the crisis
in terms of percentages? No, we do have a higher percentage of nonmembers onboard than we used to.
But that number, to me, looks like it's recovering very nicely as people get more comfortable flying on
airplanes.

Helane R. Becker
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And I'm wondering if you're able to convert some of those nonmembers to members?

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

We always work at that and also to get them to hold our credit card, obviously, which has done
extraordinarily well during the crisis as well. Our credit card situation is completely diverse at this point
from our passenger revenue situation. So that's going well. But we will continue to work to convert them,
but it definitely is a different makeup of passengers as we look back in time. But as we look forward
in time, it seems to be moving back towards normal. But again, normal won't be achieved until I think
there's a vaccine.

Operator

From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi.

Joseph William DeNardi
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Scott, is Luc's compensation, his budget for talent and the level of investment in the MileagePlus
consistent with it being a $25 billion asset?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

I'm not going to talk about Luc's compensation on a public call. But Luc and his team have done a truly
phenomenal job, not just what they've done on what they and Mike Leskinen and the whole finance and
legal teams did on getting the MileagePlus holdings deal done. But Luc went through a great negotiation,
collaborative negotiation with Chase, which we announced like literally 2 days before the Italy news. So
really good timing on our renewed deal with Chase.

And as Andrew said, that's been a partnership that's working really well. And Luc is a great asset and his
whole team for United. We make sure they get the resources they need to keep growing this business.
And we also appreciate the partnership with JPMorgan Chase who invested a lot in also growing this
partnership.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

How do you use the organizational structure and the commercial agreement you've established between
the airline and the loyalty program to build a competitive advantage relative to your peers, more
appropriately allocate capital and then maybe most importantly, improve the profitability of the core
airlines so it earns an adequate return on capital post COVID?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Well, I'll let Andrew add to this if you want. I'm not really 100% sure what you're getting at. But what I
would say is we were already kind of working down the road to more appropriately, at least internally, split
out the financials and understand the real economics of the card, core airline. They do go together. They're
not separable in the sense that you could have one without the other. They are -- they mutually support
each other in a positive and a good way.

But we accelerated that effort, obviously, as we went through the pandemic. And I don't know what all
the answers are going to be yet. But I think that separation and that even clearer delineation will create
new opportunities for Luc, Andrew and their teams to push on the nonairline side, which will also help the
airline side. So it's a symbiotic relationship. Andrew, do you have anything to add?

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

The only thing I would add is that the transparency that others now see, we always saw internally. And we
always recognize the enormous value there, and we'll continue to push it. And Luc is the right guy for the
job and has a lot of creative ideas. We've seen that over the last year, and we'll see even more of it going
forward. And I'm sure he'll be talking about his compensation with me right after this call. So thanks a lot.

Operator

From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth.

Savanthi Nipunika Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Just on the average daily cash burn, I'm just wondering if you could help me kind of walk through, as
you get from 3Q to 4Q, what some of the key components do? I understand a portion of that is tied to
variable, so what revenue does. If you kind of take away that component, I think in the last call, there
was kind of a discussion on maybe that coming down about $20 million from the level that we saw back
then just on some of the costs coming out. I was wondering if you could help me understand just how that
progresses.

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

So Savi, I'll at least try, and I probably won't give you the answer you want, which is I'll start by saying, I
think it's not correct to try to disaggregate the various components, whether it's cost, capacity, demand as
separate variables because they're not independent variables, they're combined.

And what we think will happen moving from the third quarter into the fourth quarter is we'll continue to
make progress on costs, which will be a little bit of a tailwind. And we think the net effect of capacity and
-- or cost efficiency. The net effect of capacity and demand is going to continue to get better. We don't
know that. Nobody can really get you an accurate forecast. It will be flexible.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

But if we just had to guess, if I had to guess on what cash burn was going to be for the fourth quarter, I
would guess it's going to average in the $15 million to $20 million range. A little bit of that at cost, but
mostly about an improving demand environment and an improving demand environment relative to the
amount of capacity you have to deploy to generate the demand.

But if demand is stronger, there'll be more capacity and therefore, more cost. If demand is weaker, there'll
be less capacity and less cost. But I actually have a higher degree of confidence in our ability to forecast,
maybe it's even too strong a word, but have an expectation of cash burn than I do the other variable. And
if I had to make a bet today, I'd bet on somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million range for the fourth
quarter.

Savanthi Nipunika Syth
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

That makes sense and super helpful. Just on the CapEx side and maybe for Gerry, just 2021, '22, based
on what you're kind of thinking today, how does that level look like from a kind of gross CapEx standpoint?
And I'm guessing from a cash CapEx, it's very small then.

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So in any given year, cash CapEx, when you take into account aircraft financing, is always going to be
pretty small relative to the total number since most of our CapEx has historically been for new aircraft and
those are always financed.

2022 is just too far out to speculate right now. I can tell you though that for the next few years, CapEx is
going to be lower than what historically has been because we have other priorities as we come out of this
crisis, principally restoring our balance sheet before we make significant investments.

For next year, because we still have aircraft where the metal was effectively being cut when this price has
started, we will take delivery of. It's still going to be a couple of billion dollars. $2 billion-ish is our target
right now. And we'll have more clarity on that over the next few months.

Operator

From Crédit Suisse, we have Joe Caiado.

Jose Caiado De Sousa
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

First, a quick question for Gerry, just a clarification, actually. Do you still have the ability to borrow more
against MileagePlus? Or has that exhausted the source of collateral? And can you talk about the relative
attractiveness of doing more of that versus taking the federal loan that you're approved for?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we were able to, as you may remember, in that transaction, upsize the transaction from what we
originally went to the market with, which basically used up the availability of the first lien capacity. The
way that deal is structured though, because it is amortizing starting in year 3, as it amortizes, we're able
to reborrow against that collateral. So it becomes a facility if we want that we can continue to borrow
against in the future.

Jose Caiado De Sousa
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. Okay. Second question, just a quick one for Andrew. Cargo revenue, clearly, a bright spot, good job
pivoting to go capture that in the second quarter. Can you just talk about the outlook for that in the third
quarter and what's sort of a sustainable run rate? Do you sort of have to pivot back away from cargo as
you add back more passenger service? Just your thoughts there.

17

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Well, first, what I would say is that we did have an advantage in that cargo tends to go to and from our
hubs. So we have a well-established network with our people and our distributors and that just was really
humming.

I would say -- and the other thing I'll point out is that our cargo revenue in the second quarter and the
first month was actually kind of flattish. So you can just imagine what May and June looked like. They
were just really off the charts. Cargo revenue does come in rather close to departure time. So it's a little
bit more difficult to predict, but we expect it to have another great quarter.

And really, as long as the global fleet of widebodies is not flying like it normally is industry-wide, we think
cargo is going to be pretty strong in terms of the yield production, which it is, and our ability to do cargo-
only charters.

But again, a big thanks to our team. And again, really, this is one of the advantages of our hub system
because cargo wants to go from our gateways to around the world and so we can easily take advantage
of it and we did. So expect more of that in the third quarter. Whether it's at the levels of 2Q, I think it's a
little bit early to tell, but it definitely will outperform year-over-year based on what we're seeing here in
July already.

Operator

From Goldman Sachs, we have Catherine O'Brien.

Catherine Maureen O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

One quick clarification for Gerry first. On the down 45% recent cost, is that all in adjusted operating costs
or there's something else?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. That's all in, ex specials, yes.

Catherine Maureen O'Brien
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And so it sounds like it's maybe too early to nail down 4Q costs given the uncertainty around
demand and capacity outlook. But how should we think about costs sequentially from that down 45% level
you're expecting in 3Q? If we just assume capacity stays level with August as you're currently expecting,
I'm assuming the changes to your labor force should be you'll be forced to make -- to potentially drive
those costs lower in 4Q versus 3Q. Or are there other cost buckets that you cut spending temporarily that
maybe come back and offset that labor impact?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

Catie, actually, I'm not focused so much on those cost numbers as I am on cash burn. So I think in
terms of cash burn, more than anything else. But to try to answer your question, I would say that with
your assumptions, I would say that costs are going to be about the same as what we're seeing now. So
basically, that decline is flat going to the fourth quarter.

The 2 things I would mention, by the way, about the fourth quarter on cash burn. We do have, in addition
to our normal debt amortization, $300 million maturity in the quarter. So principal payments in the fourth
quarter will be higher than, for instance, in the third quarter. And of course, there would be some onetime
costs as we rightsize the labor force that we'll also have in the fourth quarter.

From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg.

Michael John Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just 2 quick ones here. Gerry, the $15.2 billion liquidity as of July 20, does that include the last PSP
installment? I think that's like $500 million or so. Is that in that number?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

No. No. That typically would come at the end of the month.

Michael John Linenberg
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just -- great. And then just my second question, and this is probably to Andrew.
When you look at some of the IATA data, they talk about tickets purchased within 3 days. I think for the
month of May, it was over 40%. A year ago, it was probably closer to like 15% to 18%.

Are you guys seeing numbers that are similar, at least maybe in May or June? And are those numbers
starting to normalize? Or are they still very high closed in, and I'm sure that's obviously having some
impact on your ability to plan. Maybe you can just provide some color on that.

Andrew P. Nocella
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, Mike. I would say forecasting is a little bit more challenging these days than normal. We definitely
saw very high closed in demand in May, in particular, and early June, which quite frankly was nice to see,
got the load factors and revenue moving in the right direction.

I will say that tapered off a bit as the quarantine hit in New York City and then Chicago and elsewhere and
borders got even more restrictive. So I don't know where it is on the realm of normalcy, but it was very
high in May and early June. It's lower now that these events have happened. And once things start to get
back on the road to recovery, I do expect that the booking curve will have moved closer in.

And all of that's to say, it really is difficult to predict revenue at this point and get the capacity equation
optimized like we'd like to. But I think we're going to get better and better at it as we go forward,
but that's kind of where we are. So that is what -- we're seeing what IATA told you, and I think that's
consistent, although in recent weeks, that's changed.

Operator

From Barclays, we have Matthew Wisniewski.

Matthew Aaron Wisniewski

Just wanted to come back to the fleet real quickly. I appreciate the flexibility on making a decision, but is
there a point in time you can -- you would need to make a decision? Or essentially, how long can you push
off deferring kind of making a decision on delaying or retiring an aircraft type?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Maybe I'll start and Gerry can add on. But it's difficult to predict the virus path. We've put a lot of aircraft
into some type of storage, whether it be temporary, long-term storage or short-term storage. And we are
moving aircraft in and out of storage based on maintenance cycles and engine time and all kinds of things.

So when we went into this, we didn't have a plan to necessarily retire any fleet type, and we're going
to hesitate to make final decisions on that until we kind of better understand the length and duration of
the situation, to be honest. So there are token number of very, very old 757s that had Pratt & Whitney

engines on them. Those aircraft have definitely been permanently retired because they were part of our
retirement plan. But we are definitely trying to keep our powder dry on the rest of the fleet until we have
better visibility of what's going on.

But more importantly, we're using that fleet really effectively with green time for both airframe and engine
to make sure that we do what's right for cash burn and long-term requirements of the fleet. So I hesitate
to make a decision today to retire a fleet when we just don't need to. So that's my perspective on where
we are today. And Gerry, do you want to add anything to that?

Gerald Laderman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Let me just add a couple of things. One, even the Pratt-powered 757s, which -- if you look at what
our original expectation was on their retirement, it is probably likely that they're not going to come back.
But even those aircraft would be available if there was a rapid recovery. Just our expectations are those
are the first to go.

And just in terms of the amount of time, we have plenty of time measured in years. The aircraft are being
cared for, properly stored and can be pulled out for the desert when and if we need them.

Matthew Aaron Wisniewski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's helpful. Just other quick questions. Well, it's probably a little early to be talking about
international traffic too much. But maybe you could quickly touch on kind of the conversations you're
having with some of your international peers, if there's a concerted effort to be disciplined on capacity
eventually or what that could look like when demand does return.

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Well, we're definitely not having that particular conversation because it would be illegal. But what we have
been talking to people about is ways to get people flying again and to increase demand.

And in fact, yesterday, United Airlines was proud to sign along with Lufthansa, IAG and American Airlines
a letter that went to governments on both sides of the Atlantic asking that they consider allowing people
to begin traveling back and forth between Europe and the U.S. if they get a negative COVID test as a way
to start reopening borders and a way to safely start reengaging in travel. So our focus, as we've talked
internationally, has been about how to get consumers flying again.

recovery of about 50% and then a plateau ahead of any virus vaccine. What sort of time frame do you
think that would be? Does that anticipate going into middle or late next year for that level?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Look, I'm not an expert on when a vaccine is going to be available and widely distributed. But I've been
reading a lot about it. It seems pretty clear it's going to also require multiple vaccines. And when we
talk about a vaccine, it needs to be a vaccine that's been tested, found to be effective, manufactured,
distributed and given to a wide percentage of the population. So I think that's probably longer than what it
is in terms of the media.

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

I certainly hope it's sooner, but we'll let you go to other experts to find what it is. At United though, we're
at least planning as a scenario that it takes until late next year before that really happens and we hope it's
better than that.

Operator

From Reuters, we have Tracy Rucinski.

I wanted to ask about that letter that you referenced that you and other airlines sent yesterday to the EU
and the White House on a program to test passengers for COVID. Have you received any feedback from
the respective governments on that? And how do you see international travel restrictions evolving in the
coming months?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

Brett, do you want to say anything about anything that we know on what we've seen so far or heard, if we
have?

Brett J. Hart
President, Chief Administrative Officer & General Counsel

This is Brett Hart. Yes, to date, we don't have any formal responses, but we do expect to have productive
discussions. And we're hoping to, in fact, to be able to go on, to move forward on this policy. We think it's
in everyone's best interest, obviously, various countries, including the United States. So we're hopeful.

We have strong support across our industry, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And this is something
that we think, at the end of the day, will benefit all of our collective countries and our industry. So we're
hopeful.

Operator

And from The Associated Press, we have David Koenig.

David Koenig;The Associated Press;Journalist

Your press release today on the expanded face mask policy highlights the upgauging you've done to
reduce the number of passengers per flight. And I just wondered if you're regretting not having started
out at blocking some seats like some of your competitors because it seems like their policy would be
easier to explain to customers. Any regrets on that?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

So look, we, as we said, have been taking significant action to increase consumer confidence. And we
ran, I think, a 35% load factor in the second quarter. We're projecting a 45% load factor in July. And
importantly -- but that's about confidence. We have incredible confidence in the safety of the airplane. But
that's about consumer confidence.

Importantly and to that end, we are also notifying customers when we have a 70% load factor or higher
and giving them the option to switch to another flight if they don't feel comfortable. And to date, fewer
than 1% of our customers are taking us up on that.

Earlier in the call, I talked about why an airplane is safe, and we have high confidence in the safety of an
aircraft. It is not the same as be in another indoor space. It's not the same as being in a restaurant. It's
not the same as being in an office building or even a hospital because the air comes in from the ceiling, it
goes past the customer down to the floorboard back into the ventilation system and then is either filtered
through HEPA-grade air filters or 50% of the air recirculated into the cabin is from the outside. And that is
a uniquely safe environment that exists nowhere other than on an aircraft.

And you combine that with our mask policies and our cleaning protocols. And it really is one of the safest
places you can be if you're going to leave your house. And we have high, high confidence in that.

And other steps that we take -- because we have high confidence in the safety, the other steps that we're
taking are about consumers and getting consumers confident. And so that's why our policy has been with
-- what it has been. We kept load factors low intentionally to help build confidence, to help explain the
story that aircraft are safe.

Operator

And from New York Times, we have Niraj Chokshi.

Niraj Chokshi;New York Times;Reporter

I just wanted to ask about the mask policy. I guess I was curious to hear what -- how uptake on that has
been. Can you guys say how many people have been barred from future flights, how that's going?

J. Scott Kirby
CEO & Director

So the vast majority of our employees and customers already follow the mask policy because they
recognize it's the right thing to do for the safety of everyone. And so we have very high compliance. Since
the mask policy has been in place, we've carried in the millions of customers and we've had fewer than 30
that we have had to actually take action against.

So the vast majority of people are compliant, agree, appreciate. It is a distinctly small minority that refuse
-- that don't want to wear a mask. And look, we'll welcome them back when this is all over and masks
aren't required, but they're not going to be flying on United during the pandemic if they won't wear a
mask.

Operator

Thank you. And we'll now turn it back to Kristina Munoz for closing remarks.

Kristina Munoz
Senior Manager of Investor Relations

Thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact Investor Relations if you have any further questions,
and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Operator
Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may
now disconnect.
