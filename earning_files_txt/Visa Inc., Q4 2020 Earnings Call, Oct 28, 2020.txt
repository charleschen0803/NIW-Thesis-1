Alfred Francis Kelly
Chairman & CEO

Hey, Mike, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

Our fiscal 2020 started off very strong. And as COVID-19 spread across the globe, certainly, our business
was impacted. As a result, we were quite thoughtful during the year, adjusting our expenses yet we
continue to invest in key initiatives to support and fuel growth.

Let me share a few highlights from fiscal 2020 that illustrate our continued momentum. Over 185
billion payment transactions and almost $9 trillion of payment volume were made on Visa credentials.
Acceptance points grew 16% to nearly 70 million merchant locations, and that only counts our partners
like PayPal, Square and Stripe as one each. Contactless penetration grew to 43% of all face-to-face
transactions around the world, 65% excluding the United States. U.S. tap-to-pay cards reached 255
million. And globally, there were 23 countries that increased their penetration by 25 points or more over
fiscal 2019. We expanded wallet partnerships, which now represent over $2 billion in potential credentials
and nearly 70 million additional potential acceptance locations.

Globally, the number of active credentials in e-commerce, excluding travel, rose 14% since January,
reinforcing the continued shift by consumers to online shopping. We renewed about 25% of our payments
volume in fiscal 2020 with key clients and secured several new wins. Over 50% of Visa volume has now
been renewed over the last 2 years. We expanded tokenization globally, crossing the 1.4 billion tokens
milestone and enabling over 8,300 issuers across 192 markets. Visa Direct grew to nearly 3.5 billion
transactions, utilizing 16 card-based networks, 65 domestic ACH schemes, 7 RTP schemes and 5 payment
gateways.

More than 5,000 client users accessed over 450,000 reports on our Visa Analytics Platform, a powerful
application suite that delivers data-driven insights and industry benchmarks. And finally, several large
acquirers leverage CyberSource's robust omni-commerce payments offerings to support their merchant
customers with innovative capabilities.

VISA INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

With that backdrop, today, I'd like to first discuss our results, then I'll highlight some key client wins in
the quarter and client momentum from recent deals contributing to our current performance across our 3
growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Lastly, I'll provide a very brief
initial thoughts on 2021.

To start, our fourth quarter results. While the underlying business was in various stages of recovery, we
saw the acceleration of cash digitization through debit, e-commerce and tap-to-pay and the penetration of
new flows through Visa Direct. We also advanced our value-added services led by CyberSource, security
and identity products and our consulting. Payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border
volumes all showed positive momentum exiting the quarter. From Q3 to Q4, payments volume improved
14 points. Processed transactions improved 16 points, and cross-border volume improved 5 points.

Net revenues in fiscal fourth quarter were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 17% in constant dollars. The
decrease in net revenue was approximately 11%, however, with service revenues recognized on a current
quarter payment volume basis. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, a decrease of 23%. Given our strong ability to
generate cash flow, we returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter.

Now looking ahead, our strategic focus in 2021 remains the same: accelerating our growth through
consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all while fortifying the key foundations of our
business model: our brand, security, technology and talent.

In consumer payments, we've had success with traditional financial institutions, wallets and fintechs as
well as merchants.

First, let me hone in on Europe, which has definitely been a key focus for us since the acquisition just over
4 years ago. Our first Visa client in Europe from 1974, Corner Banca in Switzerland renewed their credit
relationship and extended its debit for the first time ever. In Denmark, [ Djurslands Bank ] will migrate
over 200,000 debit cards from a local card scheme to Visa in order to access Visa's risk, data and other
value-added services. Last quarter, I spoke about our win of the UBS debit business. And this quarter, we
also renewed the credit business as well.

In the wallet space, Samsung Pay will put virtual Visa debit cards in all Samsung devices in Germany.
For those issuers in Europe who want to offer a wallet solution to their customers without developing it
themselves, we recently signed an agreement with a digital wallet company called Vipps. And wrapping
up Europe with fintech progress, let me highlight global fintech, Revolut, who chose us late last year to
be their lead issuing partner. In 12 months, Revolut has issued nearly 7 million Visa credentials in over 34
markets, with plans to expand more in the coming year.

Let me now move to success with traditional FIs in other parts of the world. ING, one of the largest
banks in Europe, recently expanded their long-term global partnership with Visa for their consumer and
commercial cards in 12 countries across Europe, EMEA and Asia Pacific.

In Asia Pacific, we renewed with 1 of the top 5 banks in China, Bank of Communications. And we've
strengthened our strategic partnership with Malaysia-based AmBank, who will now become an exclusive
Visa credit card issuer. In the United States, we recently won the inaugural debit card for markets by
Goldman Sachs' digital checking account, with millions of customers, markets, continues to create new
products, create a full-service digital bank. And we're excited about the opportunity to help make checking
with debit card functionality an attractive part of their growing product set.

Also in the United States, we announced in the first quarter that we had secured the Venmo credit card
and are pleased that it has started to roll out, unlocking new ways for Venmo's community of more than
60 million users to shop, share and split purchases and earn custom automatic cash-back everywhere Visa
is accepted.

Shopee, the leading e-commerce platform with a large user base in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, is
launching a Visa co-branded card across 5 Southeast Asian markets.

And our traditional wins in the fourth quarter capped a successful year of renewals that went into effect
with key partners, including Bank of America, Capital One, Barclays, Santander, Caixa and Al Rajhi.

VISA INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Now let me turn to expanding access with digital wallets and fintechs, which are critical to growing
credentials and acceptance globally. In the last 90 days, we signed multiple deals with digital wallets
including Yandex in Russia, Wing in Cambodia, PayCo in Korea, Naranja X in Argentina and Easypaisa in
Pakistan. These wallets represent tens of millions of potential credentials.

Our existing wallet relationships have continued to grow this year. Rappi, Latin America's super app with
over 30 million users, is now expanding into financial services with its new division, RappiBank, and it has
chosen Visa as their exclusive network and payments provider. Rappi will leverage their deep knowledge in
their existing 9 markets to create new payment solutions that drive digital inclusion and cash digitization
not just for their users but also their carriers, restaurant partners and small businesses.

In Asia Pacific, in the last year, LINE Pay added 1 million credentials and now has approximately 3.5
million total Visa credentials across Taiwan and Japan. Our partnership with Paytm in India spans both
acquiring and issuing. And this year, the relationship resulted in approximately 80,000 incremental
acceptance points and 1.4 million incremental credentials.

We also see cash digitization opportunities with merchants providing payment services to their customers.
Two to highlight from this quarter, and they're both from Latin America. We're extending our partnership
with OXXO, the leading convenience chain with nearly 20,000 stores in Latin America, as they establish a
new fintech arm. This business will exclusively issue Visa credentials in the OXXO wallet and through their
stores to further their reach of the under- and unbanked.

Visa also partnered with Natura &Co, the fourth largest beauty group in the world, to enable financial and
digital inclusion. Through a financial services platform, there are nearly 4 million direct selling consultants
and representatives in the region who will be able to access a digital account, a Visa credential and an
mPOS, among other services.

This progress in consumer payments is also prevalent in new flows as the pandemic is accelerating the
migration to digital payments. Governments, merchants and consumers all seek fast, safe and secure
ways to move money.

Let's look at a few new flows. Cross-border P2P is a Visa Direct use case with significant potential, and we
made meaningful progress this quarter. Ozan in Turkey plans to launch a global mobile remittance service
in early 2021 to the underbanked and gig economy workers, representing over 1/4 of Turkey's 83 million
population. In Russia, VTB Bank, the second largest bank in Russia with 15 million customers, is utilizing
Visa Direct for card-to-card transfers across 64 countries. Additionally, in Russia, KoronaPay, a leading
remittance center -- system, I'm sorry, will leverage Visa Direct for cross-border money movement.
And TD Bank in Canada is offering their retail customers a mobile platform for P2P with cross-border
capabilities.

Earned wage access and payroll are other use cases that are growing in importance throughout the
pandemic. This quarter, Wagestream, the market-leading earned wage access provider in Europe, signed
on to Visa Direct. Also, in the 2 months since earned wage access U.S. provider, Immediate, launched
Visa Direct as a payment option, the near real-time method is already accounting for 50% of Immediate's
disbursements. And PNC in the U.S. is providing their commercial clients B2C disbursement solutions such
as traditional payroll processing.

Another new flow is B2B, which represents $120 trillion volume opportunity. On the card-based B2B front
in the wake of COVID, we are seeing increased interest for digital payments, including virtual cards. We're
addressing this demand by: one, engaging with a broad range of issuers and partners; two, expanding
into new verticals; and three, investing to streamline operations and enable acceptance.

First, in terms of supporting issuance, Visa payables automation, which enables issuers to efficiently offer
virtual cards to their corporate clients and send back -- send data back to the buyer to aid in reconciliation
saw an increase of issuers and partners on the platform by almost 50% in FY '20.

Second, relative to expanding into new verticals, we are expanding partners and use cases for virtual
cards beyond OTA. In Q4, we launched YeePay -- launched with YeePay in China to support a virtual card

VISA INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

program in both OTA and education. We also announced a new set of solutions partnering with Stripe to
enable buyers to use virtual cards for payments, and the initial user is a Citibank health care client.

And third, investing to streamline operations and enable acceptance. Together with partners like Boost, a
fintech focused on B2B payment acceptance, we are expanding commercial card adoption by streamlining
the manual acceptance processes for suppliers, enabling automated data reconciliation and offering
flexible economics.

And now let me turn to our third growth lever, value-added services. Value-added services grew 15%
in revenue in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, a testament to the resilience of this business
as well as the demand from our clients for support. Often, our value-added services are sold with a
brand deal. But many times, they're sold after or even on a stand-alone basis. Permanent TSB in Europe
renewed their credit and debit business earlier this year and subsequently signed an agreement with Visa
to launch Visa transaction controls, which will provide a powerful and convenient way for cardholders to
track and manage all payments activity on enrolled accounts and tokens.

In seller solutions, both merchants and acquirers have actively sought CyberSource's offerings throughout
the pandemic. CyberSource sells direct to merchant and also through robust and fast-growing indirect
channel with acquirers who can leverage our platform to provide the latest digital capabilities in order
to attract and maintain merchants. With that in mind, we are very pleased that Barclaycard, one of the
largest acquirers in Europe, will utilize CyberSource to support their merchants' digital payment journeys,
e-commerce and omnichannel requirements.

We've also established relationships with acquirers in other regions. This quarter, in CEMEA, we signed
CyberSource deals with HBL, the largest e-commerce acquirer in Pakistan, Equity Bank Group in sub-
Saharan Africa and Bank of Abyssinia in Ethiopia.

Before I close, a few words on the acquisition we announced yesterday. YellowPepper is a software
company with a platform that we see as a universal adapter that allows clients to connect and scale new
innovative capabilities without having to expend significant technology resources. Through a single API-
based connection, issuers, processors and governments can access YellowPepper's rich set of APIs to
initiate secure, real-time money movement transactions across a variety of payment rails using a simple
alias, something like an e-mail address or a phone number.

For Visa, the acquisition extends our network of network strategy by significantly reducing the time to
market and cost for issuers and processors, regardless of who owns or operates the payment rails. It
supports our financial institutions in their quest to modernize their infrastructure and access network-
agnostic solutions and facilitate an easier -- and it facilitates an easier integration to Visa Direct and Visa
B2B Connect, which will help to grow new flows and transactions. It enables the further adoption of value-
added services, both ours as Visa's as well as YellowPepper's. We're excited about the deal, and we expect
to close it in the next few weeks.

In terms of Plaid, I want to say 2 things. First, we continue to engage with the Department of Justice on
their review of the acquisition. Second, the Department of Justice's lawsuit yesterday against Visa and
Bain & Company is related to a dispute over documents they requested as part of their review of the deal.
Beyond that, we're not going to comment further.

To close, this pandemic has touched all of us. Through it all, I've admired the resilience of our clients who
worked hard to be there for their customers despite the many obstacles. I'd also have to pay tribute to the
more than 20,000 extraordinary people who work at Visa. My colleagues have demonstrated dedication,
creativity and professionalism in the face of extraordinary challenges.

In 2021, we remain committed to making the changes necessary to ensure our organization better reflects
the world in which we live and work. Visa is proud to lead -- lend our support in the fight for racial and
social justice within our 4 walls and beyond.

In terms of 2021, Vasant will provide a good deal of detailed commentary, so let me just make a few brief
points. In 2021, we'll continue to manage the business for the medium and long term while recognizing
the nearer-term realities. This means: one, we will focus on the opportunities that are being accelerated

by COVID-19; two, we will continue to invest to grow our business; and three, we will be thoughtful about
controlling discretionary expenses.

To be clear, while our business faces clear uncertainty, we have too many attractive growth initiatives
to pull back on the future. Our long-term strategy, which we covered in depth just 8 months ago at our
Investor Day, remains more relevant than ever. And I believe Visa has a tremendous opportunity to
continue transforming secure, reliable and efficient money movement for everyone everywhere.

With that, let me turn the microphone over to Vasant Prabhu.

Vasant M. Prabhu
Vice Chairman & CFO

Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the first quarter of recovery from the global
shutdowns. I'll start with some high-level observations on the trajectory of the recovery so far.

First, the debit business has been the major beneficiary of the accelerated shift to e-commerce and the
shift away from cash, even for in-person transactions. In the U.S., debit is growing at twice the rate it was
pre-COVID, and international debit growth has stepped up from 11% to 13% pre-COVID to 17% in the
fourth quarter. Debit stayed resilient through the shutdowns, growing 8% in the U.S. in Q3 and declining
only 3% in international markets. Debit growth was strong and stable through the fourth quarter.

Second, credit was hit hard by the pandemic, declining 20% globally in Q3. However, credit has been
recovering fast, exiting September down only 5% in our major markets with steady improvement through
the quarter.

Third, as economies reopened, card-present growth in major markets bounced back sharply from a
44% decline in April to a 4% decline in September, a 40-point recovery. Even as card-present volume
rebounded, card-not-present growth remained robust. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew
20% in April, 29% in May and 33% in September. Consumers worldwide are sticking with habits formed
during the shutdowns.

Fourth, the cross-border recovery has been sluggish since borders remain closed or there are significant
impediments to crossing borders like quarantines and other such restrictions. From May through August,
cross-border volumes were persistently down in the mid-40% range.

September saw a 6-point recovery, which has continued into October. This recovery was driven by a few
corridors where travel is now relatively frictionless, like travel from the U.S. to Mexico and the Caribbean,
travel from and to the Persian Gulf states and travel to Turkey. The sharp recovery in these corridors
provide some early indicators for how cross-border travel may recover when borrowers do reopen.

And finally, the recovery so far has been uneven, V-shaped for domestic volumes but L-shaped for cross-
border volumes. The cross-border business remains a significant and continued drag on revenue growth.
As a result, net revenue declined 17% in the fourth quarter, approximately 11% when you adjust for the
service fee lag. This is 10 points better than a similarly adjusted third quarter, driven primarily by the
domestic rebound.

Moving now to a review of our key business drivers. In Q4, U.S. payments volume was up over 7% with
consistent growth through the quarter. October volumes through the 21st are up 9%. Debit was up 24%
in Q4 and up 22% in October. Credit declined 7%, improving through the quarter. In October through the
21, credit is declining 3%. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to grow over 30% in the
quarter, even as card-present spending improved almost to 2019 levels in September.

A quick review of the recovery trend across 10 categories in the U.S. As we did last quarter, we have 3
groups, each accounting for about 1/3 of our volume. The first group includes categories such as food and
drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. These categories have consistently grown at or above
their pre-COVID growth rates in the high teens or even higher every week since mid-April. Through Q4,
growth remained strong and stable.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

VISA INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

The second group includes categories such as automotive, retail services, department and apparel stores,
which dropped between 10% to 50% in April and had recovered to growth by the end of June. In the
fourth quarter, these categories steadily improved and are generally back to pre-COVID growth rates.

The third group includes categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic: travel, entertainment,
fuel and restaurants. These categories declined over 50% in April, improved 20 to 45 points through the
third quarter and are up at least another 10 points with steady improvement every month. Travel is still
declining over 40% in September, with the largest improvement so far in car rentals and travel services.

Fuel is also still negative but recovered 20 points since June, driven both by gallons purchased and higher
prices. Restaurant spending is almost back to 2019 levels. International payments volume grew 1% in the
fourth quarter and 5% excluding China.

A few regional highlights. CEMEA remains our best-performing region, growing 15% in constant dollars
in the quarter, a 20-point improvement over Q3. The combination of easing COVID restrictions and client
wins drove the strong growth. Europe improved 19 points over last quarter, growing 9% in constant
dollars. Growth was strongest in the U.K. as well as Central and Eastern Europe.

Fourth quarter growth in Europe benefited from U.K. cardholders utilizing their Visa credentials to move
money into higher interest-bearing savings funds. This is not expected to continue growing forward.

Latin America also improved 19 points, growing 6% in constant dollars. Brazil's spend growth was positive
in the quarter, fueled by a steady recovery in face-to-face spending, very high e-commerce spending and
client wins. Asia Pacific declined 10% in constant dollars in Q4 or declined 4% excluding China, an 11-
point improvement since last quarter. China continues to be impacted by the runoff of dual-branded cards
that have little revenue impact.

There were more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia than other parts of the world. Korea and
New Zealand are the exceptions, where spending is already about 2019 levels.

Processed transactions turned positive in the quarter, up 3%, improving each month as a result of the
domestic spending recovery. As you know, transaction sizes increased at the height of the pandemic, but
customer behavior is starting to normalize. Processed transactions growth in October through the 21st is
4% globally.

Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding volume within Europe, declined 41% in the fourth quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, we did start to see some improvement in September and through October led by
card-present spending in a few corridors where there is less friction at the border. Cross-border volume
excluding volumes within Europe through October 21 declined 37%. Constant dollar cross-border volume
including volume within Europe declined 29% in the quarter.

It's important to remember that cross-border volume excluding volumes within Europe drives our
international fees. The trajectory of the recovery where borders are now open provide some indication of
how fast the cross-border business could rebound once most borders reopen. For example, travel from
the U.S. to Mexico saw a 40-point recovery from the trough in April through July, and the trend continued
through the quarter. This corridor actually grew over 20% in constant dollars in September and October.
Travel to Turkey, which opened in early August, improved almost 30 points in August itself and remained
at that level in September. However, at this point, borders remain largely closed.

The World Tourism Organization reported in September that out of 217 countries, 161 countries or 74%
still had complete or partial closure of their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 56 countries,
the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantine. There are very few countries with no COVID
restrictions. As a result, travel-related spending remains depressed, declining in the mid- to high 60s in Q4
and through October.

Growth in cross-border e-commerce spend, excluding travel and intra-Europe volume, has been
consistently in the mid- to high teens since mid-April, led by retail spending.

Moving to fourth quarter financial results. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenues declined 17% on a nominal
and constant dollar basis. Adjusted for the service fee lag, net revenues were down approximately 11%,
a 10-point improvement from a similarly adjusted third quarter. This improvement was driven largely by
the domestic spending recovery. Service revenues were down 13%, driven by the 12% decline in nominal
payments volume from the prior quarter.

Data processing grew 4% with strong value-added services growth offset by the mix shifting away from
higher-yielding cross-border transactions.

International transactions revenues were down 38%, a few points better than cross-border volumes,
excluding intra-Europe, due to some country mix and currency volatility benefits.

Other revenues grew 5%, led by value-added services, but continued to be negatively impacted by
declines in the usage of travel-related card benefits and marketing services for clients. Overall, value-
added services revenue grew 15% for the fourth quarter.

Client incentives were 25% of gross revenues. This step-up in the percentage was due to the revenue
mix shift away from cross-border and the service fee lag as well as the impact of very significant renewal
activity this year. Client incentives were a little better than expected due to some deal timing and
performance adjustments.

Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses declined 4% as expected, primarily driven by professional
fees, G&A and marketing expenses. These expense reductions were achieved while sustaining investments
in our longer-term growth initiatives. Non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $126 million for the fiscal
fourth quarter. Interest income fell through the quarter due to low interest rates. Interest expense was
higher from the August and April debt issuances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.3%. GAAP EPS fell 28%.
Excluding special items, non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, a decrease of 23%.

On the fourth anniversary of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we had our first mandatory release
assessment for the preferred B and C stock and released approximately $7.3 billion, giving preferred B
and C shareholders the opportunity to sell these shares. This did not affect the fully diluted share count.

A quick summary of fiscal year 2020 results. Payment volume increased 2% in constant dollars. Processed
transactions grew 2%. Cross-border volumes were down 22% excluding volumes within Europe and 16%
including Europe on a constant dollar basis. For the full year, net revenues decreased 4% in constant
dollars. Client incentives were 23.4% of gross revenues.

Operating expenses were down 3% on a GAAP basis and up 1% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP EPS
decreased 8%, while non-GAAP EPS of $5.04 was down 7% or 6% in constant dollars.

We returned $10.8 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 44.2 million shares of Class A
common stock at an average price of $183.30 or $8.1 billion and by paying dividends of $2.7 billion.

Looking ahead to fiscal year 2021, I'll start with a few general observations. Fiscal year 2020 was a year of
2 very distinct halves. The first quarter of fiscal year '20 had no COVID impact. Net revenues grew almost
10%. Second quarter net revenues grew 6.6% with the COVID impact on our reported numbers mitigated
by the quarter lag in service fees.

In sharp contrast, net revenues dropped 17% in the second half. As we look ahead, it is important to
remember that the first half of fiscal year '21 will lap a relatively normal first half of fiscal year '20.
Another important factor to highlight is the nature of the recovery we have had so far. Helped by the
accelerated shift to e-commerce and the shift to digital payments even in face-to-face transactions, the
domestic business has experienced a V-shaped recovery. Processed transactions have largely tracked
domestic payments volume growth with some impact from the mix shift to higher tickets, which appears
to be normalizing.

On the other hand, borders remained largely closed, cross-border travel has significant friction in the form
of quarantines or other requirements, resulting in a very slow recovery in cross-border travel. Also, the

cross-border business comes with higher yields. This significant shift in mix is a drag on revenue growth,
which will continue into fiscal year 2021 until the cross-border business recovers.

Meanwhile, the pandemic is still with us. The environment remains uncertain. It is not possible to reliably
forecast volume and revenue 4 quarters out. The significant uncertainties include: the impact of spikes
in COVID infections as we are seeing now; the timing of reopening of borders; the easing of friction
in crossing borders and its impact on cross-border travel recovery; the positive impact that improved
therapeutics and a vaccine could have on all this; the timing and size of additional stimulus programs; the
economic impact once various stimulus programs end.

With that as context, I'll share a few perspectives on fiscal year '21 to try and be as helpful as we can be
under the circumstances. On the revenue front, given how fiscal year 2020 played out, fiscal year 2021
will also be a year of 2 very different halves. Net revenue growth is expected to decline in the first half and
rebound significantly in the second, with the highest growth in the fourth quarter. The level of the decline
in the first half and the size of the recovery in the second will depend on how some of the unknowns I just
enumerated play out.

For example, if processed transactions and cross-border travel -- cross-border volume growth stay at
levels we have seen so far in October through the first fiscal quarter, net revenue would be down in the
high single to low double-digit range. This includes a 1 to 1.5 point negative impact from the service fee
lag.

Through fiscal year '21, we expect Visa Direct to continue its robust growth trajectory. We also expect
value-added services to continue to grow in the mid-teens. There's a little of new pricing in fiscal year '21,
some benefit from pricing we delayed and some carryover pricing from fiscal year '20.

On client incentives, we finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year '20 at 25%. There are several factors that
will impact client incentives in fiscal year '21. First, mix. Incentives are tied more to domestic volumes
than they are to cross-border volumes. The current mix shift away from the cross -- from cross-border
hurts gross revenues and causes this ratio to increase. When the mix normalizes, this would push the ratio
down again.

Second, performance. In fiscal year '20, with a sharp decline in volumes, many clients did not meet
certain volume thresholds and, as such, did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in
fiscal year '21, we expect clients will hit thresholds and earn these incentives, which causes a year-over-
year increase unique to the year of the recovery.

Finally, the impact of renewals. As we have told you, fiscal year '20 was another big year for client
renewals. We renewed 25% of our volume during the year with another 15% to 20% likely renewed in
fiscal year '21. Factoring all this in, we currently estimate that fiscal year '21 incentives as a percent of
gross revenue could be in the 25.5% to 26.5% range. As always, we have given you our best sense of the
range at this point, and we'll update you through the year as we learn more. First quarter incentives are
likely to be at the lower end of the range.

Moving to operating expenses. In fiscal year '20, we demonstrated our ability to modulate expenses and
investments as circumstances change, balancing short-term imperatives with long-term priorities. Non-
GAAP operating expenses grew 8% in the first half and declined 5% in the second. As Al indicated, we
remain very bullish about the growth potential of our business, and we'll invest accordingly.

Visa Direct continues its robust growth. B2B Connect is ramping. Our value-added services growth is
sustaining at mid-teens levels, and our recent acquisitions require investments to scale. We will step
up investment in all these areas and a few others, such as the Tokyo Olympics. As a result, we plan to
increase our level of investment through the year, modulating as we learn more about the trajectory of
the recovery. Our current plan is for expenses to be down in the first quarter, in line with second half
fiscal year '20 trends. Expenses are expected to grow in the mid-single digits in the second quarter as we
begin to lap the expense pullbacks from the last fiscal year. At this point, we plan on double-digit expense
growth in the second half, in part due to the Olympics. However, we will adjust our plans as needed and
update you as the year progresses.

VISA INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

We expect nonoperating expense to average $145 million to $150 million each quarter in fiscal year '21 for
2 primary reasons: first, low uneven negative interest rates on our cash balances; and two, our $4 billion
in additional debt after we pay off our December bond maturities.

Our fiscal year '21 tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range. It is too early to predict what
impact the U.S. elections will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates, if any, to our tax rate
expectations as the year progresses.

Capital spending in fiscal year '21 is likely to be around $700 million. We expect to return most of our
free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Our Board of Directors has
authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.32 starting in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.
When the Plaid transaction closes, we will let you know what its impact on FY '21 will be.

In summary, as we've done in fiscal year 2020, we will stay flexible and agile as we work through the
pandemic. As you heard from Al, the opportunity ahead is vast. The shift to e-commerce and away from
cash is accelerating. Use cases for new payment flows are proliferating and ramping. Our value-added
services business continues to grow at a healthy clip. We remain as optimistic about our future as we were
at our Investor Day in February, which now seems like a lifetime ago. Our strategy remains unchanged,
and in fiscal year '21, we will continue to prioritize and invest in our key growth initiatives.

With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.

Question and Answer

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho.

Dan Dolev
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

YellowPepper asset, can you give us a little color on maybe its capabilities. You mentioned send money
with e-mail or anything like that, that you could highlight in terms of the advantages of YellowPepper.

Alfred Francis Kelly
Chairman & CEO

Dan, it's Al Kelly. This is a company that we're quite familiar with. We invest -- we were an early investor
with them. We've been working with them. And what they really allow various players throughout, at least
in the foreseeable future through Latin America, being able to facilitate, getting any kind of -- various
kinds of services up and going very quickly by connecting to YellowPepper and then YellowPepper taking
over from there.

And we think as the payments and money movement world continues to grow and diversify, having a
software platform like YellowPepper that makes it easier for these connections to happen and gives us
an on-ramp to sell value-added services and accommodate the needs of various clients to have network-
agnostic solutions, that it's going to give us a good path towards accelerating both core payments as well
as value-added services and new flows throughout Latin America. And then over time, we'll look to extend
the capability beyond that region.

Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair.

Robert Paul Napoli
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Just on the value-added services, I was hoping to get a little more color about the mix of revenue, if you
could kind of break it out by whatsoever reasonable products that you could. And which of those products
are growing the fastest, obviously, Visa Direct?

Alfred Francis Kelly
Chairman & CEO

Well, Bob, thank you for the question. So first of all, we think of Visa Direct as a new flow, not a value-
added service. So let me try to give a little more color. So about 2/3 of value-added services are platform
type of services that are driven by transactions. And obviously, in this environment, some of those
have done quite well. CyberSource, where people are looking for omnichannel solutions. Risk and fraud
services, particularly as a lot more transactions have gone online, and people are looking at things like 3D
Secure 2.0 and our offerings from CardinalCommerce. And then issuer processing has done well given that
-- what's happening with debit, as Vasant described in his remarks.

About 1/3 -- the other 1/3, so that's about 2/3 of value-added services. The other 1/3 is kind of split
between service revenue and other revenue. So in service revenue, you have card benefits, which are
offered as a package. And then in other revenue, you have services that are generally not tied to volumes,
things like travel-related card benefits, marketing services, data and consulting and analytics. So you
can imagine in that grouping, there are things that are struggling a little and other things that are
accelerating. So travel-related card benefits are obviously very sluggish as are marketing services. But
things like data and consulting and analytics are continuing to grow at pretty robust levels. So that would
be -- hopefully give you some color.

I don't know, Vasant, whether you want to add anything to that.

Vasant M. Prabhu
Vice Chairman & CFO

No. I think we're very pleased with how, as Al said, the platform-based services are growing. Those
happen to be the ones that have the best margins, and it's things like our fraud services, authentication
through CardinalCommerce as well as, as Al said, CyberSource. Clearly, with the growth of omni-
commerce and certainly, everybody -- every merchant wanting to enhance their e-commerce business is
very helpful to CyberSource, which, as you know, is a gateway for most e-commerce merchants, and then
with debit doing well, the debit processing business. So those platform services, most of which show up in
our data processing line from a revenue standpoint, particularly high growth right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.

Bryan Connell Keane
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just want to ask about the strength in debit. Obviously, even without stimulus, the growth continues to
be impressive, well above 20%, especially in the U.S. and then obviously picking up internationally. How
much of that is driven by this move towards contactless and e-comm?

And as we get into next year, does it cause a difficult comp just because the growth rate is so much higher
than traditional? Or does this growth continue at these rates and maybe somewhat offset by a pickup in
credit by the time we get to the second half of next year?

Alfred Francis Kelly
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Bryan. I'd say there's a number of drivers what's happening with debit. Certainly, I think an
acceleration of cash displacement at the point of sale, where people are just concerned about cash being a
carrier of germs. I see that -- I think that trend continues.

Certainly, a significant shift to online purchases and mostly in everyday spend categories, which kind of
favors debit a bit, I think that's going to stay up at fairly healthy levels.

Thirdly, what we've learned in the past and is being reinforced now is that in these uncertain economic
times, people probably would prefer to spend the money they have than to borrow the money and hence,
that's a positive driver for debit. And then Visa Direct obviously helps drive our debit performance as well.

I expect that a lot of this positive momentum will continue. But I think there's no question that if -- and
let's hope it does, the world gets back to normal quicker than many might predict, that, a, you will see
credit come back as more discretionary purchases and travel start to bounce back. And maybe some
purchases start to move -- that are online maybe move back into the face-to-face world. But I think
a lot of people have gotten very comfortable sitting at their dining room table or in their home office,
shopping online on e-commerce. So I think a lot of these drivers of what we're seeing in debit over the
last 6 months have some staying power to them.

Vasant M. Prabhu
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I mean I'd add a couple of things. And you can see it in some of the charts we provided on the weekly
trends. I think what's happening about debit, which, as I said in my comments, is the biggest beneficiary
of the accelerated growth of e-commerce and the shift away from cash, the 2 things you're seeing is that
even as credit has recovered from declining 20% in April to exiting September down only about 5%, I
believe, if I remember right, in the major markets, you see the credit line -- the debit line has been very
steady. It's been growing at the same rate without really being impacted by the recovery of credit. And
even as card-present trends have improved, you're seeing the debit line hold steady.

VISA INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

So a lot of it has to be driven by the new use cases we are enabling and new payment flows through Visa
Direct, as Al said, and also the fact that there has been a true shift away from cash, and most of it has
gone to debit.

Now clearly, some of it is the stimulus payments. And if you don't have them next year, clearly, some of
that spending may have been spending that may not sustain, but that remains to be seen.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.

Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to sort of follow up on exactly what you were talking about, Vasant. Obviously, there's a recovery
underway. But to the extent that stimulus isn't renewed, and I know that, that may or may not happen,
and then you have -- you're going into the winter months where it may be more difficult to travel or eat
out and such, do you feel like that's a risk to the growth trajectory of the volumes?

And then just a clarification on the incentive guidance, the volume and support guidance. Does that
include, the numbers you gave, an impact from the lag of the volumes that come back versus what you're
paying out?

Vasant M. Prabhu
Vice Chairman & CFO

I'm not sure I fully understood your second question, but I will try to answer it. On the first one, as we
said, we live in uncertain times, and it's difficult to hazard guesses on what's going to happen when --
if there are spikes in infections. I would say we are tracking it very closely. And there's really 2 things
to track: it's spikes in infections and then what is the response from the government. To the extent that
the response from the government is to impose restrictions and shutdowns, then it does have effects on
spending. If the response of the government is to largely keep things open, then we see less of an impact.
So it will be very different region by region and country by country, both linked to the infection rate as well
as the governmental response.

As it relates to travel, travel habits are changing, as you saw. I mean people can't go everywhere. So
corridors that are open are getting more of the travel, which is why you saw the Caribbean and Mexico
actually growing in September and October. And normally, September and October, after schools open,
tends to be a slowdown in travel. In fact, we're seeing travel continue -- personal travel continue into
September and October in the corridors that are open.

So what you may see in terms of travel is people really being quite astute about where they can travel.
And as certain corridors open up, you start to see travel moving into those corridors that may have gone
elsewhere. So it all makes it very difficult to make any hard predictions about what's going to happen
next.

As far as your incentives question, I wasn't sure what the question was exactly. But we try to factor in
everything we know right now, mix shift from cross-border, service fee lag, the renewals we already had
and what we might expect, to give you the best range we can. We will obviously give you an update as the
year goes by.

Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.

Ramsey Clark El-Assal
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

You called out a lot of new partnerships and agreements this quarter, Al, in your prepared remarks. And
I'm just wondering in the context of the pandemic, has the way you structured the agreements changed at
all? Are incentive levels less performance-based? Or is there -- are there any kind of changes that might

have an impact on the way incentives kind of come in down the road in terms of how you're negotiating
right now?

Alfred Francis Kelly
Chairman & CEO

Ramsey, as a general rule, I'd say there really hasn't been a lot of change. I think that they've generally
been fairly similar. I think that for the most part, I think most -- as you know, most of these deals are 5,
7, sometimes longer years in duration. And I think almost everybody thinks that we're looking at kind of
a once-in-a-century type of event here. The conversation Sanjay and Vasant were just having, we're not
sure how long that really lasts, but we're certainly not looking for it to last through the duration of what
these contracts are.

I think that said, we're certainly thinking about the structure of deals and trying to determine where to
tweak things here and there. But I wouldn't say that we've made any kind of radical changes to how we're
structuring the deals, Ramsey.

Operator

Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson.

Lisa Ann Dejong Ellis
MoffettNathanson LLC

My question is about Europe. This 9.1% growth in Europe this quarter, that is a very strong number,
stronger than it had been pre-pandemic. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in Europe? Are
you starting to see the payoff of the long-term effort there to invigorate that business after the Visa
Europe transaction? I mean are you seeing just really elevated cash displacements? What are some of the
underlying dynamics in Europe?

Alfred Francis Kelly
Chairman & CEO

So Lisa, I'd say a few things. First of all, this movement of funds into these higher-yielding savings
accounts definitely was a real factor, and that's not going to repeat itself. But beyond that, I think that you
are seeing the beginnings of traction of a number of fintech deals. I mentioned Revolut in my remarks. But
Lydia in France comes to mind, ininal, a fintech in Turkey, comes to mind, that are really starting to scale
up in terms of their relationship with Visa.

I also think that we've had a pretty good track record of deepening some of our existing businesses that
we renewed as well. I commented on a few of those. But if we go back over the past numbers of earnings
calls, we commented on others.

And I have made the point that I think that I believe over the last 5 or 6 quarters that Europe has made a
lot of progress in terms of relationship builds. They're just going to take time to show up in the numbers
because you're either doing a start-up or you're doing a shift in -- with the client, and both of those just
simply take time. And they take time to ramp, to get credentials out and then they take time for those
credentials to ramp in terms of volume.

The other thing I would say is that Open Banking continues to be a strength for us in Europe. And
we're having good success selling our value-added services, particularly, as I commented in answering
somebody else's question earlier, some of our products from CardinalCommerce as well as our 3D Secure
products. So I think it's the beginnings of some of the success that we're -- we think we've been having
over the last 5 or 6 quarters, plus this kind of onetime deal where people move money via their debit
cards into these high-yield savings accounts. And we'll have to see what happens, Lisa.

Today, you probably saw both France and Germany announced going into some form of partial lockdowns
again. So that's obviously not a very positive news vis-a-vis driving volume across the continent.

Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.

Daniel Rock Perlin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I just wanted to follow back up again around the notion that cross-border volumes kind of ex intra-Europe
is probably going to drag on for a bit. And so what I'm trying to understand or kind of reconcile a little bit
here is the specific opportunities that you might be pursuing maybe more behind the scenes in order to
offset some lost revenue and lost profits. So rather than kind of a very large drop-down list of products
and opportunities, I'm thinking of things like increased authorization rates now that you have a lot more e-
commerce cross-border that's happening that's opening up the funnel for merchants.

Are you able to offset some of those lost profit dollars as a result of those types of things? And then how
prominently is CyberSource playing in that regard?

Vasant M. Prabhu
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I mean we're clearly focused on all that, increasing authorization rates in particular corridors, big
priority. Increasing activation of cards that can be used for cross-border, critical priority. The growth of
nontravel cross-border business, big priority. Cross-border business for new use cases that Al highlighted
through Visa Direct like remittances, cross-border business through B2B Connect, all those are revenue
streams that are new and very exciting and growing well.

It's a big year in '21 to lay the groundwork for Earthport to scale. We've signed up a lot of clients. The
volume is ramping. We're spending quite a bit of time and effort to ensure that the Earthport platform
can scale. And a lot of that will be cross-border flows, not necessarily for consumer payments but a whole
range of other use cases.

So there's a variety of nonspecifically travel-related cross-border use cases that are happening right now
that we're very excited about. And then we're doing, as you said, the sort of the bread and butter stuff of
improving authorization rates, reducing fraud and all the things that would make people more willing to
approve more cross-border transactions.

Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I was thinking about your answer to Lisa's question. And I'm curious if you can -- do you think you can
shift into another gear and win more business in Europe with Open Banking and the digital shift there? I
guess I could expand that to other regions as well, but I'm thinking about Europe given the Open Banking
dynamics.

Alfred Francis Kelly
Chairman & CEO

I certainly hope so, Tien-Tsin. We are very, very focused on it. I think we've talked about this in the past. I
mean we really feel like we've been, in the last year, 15 months, really on our front foot in Europe. We've
got a really good win rate on fintechs. We're having lots of really good discussions with banks about Open
Banking. In addition to the things I mentioned, we've got our Visa Trusted Listing, which allows customers
to identify merchants that they trust, which will help users meet the regulatory requirement and have a
much better user experience for the customer.

We've got the Visa Delegated Authentication, which issuers delegate authentication to merchants or digital
wallets, which also reduces friction at the point of checkout. So a lot of these discussions have gone very
well. And I think that people who are clients and potential clients are viewing us as being very supportive

of what they have to do to deal with Open Banking downstream. So I believe that our momentum is good,
and you're going to continue to see it in our numbers.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just a quick follow-up, if you don't mind. I know some of the wins you guys have had like Venmo and you
talked about Revolut, pretty innovative, including on the reward side with things like Venmo. I'm curious if
also you could see a little bit more of business become available, thinking about travel cards and some of
the more traditional travel rewards might have less utility here during the pandemic. Are you seeing that?
Is that an area of focus perhaps?

Alfred Francis Kelly
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think issuers around the world are dialing back on their spending and their acquisition on travel-
related cards at this point and looking at alternatives. And even here in the United States, obviously, I
think you're seeing a lot more activity on things like cash-back than you are on travel co-brand. So I think
in the near term, that's going to be the case.

I think, though, as travel returns, which I happen to be optimistic that it will -- Vasant basically describes
how I see it, which is that travel is, for all intents and purposes, shut for consumers. It's not that you're
even having a choice of to travel or not to travel. In most cases, it's so much of a hassle that -- right now
that you just don't. It's just not a good experience. And I think as travel can reopen, I think that people
wanting to see the world, see family and friends and knock places off their bucket list, et cetera, it will
start to come back. And at that time, I think people will go back to promoting the travel elements of their
card or the benefits of the card as well as you'll see more attention paid back on the travel-related co-
brand cards.

Vasant M. Prabhu
Vice Chairman & CFO

A couple of sort of, let's say, bright spots from some of the early indications here is, as you know, the bulk
of the cross-border business we have that's card-present and the bulk of our cross-border travel is based
on personal travel, and that's an important one to note.

And there clearly seems evidence of pent-up demand because any time a corridor opens up, we shared
the example of Turkey, there's a massive pickup. There are more Americans traveling to Turkey now than
they did last year by a significant amount because they realized that's one place they can go. We've seen
that from other parts of the world that are open like travel in and out of Dubai. So we're seeing a lot of
travel from Europe into the UAE, for example.

So what we are seeing is there is pent-up demand. The corridors which are very few right now that are
open are getting a lot of it. And as corridors start to open, you will see different travel patterns than you
saw pre COVID, but there just seems to be a lot of desire to travel.

Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America.

Jason Alan Kupferberg
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I know back at the Analyst Day, which I agree with you, Vasant, feels a very long time ago, you spent a
lot of time on B2B. And I wanted to see now that we're 6-plus months into the pandemic, I mean is COVID
catalyzing accelerated growth in B2B for Visa? And if so, are there some supporting data points you might
be able to share on that front?

VISA INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Well, I'll start, Jason, and Vasant can add. I would say that commercial B2B volume in the carded space is
running pretty close to where you see consumer credit. So it definitely has been hit. And the line and its
growth has been, as I said, fairly close to the credit line.

That said, we've continued to invest heavily on trying to promote virtual cards as more digital spending
is going to take place in the B2B arena, and we're continuing to build out and invest in building out the
B2B Connect network. We're up and have the capability up and going in 80 countries. We're looking to
expand to the next 30 countries over the next year plus. And so we haven't really taken our investment
dollars on building for the future down much at all in this area. But there's no question, the volume has
been impacted by lots of people curtailing their spending and lots of employees around the world working
from home.

Vasant M. Prabhu
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I mean just a little more color on the B2B side and the -- as Al said, in the card-based part of the
business, we're seeing the small business side recover nicely. The large and medium-size side is the one
that is still somewhat sluggish. We don't have a big travel-related component in our card-based B2B
business.

On B2B Connect, we continue to build the nodes. A lot of interest, and we have some big new clients that
will be ramping. And hopefully, we can tell you more about that in the next few quarters.

And then in the very large AR, AP business, there continues to be interest. We are very focused on trying
to figure out the use cases that have traction and how we create value, but I wouldn't say that there's any
dramatic shift. It remains the category of people are trying to figure out a way to create value there. So
we'll again tell you more as things develop.

Operator

Our final question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.

Darrin David Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

We've seen, obviously, this uplift in the CNP transactions, both online and even off-line, similar with
contactless. And I think we've been saying, and I think you guys have said also, there's -- your technology
can handle more of that market share than other local or PIN networks given your investments. I guess,
first of all, can you just make sure -- just verify if that's true, in your opinion? And then second of all, what
kind of economic uplift is there from things like the CyberSource and fraud solutions you provide there?

And then Vasant, just a quick follow-up on the incentives comment you made about '21. You mentioned
incentives are, I think, 26% or so in fiscal '21. Does that assume that cross-border does not -- doesn't
improve at all in fiscal '21 or it just stays basically October levels to get to that number?

Vasant M. Prabhu
Vice Chairman & CFO

Well, I mean what happens -- I'll take the second part first. What happens to cross-border is anybody's
guess, right? So we gave you a range of 25.5% to 26.5%. We have seen, let's say, a 6-point improvement
from Q3 to Q4. From Q4, 41 down to where it's running in October is a 4-point improvement. So we've
assumed some modest improvements through the year. So it's not saying that there's no improvement.
Implied in there is some modest improvement. I think that's probably the best way to think about it. But it
is a range. It's hard to estimate. We've given you the best range. We'll tell you more as the year goes by.

And then your first question, I don't know, Al, if you were going to take that.

VISA INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

So I was -- so in the case of card-not-present, it's very, very good volume for us as we -- I think at
Investor Day, we said that $0.15 in every dollar in the world today is -- in face-to-face is spent on a Visa
card. In the card-not-present world, it's $0.43 on the dollar simply because cash comes out of the picture.

And obviously, as fraud has migrated more to online, as chip on card has depressed fraud in the face-
to-face world, that gives us an opportunity to work with issuers on driving down fraud by using various
services and products that we can provide.

And somebody alluded to it earlier. I mean there's still -- in the card-not-present world, still real
opportunity to drive up authorization rates. I think it was a question asked relative to cross-border.
And clearly, cross-border authorization rates and card-not-present are lower than authorization rates
domestically on card-not-present. But in both cases, versus face-to-face, there's real opportunity to
increase authorization levels to drive more volume.

Darrin, you said something about contactless, too. Obviously, that's in the face-to-face world. And we'll --
we continue to make and will continue to make real progress there. I think COVID will help accelerate the
pace in the United States, which is the one market that's been much further behind. I think I said in my
remarks that contactless transactions represent 43% of face-to-face and across the globe, 65% excluding
the United States, which gives you the magnitude of how far behind the U.S. is.

I do think though that -- and maybe you meant click-to-pay, I do think click-to-pay will help as well
accelerate card-not-present as well, particularly for people who are not card on file, but they're just
logging on to buy for the first time, and they're doing -- they're being a guest. So I think that there's real
opportunity for click-to-pay to help build a better user experience there. So we certainly remain really
bullish on what can happen in the card-not-present world.
