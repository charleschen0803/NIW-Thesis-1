Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone. My name is Hector, and I will be your conference operator on today's call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Live Nation Entertainment's First Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

Before we begin, Live Nation has asked me to remind you that this afternoon's call will contain certain
forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ, including statements related to the company's anticipated financial performance, business
prospects, new developments and similar matters. Please refer to Live Nation's SEC filings, including the
risk factors and cautionary statements included in the company's most recent filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q
and 8-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact the actual results.

Live Nation will also refer to some non-GAAP measures on this call. In accordance with the SEC
Regulation G, Live Nation has provided a full reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures in
their earnings release. The release, reconciliation and other financial and statistical information to be
discussed on this call can be found under the Financial Information section on Live Nation's website at
investors.livenationentertainment.com.

On today's call, we have with us Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Nation
Entertainment; and Joe Berchtold, President of Live Nation Entertainment.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Michael Rapino. Please go ahead, sir.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. When we spoke last in February, I was optimistic that we
would soon be returning to live events. And since then, our confidence has increased for our key markets.

In the U.S., over 40% of the population have received at least 1 vaccine dose, and most states are now
fully or partially reopening with more restrictions being lifted daily. In the U.K., over 50% of the population
has received at least 1 vaccine dose, and their reopening road map is tracking to plan. And although
Europe remains a few months behind on vaccinations, they are progressing, and recent discussions about
reopening to international visitors this summer are encouraging.

Around the world, people are showing the need to get out and socialize once again, which reinforces
our expectation that a return to concerts will be the logical progression as vaccines are readily available
to everyone who wants one. This is generally already in the case in the U.S. where we are confidently
planning our reopenings, particularly for outdoor shows. And we expect other major markets will follow
this summer.

Alongside these trends, we are seeing the effects of significant pent-up demand. The fans are buying
tickets, and events are selling out faster than ever. In the U.S., Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy and Rolling
Loud festivals all sold out in record times at full capacity. In the U.K., we have 11 festivals planned this
summer, including our largest ones, Reading, Leeds and Parklife, where tickets are already sold out. New
Zealand, the country's largest festival, Rhythm and Vines, quickly sold out. And as we get further clarity
on reopening time lines, we are announcing more tours for late this summer, including Dave Matthews,
Luke Bryan, Maroon 5 and others to come, showing artists' increasing confidence in performing this
summer.

Given the longer lead times associated with global arena and stadium tours, we expect these will start
later this year and into 2022. As we've discussed, we are already seeing confirmed major tour dates for
2022, up double digits from the same time prepandemic. Many of these artists will have multiyear tours
spanning in the U.S., Europe and often Asia or Latin America, setting up for a strong multiyear growth run.

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

Complementing our event pipeline, Ticketmaster continues to build its global client base to further
accelerate its growth. This year, we have already added new clients representing over 5 million net new
fee-bearing tickets, which we expect to grow further throughout the year as more venues prefer for 2022.
And with Ticketmaster's client base increasingly shifting to digital ticketing, we continue to enhance our
offering, ranging from upsell and improved advertising opportunities as well as blockchain and NFT ability
at the Ticketmaster platform.

Our brand partners remain engaged and are responding well to our reopening. And like our concert
business, our sponsorship pipeline of committed activity for 2022 is up double digits for next year relative
to where it was prepandemic. Like so many of you, I'm excited to go back to concerts over the next few
months and even more excited to see what I expect to be a nonstop 2022 that continues roaring into '23
and beyond.

With that, I will turn it over to Joe for more detail on our operating results.

Joe Berchtold
President

Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone.

As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release
to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today.

For the first quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers improved relative to Q4 2020 and are at or better
than what we expected at the start of the quarter. We remain confident that our actions taken to cut costs
and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until we bring shows back, which will begin
to scale in key markets outdoor this summer.

As we move toward reopening, we continue to balance strong cost and cash management. We're now
making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect the second quarter to be our
first year-on-year improvement since Q4 of 2019 and to also be generating positive AOI through the
second half of the year, we still plan on reducing costs this year by $750 million and reducing cash spend
by $1.5 billion relative to prepandemic plans.

Looking at our Q1 AOI results. Our AOI loss for the quarter was $152 million, which consisted of $323
million in operational fixed costs and $171 million of contribution margin, which included $149 million from
operations, along with various onetime items, including insurance recoveries.

Ticketmaster's ticket sales began to pick up at the beginning of March, particularly in the U.S., with weekly
ticket sale count significantly ramping as concert on sales have restarted, including the Bad Bunny on sale,
which was the top Ticketmaster artist on sale day since 2018. As Michael noted, sales for our Live Nation
festivals and concerts have been strong, demonstrating the tremendous pent-up demand for our shows,
with many festivals selling out in record time and a number of tours substantially overperforming relative
to their historical levels.

And our artist management and merchandise businesses also grew their contribution margin relative
to the fourth quarter of last year. And our artist management businesses, artists continue to generate
revenue through nontrain activity, including publishing rights, while our merchandise business has grown
its retail and e-commerce businesses.

Looking at free cash and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion in free cash compared to
$643 million at the end of 2020, an increase of $462 million. Our free cash, along with $964 million of
available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of
2020. Benefiting our free cash position, in January, we raised $417 million of net debt, and we had a $181
million timing benefit, largely associated with deferred revenue classification.

Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $136 million or $45 million per month, which included $100
million per month of average operational burn, roughly in line with Q4, plus another $4 million per month
of nonoperational cash costs to get us to $104 million average per month in gross burn. This gross burn

5

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

includes the benefits we realized from the sale of a nonstrategic minority investment and timing on
interest payments and severance costs. And in Q1, we had $59 million average cash contribution margin
per month, roughly 50% higher CM than we averaged in Q4.

Now on the other balance sheet items, ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that
are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the
prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q1. For tours that have gone for a second refund window, the
refund levels continue to generally be much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested
their refunds during the first window. On our festivals where fans were able to retain their tickets for the
next scheduled event, 65% of fans are doing so.

On deferred revenue, at the end of the first quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that will
play in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion, the same as at the end of Q4. Ticket sales in the first quarter
were $200 million, but this was offset largely by a shift of deferred revenue from short term to long term
for shows that were rescheduled into 2022. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to
short term during Q2 and Q3, reversing the timing benefit in free cash this quarter.

Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale this summer in key
markets, notably outdoor, and led by the U.S. and U.K. Given this expected activity through Q2, we will
continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its own sales, the concerts division to
staff up for the amphitheater and festival season, and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands of
these events. Between this ramp-up and the reversion of some of the Q1 timing benefits, we expect the
average monthly net burn for the first half of 2021 to be roughly in line with Q4 of last year.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Michael.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Before taking questions, I wanted to cover one other thing. Kathy Willard, our CFO for the past 15 years,
will be retiring as of June 30. She will be then staying on as an adviser throughout the end of the year. As
of July 1, the plan is for Joe Berchtold to become CFO.

Kathy, as you know, has been an invaluable part of our executive team for the past 15 years and been
with Live Nation for over 20. We are a much stronger company because of her, not just from her role as
CFO, but as a champion for women at the company and the industry, an important adviser to me on a
range of issues. Because she built such an effective finance organization, I'm confident we will remain in
good shape as Joe steps in. He and Kathy have been working together closely for over a decade now, and
he has gotten more deeply involved over the past year as we have been planning this transition.

In addition, late last year, we elevated [ Jackie Viato ] to EVP of Operations to take on greater
responsibility and give Joe the bandwidth he will need for the job. More than anything, I want to thank
Kathy for her impact on the company, her commitment and her friendship.
Operator, let's open the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.

David Karnovsky
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Kathy, if you're on the call, good luck, and you'll be missed.

I guess with regards to the summer, early fall, Mike or Joe, can you provide a sense for how much is
booked at this point relative to a normal year in the U.S. or U.K.? And just given the lead time, how much
room do you have to still kind of ramp that higher should conditions improve further from here?

Joe Berchtold
President

Yes. This is Joe, David. I'd say that the summer and early fall next 3 to 4 months is largely booked. We
obviously have a lot that is shifted from last year into this year. We've added some tours. We've also
added a number of festivals, all of which have been selling well. So the typical amp show is probably a
couple of months lead time. So I think we'll still have room to be adding more as we get into August and
September. But the majority of it has been booked at this point.

David Karnovsky
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then can you maybe just expand a bit and review foreign landscape in the next 12 to 18
months just given all the supply that's built on? And how do you expect to kind of efficiently allocate out
all the tours? Are there any capacity constraints, not necessarily in terms of venues, but just in terms of
maybe like a weekend nights that are available?

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're currently in that good position. We have lots of great conversations with probably every artists
you can imagine, talking about when they're going to be back on the road. An artist typically tours once
every 3 years on a cycle, so we're kind of condensing 2021 and '22.

So the good news is we got incredible supply. Now we're just starting through what makes sense to go out
in '20 -- at the end of '21 still into '22. And some artists, we're talking about moving into '23. So I would
say the artists are patient, and they're smart in terms of what their cycle is predicting. Maybe they have a
record coming out in the fall, maybe it's in Q1.

So right now, we have great supply. We don't have any issues in terms of availability, but we're also not
looking to cram everything in 3 years into 1 year. We're looking to stage a good '22 into '23 year. So when
you spread it over those 2 years, you find enough Fridays and enough weekends and enough rooting
challenges come to be solved that way.

David Karnovsky
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in. I guess as content activity is now ramping up, can you maybe
just discuss a little bit about what the process has been like for Live Nation? What are you finding that you
can do differently versus prior to the pandemic? And maybe just what your overall confidence level is in
hitting your prior target for structural cost savings?

Joe Berchtold
President

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

Yes. We're very confident we're going to hit the structural $200 million cost savings we've given you. As
we've talked about, we've done it the opposite way, which is we took $950 million of costs out. And so
now it's a matter of how we let $750 million of costs back in over a period of time. So that gives us -- that
makes it more real, if you will.

We've done a number of things. On the ticketing side, we've talked about -- we've shifted that to a truly
global organization as part of moving to a true single approach on the marketplace, on the enterprise and
on all the technology. On the concert side, we have a long-standing local network, which is very important
to continue to understand the markets. With 80% of your shows now booked via tours, you don't need to
have an entire infrastructure in every local market.

So we've been seeing that there are ways of streamlining it. And when we were growing double digits
every year through most of the last decade, it wasn't worth the potential disruption. But as we've stopped,
we've asked ourselves what's the best way to do this rebuilding from the ground up, and we're very
confident it's going to deliver those savings and be an even more effective organization for driving future
growth.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

And just to add to Joe, I think there's 2 ways to look at the business. We got -- we had a great workout
testing a new muscle for the last 12 months in terms of our balance sheet, our fixed costs and how we can
become more efficient. And I think that you're going to see come to life through our $200 million plus.

But I think the real win of the downtime was what is the new products of the kind of Live Nation 3.0,
what else are we going to do with this incredible scale we have across our consumer base. So I would say
whether it's sponsorship, concerts or Ticketmaster, we would have a new level of new products in the pipe
that we had not historically had the time nor the skill set, set to kind of unlock. So I'm very confident over
the next couple of years we're going to see some exciting new things coming out of the concert division.

Our consumer side of the business, our subscription business, our Ticketmaster business, our new ad
business models we're looking at. So a bunch of exciting ideas now finally had months and months to put
some people around and some skill set that we've acquired to advance that part of our business. So we
look at the future as not only can we run the largest concert company in the world more efficiently and the
best at it, but also what other new products will drive our business to think differently about the customer
and the artist.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with LightShed Partners.

Brandon A Ross
LightShed Partners

Just -- I guess you just mentioned Live Nation 3.0. So I figured I'd take it to Web 3.0. And you earlier
mentioned the digital ticket and the ability to now integrate the blockchain. I was wondering if you could
help us understand what the extra advantages are to utilizing the blockchain versus your current version
of the digital ticket and maybe how heavy of a lift that is for you and what tech do you plan to use.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Brandon. It's a great question. We get asked it every day, and I read a new article every day on
all the great things it's going to solve. So let's step back. I mean, blockchain, we think it's a very exciting
technology. We're currently using blockchain technology in our products, been invested in this business for
a few years now, and we think it's a great technology that will help our business.

I would step back from what are the problems that we're trying to solve or what are the opportunities
that blockchain specifically brings to the ticketing business. One of the great advantages in the industry

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

is when we went from a PDF to a digital ticket, we unlocked a lot of what you keep reading about the
blockchain is going to do in the future.

So the digital ticket or your mobile ticket that you're now buying has solved the biggest problem that
unlocked, we've been talking about this for 2 years, identity. Identity for us, the fan, the artist, the
team and the venue, knowing who sits on that seat, who's actually coming to the venue, having a
communication directly with them, having a verified ticket, being able to trade that ticket, putting rules
on that ticket. You currently do that now. If you want to. Can you transfer it? Can you transfer it with a
certain cap, all of those things that content could decide to do if they wanted to with a digital ticket.

And the service fee, I read about being reduced. I mean, the service fee could be reduced tomorrow. It's
just a function of the venue. Not the ticket company. So digital ticket and moving from the old PDF model
that historically ran the industry has been achieved to date. We've been talking the last couple of years
about the progression of adoption.

COVID, obviously, has really sped that up. Most ticket access now does not want to be in the contact
business. So having a ticket on your mobile phone, walking into that venue and then being able to
buy a drink, communicate with each other, upsell. You name the ideas that when you have a direct
communication with your fan, those are all being unlocked right now by sports teams, by venues and
artists.

So we think the blockchain technology is a great part of a technology solution to keep providing a better
communication and identity platform for the fan. But that's already in place. There's nothing blockchain
would bring to that, that we can't -- or others have currently achieved. So we'll continue to lose blockchain
to supplement and augment our platform and continue to look to be better at it. And we'll -- we think the
great opportunity in ticketing, just getting this full access.

I would step back -- and Brandon, you and I have talked about this before in terms of what does the ticket
company do? I mean, quite honestly, selling the ticket is the easiest part of being a ticketing company.
When we talk to clients, they don't pick us because we can sell a ticket. They pick us because we have
marketing and distribution reach. They pick us because we have one of the largest marketplaces in the
world to help them sell tickets. They pick us because we have a secure, great technology platform that
can plug and play with their APIs and their databases and their consumer needs. And they also pick us
because it's a financing mechanism.

A ticketing business is about financing the venues, and it's exchanging that for ticketing rights. So it's
a full bundle to be a ticketing company, and that's what Ticketmaster has delivered so successfully for
so many years. And we'll continue to think -- lead with blockchain and bringing identity and all of the
transparency and benefit that now having that ticket with an ownership to market.

Brandon A Ross
LightShed Partners

And can you maybe talk a little bit about the collectibles angle to it? Obviously, NFTs are very popular right
now. How does that integrate into your ticketing system? Or is that something that would be separate
from Ticketmaster?

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Right. No, that's -- and we think that's the great opportunity. NFTs are just another way of saying, can I
add value to the customer relationship? Can I put a contract or privileges on that ticket for the customer?
And that's a great mechanism, and it's a great vehicle.

I mean, whether we sell a T-shirt to that customer coming into a concert or we sell them a PDF with a
unique piece of artwork or a concert moment, it's another mechanism to engage your customer, find
unique products that will let those magic memories of that event live on. So macro level, we're always in
the business of figuring out what else can we add to that experience that the customer would engage in to
kind of cement that magic moment called the concert.

LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

So NFTs, specifically, on Ticketmaster side, they're working already with sports teams and festivals and
everyone else about how they would -- how they can layer an NFT on a ticket. You can mint a ticket and
mint an NFT right on top of a Ticketmaster platform and deliver it how you want. So that's -- Ticketmaster
will be in the delivery business using their ticket -- digital ticket, blockchain. And then as the customer
creates its own NFT, we can sell those and bridge those together on whatever minting system and/or
marketplace they use.

On the Live Nation side, we're deep in exploration. We have a great team that's been working on this and
working with the Mark Cubans of the world and others who are smart in this space. And I think you'll see
us come out with an interesting Live Nation concert NFT angle. We think it's a great way for us to engage
with our fans using that NFT and that direct relationship now to add rewards, add perks, add souvenir
moments. We've all learned from top shops at the NBA, so we envision Live Nation with the marketplace
and looking at some of its concert moments as magic moments that we could mint and attach to our
ongoing ticket festivals and special moments.

So we think it's -- if you have IP, we think it's an exciting time to use that IP to create some exciting
moments with fans that can trade it ongoing and live that moment and kind of cement that relationship
they have with that July 16th first concert back at Jones Beach, and I got an NFT and a special souvenir
ticket that's mine forever. I can trade it. I can put it in my wallet and own that moment forever.

So we think it's a fabulous moment to take a boring PDF and turn it into a magic souvenir with unlimited
ideas on how you can bring that to life for the fan. So we think it's an exciting time. We think we'll be able
to use our scalable IP to launch our own ways to engage with the fan in this space as well as empowering
our artists through our management company that we've been doing to date.

Brandon A Ross
LightShed Partners

Makes sense. And then I guess while we're on ticketing, just one last one. With the Vivid spec, thought
maybe it would be a good time to get some updated -- your updated thoughts on the secondary ticketing
market.

Do you see that as a growth market, I guess, as an industry, first of all? And then for Ticketmaster,
secondly, and kind of maybe how you see the competitive landscape in that arena now?

Joe Berchtold
President

Yes. We absolutely believe in the secondary market. It's another set of distribution platforms of getting
tickets in the hands of fans. For all the reasons Michael talked about in terms of digital ticketing and
identity, we think that more and more of the control over secondary will go to content, the sports teams
and the artists as they have wide set of agendas in terms of what they'd like to accomplish and how they'd
like to have the relationship with their fans.

So we think there's some evolution as it goes to digital ticketing, and we absolutely support the content,
having more control over how that happens. We support there being more transparency in secondary. But
we think it's here to stay, and it will continue to be an important distribution platform. We'll continue to
focus on pricing to get as much of the value of those tickets in the hands of fans as we can.

And I think as we look at Vivid, they've all got a similar business model, right? It's all a service fee
business model. They've got customer acquisition costs associated with a lot of search in digital, and we
have more customer acquisition costs associated with alignment with content, but it's similar at the end
of the day business model. We think we've got a great proposition by aligning with content and by also
leveraging the scale of our Ticketmaster platform.

So we like the position we're in. Whether it grows or shrinks exactly as artists price their content to
market value is less of a concern and making sure we're delivering on that content agenda.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.

Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Michael, you kind of freaked me out with that July 2021 because I have ticket to The Black Crowes at
Jones Beach on that day. So maybe you're going to be there as well, probably in better seats.

I guess just picking up quickly on the secondary conversation with Brandon, any comments or reaction to
the noise out of D.C. on safe ticks and what's going on. I thought it was -- at first I thought it was sort of
unusual to be bringing up and defending sort of the secondary market in that context, but I didn't know --
we sort of put the consent decree behind us, I thought. I don't know if you had any comment on that stuff
since it came out over the last month or so.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It would surprise us, too, right now where we are, but Pascal has been on this mission for quite a
while. So we would love to sit with his team and educate him on the business so we can get all of the
idiosyncrasies nailed because it's never as simple as it seems.

So I really -- we look at that as a bit of a nuisance. They seem to be -- obviously, scalpers are doing a
good job of convincing his staff that we are going to do a digital ticket in a closed platform. So that's their
great fear that we're going to have a digital ticket, and we're going to tell you when you buy that ticket,
you can only you can only resell it at Ticketmaster. That's never been our intent.

So their kind of their main claim -- and I'm not even sure if they would sit down with us, we'd explain
it's never been our intent to have a closed platform. We've actually -- the biggest thing I've done at
Ticketmaster, since it's taken over, is rebuild this company so we can have an open platform.

Our goal is to sell that first ticket. But as we did with the NFL last year, we have an open platform with the
NFL. We power the NFL. And if those secondary companies are approved by the NFL, then that ticket you
buy for the NFL can be freely sold on any other platform and used to get in the show.

So that, we think, is the best model. We think we have the largest kind of footprint from a primary
platform. We believe that if the ticket is to be resold, we have a great marketplace for that, for the
Ticketmaster fan. But we're also working and been working towards an open platform that it can be sold in
other places with the content like the NFL or venues want that path forward.

So not sure there's much meat to the claim. We're not looking to limit distribution. We're looking to
increase distribution for the teams, venues and artists. And the best platforms will win in the end that
offer the best value to the content and the fan. So that's our plan.

We think we have an incredible opportunity in ticketing in that -- the amount of people that buy at
Ticketmaster and actually resell their ticket is very, very low. So we think we have a natural huge audience
that we should do a better job of allowing you, the fan, if you just bought to think about how you can
resell on our platform. And maybe there's better incentives we can do for you as a fan to make that even
more seamless. But if you want to sell on other platforms, as we do on the NFL, then we'll be happy to
validate that ticket and let the content decide where it's sold.

That's very helpful. Second, just on Veeps, I think you guys announced 60 venues have been equipped
with their technology. Just any updated thoughts on how substantial that opportunity is as you guys look
into reopening later this year into next year from a business point of view -- business model point of view?

Well, I think it's no different than we just talked about NFTs, right? Our job is to keep looking at our
core business and making sure we can add more exciting products around that core business. We're just
thrilled with the acquisition partnership with the Madden Brothers who run this on a daily basis. The soul
and sweat they put in, it's really all them. We've just added a bit of a firehose by helping them with our
distribution.

They're -- I think they're up to over 1,000 shows in the last year, probably grow somewhere over 10
million. So a good start to that business. But now, you're going to see with our new clubs -- we do 10,000
club shows. So you start digging into that a little bit, adding some amphitheaters.

And the part we think is really exciting is our festivals, opening up that model that, in Lollapalooza, instead
of just rebroadcasting that for free, what if for $49, you could watch the Lollapalooza weekend or you
could buy the Lollapalooza Day at home and continue your party at home if you couldn't make it to the
venue.

So we've seen great success in our EDM business. Pascal's blown the numbers up on his business when
he does that. So we think extending the festival, which is a bit of a party-at-home model, it's got great
opportunity. And I would much rather use my festivals to add another revenue ticket to the equation than
treat it as promotion value. So we're going to test that this summer, and we think we'll get some learning,
and that'll help us move forward in that place.

If you just launch festival TV, you have a proposition itself there with our 150-plus festivals. So we think
that's exciting, plus our club business for young artist. So new space for us.

We think it's an exciting place to add value. We think there's subscription ideas forward with that. We think
we can bundle it with other things. We think there's a great foundation to our core business here that we
can keep exploring and innovating on.

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Glagola with Cowen & Company.

Stephen William Glagola
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

The July through November period for the festivals in the U.S. and the U.K. appears pretty crowded.
Outside the major festivals that you guys highlighted on the press release, is there -- is that having any
-- is there any impact adversely on consumer demand in some of those other festivals given the crowded
slate?

And then also with the 2021 Rock in Rio rescheduled for 2022, does that mean you will have that festival 2
years in a row now, '23 also?

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll answer it backward. We're debating the rock and roll decision, so we'll get to that -- the Rock in
Rio decision. We'll get to that later after we get '22 done.

No, we don't have any fear of a crowded slate. I think as you saw maybe some of our releases, we just
went up with Travis Scott yesterday or the day before and sold 100,000 tickets. Or Gov Ball went up
because it's long -- it's biggest on-sale ever. And Rolling Loud just is amazing. We sold 100,000 tickets in
about an hour and had 200,000 people in the waiting line. So we're just seeing demand beyond any other
historic moment.

So Garth Brooks this morning, I'm so proud, he broke every Ticketmaster record in history for the fastest
stadium sell-out. So I'm thrilled for the crowd, but I'm more thrilled that our ongoing investment in
Ticketmaster and the amount of strain that, that causes to be the fastest selling stadium in history or do
100,000 tickets in an hour is a testament to the Ticketmaster platform because the demand, the box, the
load that hits you in that hour is amazing.

So I'm proud that the Ticketmaster team is delivering, but also the demand right now is far exceeding any
of our scheduling festivals right now.

Stephen William Glagola
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And one more, if I can. Just you spoke about the NFT impact and blockchain impact on your Ticketmaster
operations. From the standpoint of artists potentially making more money, monetizing their back catalog
or whatnot, does that make them become less reliant on touring as an earnings driver going forward, in
your view?

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Not sure if that was a statement or a question. But no, I would say that -- I think you've got to look at the
macro pie always, right? There's always going to be a few artists that are able to sell their business at the
top end.

But if you look at the macro numbers, the percentage that comes from the road, the amount of artists
that are dying to get back on the road, we're seeing right now greater demand than ever from artists
calling us saying, when can we get back out? These are some very successful and wealthy artists. So we
always look at that. 2 hours on stage at a stadium is a drug that, that artist tends to want to run for his
entire career. So we don't see any decline in that desire for that artist to get on stage.

I think the reason you see Mick Jagger and The Stones on stage isn't financial at this point. I think
it delivers something much bigger than a paycheck. So I think that magic moment on stage is a
nonduplicatable for the fan and something that artists doesn't get at home.

Stephen William Glagola
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes, looking forward to going back to shows in the second half.

Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

There's been an awful lot of discussion about sort of the near-term demand. I wonder what data points
or information or perspectives you might have about demand beyond, say, the next 12 or 18 months and
how you think about sort of the demand curve longer term.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I guess if you were going to model that out, you'd probably -- you'd be thrilled that your first data
point is the biggest demand in history. So I think however you model that out for the next -- I don't think
you're going to see any cliff on that demand. I don't think these consumers are saying, "I can't wait to get
through '22," and then it's over.

So I think this is showing -- I mean, look, we always look at the -- I think the most important demand
curve is the 17-, the 16- and 14-year-old of today, excited about going to the show as the last kind
of generation, right? You always get that question on who's the next Rolling Stones. And our data will
continually show that, that young artist is capable of selling out stadiums and arenas very fast.

I mean, Bad Bunny just went on sale and sold out arenas very fast, huge Latino star. So we're just seeing
pockets of strengths coming from young artists every day. Billie Eilish is selling out instantly. So we see
young artists regenerating the supply side. We see new 14-year-olds going crazy for BTS all around the
globe. That's a part, to me, is what I look at is, is it still as important to a 14-year-old to see from the

Beatles to NSYNC to Backstreet to Britney Spears to BTSs of today, right? So they seem to be -- my 10-
year-old is as excited about concerts as I was when I was 10 -- or even more, I guess, where he's based.

But we see a great, young, vibrant supply/demand in the business. To me, that's what you want to model.
And over time, is it still as important to a 15-year-old of today and a 20-year-old of today as it was 10 and
20 years ago.

Joe Berchtold
President

David, just one other thing to add. I wouldn't just use what are the on sales of the past month as part of
your indicator. This is a supply-constrained business with a lot of latent demand out there. And if you look
at the past decade and you look at how Live Nation went from 40 million fans a year to 100 million fans
a year, it was by bringing more artists to more markets, to more people and unlock that latent demand
because of the desire that Michael talked about. So there's a long track record that would say I'm certain
about is the demand going to be there when you've got these great artists out on the road.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Agreed. And if I may follow up quickly. With respect to M&A, how are you thinking about sort of the timing
and the boundaries and the catalysts for maybe getting out and putting some deals back on the board to
grow that way?

Joe Berchtold
President

Yes. We -- go ahead.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

I think we're...

Joe Berchtold
President

Yes. No, I would just going to say, I think we're -- we've been looking at our current pipe. We have a good
pipe that was already in process when COVID started. We probably have 15 to 20 different venues around
the world that are in some level of construction or development or opening. Those are on plan, and we'll
be opening up from theaters to amphitheaters.

We've got an ongoing list of promoters and festivals around the world that we've been in conversations
with. We've been close a couple of those recently, and we'll keep doing that. So we will continue on
our bolt-on strategy, as we have been for many years, to keep bolstering our global foundation and
opportunity markets.

Michael Rapino
President, CEO & Director

We're a growth business. And whether it's growth CapEx or M&A, we're going to be continuing to invest in
the business. We're obviously at a higher leverage level, but we are confident that as we continue to grow
our AOI and that returns in 2022 and beyond, that we'll have plenty of flexibility to continue to drive that
growth.

It's actually Jessye McVane on for Ryan. Last call, you guys talked about ticket sales in the U.K., benefiting
once guidelines and time lines for reopening's put in place. When we see states like New York announce
this week that they will start to remove capacity restrictions later this month or as other states like Texas
have already acted on, are you seeing a similar step change in demand here in the U.S.? Or does it need
to be done at a national level to have a similar effect?

Joe Berchtold
President

We're absolutely seeing massive demand. I mean, today is a great example. We had the first half dozen
shows -- Broadway shows have their presales wildly outperformed all expectations. So just whatever it
was 2 or 3 days ago, they relaxed in New York, on sales today, going great. Governor Ball, as Michael
referred to, went on sale, far and away, the best first day for Governor's Ball.

So as every market is getting unlocked, that's telling the fans to be comfortable going out and buying the
tickets. And it's consistent as we go market to market.
