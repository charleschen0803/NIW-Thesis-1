Presentation

Operator

Good day. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF First Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.

Michael DeVeau
Head of Investor Relations and Communications & Divisional CFO of Scent

Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's First Quarter
2020 Conference Call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results.
A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being
recorded live and will be available for replay.

Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making
forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook
for the second quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and
contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual
results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and
risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 3, 2020, and in our press release.

Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe
affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures is
set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday.

With me on the call is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO,
Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.

With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Mike, good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. At IFF, with global operations in 44
countries and sales into approximately 200 countries, we have seen firsthand how the coronavirus
pandemic has touched our world. This is truly a remarkable moment in history. It presents all of us with
new challenges, but also revealed the best humanity at the same time. On behalf of every one at IFF, I
want to express my sincere sympathy for all those affected by the pandemic.

I also want to thank everyone in the global health care community who exemplifies the best of all of us
in responding to this crisis with courage and grace. Everyone on the frontline who continue to keep our
society moving [ towards ] has our thanks. To all the essential workers and the consumer goods supply
chain, of which IFF is proud to play an important role, we thank you for responding so quickly and moving
swiftly to deliver for consumers around the world. This is very clear that we are still in the early stages
of adjusting to the changes the pandemic poses to our world. As we'll review in more detail later, the
IFF business is strongly positioned to be resilient through economic cycles given our substantial portfolio
delivering needed solutions to vital consumers and markets.

The steps we have taken in recent years, including diversifying of our customer base and expansion into
more categories, have only served to further strengthen our ability to be a vital partner to our customers
and affirm our ability to be resilient through the cycles. Like many, we are seeing uneven impacts on
our business due to the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges. While some end markets are
seeing increases in demand, others are seeing notable declines. We are fortunate that only about 15%
of our revenue, not including Fragrance Ingredients, that is subject to the downward pressure right
now. However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the early stage of the economic impact

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

creates enough uncertainty for us that we have made the decision to withdraw our full year financial
guidance. Rustom will cover this in more detail later. But while we navigate through this challenge, we are
committed to providing as much forward outlook as we can so you understand the trends driving earnings.

On today's call, I will provide an executive overview of our operational and financial performance for
the first quarter 2020 before offering a more in-depth review of IFF's management of the ongoing and
evolving COVID-19 situation. Following this discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a more detailed
financial review of business, including additional insight into our liquidity and capital structure, which is
very strong, given the uncertainty of the pandemic going forward.

As you may also have seen, today, we announced important progress related to our pending combination
with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences, including a new guiding purpose and vision for the future combined
company as well as our operating model and executive management team post close. Following Rustom's
remarks, I will provide an overview of these important integration updates. Upon the completion of our
prepared commentary, we will take any questions that you may have.

Our strong performance for the first quarter 2020 affirms the strength of our organization and the
essential position in serving vital end markets through economic cycles. We achieved a strong start to the
year with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth, both of which are
currency-neutral basis. Importantly, we continue to achieve financial benefits related to our integration of
the Frutarom business, both revenue and cost synergies.

As I mentioned before, we have also made significant progress with integration planning to support our
combination with the DuPont N&B business. And I must acknowledge our teams that have worked hard to
build the foundation for this combination while continuing to contribute to IFF's day-to-day operations.

Our teams have worked tirelessly to deliver for our customers. They have gone above and beyond to
support our communities around the world during this time. Our strong quarter is a testament to their
unwavering dedication, the underlying strength of our business and our role as an essential partner in the
global food and consumer product supply chains. While we have certainly faced many challenges through
these unprecedented situation, our operations and global network remains strong, and we have taken
appropriate steps to ensure our business is well positioned to successfully manage through the pandemic.

Looking at our financial performance in the first quarter, I am pleased to say we delivered strong
improvements across key financial metrics. In the first quarter, IFF achieved sales of USD 1.3 billion,
which represents a 6% growth on currency-neutral basis, driven by our performance in both our Taste and
Scent businesses. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share of $1.62, excluding amortization,
reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral adjusted
operating profit of 9% to USD 271 million.

In addition, we expanded our operating margin, excluding amortization, by 60 basis points to 20.1%,
driven by volume growth and productivity. In summary, IFF entered 2020 with solid momentum and
continued to deliver currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits through the end of February.
However, for March onwards, we started to see the global impact of COVID-19 on our business, and
we expect this to impact our results in the second quarter as we have seen uneven impact across end
markets. Rustom will touch on this in more detail later.

I would like to spend a few moments outlining the key characteristics and drivers of our business, which
leave IFF very well positioned to navigate today's new reality. More than ever, it is clear that IFF plays a
vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for world's most important manufacturers in food and
beverage as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies.

IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient
through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. As a result of regulatory actions and
corresponding economic challenges, we are seeing certain reduction in demand in our Fine Fragrance,
Cosmetic Active and Food Service offerings where end markets are seeing significant impact. This
represents approximately 15% of our revenue. At the same time, we're seeing tremendous pickup in
areas where the solutions that IFF pose are absolutely critical to the production of essential products. Our

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and hygiene and disinfection saw continued strong
growth during the quarter. That is about 85% of our revenue.

Fortunately, our operations remain strong as we continue to deliver the creative solutions that our
customers and end consumers demand during these unprecedented times. Our goal from the outset
of this crisis has been twofold. First, we are deeply determined to ensure the well-being of our people.
Second, we are committed to preserving continuity across the network so that we can continue meeting
the needs of our customers. Our global, regional and local crisis teams are working around the clock to do
what is the best for our people and our business. A co-working group, including representative from our
executive team and across functional support groups and business teams, meets daily to ensure alignment
from top to bottom across our teams. This team is putting in place plans and protocols to be sure we are
anticipating what is to come and keep all of our stakeholders engaged through this extended period of
disruption.

We have been proactively reviewing our resiliency plan to address the COVID-19 developments, and we
are coordinating our response with federal and local health and government entities around the world. We
have updated internal protocols as the situation has evolved, taking significant measures to protect our
people, including implementing enhanced disinfection and sanitation measures at our operational facilities
and taking precautions to minimize contact among employees as part of social distancing by grouping our
professionals into smaller pots and separating their work shifts. For those able to work from home, we're
instituting a remote working policy across many of our locations as well.

Given IFF's vital role in the consumer product supply chain, we continue to secure essential designations
that provide our company with permission to manufacture our products around the world as governments
extend workplace restrictions. A good example of our team working through these unexpected
challenges has been India. Recently, our Chennai facility, where we have been secured essential business
designations, was still forced to shut for several days due to regulatory restrictions. Thanks to the
diligence of our team and a strong working relationship with regulators, we were able to move ahead of
time in response to the shutdown to meet all customer demands through the shutdown while keeping
employees safe.

In terms of our operations, we are seeing some challenges with logistics, and our lead times have
increased, but the team is doing an excellent job navigating the transportation restrictions. We realize
we are certainly not alone in this challenge. For these reasons, we have also seen some limitation in raw
material distribution and have activated our contingency plans to limit the disruption that any material
shortages might have for our customers.

Now we have seen disruptions to our supply chain, it has been mostly limited to the regions where the
most significant government restrictions are in place, including Italy, Spain and India. On the new project
and innovation front, most of our creative centers remain open and are engaging remotely as needed, and
I'm happy to say that our project pipeline remains solid across our entire portfolio.

As I mentioned from the outset, our business has displayed impressive resilience through the evolving
situation. We continue to proactively take steps that will ensure that IFF is operating from a position of
financial strength. Specifically, we're adapting an especially disciplined approach to cost management.
This means we are tightening any nonessential spend and reviewing new opportunities for efficiencies that
can preserve our margin profile. We also are looking at CapEx and considering near-term priorities while
pushing out longer-term investments as appropriate. And we are considering additional ways to optimize
our net working capital by closely reviewing existing inventories and pursuing collections. Lastly, we have
a strong cash position with USD 1 billion of untapped credit revolver available, giving us confidence in
ensuring our strong position even in the event of a prolonged economic downturn.

Even in the midst of increased demand and the challenging operating environment, our teams have
mobilized to support frontline health care workers and first responders across the global IFF network.
IFFers across the globe have found very creative ways to leverage the company's unique capabilities and
innovative spirit and lead a number of exciting community-focused initiatives, including from New Jersey
to the Netherlands, IFF has modified our production facilities to allow for the manufacture and distribution
of hand sanitizers. To date, I have estimated more than 65 metric tons of hand sanitizers globally to first

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

responders and other organizations in need. Our North America Scent creator team quickly developed a
new scent, HOPE 2020, that has been used by IFF and other partners in the production of hand sanitizers.
Our Scent team has also partnered with Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital to create early
detection smell test for asymptomatic carriers, the first developed globally.

In India, our facilities donated food and other necessary sanitation items to local orphanages, hospitals
and police stations. These actions speak to how our employees continue to embody our commitment to
care for the resources of our world, and nothing could be more important than caring for our communities.

I could not be more proud of the spirit of caring that IFF has demonstrated throughout the global
pandemic.

With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom, who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in
greater detail.

Rustom F. Jilla
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, and taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial
performance.

On a currency-neutral basis, IFF delivered broad-based sales growth of 6% versus 2019's first quarter.
Adjusted operating profit margin improved in both Taste and Scent with procurement synergies; volume
leverage; and productivity initiatives; and disciplined research, sales and administration for RSA cost
containment. And this helped reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales. I am therefore
pleased to say that we also saw solid profit growth in roughly 60 points of currency-neutral margin
expansion on an adjusted operating profit mix amount basis.

COVID-19 did impact our P&L in Q1, but more in terms of sales mix rather than in total dollars and only in
the final weeks of the quarter. It did have a modest negative impact on our adjusted operating profit in the
quarter, causing us to incur extra manufacturing costs, additional freight expenses and higher raw material
costs. But most of these went into inventory and will not be with expenses.

Our currency-neutral earnings per share, excluding amortization, grew a strong 13%, with robust
operating profit growth boosted by lower year-on-year interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate. FX
adversely impacted our reported numbers, pulling sales and adjusted operating profits down a couple of
percent. It had a much larger negative impact on other income/expenses in March as a result of currencies
collapsing globally against the dollar and the euro. So on a reported basis, this pulled down year-on-year
adjusted EPS growth.

Now looking at our Scent division on Slide 13. In the first quarter, currency-neutral Scent sales grew
7% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Sales performance was strongest in Consumer
Fragrance with a double-digit increase led by robust growth in Fabric, Home and Hair Care. And while
we did experience a volume lift from COVID-19, especially from the increase in hygiene and disinfection
categories, we also benefited from strong new wins, including with customers where we have recently
gained access to their call list. We also saw high single-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients, led by robust
volume growth.

At the same time, Fine Fragrance sales declined as disruption of consumer access to retail markets, and a
pronounced drop in global travel due to COVID-19 led to deceleration late in the quarter. Fine Fragrances
started 2020 well and was growing until the last couple of weeks of the quarter even against last Q1
double-digit comp. And then we saw a significant contraction as our customers adapted their supply chains
for new store closure and travel realities. This trend has continued in Q2 with a far greater impact, and I
will elaborate on this shortly.

For the entire Scent segment, we posted a 20.4% segment profit margin. And segment profit grew
to $105 million, up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by volume growth and lower operating
expenses.

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

Moving to Taste on Slide 14. We saw currency-neutral sales growth of 5% in the first quarter having
achieved increases in all regions. We saw mid- to high single-digit growth in LatAm, Greater Asia and
EMEA. From a category perspective, we again saw significant mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions with
very strong growth in EMEA, our largest market, and also LatAm.

Flavors grew low single digits, led by Greater Asia and Latin America. And this was driven by strong
commercial performance on new wins, in particular, in the attractive categories of Beverage and Dairy.

Though Frutarom is now mostly incorporated in the Taste business, we did commit to continue providing
updates as to how sales are doing as if this had remained on a stand-alone basis. So if we had measured
Frutarom as a stand-alone, currency-neutral sales would have grown by roughly 4% versus the prior year.

For the entire Taste business, we had a 16.5% margin with segment profit growing 6% to $137 million, led
by volume benefits and Frutarom integration-related synergies. You may have noticed that this segment
profit margin appears lower than you are used to seeing. This is because Frutarom is now included, and
there is approximately $44 million of amortization of intangible assets.

Now I would like to provide an update on cash flow through the first quarter of 2020. The chart on Page
15 is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to cash flow, inclusive of all the
drivers. Operating cash flow was $17 million in the first quarter, down from $47 million in 2019's first
quarter, primarily due to higher core working capital levels. Within core working capital, we had solid
improvements in inventory that were offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of strong sales in Q1
2020 as well as 2019 calendar shift. We expect the portion of this will normalize as we move through the
year. Nevertheless, our cash conversion cycle in Q1 2020 was consistent with 2019's first quarter.

We continue to invest in the business, particularly for planned capacity increases and Frutarom
integrations. Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2020 was 3.6%, and
this was versus last year's 4.5%. And I will touch on our outlook for the balance of the year in a moment.

The net impact on our free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was a negative $31
million. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonably lowest quarter of the year, and last year, it was a negative
$11 million.

In terms of cash usage, M&A and earn-outs and dividends amounted to $94 million versus $112 million in
the prior year's first quarter, and this was all due to lower M&A and earn-outs.

As Andreas noted before, we are taking steps to preserve our strong financial position at this time. Given
the current environment and the possibility that the global economy could face a protracted downturn, we
are constantly refining our scenario planning to ensure we are well prepared. This starts with controlling
what we can control, targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. We are being very cautious
with hiring, mainly just critical replacement positions and a handful of critical new hires. And we are
reducing any and all nonessential spend in the near term, including the likes of travel, entertainment,
consulting, et cetera.

COVID-19 does bring some working capital headwind. We have experienced supply chain disruptions as
various countries took lockdown action. We value our long-term customer relationships, so we purchased
additional raw materials to serve as safety stocks, giving us capability to move manufacturing around and,
in general, to help insulate against supply chain disruption as we've seen in India. We are also paying
some of our smaller and/or COVID-19-impacted suppliers more promptly if this is warranted. And this
could be expected. We're experiencing an increase in receivables, particularly from Food Service and Fine
Fragrance customers.

Of course, we're working to offset these working capital pressures where we can. For inventory, we are
constantly balancing the need to ensure business continuity during COVID-19 with the need to not over
order. Where we could extend our payables, we are working with suppliers to do so. And we are pursuing
collections from customers with over dues and being proactive with those where there is credit risk.

For capital expenditures, we are targeting reductions across the business. Specifically, we are prioritizing
the highest-returning projects while delaying longer-term investments that are not absolutely necessary at

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

this time. And of course, practically, COVID-19 is making it much harder to launch our complete projects
where significant travel is required. Moving forward, we also have to be smart to ensure that we invest in
a flexible and healthy ecosystem.

Turning to Slide 17. As we consider our current capital structure and manage our balance sheet moving
forward, we've outlined our upcoming debt maturity schedule, which includes a good balance of short- and
long-term tiers. We have strong and ample liquidity, well within our debt covenants as our net debt-to-
EBITDA at the end of Q1 2020 was 3.3x. Our cash position at the end of Q1 is strong at $433 million with
$1 billion of an untapped credit revolver available should we need it. Looking ahead, following the close
of the DuPont N&B transaction, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. As stated
in December, we intend to quickly delever after the close of the transaction to get below 3x net debt-to-
EBITDA within the following 24 months.

Now turning to our outlook. To conceptualize our expected sales dynamic in Q2, I wanted to highlight the
many moving parts we are seeing and expecting this quarter. COVID-19 presents both opportunities and
challenges as we forge ahead. Starting on the left side of the slide, we expect to see continued robust
growth in our Taste business, excluding Food Service as well as in our Consumer Fragrance business. The
demand and consumption of the products that these businesses are supporting remain high, and we are
well positioned with our global footprint to capitalize on this. In the middle box is Fragrance Ingredients
where demand is strong. However, we are facing challenges in the supply chain and, in particular, the
Indian lockdown. This means that we have to forgo external sales to ensure that we protect our Fragrance
compounds business.

The last category is where demand has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Food Service, with a vast
stay-at-home orders across the globe as well as changes in consumer behaviors, have impacted away-
from-home consumption. Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives, where the retail channels have been
temporarily closed and travel retail is down, both due to COVID-19, as well as these categories being more
discretionary in nature.

Now more than ever, IFF's broad-based exposure across the regions, categories and customers positions
us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges. We are fortunate that the majority of our revenues
comes from categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and from hygiene and disinfection, so
parts of our business are experiencing higher sales volumes in this current environment. Having said this,
we're not totally immune. Not surprisingly, April's currency-neutral sales were challenged, with strong
Consumer Fragrance and Flavors, offset primarily by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. For the
second quarter, while we are not giving specific guidance, it is worth noting that with the pressure in Fine
Fragrances, operating margin mix will be a headwind as well as the additional COVID-19-related costs.

We continue to evaluate what evolving global market dynamics will mean for our business performance
and projections moving forward. As the second quarter progresses and we gain greater visibility, as
Andreas noted, we'll provide updates as appropriate. While our ability to pivot quickly and modify our daily
operation has enabled us to responsibly operate our business, the constantly evolving global responses to
COVID-19 have created uncertainties for IFF and for other companies and our partners as well. Given the
extent of the current uncertainty globally and the potential for uneven impact on our businesses, we have
decided to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. We will continue to manage our business by taking actions
to generate strong cash flow and maintain ample liquidity.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Andreas.

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Rustom. I'm also very pleased that today, we're introducing the next step in our planned
integration process with N&B. As you know, we are extremely excited to combine our 2 customer-focused
and consumer-led organizations with leading positions in high-value categories. Together, our product
portfolio will be among the industry most robust and diverse. We have a coveted R&D program with an
industry-leading pipeline, and most importantly, we will be poised to redefine our industry by delivering

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

essential solutions to our customers. We remain on target to close the transaction in the first quarter of
2021. Until then, IFF and N&B will remain independent entities and will operate separately.

Since we announced our merger in December 2019, our teams have been hard at work bringing this
combination to life. We have formal integration management office, cleared the U.S. regulatory process,
filed for regulatory events in Europe and China and filed our initial registration statement. The potential of
this combination continues to excite our teams, and we are working diligently to make sure we can hit the
ground in full sprint on day 1.

Some of our important highlights over the past 4 months include: completed strategic assessment of the
future combined company portfolio, joint cross-function integration program in place and operational,
created ideation framework to identify, assess and prioritize synergy opportunities. Today, we took another
significant step forward. We have announced our purpose, vision and operating model and Executive
Committee for the future combined company. In short, we are announcing who we'll be, what we intend
to do and who will lead our incredible team once we combine forces with the N&B business in the first
quarter of 2021.

Our purpose is the why that drives everything we do. The combined companies' purpose, applying science
and creativity for a better world, we'll focus on our intent to push past traditional industry boundaries and
commit to be a force for a better, more sustainable future. We will shape the future of our industry with
best-in-class solutions at the intersection of science and creativity. We're passionate organizations made of
team members who see their job as so much more. Our collective purpose inspires us every day to strive
for better.

It's not just that we are talented scientists and creators, but that we are passionate about using those
talents to generate results for our customers and for the world. We need both, the rigor of scientific
expertise and the imagination of new possibilities, to create the best results. The fusion of both that will
lead us to realizing the full potential of this combination.

Everything we do is for the purpose of improving the world, lengthening life spans, replacing or sustaining
resources, enhancing sensorial experiences, solving house problems and more. And together, we can do
even more good.

Creative science, scientific art, when science and creativity intersect, the possibilities are better. Here,
innovation isn't a department. It's our business. Incredible curiosity, relentless drive, purposeful impact,
innovation is simply our way of operating, and now with double the R&D resources, unmatched in the
industry. If you are keeping track, our people can't wait to get starting collaborating on something new.

We are shaping the future of the industry for the better. Our vision is our strategy for future success. It
articulates our aspirations and guides the development of future strategies and initiatives. It is a filter by
which endeavors can be evaluated. Our vision is to be the partner for essential solutions. From day 1, we
will bring unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight to anticipate what will be essential to tomorrow's
consumers. Helping our customers and consumers need is at the heart of our business.

We are more than a vendor or supplier. Yes, we supply the ingredients, compounds and solutions you
require, but we're also united in understanding and meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow.
Essential solutions means that we will work to make both our relationship and what we provide invaluable
to our customers' business. It pushes us to supply technology and know-how that no one else can.
With customers of all sizes across the globe, from start-up to multinational, we have the agility and the
expertise to deliver what you need. Unmatched innovation and leading-edge insight means we are already
anticipating what will be essential to tomorrow's consumers. As we come together as one organization, we
can help our customers meet consumers' needs faster.

Our new operational model will leverage the capabilities and offerings of both organizations to create
a sustainable framework that best position our teams, customers, shareholders for success on day 1
and well into the future. The complementary structure will focus our organization into 4 divisions: Taste,
Food and Beverage; Scent; Health & Bioscience; and Pharma Solutions. We carefully examined how each

division go to market, including customer overlap, R&D focus and service level requirements. Among
other, several factors to make sure we created global divisions that were built for success.

Just as important as our 4 operating divisions will be our global centralized functions. Each of these will
work in collaboration across our divisions. I want to call out, in particular, that we will be establishing
a new integrated solution Center of Excellence to focus on incubating new business opportunities and
total product solutions. We are also creating a Center for Commercial Excellence to support our business
and commercial teams through development of best practices, customer insights and analysis, resource
deployment and the optimization of pricing strategies and solutions. These 2 are extremely important as it
will be instrumental collaborating with the business to achieve our revenue synergy goals.

We also announced the Executive Committee for the combined company, including highly qualified and
diverse leaders with deep knowledge and expertise. If you're interested in the team's background, please
check out on strongerinnovationtogether.com. I won't go through all of these distinguished leaders here,
but I will note that this was a particular challenging process. Most organizations have tremendously
talented individuals. We are fortunate that as a significantly large organization, we will be able to create
many challenging, exciting new opportunities to further the careers of our employees.

I'm also very encouraged by the world-class Board of Directors we are beginning to assemble. As shared
at the deal announcement, DuPont Executive Chairman and CEO, Ed Breen, will join the Board of the
combined company as the DuPont designee following the close of a transaction and will serve as lead
Independent Director starting in June 1, 2021.

I'm also pleased to say that Matthias Heinzel, President of Nutrition & Biosciences at Dupont, will be
joining the Board of Directors of IFF following the close of the transaction. Under his leadership, Matthias
has strategically transformed the N&B business, driving customer-focused innovation, operational
effectiveness and multiple business integrations. As an Independent Director, his extensive global
management experience and deep knowledge of the industry will support the future company as it unlocks
the value of the merger.

In addition, Carol A. Davidson will also be appointed to join the Board of Directors of the future combined
company following the close of the transaction. Mr. Davidson is a CPA with more than 30 years of
leadership experience across multiple industries. He has held a variety of leadership roles at Tyco,
International TE and Dell Inc. and financial leadership roles at the Eastman Kodak Company. Mr. Davidson
is the lead Independent Director of Legg Mason and serves on the Board of TE Connectivity. For this team,
both Board and management, I know our combined company will charge a new path forward for our
industry and have a powerful impact on the world around us.

Stepping back, I will say that I'm deeply impressed, even more so given COVID-19, by the dedication and
focus both the IFF and N&B teams have brought to this effort. We knew early on that these companies
would be a strong cultural match, and our excitement and conviction behind the potential of this
combination was only grown as our teams begin more and more to cooperate. As we look ahead, we are
focused on executing the next key milestones and will do so within the same spend and diligence we have
achieved thus far.

In summary, we are pleased with our strong financial performance despite an unprecedented first quarter
2020. We delivered on all of our key metrics and saw broad-based growth in both divisions with mid-
single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth on a consolidated basis. We
continue to make important progress in the integration of Frutarom business and have taken substantial
steps forward in bringing on our combination with DuPont and N&B to life.

I'm also credibly proud of each and every one of my colleagues at IFF for what they have achieved
during these challenging times, not just for our business, but for our partners, our customers and our
communities.

While global conditions remain volatile in the near term, our order book for Q2 looks solid as we are
successfully navigating through these unprecedented times to emerge as a stronger company.
I would now like to open the call for questions.

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take a question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.

Mark Stiefel Astrachan
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Speaking of promotions, by the way, congrats, Senior Vice President, well deserved there. So I guess I
wanted to talk a bit about just general sales ordering turns. Basically talk a bit about whatever you can
on emerging versus developing markets, anything notable there? As well as between multinational and
local and regional customers, especially related to the Frutarom business? And what are you hearing from
customers regarding timing of new product launches? And how does any change impact IFF or even just
category dynamics?

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Mark, I will take it. The emerging markets in the first quarter were particularly strong, Latin America
by round about 10% and Greater Asia by plus 9%. What we see in terms of the different categories,
in particular, the Consumer Fragrance in Latin America in high-teens, as well as Flavors, high single,
and Savory Solutions in high-teens as well. So really, really good results. Probably strongest from the
multinationals, specifically in the HBC field. In Asia, it was all about Consumer Fragrances as well, so mid-
teens, really good. Taste in high single digits. No surprise to COVID-19, I would say. And here in Asia, very
much across both multinationals as well as regional and locals. Frutarom, as we said, is probably around
about 4% growth with some benefits of smaller M&A, but still a very, very good performance.

I would say, country wise, it depends where the COVID-19 wave has started. We have seen the first
impact in Asia, in particular, in China, then it moved to Europe, then to the U.S. and Latin America. So
that's probably what you can see in the first quarter.

In terms of the pipeline, our pipeline remains strong also into the second quarter. But having said all
of that, it's really different from customer to customer. I can say, also for us, our accretive labs are
basically almost all open. They're working on new launches. They're working on, let's say, better, let's say,
improvements of some of the products. So all in all, I would say, a very strong picture. Certainly, impact
on Fine Fragrance because -- and you heard this from our customer base as well, which is not positive.
But all the essential products are really going actually very, very strong.

Rustom, you might comment on that.

Rustom F. Jilla
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, I actually agree. There's not much to add there, Andreas. You covered it.

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Good.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Mike Sison of Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Glad to sound -- you guys all sound happy and a nice start to the year. Andreas, you've made some
progress on transaction, getting your operating model leadership team in place. And how much can you

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

do before you close the deal to get the integration synergies accelerated? And then -- and maybe just talk
about how you think about the transaction different now given the current environment?

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Let me start probably with the second part of your question first. So combination with the DuPont
N&B business is fully on track. And if you look at the product portfolio, it's now among the industry, in
particular, in this COVID-19 situation, one of the most robust ones and very diverse. We're in all of the
categories, #1 and #2 in the market. We have a great R&D pipeline with a combined spend of around
about $550 million, more than 9,000 patents granted. So I believe very, very robust. And as you have
seen the N&B results in the first quarter as well, it shows it's an essential business. Probiotics are going
gangbusters and many of the other portfolio areas as well.

Coming back to the integration fees. So as you know, we have formed an IMO, so an integration
management office. We cleared antitrust in the U.S. We filed in Europe and in China. The combined
integration planning can do a lot, which is even in these challenging times, and I'm very, very pleased how
they worked together all over Zoom or Skype. Of course, it's very, very interesting. So we really make
sure that we are ready for day 1. The next up on the schedule is the shareholder vote in September, then
the financing and then the close, hopefully, in the first quarter 2021. So I have to say that this COVID-19
has further solidified our position. Strategic logic is very strong. Very resilient business. Very great market
position. And I believe that we're in a very, very good spot right now.

Operator

We'll move next to John Roberts of UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

For the 15% of sales that are impacted by COVID-19, have you had 2 sequential weeks of stable sales
yet? Or were they still declining at the end of April? And where are those product line sales in China versus
the start of the year?

Rustom F. Jilla
Executive VP & CFO

It's Rustom. Let me take that. No, we have still had sales decline, I mean, as we go through and look
at that area. It's Fine Fragrance and Food Services that we really see. But let me just step back for a
second. I mean look, from March onwards, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally, we had lockdowns,
changes in customer order patterns. We are fortunate that most of our revenue comes from the packaged
Food and Beverage categories as well as hygiene and disinfection, right? Those -- so we have continued
strength there. I mean the path that you're referring to is the part that we're not immune, is the
categories most exposed to retail end markets where stores closed and travel dropped sharply. And that
hasn't changed as of now. So that's Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives as well, right? And also the
away-from-home channels. So we're seeing that impact, and we are choosing to be -- try to stay resilient,
flexible, close to our customers as we possibly can be. And always, sort of trying to be cognizant of the
safety of our employees and well-being as we go forward.

China, regarding the China, part of your question. Fine Fragrance is a very small part of the portfolio, I
mean, based on category demand, I mean, less than 2% of total Fine. And although it was quite strong
in Q1, I mean, we -- that sea in China is opening up as well. Now Food Service in China was particularly
challenged in Q1. That's obviously COVID. And I think that answers your questions, John.

Operator

Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

Yes. So I also just wanted to hone in on trends that you've seen since the quarter in April and May. And
in particular, I was wondering if it's possible for you to maybe disaggregate the benefit from potential
stockpiling versus underlying demand. And I'm particularly focused on Consumer Fragrances where you
had double-digit growth. And I know you mentioned that emerging markets were particularly strong where
I don't think there was much stockpiling. But I was just wondering if you could offer more perspective
there and how you're thinking -- what trends you have seen since the end of the quarter and how you're
thinking about the sustainability of growth there as we go through the year?

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Absolutely, Faiza. Let me get started, then I hand it over to Rustom. It's hard to disaggregate the
underlying demand versus stockpiling. But we talk with many of our customers. And we believe on the
Consumer Fragrance side, certainly, the activity in washing clothes and detergent, the softeners, it's very
much demand. It's not so much stockpiling here. I think we see this. We see also all the hygiene products
are really used. It's not just that people put it in the pantry. But that's what we see. And also on the Food
side, when you talk to some of our customers, the yogurts are going like there's no tomorrow, which
is probably not a big surprise to all of us because working from home, instead of going to the company
cafeteria, you go to the fridge and pull a yogurt and that's your lunch. So we see some categories very
much it's consumption. It's moving, but I can't give you all the details. What is for us, right now, really
important is on the consumer insight side. We do all of our studies, we know how the consumer behaves
right now. And what is sustainable? So that we really can orient ourselves in terms of our R&D and the
new product development towards things which might will come. We believe that everything in terms of
sanitizing will stay. We believe also that many of the health products, in particular, fortified with vitamins
or probiotics will stay. But there's more to come. So that's the work we are doing right now. So in many
areas, the consumption is real. By the way, one last one, potato chips are also going like gangbusters. But
Rustom, please comment.

Rustom F. Jilla
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Andreas. Thank you. Faiza, so yes, look at the raw materials part of your questions. And yes,
we've had some limitations in raw material sourcing and logistics. And we activated our contingency
plans very early to limit the disruption to our customers, right? And the disruptions were from material
shortages because of government restriction of various sorts. As Andreas said earlier, it's in Italy,
Spain, India, with 3 of them out there. I mean the part of your question -- then you also talked about
sustainability, right? Sustainability of Consumer Fragrance, we do believe this will continue to be robust.
Consumer demand remains high in hygiene and disinfection. And if anyone has been to the store lately,
it's just hard to get those products, right?

But let me address one aspect, too. I mean the Scent profitability because of specifics and because of
Fine, right? Scent profitability without -- that will still be adversely impacted in Q2. I don't -- I can't get
into -- I don't want to get into specifics, but based on our largest -- what our largest Fine Fragrances
customers are saying publicly, the category is declining double digits. So I'd expect the same for IFF
and our competitors. And being that it is one of our highest-margin categories, well above consolidated
average, and with these declines, margins will be down. Then you add in additional COVID costs that we
had in Q2, a full quarter's worth then that's just another factor.

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So it all depends right now when the economy is opening up and the stores are open, and some
of these products can be sold again to our consumers. I think that's what we're all waiting. And the big
experiment, it's not so much China because it's very small for this category, as Rustom said. But what will
happen now in Europe, you see Germany is basically open. We will see next week France is opening again
and Spain and Italy. And then we take it from there. So it's a very volatile environment, but we are very
well prepared for it. I hope that helps Faiza.

Operator

We'll move next to PJ Juvekar of Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Andreas, quick question for you. We talked about this restocking quite a bit here in the pantries and so
on and so forth. When do you think orders go back to normal level? And then as the economies open
up, is there some destocking in the pantries? And related to that, that's the inventory at the sort of the
household level, but what are the inventory levels at your plants and in the supply chain?

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Okay. No. It's a very, very important point, actually, and we are looking at this. I would say in some of
the countries, we have seen already a normalization because people are back to work and people see
that they can buy everything. You might remember at the beginning, toilet paper was also very precious
article around the world in many of the supermarkets. But that's back to normal. So actually, we have
seen already quite a normalization, not because COVID is gone, but people see and feel that they can buy
whatever they need. There was not a big disruption in the supply chain. So we believe that the inventory
has changed. It's different than in pharmaceuticals, for example, where people just keeping their diabetes
product better for 3 or 4 months instead of 1 month to make sure that they are covered. But here, I think
in many cases, we are already back to normal.

On the plants, it's a bit of a different situation because we are managing the supply chain actually almost
by the week because India, which is a big country for raw materials in our industry, has some challenges
with lockdown as well. So we really had to make sure that we get enough inventory in all the plants
around the world to secure supply for our customers. So here, you probably will see some elevated
inventory levels for quite some time. But again, situation is volatile. I expected this actually for the first
quarter as well. But we were selling so much, the inventory actually went down. So that's our plan of
basically what we assume for now, but it might change because it's very dependent on the demand as
well.

But Rustom, maybe you comment.

Rustom F. Jilla
Executive VP & CFO

I mean, again, I mean, you covered it. I mean -- but PJ, I mean this is really hard to predict, right,
because you're going into the government regulations, consumer psychology and also the possible fear of
any wave 2s or anything like that. I mean you never know. It's hard to predict. But even after COVID-19, I
mean consumers, actual consumers might maintain higher stockpiles as a common practice, who knows.

Operator

Our next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the performance in the first quarter in the Taste segment,
specifically around the margins. I'm just trying to think about margins that were essentially flat year-
on-year and kind of just thinking about the -- against pretty healthy top line growth. So how many can
you construct that in terms of mix, in terms of incremental Frutarom synergies, in terms of COVID-
related costs? And then just thinking about balance of the year, kind of, has the expectation on Frutarom
synergies changed? Specifically, kind of, can you do all the facilities closures you were looking for this year
given the pandemic?

15

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

Adam, it's Rustom. So let me take that action. You actually were -- you were triangulating in on exactly
what the factors were. So in the -- first of all, we are on track with our cost synergies target through Q1,
Frutarom, I mean, with more than 25% of our $50 million full year savings coming in Q1. And in terms of
geography, it's about 3/4 Taste and the rest in Scent roughly, okay?

The Scent synergies showed through. And as you saw Scent's performance, there's consumer leverage.
But Taste, where you're homing in, did benefit some synergies as well. But it also had mix. I mean we
went straight there. We also had mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions, which is a lower-margin business.
We had the loss CitraSource, and then we have some added costs, right? Manufacturing and procurement,
and cost hid up in the balance sheet and everything. But we also had some bad debt as we increased our
bad debt provision, not actual bad debts but actually provisions as we did. So there were all offsets in
here.

Now as to your second part of your question about the ongoing plans that we have. I mean, yes, there will
be some delays. There's a little bit of disruptions to achieving, in particular, the manufacturing synergies
that we expected from Frutarom, right? And that's quite simply because we can't -- the people are
not traveling out to various sites. Even we're working from home quite effectively. But as Andreas has
mentioned, too, we do prioritize the safety of our people. And people are just not traveling out to site. So
there will be some delays in realizing the synergies from Frutarom coming through. And the same thing on
procurement. On the procurement then, by the way, because with the huge disruption that we've seen out
there in the -- in raw materials and sourcing and all the rest of that, that hasn't shown up in our P&L. But
that's because our teams have been sort of pulling in really hard yards, making sure that we handled all
this without disrupting our customers, right? But something gives, and that something is -- one of those
things that it have given is pushing through some of those other synergies. Andreas, is there anything you
want to add there as well?

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Actually, just one thing on the closure of the factories. We might have, in some cases, a delay of maybe 2
to 3 months. That's what we are planning right now. So we will be done with what we saw in mid-end of
third quarter, mid and end of fourth quarter. So that's the planning right now. I hope, Adam, that helps.

Operator

We'll take a question from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. It'd be good to actually just clarify that. So I think in the Q, it was -- on the Frutarom integration,
there were risks associated with not being done with the work this year and said it could even extend into
not just fiscal '21, but into '22. So I just wanted to kind of clarify that versus what you had just said about
the only a 3-month delay on synergy.

And then just more broadly on Frutarom. I was just curious to know kind of what drove the upside in the
quarter. Is it sustainable? From what we can see, it looks like Savory was a big part of that. And just is
that also -- we talked about some mix dynamic, the areas in Frutarom that are coming through maybe a
bit better than expected. Is that also another drive on mix?

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Let me start with the second piece first. We have seen a couple of elements of the legacy Food
business which performed very well and we believe it's sustainable. So everything which is connected to
health, we believe, will be sustainable because that's an incredible drive for the sales ingredients. That's
number one.

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 12, 2020

The second one is on food protection because people really want to increase shelf life and make sure that
this works out well. So that's going extremely well, double digit, but we believe it will be also sustainable.

And then on Savory, we will see. The Savory Solutions has made actually extreme progress in terms of
bringing it together with the legacy flavors. And we have seen good developments. Whether this is --
certainly not sustainable in a double-digit growth rate, it is more dependent on how quickly the economies
open up and how much is in the Food Service area because that certainly has more of a negative impact
here as well. On the other hand, this is part of this famous butchers business. People in Austria and
Germany were eating meat like there's no tomorrow because all the restaurants were closed, and that
helped us with our sales as well. So sometimes, it's -- these are interesting, interesting dynamics. But I
hope that helps as an explanation.

And then on the food integration, risk associated was not being done with the integration work before
merging with DuPont. It is basically some -- 1 or 2, on our manufacturing plants, we just hold back
because we believe with N&B now we have a different way forward where we can use these capacities and
can use them for some of the N&B products. So we do note everything, which we have said we are doing.
Despite the things where we believe with the N&B combination, we have a better way forward when we
have N&B on board as well. So that's it. That's the only thing. And that's on Tilburg in Holland, but that's
it. We can't talk more in detail. I hope that helps.

Operator

We are now past the top of the hour, and we'll now conclude the call. I now want to hand it back to
Andreas for closing remarks.

Andreas Fibig
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thank you very much for the time. I hope everybody is healthy and stays healthy. And we certainly
have time to speak over the next 1 or 2 days. Thank you very much. Take care. Bye-bye.

Operator
This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines, and everyone have a good
day.
