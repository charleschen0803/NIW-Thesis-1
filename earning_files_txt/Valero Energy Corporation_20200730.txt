Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to Valero's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor
Relations.

Homer Bhullar
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call.

With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser,
our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial
Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.

If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at
valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information
on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to
contact our investor relations team after the call.

I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the
press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that
state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking
statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There
are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've
described in our filings with the SEC.

Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Homer. And good morning, everyone.

This year has been challenging in many aspects. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing global
economic downturn has affected the health and livelihoods of so many people and has had a severe
impact on all businesses, including ours. As troubling as our circumstances may be from time to time, it's
gratifying to see individuals stepping up, selflessly helping those in need, whether it be by providing health
care to those that are sick or food to those that are hungry. In this regard, our team is doing its part.

As you probably know, Valero is part of the country's critical infrastructure. As such, our team continues to
operate our plants, providing the fuel that our country needs to keep critical supplies and first responders
moving. I'm proud that we have not laid off, furloughed or reduced the compensation of any of our 10,000
dedicated employees, who continue to give generously, volunteering their time and working courageously
and tirelessly through this difficult period. Our employees are our greatest asset and the heart of our
company. Their health, safety and well-being remain among our top priorities; and we'll continue to take
the steps necessary to keep them safe whether they work in the field or at our headquarters.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic-imposed shutdown, we had to make important operational and
financial decisions. When the stay-at-home orders were first issued, we reduced our refinery and ethanol
plant throughput rates to match product supply with demand. We saw demand in April bottom out at 50%
of normal demand for gasoline, 70% for diesel and 30% for jet fuel relative to the same period last year.
As the stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions eased through most regions of the U.S. during the

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

second quarter, we saw gasoline and diesel demand recover to 85% to 90% of normal and jet fuel recover
to 50% of normal. We also saw a recovery in product exports to Latin America and Europe in June. As a
result, we prudently increased refining and ethanol throughput rates in step with the increase in product
demand. We also took prudent actions to maintain our financial strength. We lowered our 2020 capital
budget by $400 million; raised $1.5 billion of debt at attractive rates; secured an additional credit facility,
which remains undrawn; and temporarily suspended the stock buyback program, beginning in mid-March
this year. And through all of this, we've honored our commitment to capital discipline and maintained our
dividend, as demonstrated by our Board of Directors approving a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share
earlier this month.

Notwithstanding project deferrals this year, we continue to invest for earnings growth and are making
progress on strategic projects under development. The St. Charles Alkylation Unit, which is designed to
convert low-value feedstocks into a premium alkylate product, is on track to be completed in the fourth
quarter of this year. The Diamond Pipeline expansion and the Pembroke Cogen project are expected to
be completed in 2021, and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. And we
remain committed to the expansion of our low-carbon renewable diesel business. The Diamond Green
Diesel expansion project is expected to be completed in 2021. This project is expected to increase annual
renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, bringing the total capacity to
675 million gallons per year. In addition, the Diamond Green Diesel continues to make progress on the
advanced engineering review for a potential new 400 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant at our
Port Arthur, Texas facility.

As we focus on the path to recovery with improving product demand, we remain steadfast in the execution
of our strategy, pursuing excellence in our operations, investing for earnings growth with lower volatility
and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. We continue to prioritize our investment-grade
credit rating and nondiscretionary uses of capital, including sustaining capital expenditures and our
dividend. This uncompromising focus on capital discipline and execution has served us well in the current
pandemic-imposed downturn, and it should continue to position Valero well through the recovery and
beyond.

So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you.

Homer Bhullar
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Joe.

For the second quarter of 2020, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.3 billion or $3.07
per share compared to net income of $612 million or $1.47 per share for the second quarter of 2019.
Second quarter 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $504 million or $1.25 per
share compared to adjusted net income of $665 million or $1.60 per share for the second quarter of 2019.
Second quarter 2020 adjusted results exclude the benefit from an after-tax lower of cost or market or LCM
inventory valuation adjustment of approximately $1.8 billion.

For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the
release.

Operating income for the refining segment was $1.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020 compared to
$1 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the LCM inventory valuation adjustment, the second
quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $383 million. Second quarter 2020
results were impacted by lower product demand and lower prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.3 million barrels per day, which was lower than the second
quarter of 2019 due to lower product demand. Throughput capacity utilization was 74% in the second
quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.39 per barrel were $0.59 per barrel higher than
the second quarter of 2019 primarily due to the effect of lower throughput rates.

Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $129 million in the second quarter of 2020
compared to $77 million in the second quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive blender's tax

credit, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $145 million for the second quarter of 2019.
Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 795,000 gallons per day in the second quarter of 2020, an
increase of 26,000 gallons per day versus the second quarter of 2019.

Operating income for the ethanol segment was $91 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $7
million in the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the benefit from the LCM inventory valuation adjustment,
the second quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the ethanol segment was $20 million. Ethanol
production volumes averaged 2.3 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2020, which was 2.2
million gallons per day lower than the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in adjusted operating income
from the second quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower margin resulting from lower ethanol prices
and lower throughput.

For the second quarter of 2020, general and administrative expenses were $169 million, and net interest
expense was $142 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $578 million and the income tax
expense was $339 million in the second quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate was 20%, which was
affected by the results of certain of our international operations that are taxed at rates that are lower than
the U.S. statutory rate.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $736 million in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the
favorable impact from the change in working capital of $629 million as well as our joint venture partner's
50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in its
working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $38 million.

With regard to investing activities, we made $503 million of capital investments in the second quarter
of 2020, of which approximately $240 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for
turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. Approximately $263 million of the total was for growing
the business. Excluding our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's capital investments, Valero's
capital investments were approximately $448 million.

Moving to financing activities. We returned $400 million to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2020
through our dividend, resulting in a year-to-date total payout ratio of 96% of adjusted net cash provided
by operating activities. As of June 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion of share repurchase authorization
remaining. And on July 16, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share,
further demonstrating our sound financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors.

With respect to balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $12.7 billion,
and cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash
equivalents, was 33%. At the end of June, we had $5.7 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.

Turning to guidance. We still expect annual capital investments for 2020 to be approximately $2.1 billion,
which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments, with about 60%
allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Approximately 30% of our overall growth CapEx
for 2020 is allocated to expanding our renewables business.

For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the
following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.4 million to 1.45 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at
380,000 to 400,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast as -- at 215,000 to 235,000 barrels per day and
North Atlantic at 375,000 to 395,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in
the third quarter to be approximately $4.40 per barrel. With respect to the renewable diesel segment,
we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2020. Operating expenses in 2020 should be
$0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.20 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the third quarter.
Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs
such as depreciation and amortization.

For the third quarter, net interest expense should be about $145 million, and total depreciation and
amortization expense should be approximately $580 million. For 2020, we expect G&A expenses excluding

corporate depreciation to be approximately $825 million. And we expect the RINs expense for the year to
be between $400 million and $500 million.

Lastly, as discussed on our last earnings call, due to the impact of the beneficial tax provisions in the
CARES Act as well as the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, we are not providing any
guidance on our effective tax rate for 2020.
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Prashant Rao of Citigroup.

Prashant Raghavendra Rao
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So I wanted to start on the demand recovery. Joe, you mentioned the rapid recovery in product demand
through 2Q. Can we get a sense of the strength of product demand as we entered the current quarter and
how it's been trending since? And if you could, any color on how to think about that in terms of buckets of
gasoline versus jet, versus diesel and everything else?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes, sure. Gary, do you want to...

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, sure. I'll walk you through it. So I'll start with gasoline. As Joe mentioned, we saw demand fall off to
about 50% of what we would normally have. Our export volumes fell to about 1/3 of where they would
typically be in the second quarter, but as you mentioned, demand has certainly recovered faster than
most people have expected. By May, we were at 77% normal gasoline demand in our system; in June
88% of normal. And we've continued to see recovery as we transition into July. On the export side, as I
mentioned, we bottomed out at about 1/3 of the volume we typically export in the quarter. By June, we
were back to 70% of our normal export volume. July, with the estimates we have today, we'd be about
76% of normal on our export volume. So gasoline demand has recovered much faster than certainly
most would have expected and appears to be pretty strong. On the distillates side, the magnitude of
the demand destruction wasn't nearly as great. As we mentioned, we fell off to about 70% of typical
demand, but diesel demand recovered pretty quickly back to about 80% of normal. In our system, we've
remained about 80% to 85% of normal demand. However, that's below what the DOE was reporting.
The DOE is closer to 94% diesel demand. I think the difference there is certainly in our Three Rivers and
the key system we had a lot of diesel going into the upstream sector, and with lower drilling activity,
we're seeing a little less diesel demand than maybe we're seeing nationwide. Also, just like gasoline in
the export market, we fell off to about 1/3 of our typical export volume in May. Just like gasoline, it has
recovered at a pretty good pace, actually stronger. In June, we were back to about 45% of our normal
export demand. And things have really picked up for diesel export demand in July. Our current estimate
for July would show July export volumes 107% of where they were in July of 2019. I think the other thing
that's really interesting when you look at the export numbers is looking at those export numbers in light of
the U.S. Gulf Coast diesel production. So if you look at our export volumes, last year, in July, we exported
about 1/3 of what our refineries produced, the diesel they produced. July of this year, with our estimate
on exports, it would be 47%. So almost half of what our refineries are making are going to the export
markets.

On the jet side, we've been also seeing recovery in demand. This week's DOE stats would show jet
demand about 60% of normal. I think the DOE data really highlights the importance of the recovery in jet
demand because, as jet demand has recovered, you've seen diesel yields from refinery fall off significantly.
So where we've peaked at about 39% diesel yield, that's come down to about 32% diesel yield. As you
continue to see jet demand recovery, you'll see diesel yield fall off from the refineries, which will really
help the diesel supply-demand balances. I think on the jet side that would be the only sign that we're
seeing that's a little bit troubling. Certainly with some of the renewed efforts to slow the spread of the
pandemic and many of the states shutting down, we don't have a lot of good line of sight into jet demand,
but some of our nominations for August demand are down a little bit from what we saw in July.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Prashant Raghavendra Rao
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Excellent. That's a great answer. My follow-up is just on the balance sheet. Net debt-to-cap held in pretty
well sequentially, and free cash flow including the working cap tailwind was positive in the quarter. Given
what we're seeing in the demand recovery and the commentary around where we are in 3Q, if we can hold
at these levels, if not improve slowly from here, does it feel like you're already starting to turn the corner
a bit on the balance sheet? That is to say the defensive measures that you've taken so far this year feel
sufficient to ride out this downturn absent another pullback in demand.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes, why don't we let Jason take a shot at that?

Jason W. Fraser
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. This is Jason. Yes, I think you're right. With the liquidity we have now of $2.3 billion in cash and
$5.7 billion of other liquidity available, we do think that's adequate for what we see this -- how we see it
playing out right now.

Prashant Raghavendra Rao
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Fantastic. And Jason, congrats on the promotion and stepping into the new role. I look forward to
talking to you more on that front in the future.

Jason W. Fraser
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks. I appreciate it.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Prashant.

Operator

The next question is from Theresa Chen of Barclays.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just a quick follow-up on Prashant's question related to the demand side and your commentary about
LatAm. The current estimates of, I think it was, 107% versus normalized levels that you're seeing, how
much of that do you think is pent-up demand? Or is it sustainable? And related, do you think that any of
the refineries that were previously maybe not optimal or operating at optimized capacity would perhaps
permanently shut down or be permanently impaired economically in that region such that perhaps you can
take some market share going forward?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So I think what we've seen, at least for the export markets we go to in Latin America, their demand
recovery has been very close to the same-type demand recovery we're seeing in the United States. I do
think you may have some prefilling of inventories getting ready for winter, which could cause exports to
spike a little bit, but in our system we see a pretty steady flow of diesel volume to Latin America, and
the volumes are fairly constant. Where we really get a spike in our export volumes is when the arb to
Europe is open. And that arb is currently open as it has been much of July, and that's where a lot of that
incremental volume is going.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And then switching to the differential front. So we seem to have several pipeline -- or projects
in regulatory purgatory. And just given your expansive commercial presence, I'd be interested to hear
your views on how differentials could react specifically to DAPL. So if the pipe is shut down, how do you
think that will impact not only Bakken differentials but also WTI? And as in, do you think that could create
perhaps like a pull on Cushing? What are your thoughts here?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So definitely, if DAPL isn't allowed to operate, it certainly will pressure the Bakken differentials. We
could see that moving weaker. Enbridge came out yesterday. They have some efforts to improve their
capacity to help clear the Bakken. Of course, through that Enbridge system, we are connected via our
Line 9 to Québec, so we'd have an opportunity to bring that Bakken volume to Québec, which would be a
benefit for us. In terms of the WTI differentials, I think, where we are on the forecasts for production and
where pipeline capacity is, I don't see it really having a significant impact on the WTI differentials. I think
we're kind of in a mode where Brent-TI probably is in that $2 to $3 range based on the incremental costs
to get it to the gulf and clear.

Theresa Chen
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood. And congratulations to Jason as well.

Jason W. Fraser
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you.

The next question is from Manav Gupta of Crédit Suisse.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

First is more of a policy question at this point...

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Manav, we can barely hear you, man.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Is it better now?

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Sorry.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. So on the policy side, at this point, President Joe Biden's clean energy agenda does not have
renewable diesel in it, but there is a school of thought that you can't [ coach ] the big trucks and buses to
go on electric, but you can encourage them to go on renewable diesel. Do you see a chance that the clean
energy agenda of the Democratic nominee expands and includes renewable diesel at some point of time?

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Manav, everybody fainted when you made your first proclamation. We'll let Rich Walsh take a shot at the
answer, okay?

Richard Joe Walsh
Senior VP & General Counsel

So we have some familiarity with Biden and some of his priorities. And one of the things that I would point
out is that nobody is going to want to take the union jobs away that are associated with the manufacturing
that we have out there. There's a huge amount of infrastructure in the country that's based on that. Same
thing with the renewable fuels, I don't think that any administration that comes in is going to want to pull
the rug out from under the farmlands. And so we see the renewable diesel having a big role to play, a
significant role to play. And I know there's a lot of aspirational statements and positions out there about
electrification, but there's a big marketplace for renewable diesel and we think it fits strongly in the green
agenda.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Martin, anything you want to add to that?

Martin Parrish
Senior Vice President of Alternative Energy & Project Development

Well, I'll just echo that. When you look at -- when you [ get ] the true numbers, if you look at the carbon
intensity, renewable diesel competes very well with a so-called zero-emission vehicle. You're already up
to 16%, 18% renewable diesel in California. You've got mandates out to 2030 in California and Europe,
the clean fuel standard coming in Canada, New York proceeding, so we just -- as Rich said, we just feel
really good about the future and the growth and just see this worldwide globally as in the fuel mix for a
long time to come.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay, that was helpful. One quick follow-up. So the Monday morning indicators which you put out, which
are very helpful, are basically indicating that, when you look at all the regions versus May, every region
is showing some improvement, but the Gulf Coast, where you have most of your capacity, is actually
showing a $3 per barrel improvement, so I'm just trying to understand. On the margin front, why is the
rate of change on the Gulf Coast showing a better positive variance versus some of the other regions?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Probably the biggest variance is due to the crude differentials. So crude differentials have been very tight,
but we've seen medium sours move $0.60 in the last few days and we've seen the Canadian heavy move
$1. And so in our Gulf Coast we run a lot more of the medium and heavy sours, and so that would have
the positive impact on the margin indicator versus the other regions which are primarily sweet.

The next question is from Paul Sankey of [ Hubbard ].

Paul Benedict Sankey
Analyst Hub, LLC

Yes. It's Analyst Hub actually, not [ Hubbard ], but anyway, [indiscernible]. Joe, it's been a long 6 months,
4 months since we last spoke, and I was wondering the extent to which you feel the world has changed
on a secular basis. Obviously you've referred to the demand side. And we can debate how air travel and
[ whether ] suburbanization is more gasoline intense, but clearly you've accessed capital. You seem very

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

clearly to be restating the dividend commitment that you've had since you became CEO. I guess one
question would be where you think we're going in terms of how U.S. crude markets change. It does seem
that we're in for a very different outlook now in terms of how much available crude there is in the U.S. and
how the balance will shift. Equally, we've heard a reference already, and thanks for the laugh, about how
the election may change things, but any further comments you have on that would be very interesting.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes, you bet. Paul, I mean, just looking back over the last 6 months, it's been a bit of a roller coaster,
right? I mean we started off the year in pretty decent shape and then we had the incredible trough.
Most of us in this room have been in this business for a very long time. And you got to look back a lot
of quarters before you see a quarter like the second quarter of this year. I mean it was just brutal. I
mean the margins were just horrible. And so anyway, the one thing that we're focused on really is that
we're going to run the business for the long term, and we need to have a steady hand right now and just
continue to focus on doing what we do and doing it well. We're dealing with news that's barraging us every
day with negative commentary and people are fearful. And we've got an election coming on. And you and
I probably could have a lively conversation about the impacts of that, but frankly, we're coming out of
this. And I think, if you look at our country and the way that people want to live, it is not the way that
they've lived over the last quarter. So anyway, I'll stop there [ and let ] Gary talk a little bit about the
crude situation.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So I think most forecasts we see confirm what you're talking about. As total oil demand picks up,
I think a greater percentage of that gets filled with more sour production. Our view is that the U.S. will
still be a net exporter of crude oil. And as long as the U.S. is exporting crude oil, we'll continue to have
advantage on the light sweet barrels we're bringing into our system. And of course, with the flexibility that
we have, especially with our complex Gulf Coast refining assets, getting some more medium and heavy
sour barrels on the market will help us as well from that aspect.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

And then as far as your -- [ no, Paul ]. And you mentioned the election. And we don't have a crystal ball
on what's going to happen, but we do know that, if you just look fundamentally at where we are, the
products that we produce are necessary for life as we know it. And so you can have a lot of conversation
around what we're going to do and what needs to -- but in reality, fossil fuels are going to be with us for a
very long time. And demand forecasts continue to be for increased crude oil consumption going forward as
countries continue to develop and so on. So we just need to not get hung up in the thinking we're going to
be in this dungeon that we're in now forever.

Paul Benedict Sankey
Analyst Hub, LLC

Yes. I mean obviously a vaccine will change that. I think I've read from your comments very clearly that
the strength of demand is really impressive, if you think we've just printed minus 30% GDP. And we've got
yesterday gasoline demand down 8%. It's actually quite incredible.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So my question is on supply and specifically how you guys are thinking about closures of refining capacity
over the next several years. And the reason that I ask is because I think IEA's final tally of closures last
cycle was 6 million, 7 million barrels per day of supply. And between recent closure announcements that
we've seen in Asia, IMO-related factors and current refining economics, it seems like we could be on a
similar track for the next couple of years as well. So I just want to see how you're thinking about the --
how the supply side could be affected by this factor in coming years. And is there really any reason to
believe it will be much different from the trough from the last cycle?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Doug, this is Lane. So I -- we've always sort of had the view that -- really what shuts refineries down.
Obviously they have to have some sort of fundamental issue, whether it's they're configured incorrectly
for where the market is or some other structural things, but ultimately what closes them is either a big
regulatory change where it requires a lot of capital and it just becomes like you look at the whole sort of
scenario of cash flow and it becomes insurmountable, and you start trying to normally try to sell it and
then ultimately it shuts down. The other one that does that is it could be like a big turnaround. We visited
a refinery a few years back in the U.K., and that's essentially what got them. They had a -- they'd put
off a turnaround and had kept doing that. And ultimately, that -- it was a big FCC, alky cracking complex
turnaround, the cost of which got to be where it was so large they chose to shut it down. So let's -- it's
really big -- refineries, if they can just sort of just kind of move along and manage expenses and things
like that, but it's when -- if a refinery has an outlook based on configuration or fundamentals, it makes it
negative, to begin with. And then they have -- there's a large cash outflow due to something changing.
That's generally what gets these refineries.

Operator

The next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question here. Just obviously you've referenced the demand picture improving into July quite a bit.
That said, the crack spreads are still pretty soft here in July and as we head into August, so as you look at
the second half of the year and look to balance the supply against the demand and the current inventory
picture, do you think demand is going to be able to take care of the inventory situation? Do you think
we're in a situation where we need to underproduce through the second half of the year in a greater
extent to get inventories lower?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

So this is Lane again. So I -- we ultimately believe, to get back to more normalized economic sort of
drivers for our business, we need to get back into sort of a 5-year range for inventories. There's 3 paths
you talked about. There is really how does the demand look and how disciplined are refiners with respect
to their utilization rates. And then of course, finally it's just a matter of how many closures there are. And
our view is that we've been really impressed so far with the industry's response to this in terms of being
disciplined and been encouraged by that, but certainly as we move forward, seeing how jet demand works
and obviously the seasonality with respect to butane going [ in the pool ], we expect that utilization rates
will sort of be commensurate with where the economics are. And then somewhere, it's your -- somewhere
in, I'm going to say, early next year, we -- our view is we'll get sort of back into the 5-year range of
inventories.

Okay, got it. And so I guess, with your view then, just extrapolating that a little further to kind of the
medium-term outlook, would you think -- by the middle of next year, do you think that would imply
margins could get back to some kind of normalized level if demand continues to improve? Or just how are
you thinking about things in terms of structurally a normalized picture moving forward?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

A normalized world looks like the inventories are basically back into the 5-year band. That's how sort of --
that's how we sort of look at it. And yes, we believe some more time next year, but we should be back into
that sort of market.

The next question is from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research.

Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC

So my question is about the next potential DGD expansion. You mentioned you're in engineering. At this
point, the kit seems pretty well established. The underlying fundamentals of the business are good. I think
what you said is reasonable, that there's a high probability that -- I mean other markets that have a credit
system or a carbon price that are comparable to California. So this business is growing. So I guess my
question is on this evaluation. What are the inputs that you're watching? Is it more commercial? Or are
you really evaluating some design changes [ with some other aspects of the inspiration in front of FID
here ]?

Martin Parrish
Senior Vice President of Alternative Energy & Project Development

Sam, this is Martin. We're really just going through our gated process and the work. This is of a new
location, so there's other things you have to take care of, the off-sites, the integration with the refinery. So
it's really not -- I wouldn't say -- I think commercially and operationally we feel pretty good about where
we're at. It's just really doing the work you have to do to get to a cost estimate and the rigor that we
apply to these things. So we're still on track. We're -- expect to make a final investment decision in early
2021. And if we go forward, we would expect to start construction in 2021 and operations commencing in

Joe, at the beginning of this -- at the beginning of March, when Saudi launched [ this throw pillow ] of
crude to the United States, I seem to recall you talking about getting calls relating to your ability to absorb
that crude. And obviously we saw a huge increase in exports -- or imports, rather, from Saudi essentially
at the end of May. That appears to have tailed off now. And I'm just wondering if you can walk us through
your prognosis for heavy availability and crude spreads in light of what I just suggested.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Doug. Gary can speak to this really well.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Doug, so I think, for us, we've certainly seen spreads about as narrow as we've ever seen with our margin
for light sweet, medium sour and heavy sour all right on top of each other. As we look forward, OPEC has
2 million barrels a day coming online in August. It looks like Canadian production will ramp up somewhere
in the 200- to 300-barrel a day range. And so we're already starting to see that have an impact on the
market. I mentioned medium sour discounts have widened about $0.60 in the last week. Canadian heavies
moved about $1 a barrel weaker. Longer term, the forecasts we see show that, as total oil demand
increases, a much larger percentage of that total oil demand will be filled with sour-type production rather
than the light sweet which came off the market. And so we think all of that could lead to wider-quality
differentials as we move forward longer term.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. I appreciate that. And I mean I don't want to make this my second question, but just a footnote to
that, Gary: Our understanding from our quality [ group or associate that we use ] at the center of energy
studies in Russia -- he suggests that the increase from Saudi and Russia will be absorbed domestically. So
do you believe that those barrels are actually hitting the water?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

We have seen some barrels from the [ heavies ] show up in the U.S. gulf or on offer in the U.S. gulf which
we haven't seen in quite some time. So Basra has been on offer, which we haven't seen in quite some
time. So I think some of the barrels are making their way onto the water and to the market. And some of
that is also due to the fact it looks like Far East buying is down a little bit as well, which is also helping to
pressure the crude differentials and make barrels available to us.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I appreciate that. So Joe, my second question, and I apologize in advance. It is a policy question in light
of what we're seeing in the polls and so on. And it's really just to ask you if you would mind articulating
Valero's position on carbon tax, and I'll leave it there.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Okay. No, that's great. I mean -- and I'll -- again we'll get Rich Walsh. Rich is responsible for our
government affairs activities. We'll get him to comment on this, but Doug, we're seeing different proposals
coming out, all right? I mean Biden's got a position he's taken and the House is looking at things and so
on. We don't know what's going to come out of this yet, okay? We just really don't and because nothing
seems to have been settled on, but that being said, Rich just want to kind of share what our thoughts are.

Richard Joe Walsh
Senior VP & General Counsel

Yes. I mean it's a little bit hard to respond to it in the abstract, right, because it all depends on how the
tax is structured, right? If you're looking at a properly structured carbon tax, you've got to consider
is the carbon tax going to drive carbon offshore to unregulated environments. You'll need to structure
around that. It needs to be market-driven. You need to think about affordability. You need to think about
complexity and structuring it and not picking winners and losers just by virtue of it. Letting it actually
allow all carbon reduction options to play into the market is really important. The other thing I think you

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

should temper all of this with is considering the state of the economy right now. I mean any administration
that gets elected is going to be dealing with a COVID recovery economy, and you need energy to drive the
economy. You can't really want to drive stimulus in the economy and then layer a bunch of taxes on and
completely restructure the energy format for the nation. It's really not feasible. So I think you're going to
-- the next administration, it's going to be about the economy, and the economy is going to need energy.
And so while there's a lot of hyperbole in the campaign and a lot of aspirational statements, the reality is
that they're going to need strong fuels to keep the economy going.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

So I guess in summary we just need to see what they're going to do before we can say what our position
would be on it.

The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

A lot of [ stills ] have been hit here but, I guess, one question I'll throw at you on the refining side. We've
heard talk in some of the other companies about delays and deferrals on maintenance and how that
may affect what's available to run, meaning maybe a little higher this fall and winter but maybe lower
next spring as people get -- let's say, we get past the worst of the pandemic and all that. As you think --
probably, Lane, this question is for you. As you think about getting inventories back to the 5-year average,
is that something that we should factor in as an additional help? Or there is enough surplus capacity
everywhere, if demand stays kind of soft, that maybe we won't really notice anything on the maintenance
deferral side.

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Roger, so I think it's really a function of how the -- how that operator responds to some of this. So
for example, one of the things that we did when we saw -- when this all first started is we took the
opportunity to take Pembroke FCC down and on its fractionator, all right? So we actually incurred
additional maintenance expense to deal with what we thought was an acute issue around its operation.
We could have tried to get through that and get it to its turnaround next year, but we thought, you know
what, let's just get in and get that cleaned out and also help with this sort of just the sort of structural
demand destruction that was early on. So I think it all depends on the operator. An operator who's
stressed, they have their balance sheet stressed or access to capital is -- and debt is a little bit stressed,
they may in fact decide to defer a lot of maintenance to some other point because they got to get through
-- they got a liquidity issue and they got to get to -- they got to push it out to a point at which they hope
that there is enough recovery that they can afford to do these things. The risk in that is the unit. The unit
doesn't really know how good your balance sheet is or how the world is. It just sort of decides, and at that
point, if that unit goes down, it's an unplanned events. It becomes a much larger event. It's a much more
expensive event. And that's the risk an operator in that condition has to deal with, but Valero specifically,
we didn't have a lot of turnaround work going into the sort of even planned turnaround work in the third
and fourth quarter. We'll still address where we think we have operating issues. And so -- and the other
general comment I'll say is, yes, we reduced expenses. One of those knobs was, I would call it, light
maintenance. You can sort of tell from the way I talk we have -- this sort of core value of ours is that we
will never ever cut our maintenance capital such that it puts our reliability at risk because we believe that's
a pathway to get to even higher expenses and more cash outlay in the future. Because we're -- we believe
in being in this in the long term. So we don't operate that way, but we did touch lightly on some of what
we consider to be a little bit of discretionary maintenance. So did that, does that answer your question?

understand some of the things that are going to be coming at us here other than...

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Just what I'm trying to say is very -- it's very operator specific. If you think -- if you like to look out there
at the cast of characters, the people who are in this business. Some people will respond by being careful,
and some people might have to take an additional risk. And then it all -- and then it's just a matter of how
it all unfolds.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

No, I appreciate that. I guess the other question I have is to follow up on the earlier comment about
the diesel yield going from the high 30s to the low 30s as jet fuel demand comes back up. As we look
overall at what's been coming in the last several weeks on the DOE is we've seen gasoline draws a little
bit on net. Diesel has actually been continuing to build. Are we at a point here where jet fuel demand has
recovered enough that we should see the lower diesel yields feed into no longer building diesel margins?
Or kind of maybe tag teaming on Phil's question, are we in a situation here where maybe we face, I don't
know, overall run cuts or a further cut in diesel yields in order to kind of balance the market? And one of
the reasons I'm asking that is, as we roll late September and into October, we go from summer-grade to
winter-grade gasoline. And so that tends to make it easier to make gasoline, and I was just curious if that
further complicates things if we don't see a continued improvement in jet fuel demand.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So I think our view is we don't see where jet fuel demand fully recovers to where we were and that
jet fuel demand picks up enough to really correct the yield issue, which is where it gets really to Lane's
point. For us to really see diesel inventories get back to that 5-year average low -- the total light products
inventories in that 5-year average range, we really need to see discipline on the utilization. And to keep
utilization down is probably the biggest key to getting inventory [ for now ].

Roger David Read

So stay tuned. All right.

Chairman & CEO

So I would -- I'm going to say this right now, okay? The high end would be $2.5 billion, and then probably
$2 billion on the low end, okay? And I think we just need to wait and see what happen. Lane's got us
really well positioned on the execution of the capital plan that, if we need to delay a project or continue to
slow some of these projects, we'll do it. I think we're very highly confident. We're just going to continue to
proceed with the Diamond Green Diesel project...

R. Lane Riggs

We haven't slowed that down.

Joseph W. Gorder
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We're not going to slow that down. So Paul, I'd say $2 billion. And if we see the -- as the guys have
talked about, to get really back to a really strong margin environment, we need to see inventories come
down some. That could happen sooner than later, but we just don't know. But I think, if to the extent we
can restart some of these capital projects, we'd like to do it, okay? And I think we've talked for -- Jason,
we've talked about this, that if you're going to prioritize your use of funds in the company, one of the first
things we'd like to do is go ahead and restart these high-return capital projects like the coker. Then we're
going to look at the balance sheet and be sure that we reduce our debt and that we build some cash.

around the use of cash. And Jason...

I'm wrong, but if that is the first priority, then at what point of debt level you will say, okay, while that

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. A final question from me on my side. In the event you're being [ shut for Québec city ] the supply
alternative, Gary, can you maybe elaborate a little bit?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So we -- throughout history, we've really supplied the Québec refinery over the water and can fully
supply Québec with waterborne barrels. Line 9 is an optimization for us. It's provided a nice economic
benefit to us, but we have the ability to supply Québec either West African barrels or barrels from the U.S.
Gulf Coast over the water.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

But is there any option or opportunities to find additional North American [ in-line ] supply? Or that's really
-- once Line 9 is shut, that's really there is no additional [ ways we'll ] be able to get more local supply or
that Calgary or that Bakken supplies into that?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

So the line that's really close is Line 5. And not all of Line 9 is fed from Line 5, so even if Line 5 is closed,
we still believe we'd have access to Western Canadian barrels that could feed Line 9.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

How does that work actually? [ Is it prorated ]? You have -- Line 5 is shut and that's assumes that the
total available in Line 9 becomes, say, call it, half. Is it you will get half of your normal allocation? Or how
does that work, the process?

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

That's close to how it would work. So there would be a [ proration ] that goes into effect based on your
shipper history. And so where we would fall out on that, I'm not sure, but assuming Line 5 is half of the
volume and everyone was [ prorated ] to 50%, then would be 50% of what we normally ship through Line
9.

RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Joe, you've had the 40% to 50% cash return target for a long time now. I'm curious, if we end up in a
sort of longer margin recovery environment maybe like we saw after the financial crisis, how long you're
comfortable sort of paying above that target as you are now before potentially the dividend will need to be

Okay. We'll let Jason talk generally to how we're thinking about cash flows and the dividend here, okay?

Jason W. Fraser

Yes. You're right. We're well above it now. I think Homer said we're at 96% year-to-date on payout, but
with this being an extraordinary and short-term event, we're not going to adjust that based on this type of
a situation. So we stick with our guidance. We won't vary from it. I don't know if we have an exact number

Bradley Barrett Heffern

repurchase program just given what we've seen? I mean obviously the historical criticism has been that,
when you have money to do repurchases, obviously the stock price is higher. And that's certainly proven
to be true this time. So is there a chance that on the other side we see Valero with -- sustain a higher
cash balance and a lower overall debt level than maybe we thought previously? Any color like that would
be great.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

The first question I have is just on DGD margins. We've been following the indicator margins on your
website. They came in a little softer than what we expected in the second quarter. Volumes looked good,
but just any thoughts on 2020 DGD margins would be helpful.

Martin Parrish
Senior Vice President of Alternative Energy & Project Development

Yes, Neil. This is Martin. I can tell you the second quarter was $1.93 a gallon EBITDA, which we actually
feel pretty good about it. If you look now where we're at relative to the second quarter, diesel price is
up $0.27 a gallon. The D4 RIN component with a multiplier up $0.12 a gallon. So you're close to $0.40
a gallon better on the indicator margin than we were in the second quarter with those components. So
looking out for the rest of the year, we feel really good about where DGD is going to be for the rest of the
year and foreseeable future.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's great. And then that brings us to the follow-up with just your thoughts on RINs and particularly
the D6 RINs and just how it could play out from here. And it kind of ties back into some of the election
[ commentary said ] earlier.

Martin Parrish
Senior Vice President of Alternative Energy & Project Development

Well, I -- right now, we expect RINs to remain supportive in the near term. There's a lot going on. You've
got low energy prices relative to agricultural prices; and that makes the biofuels less competitive, which
typically means a higher RIN. You've got uncertainty around the small refinery exemption program and
obviously effects of COVID-19 on gasoline. You just don't know if you can -- the gasoline pool will absorb
the mandated ethanol volumes next year. So that's a risk. And then the EPA, the 2021 RVO itself has been
postponed indefinitely. So there's just a lot of uncertainty around the RIN right now, so as a result, it's
higher. Once we turn the corner on the pandemic, we get lower energy prices -- and energy prices, excuse
me, recover to higher levels, we expect the RINs to drift lower.

The next question is from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies.

Christopher Paul Sighinolfi
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I do have 2 questions. I guess, first, following up on Roger's earlier question. With changes in product
slate and unit configuration and perhaps the swing into winter grade, how high could you push gasoline
yield if demand there continues to rebound and for jet and distillates maybe it doesn't? And on a related
note, are you changing at all the crude procurement processes just given the pace and degree of change
and uncertainty with regard to individual product demand over the last couple months and maybe
continuing for the next couple of months?

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

Gasoline yield. It's probably, to give you a really good answer in terms of if you were in a mode of trying
to maximize gasoline and minimize distillate, it would be -- it's probably in the order of 50%, low 50%,
sort of yields overall. In independents, it's obviously a function of different refineries. Our Venetia refinery
makes [ often ] like 60% gasoline, and so does our McKee refinery. Some of the more heavy refineries
are a little bit different. So it's really a function of the refineries. And if the world works out the way this
-- where gasoline has recovered and jet doesn't recover and consequently you've got to be careful, we'll

certainly test the limits of that probably going into probably first quarter and going into second quarter,
depending on again how disciplined refiners are for the rest of the year.

Gary K. Simmons
Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. On crude, I mean, I guess, early in the second quarter, when gasoline got very weak, we pushed a
little bit more medium sour into our system to try to promote higher distillate yields. Since then, we've
backed off, and we're in a similar crude diet to what we typically run. And I don't see that changing in the
near future.

Christopher Paul Sighinolfi
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay, great. And Lane, I appreciate the early discussion of product inventories and sort of your
expectations as we move into next year. For my own edification, when you think about recapturing 5-year
inventory ranges and the signal that, that inventory normalization might send to prices and cracks, do
you think about that in an absolute sense, or do you think about it in terms of a days of demand ratio? I
know it's a conceptual question, but I guess, with all this shadow inventory represented by the low refining
utilization rates, I'm just curious how you and your team think about those components.

R. Lane Riggs
President & COO

That's an excellent question. We always -- because obviously there's just different demand through
time. And so it's not just -- we look at where inventories are in the 5-year range. That's sort of where
we start, and then we certainly start looking at days of supply. And then we look forwards. Are there
inventories that maybe the DOE is not capturing that's somewhere else out there? And so we look at all
those things, for sure, but I guess it's sort of in a high level we're just saying there's -- the industry needs
to be disciplined. It needs to -- and there's -- and obviously demand is on its way back. We want to see
what is normalized inventory to be in the 5-year range. And then we'd start looking at days of supply and
are there inventories in unusual places that we'll take into account.

The last question today comes from Benny Wong of Morgan Stanley.

Benny Wong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I'll keep it to one. I just want to be mindful of your time. Just kind of looking at your renewable diesel:
Your business margin there came in at like $1.95, which was a little bit better than what we expected,
but when we look at spot prices, the business margin looks like it could have been much better, maybe
even close to [ 2 50, 2 75 ]. When we kind of put aside movements in commodity prices, is there any
reasons or factors that we should not expect the same magnitude of index price recovery to flow into your
business margin in 3Q and the back half of the year?

Martin Parrish
Senior Vice President of Alternative Energy & Project Development

Okay. This is Martin. As I said earlier, we've seen quite a bit of recovery, since the 2Q average numbers, in
both the diesel price and the RIN. LCFS price is flat. So I will say you ought to expect kind of what we've
guided to before, that we feel pretty good about third and fourth quarter for renewable diesel.

Benny Wong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it, okay. Appreciate that. So there's nothing within like movements in capture rates and costs that we
might have to incrementally think upon in the back half of the year. Is that right?
