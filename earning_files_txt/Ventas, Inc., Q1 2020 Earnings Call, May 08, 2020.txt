Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2020 Ventas Earnings
conference call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Juan Sanabria.

Juan Sanabria
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Cindy. Good morning, and welcome to the Ventas conference call to review the company's
announcement today regarding its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020.

As we start, let me express that all projections and predictions and certain other statements to be made
during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities law. The company cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to many
risks, uncertainties and contingencies, and stockholders and others should recognize that actual results
may differ materially from the company's expectations, whether expressed or implied. Ventas expressly
disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to
reflect any changes in expectations.

Additional information about the factors that may affect the company's operations and results is included
in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the company's
other SEC filings. Please note that quantitative reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure
referenced on this conference call and its most directly comparable GAAP measure as well as the
company's supplemental disclosure schedule are available in the Investor Relations section of our website
at www.ventasreit.com.

Before I hand the call off to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of the company; I'd like to note that
we've posted an investor presentation this morning on our website, which includes the COVID-19 business
update that is helpful information that the team will reference in our prepared remarks.

With those formalities out of the way, I'll hand it over to Debbie.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Juan, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the
Ventas First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. I sincerely hope that you, and yours are safe and healthy.

Today, the Ventas team is working remotely, but we are together in spirit as we outline our outstanding
first quarter results, describe the challenging conditions in the markets, the economy and our company
brought on by the terrible COVID-19 pandemic, discuss near-term business trends and evaluate the macro
outlook.

At this time, we face unprecedented conditions nationally and globally, created by the pandemic. Those
of us in real estate have been around a long time, have managed through many severe crises over the
decades, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the great financial crisis and the deep recessions that
followed both. Yet today's complex mix of public health, remote working, economic, operational and
market conditions make this pandemic a uniquely challenging adversary.

Let me begin today by setting the stage and then outlining the swift and decisive actions we've taken to
ensure that Ventas remains strong and stable. As we rolled into March, we were excited to see how our
previously announced initiatives were gaining traction and making an impact, and how well our overall
enterprise and each of our business lines were performing. You can see the power of our diversified
business, model and the strong normalized FFO per share results we reported today at $0.97 per share,

inclusive of the financial impact of COVID-19 towards the end of the quarter. In short, we were hitting on
all cylinders with terrific momentum.

As soon as we realize the potential scope and impact of the novel coronavirus in February and early in
March, we identified as our key priority that health and safety of Ventas employees and their families and
the employees, patients and senior living residents in our 1,200 health care sites. Although this particular
crisis reflects a unique combination of forces, our experience, deep analysis based on early real-time
inputs and core principles have given us a solid framework for action.

Here are some of the strong measures we've taken to preserve and protect the company and the
many stakeholders who depend upon us. We have devoted significant efforts to support our tenants
and operators across our portfolio during the COVID-19 pandemic. We've established financial support
programs for those who are experiencing financial hardship. We've assisted operators who may be eligible
for complex and varied government programs, and we've leveraged our national scale to help operators
source supplies, including scarce Personal Protective Equipment or PPE. And today, we've announced a
powerful new initiative for Ventas senior living operators. Ventas will be providing access to COVID-19
testing kits and analysis from Mayo Clinic Laboratories without charge to certain of our senior housing
operators to further enhance safety at Ventas communities by accelerating employee testing.

Ventas and Atria working through Atria's ongoing relationship, have secured access to testing capacity
in excess of 30,000. Atria is already nearly done testing all of its 14,000 U.S. on-site and regional staff.
With approximately 9,000 results in, less than 1% of Atria's employee tests have been returned positive.
Combined with digital tracking and tracing and appropriate use of PPE, Atria is building a new normal
model to run its senior housing business safely and thoughtfully. In a positive sign, Atria has moved in 300
residents since early March, all under full quarantine and PPE protocols.

Ventas plans to make available to certain of its other operators, at least 10,000 COVID-19 test kits and
analysis from Mayo Clinic labs. ESL will be the next Ventas operator to use this testing for its Ventas
communities and is already getting ready to test all of its staff in May. We look forward to finding more
ways to work with Mayo Clinic labs and our operators to further enhance safety in our communities for
residents and caregivers. We will continue to evaluate additional action as appropriate.

Second on our action hit list, we moved early to review and implement our pre-existing business
continuity plans, so we could maintain a high level of productivity and manage a seamless transition
to remote working arrangements. With an interdisciplinary team of Ventas leaders coordinating our
efforts, strong IT support and capabilities, fueled in by our employees, and enhanced communication,
the company experienced no downtime, and we've been highly effective during these challenging times.
I'm so proud of how Ventas employees have reacted and rallied, and I want to thank them for their
extraordinary efforts.

Third, we're pleased that we've reached a positive consensual resolution of our holiday lease. After
receiving full rents from holiday since lease inception in 2013 through the end of the first quarter 2020.
We have now received an additional $100 million in cash and secured notes. We've entered into a new
management agreement with Holiday for our 26 independent living assets, and we've terminated the
Holiday lease, all effective April 1. This management structure retains our upside in our 26 communities
and provides us with operational flexibility. We appreciate Holiday management's engagement and
cooperation to complete this transaction.

Fourth, we were excited to augment our leadership team with Justin Hutchens and Carey Roberts when
they joined Ventas on March 4. Justin and Carey have added new energy and insight to our tightknit group
at this crucial time. They've already made many meaningful contributions to Ventas as we've collaborated
to analyze and attack the business challenges presented by the pandemic.

Our experience has instilled in us the importance of liquidity in a crisis. As a result, we showed the
courage of our convictions in mid-March by drawing on our revolver and then issuing senior notes
generating $3.3 billion in liquidity. This financial flexibility will serve us well as we manage through to the
other side of the COVID-19 pandemic.

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

In addition, we further enhanced our financial flexibility by acting immediately to reduce 2020 capital
expenditures by $300 million, mainly by pausing certain of our previously announced ground-up
developments that were not yet substantially underway. We are also carefully reviewing other areas
of our company for cost savings including general and administrative expenses. At the same time, we
promptly withdrew our financial guidance on March 17, nearly 2 months ago, when our early analysis
informed by real-time data led us to conclude that our financial performance could be materially affected
by the pandemic. Our foresight proves correct, and we fulfilled our commitment to transparency to our
stakeholders by the actions we took in a timely way.

Finally, Ventas has served and continues to work tirelessly as a proactive and evidence-based advocate for
seniors with federal policymakers. Working with industry groups, and in alliance with senior living CEOs,
we are demonstrating the crucial role senior living care providers play in protecting our senior population
that is particularly vulnerable to this novel coronavirus.

While we've taken plenty of action, policymakers have done exponentially more. The Fed, the
administration and Congress have implemented a comprehensive array of bold policy actions to partially
mitigate the virus' severe implications for public health, capital markets and the economy. Many
businesses and households, including many of our tenants and operators, have already benefited from this
arsenal of federal programs. With this powerful support and more financial release likely to follow, it's our
responsibility now to take action to safely and responsibly move our company towards a new normal.

As we do so, our visibility is limited, and uncertainty remains very high. Indeed, we faced the COVID-19
paradox, on the one side, reputable models and even certain government projections show an expected
increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases and mortality numbers in many jurisdictions. These expectations,
if they materialize, could derail even the best-laid plans for economic recovery. And this morning, we saw
historic levels of unemployment claims in the U.S.

On the other hand, there is palpable optimism in the air. As most states plan staged reopenings of their
economies and businesses, many companies, including ours, are preparing for a gradual return to office
work. Patients and physicians are scheduling appointments and elective procedures. Families are making
deposits for senior housing move-ins. Universities are planning to welcome students in the fall. And most
importantly, our best scientific and medical minds are racing to find treatments, cures and vaccines for
the coronavirus. We're proud to say that many of our key research and innovation university relationships
and tenants, including Duke, Wake Forest, Penn, Yale and Integral Molecular are at the forefront of this
research. All these promising developments provide hope for a speedier and sustained bounce back.

We don't have to know how these opposing trends will play out. Our job is to preserve and protect our
company and our stakeholders and be ready for a variety of scenarios and opportunities.

Before closing, I want to address our dividend in the context of this COVID-19 uncertainty. As you know,
we declared and paid our last quarterly dividend in April. Because we normally pay our next dividend
in July, our Board will consider the dividend in mid- to late June. As it always does, our responsible and
experienced Board will make a decision using its good safe business judgment, taking into account all
of the information available to it at that time. In a situation like the fast moving, rapidly changing global
pandemic, we have the advantage of aggregating and analyzing the best and most current information
available in order to make the optimal decision.

The cycle tested Ventas team and the company are well prepared to manage through current conditions
and to take further actions as necessary. Guided by our experience, analysis and ethics, we will safeguard
our employees, our senior housing residents and caregivers, our capital and our reputation so that Ventas
will remain a leading health care property owner in the businesses and geographies where we invest, a
desirable employer and an attractive investment vehicle.

And now for the first time, I'm pleased to ask Justin Hutchens to address you about Ventas' senior housing
business.

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Thanks, Debbie. Let me just start out by saying I'm extremely excited to be working with the Ventas
team. Given the circumstances, I've certainly had the opportunity to jump right in and immediately put
my operating experience to work. I'm also happy to be working again with long-standing colleagues and
industry leaders like Atria, Brookdale, ESL, Holiday and Sunrise. COVID notwithstanding, I see great
opportunities ahead for Ventas in its senior housing business.

In my first Ventas earnings call, I'd like to discuss the momentum of our SHOP same-store portfolio
showed in the first quarter; outlined how Ventas' worked with integrity to support our tenants and
operators during a very challenging time; describe the operational and clinical environment in SHOP and
triple-net; delve into April and May trends; and provide our outlook for safe and stage reopenings in senior
housing.

Our SHOP portfolio started the year ahead of our expectations and with good momentum. Sequentially,
NOI in our same-store SHOP portfolio grew 2.3% in the first quarter, with COVID costs embedded. Without
COVID impacts, NOI grew 6% versus the fourth quarter with credit due to solid sequential performance
from Atria through strong rate growth and expense control and some welcome stabilization from ESL. As
expected, the year-over-year same-store SHOP comparisons were negatively affected by $6 million in
COVID costs incurred in the quarter. The reduction in occupancy as a result of COVID in the back half of
March as well as the previously discussed lower start point heading into 2020. Ex-COVID costs, the year-
over-year same-store NOI would have declined 6.9%, better than our expectations given the difficult prior
year comparison.

While we are mostly focused on the impact of COVID-19 for our operating performance, it is worth noting
new construction starts in senior housing continued to decelerate with the first quarter of 2020 having the
lowest number of new starts in several years at 1,000 units in Ventas markets.

Moving to our support for senior housing tenants and operators. I've been proud that Ventas has been out
front and willing to work with integrity in support of our senior housing tenants, who are on the front lines
of caring for seniors. This support has taken many forms. I'll just focus on some creative programs we've
offered to our triple-net tenants.

The company offered support to its triple-net senior housing tenants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
by implementing a 25% rent deferral program in April to enable them to care for seniors, purchase needed
supplies and pay employees. This program ultimately reduced April cash rent receipts by approximately $3
million.

Adjusting for this tenant support program, tenants paid substantially all triple-net senior housing rent in
April. For the month of May, the company offered qualified senior housing tenant, the opportunity to pay
up to 25% of their rent with cash escrows and security deposits, and based on participating tenants, we
expect about $2 million of our rent to be paid this way.

We are encouraged to see that some of our tenants have availed themselves of government relief
programs for which they are eligible. We will continue to engage in constructive ongoing dialogue with
our triple-net tenants regarding their COVID-19 challenges on a case-by-case basis. We have many tools
available to us to work through near-term conditions including our backstop of corporate and personal
guarantees and over $100 million of security deposits that stand behind these lease obligations.

Turning to the clinical and operational environment. These trying times underlined the importance of
partnering with true industry leaders. We have been inspired by the tireless work of our operating partners
to keep seniors safe. Senior housing operators across the industry continue to aggressively implement
protocols to protect against COVID-19. The result of these protocols is that almost all operators are only
offering virtual tours, and at the present time, about 29% of our 400 SHOP communities have suspended
their movements. In terms of the clinical impact on our SHOP portfolio, as of April 30, it is a tale of 2
cities. Having a large New York and New Jersey footprint is a strategic advantage for Ventas, but those
states were the epicenter for the COVID-19 infection and mortality rate. On a full portfolio basis, about
1/4 of our SHOP communities experienced at least one positive COVID-19 resident diagnosis since the
beginning of the pandemic, registering a cumulative percentage of resident cases at slightly over 2% of

7

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

the resident population. Excluding New York and New Jersey, these figures improved dramatically with
only 1% of our residents cumulatively effective since day 1.

In our triple-net senior housing portfolio, benefiting from geographic diversification, the percentage of
resident cases is 1%. As is best practice, the care providers took great lengths to isolate or transfer to
a higher acuity setting, the limited number of residents who received positive diagnosis. Brookdale, in
particular, has been compassionate but also early, disciplined and rigorous in its preparation for and
management of COVID conditions for the benefit of residents and their families.

In SHOP, as a result of restricted access to communities nationally, April move-ins approximated 25% of
typical levels, while overall move-outs were largely in line with historic patterns. April average occupancy
was approximately 82.4%. As of May 1, spot occupancy was estimated as 80.7%, representing a
330 basis points decline since the beginning of April based on interim information provided by Ventas
operators. When excluding New York and New Jersey, occupancy would have declined 280 basis points.

Operating expenses are trending around 10% higher, particularly for labor and supplies, including PPE.
These revenue and expense trends we are seeing for April are expected to continue in May.

Financial and operational trends are expected to be directionally similar for our triple-net portfolio in the
second quarter. For senior housing overall, as we look beyond the second quarter, there are 3 critical
considerations we are monitoring that will materially affect the outlook for senior housing: One, timing
of reopening of communities to physical tours and move-ins; two, cost and access to labor; three, local
demand characteristics, including evolving protocols required to protect against the virus.

The timing of openings will be driven by state-specific guidelines, CDC guidelines and local community
considerations. Ventas, along with our operating partners, is closely tracking state-specific guidelines
and COVID infection curves in each of our markets. I'm encouraged to report that we have roughly 300
deposits for move-ins, which is a good sign of ongoing demand for our senior housing communities. Senior
housing operators will find success in many ways, including and most importantly, building trust with
prospective residents and their families by demonstrating a concerted effort to keep communities free of
infection. To do so, we anticipate elevated levels of costs over the course of the next several months.

Trust and confidence in senior housing over the near-term will be supported with best-in-class infection
control practices, availability of PPE and testing residents and employees. As Debbie described, Ventas
has played an important role alongside our operators and tenants in combating the pandemic and helping
operators prepare to open successfully. Through this challenging stretch, we continue to resolutely believe
in the long-term value that senior living offers, residents and their families and are sharply focused on
positioning Ventas' senior housing business for long-term success.

With that, I'll hand the floor to Pete to discuss our office business.

Peter J. Bulgarelli
Executive Vice President of Office

Thanks, Justin. We are certainly glad to have you and Carey onboard. I'll quickly touch on the first quarter
results for our office segment, which represents 27% of Ventas' NOI, and then focus on the latest trends
and our latest second quarter COVID framework.

For the first quarter of 2020, office same-store cash NOI increased by 5.8% year-on-year. This
outstanding result was fueled by our R&I portfolio, which grew 22%, driven by strong lease-up and
complemented by strong performance from the MOB portfolio. In R&I, first quarter average rent per
square foot was up 9.4%, and occupancy is robust at just under 97%. Strong performance in our
university-based developments, affiliated with Washington, University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia
and Washington University in St. Louis fueled our growth. Complementing the fast-growing R&I business
is our MOB business. MOB same-store cash NOI for the first quarter of 2020 increased 1.9% year-on-year,
also above our expectations.

Now let's shift to the latest COVID trends we are seeing in our office portfolio. I'll start with medical office.
Our top priority has been to partner with our tenants, in the associated health systems to ensure the

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

safety of health professionals, patients and our employees. We have sourced substantial amounts of PPE,
coordinated visitor screening, licensed short-term spaces, set up drive-through testing centers in our
parking lots, provided supplemental cleaning, in other ways supported our tenants during this challenging
time. We are happy to report that all of our buildings are open, and none of our site-based employees
have tested positively for COVID-19.

We sincerely thank all of our on-site employees and partners who fight the fight every day. We are very
proud of them. I'll also say regarding our MOB business, the parking receipts have slowed and while safety
concerns have caused an increase in cleaning costs.

Given the current uncertainty, the pace of new leasing has slowed. However, we still leased 573,000
square feet during the first quarter and 381,000 square feet during April, with an additional 200,000
square feet of leases at the letter of intent stage. Also, tenant retention has increased. I'm proud to say
that MOB reported record retention of 83% for the trailing 12 months, 90% retention for the first quarter,
94% retention for March and an outstanding 98% in April.

Turning to our R&I portfolio. Our R&I buildings are 100% open and are supporting critical research
focused on the detection, prevention and cure of COVID-19. We are proud to be partners with leading
research institutions such as Yale, the Penn Gene therapy center, Wake Forest Health Sciences, Virginia
Commonwealth University, Integral Molecular, Alexion and others in fighting this virus. We look forward
to expanding our portfolio with other leading research institutions such as Arizona State and University of
Pittsburgh in new, under construction, world-class research buildings.

As previously mentioned, our R&I portfolio is 97% leased with an active leasing pipeline. Lab space
continues to be in high demand. Net-net, as of April 30, we had 91.5% occupancy in our office business,
representing 150 basis point year-on-year increase from April 2019. From March 31 through April 30, we
experienced a 10 basis point increase in occupancy for MOB and a 10 basis point increase for R&I.

So let's talk rent payments. During the first quarter, our tenants paid essentially 100% of the office rent.
Our historical bad debt expense has only been 20 basis points. We have high-quality tenants that pay their
rent. In April, our tenants paid 96% of office rents. We expect a significant proportion of the unpaid rent
to be ultimately collected. And I'm encouraged that so far in May, our office tenants have paid nearly 80%
of the rents due. To date, we are seeing a faster payment rate than what we experienced in April.

I will say the tenants experiencing the most pressure are the smaller third-party physician groups in MOB,
the smaller private companies in R&I and retail. Taken together, these customer segments represent a
relatively small portion of our office portfolio. We're supporting these tenants by raising awareness and
assisting them with securing federal relief. On a selective basis, we are also offering to defer May rent for
these small tenants to be repaid no later than the fourth quarter. To date, only a small number of tenants
have utilized the rent deferral opportunity.

Supporting the durability of our office portfolio are a couple of additional facts: First, our MOB portfolio is
largely on-campus, 71%. We also have a high level of acuity in our buildings with 88% of our physician
tenants being specialists. Our buildings and our tenants are essential to the delivery of care during this
difficult time. Less than 10% of our tenant suites closed during the pandemic; second, as of May 7, over
80% of the MOB NOI is in states that have either reopened for elective procedures or have announced the
resumption of elective procedures. In locations that have reopened, we are seeing material increases in
activity, although still below pre-COVID levels.

As a reminder that our nation is resilient and that normalcy returns following catastrophes, I'm happy to
report that Ventas is delivering a full restore [Technical Difficulty] by Hurricane Michael in 2018.

With that happy news, I'll pass baton to Bob to finish up our prepared remarks.

Robert F. Probst
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Pete. I will start with our triple-net lease portfolio overall before I close with some enterprise
level commentary. The triple-net portfolio grew same-store cash NOI by a solid 3.9% year-over-year in

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

the first quarter. Growth was driven by in place lease escalations and a $3 million cash fee received in the
quarter from capital senior living.

Trailing 12-month coverage as of the fourth quarter of '19 for the overall triple-net portfolio for triple-net
senior housing remained stable at 1.5x and 1.1x, respectively. Post-acute coverage declined sequentially
by 10 basis points to 1.3x due to a decline in volumes at Kindred, driven by managed care and purposeful
reduction of noncompliant patients.

Adjusting for the 25% rent deferral program in senior housing, we collected close to 100% of our overall
expected triple-net portfolio rents in April. We've already received almost 100% of triple-net healthcare
rents for May, and we're on track with triple-net senior housing May collections.

We expect the impact of COVID on our triple-net healthcare rents from acute care providers to be muted
in the second quarter. Acute care hospitals have been impacted by the reduction of elective procedures,
but have had significant access to government funding and support. Additionally, for Ardent, as of May 1,
all 10 of the Ventas owned hospitals have reopened or will reopen in May for elective procedures.

For the post-acute providers in our triple-net healthcare portfolio, volume trends have varied. LTAC census
has been higher than budgeted, but costs have increased. We expect that the concern over respiratory
disease will enhance Kindred's LTAC business going forward. IRF census initially declined due to lower
surgeries and acute care volumes, but census has improved since mid-April. SNFs are experiencing
notably higher mortality rates, with census down dramatically and the most profitable rehab patients also
down. Positive post-acute trends include access to government funding, relief from site neutral pricing,
waiver of length of stay requirements, and the 2% sequestration delay.

I'll close with some comments regarding the overall enterprise and our financial position. I want to
underscore how pleased we are with our first quarter results including property performance ahead of our
expectations, record quarterly revenues, strong FFO delivery of $0.97 per share, enhanced balance sheet
at 5.7x net debt-to-EBITDA and excellent liquidity. And we took decisive action in the face of the pandemic
to bolster our financial flexibility.

In March, we drew $2.75 billion under our $3 billion revolver and followed it up in early April with a $500
million senior note issuance. As a result, as of May 6, Ventas has approximately $3.2 billion in cash and
cash equivalents on hand with no commercial paper outstanding. We also have very limited debt maturing
in 2020 or 2021, and we have the ability to extend our revolver for up to one year.

We plan to bolster financial flexibility by reducing 2020 total capital expenditures by nearly $300 million
to a total of $500 million, with the decline led by pausing ground-up developments not yet substantially
underway, notably One uCity in Philly, and 4210 St. Louis.

Our ongoing development projects are on average 81% pre-leased to high-quality credit tenants in
the R&I business. I'd note that Ventas has a $400 million committed construction line of credit to fund
developments, with $250 million of available capacity as of the end of March. Ventas has expected
unfunded investment in all ground-up developments in 2020, net of committed financing is approximately
$100 million.

In addition to conserving CapEx, the company is reviewing its cost structures across the enterprise,
including its SG&A and organizational costs. As Debbie says, we're on it.

Given our early understanding of the potential impacts of the pandemic, Ventas withdrew its previously
issued financial guidance on March 17. We believe the adverse impact on our operating results and
financial condition will be driven by many factors, most of which are outside the company's control and
ability to forecast. However, in order to provide investors with incremental observations and transparency,
we included today the investor deck outlining our COVID response and latest business trends as well as
expanded disclosure as summarized on Page 44 of the supplemental.

To close, we are pleased with our start to the year and with the actions taken thus far, and are committed
to continuing to take the actions necessary to manage through with these unprecedented times.

That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we start with Q&A, we are limiting each caller to 2 questions
given the busy calendar request from a few analysts and to be respectful to everyone on the line. Also
given the fact that we are all remote, we will ask Debbie to act as quarter back for the Q&A and to pass
questions to the Ventas team as needed. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I appreciate all the color and specifically on April and May rent collections for net lease, you addressed
holiday this morning, but do you expect additional net lease restructurings over the next few months?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Nick, it's Debbie. I'm going to ask Justin to comment on that.

J. Justin Hutchens
Executive Vice President of Senior Housing - North America

Thank you, Debbie. First of all, I think it's important to note our biggest priority is that our operators
are looking out for the health and safety of our residents and our communities. That's priority #1 in the
near term. I'll also point to, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we've already started to take
action. We mentioned the rent deferral in April. We mentioned the opportunity for tenants to pay down
rent -- pay some of the rent with their cash escrows in May. And you noted the Holiday restructuring.
What we're committed to do is to take action that's going to give us the best opportunity to create value in
our portfolio and work with our operators to determine the best outcome. It's still early. Some uncertainly
ahead of us still, but we'll certainly be watching everything closely.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Debbie, it's Michael Bilerman. Just as a second question, I hope you're doing well. So I think Bob
mentioned in his comments about looking at all forms of cost within the enterprise. Can you sort of
address corporate management sort of pay levels and whether that's on the docket and how investors
should think about that? And just from a governance perspective, whether there'd be any changes from
the Chairman and CEO role, which you continue to maintain?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Sure. I'm happy to talk about that and turn it over to Bob for a little bit more detail. But most of our
executive compensation is very aligned with shareholders and the vast majority of which is in the form of
performance-based equity compensation. When you think about the overall enterprise, I'm going to turn it
over to Bob to talk about some of the insights he has about making sure that the company is efficient and
cognizant of the environment that we're in.

Robert F. Probst
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. This is an analysis, Michael, that began pre-COVID, that is the analysis of our SG&A. We're well
underway in that analysis, everything I would say is on the table as we think about that. I would expect to
have some more news this quarter as we're well underway on that analysis. And we do see opportunity.
But at the end of the day, we have a 20-year record of being efficient and effective, and that continues to
be our goal, and we have a duty to make sure we're doing that.

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

And Debbie, is there anyone splitting the Chairman and CEO role?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

I think that consistent with the idea that you want to be cost efficient our expectation is that I would
continue to hold those roles, obviously, serving at the pleasure of our shareholders and our Board of
Directors.

Operator

Your next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

So just on the Holiday and maybe an extrapolation from that. So EBITDA below rent. So it's obviously
a dilutive transaction, but understanding kind of the thought process sort of taking Sabra's road map
on Holiday. And so I'm curious if -- in the aftermath of all this, do you feel like net lease is becoming
an increasingly dying breed for Ventas? And you want more control that goes through Brookdale -- the
Brookdale and others? Or is this a one-off type of thing? And you still think that there's a role for triple-net
to play in senior housing in the aftermath of all this?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Good to talk with you, Rich. Let me take that. A couple of things. One is we are pleased with the holiday
transaction. We think it really does a lot of good things, and we're happy to take a page out of our friend
Rick Matros' book. And we've preserved good upside in the assets and a lot of operational flexibility. So we
feel good about that and look forward to optimizing that portfolio.

In terms of the triple-net lease, what I would say is triple-net leases are a little bit like mortgages in one
sense, which is that they magnify ups and downs for the operators. And in any challenging environment,
they're going to be disfavored, and of course, that's the situation we find ourselves in now. In other
environments, they could be very attractive to both owners as well as the operators.

So I think there's many tools in the bag, many -- I guess, you'd say clubs in the bag, tools in the toolkit.
And the triple-net lease, I think, will continue to be one, although -- and there are many ways that you
can customize leases also to create alignment. So we think the triple-net lease will survive, and we
think we'll continue to be creative and collaborative in how we work with our operators, be it tenants or
managers in optimizing our portfolio and in being good partners.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Okay. I prefer arrows in the quiver, but that's just me.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

That's a good one too, absolutely.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

And then can you juxtapose U.S. to Canadian, particularly as it relates to your recent investment there?
And how things are kind of performing relatively?

13

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Yes. I mean, our investment, most -- we have a significant Canadian portfolio. Obviously, the pandemic
has affected assets there as well. Those operators have also received significant government support.
And one thing we have liked about the Québec portfolio with LGM is that they have a younger, healthier
population, a longer length of stay. They're very rigorous and have been very active from early on
working to protect the residents. Obviously, that portfolio will be affected as well. But there are some
characteristics of the LGM portfolio that make it probably a better performer on a relative basis despite
being impacted by the pandemic.

Operator

Your next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

In terms of the Holiday restructuring, I just want to make sure -- understand how this is going to work.
I guess in terms of the money that you're receiving from them, the cash and then the notes, I mean, are
you going to be actually booking any income from those 2 items in the second quarter? And in terms of
the notes, the 9% rate, is there any component of that, that is cash interest that you're receiving?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Great question. The -- yes, the cash and notes are effectively income, and I think we mentioned
this in the release. And so those will be included in net income. And yes, we would expect as part of our
ongoing -- the ongoing notes, we would expect to book and receive some amount of interest income as we
go forward.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And is any of that cash income from those notes?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

We would expect it to be cash. Yes.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then I was just hoping to get a feel for -- I know you gave the coverage on Holiday as a trailing
number. Is it possible to get the quarterly first quarter EBITDARM for those assets, so we can understand
exactly from an NOI standpoint as you now have this operating NOI, what the delta is going to be between
the old $60 million of cash NOI that you got on the lease versus kind of on a real-time basis, realizing
things are going to move around still, but at least on the first quarter number, like what that looked like
from an operating EBITDAR basis?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Right. I mean, we've had Holiday in the heat map, obviously, and it had been below 1 on an EBITDAR
basis as we reported the last time. And really, what I would say is that just like everything else in the
portfolio, as you point out, it's really going to depend on how the pandemic really plays out. And so I think
we'll just defer that as we get more real-time information about the portfolio, I'm happy to talk to you
about it as things progress.

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Right. I guess, but I mean, you guys do have an actual number. I'm assuming that you know for the first
quarter, and that's how I was trying to see if we could at least get that number so we can use it as a base
to then build off some assumptions.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean -- I think you should look at about 0.9 EBITDARM coverage, something like that in the first
quarter, rough numbers.

Operator

Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Hello?

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Sorry, I had myself on mute. I just hope everyone in the team is okay and doing well. You referenced
the dividend in your prepared remarks. And I just -- I want to clarify one, I'm assuming the dividend is
all cash today. And just as we think about the dividend going in the second quarter, what are sort of the
metrics, what are you looking at? Maybe give us a sense of where AFFO versus the dividend could trend
even just percentage-wise? What are some of your puts and takes as you think about the dividend?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Yes. I mean, I think I really want to just touch on the fact that while we're in this period of
uncertainty, we generally want to match our decision-making speed with what's required. And our Board
is going to look at all relevant information when it addresses the dividend, as I mentioned, in mid- to late
June.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And the dividend is -- it's all cash currently?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

It has been, yes, Vikram.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just second, I think you and Bob outlaid the expectations for occupancy in the next few
months, I think it was about 100 basis points per month in the RIDEA portfolio, can you give us a sort of a
broader sense of what the ins and outs are in terms of assumptions for move-ins versus move outs? And
as an aside, if we could request more monthly or more time -- more weekly updates, that would be great.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

I'm going to ask Bob to address that, Vikram?

Robert F. Probst
Executive VP & CFO

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Sure. And I'll give you some building blocks Vikram, using April as our case study here. We saw move-ins
approximately 25% of our historic levels, or down 75%, put the other way. The move-outs have trended
pretty consistently with historical patterns. And the net of that is approximately a 70 basis point impact on
occupancy on a weekly basis.

One way to think about revenue impact of that, and this is in the Page 7 of the investor deck, if you
haven't seen this, is 100 basis points of occupancy generally, sequentially, on average, is about $2 million
to $3 million of revenue per month. So you can do math there. And we expect that trend as we see it right
now to carry on into May. On the expense side, we mentioned about 10% OpEx increase driven by labor
and supplies, including PP&E. We have about $125 million of monthly OpEx in our portfolio in SHOP. So it
gives you some more facts, if you like, to do the math.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Vikram we thought you'd love those rules to solve.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

No, definitely. I guess I was just trying to understand the move from the 330 basis points loss in the
month of April down to 100 per month. And I was just trying to understand more specifically, like what are
you assuming changes from April to May through June?

Robert F. Probst
Executive VP & CFO

Let me clarify just to make sure we're on the same page. The 330 basis points was the spot to spot
effectively beginning to end of April, occupancy move. And my 100 basis points was simply a rule of
thumb to help you. So that's an important clarification. Beyond what we're seeing in April and early into
May, I'm not able to project what I think it's going to be for the second quarter, for example. But those
give you some building blocks to make your own assumptions.

J. Justin Hutchens
Executive Vice President of Senior Housing - North America

This is Justin. I'm going to add a little color to that. It might be helpful. And I'll just preface this that I'm
going to give you April average occupancy numbers that are presented by our operators, and these aren't
fully vetted. We don't usually report these numbers. But I'm going to compare March 1. So March average
occupancy was 85%. April average is 82.4%. So there's 260 basis points difference. If you take New York
and New Jersey out, as I did in my prepared remarks when I was using spot occupancy, March average is
85.1%. April 82.9%. So the 220 basis point change.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

And that shows the difference between really the "spot" beginning a month to end of month versus the
average occupancies for the month. So let's carry on. Thank you.

Operator

Your next our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Debbie, I was wondering if you could add some color on the testing capabilities that you're providing your
operators. I don't know if you said this or if I missed it, but are you able to provide enough tests all the
residents at the facilities? Or what in-depth are you able to offer right now with that relationship?

Debra A. Cafaro

16

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Great. Great. So we're very excited about this initiative, and we are taking the first step with Atria.
And it's really to accelerate employee testing at Ventas buildings with select operators to make our
communities safer and facilitate thoughtful reopening and confidence and trust, as Justin talked about.
And so we have this first complement of 10,000 testing kits with Mayo Lab's analysis, which is very
important. They have a very high accuracy rate at Mayo, as you would imagine. And we really think this is
a great first step that we can make available. Atria has already done it. ESL will be next, and we'll make it
available to select operators principally for their employee testing programs.

Once we see how that goes, again, we're early days, still a lot of uncertainty, new testing and tools coming
out all the time, we'll determine if we want to re-up or if we want to take a different step moving forward.
But we think this is a great opportunity to do the right thing and really have a differentiated partnership
with our operators and really build that trust and confidence with residents and their families that is so
sorely needed.

Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And then what's the turnaround time? How long does it take to get to tests? And I guess, if you have
confidence that at least your employees are not infected by COVID. Is there discussions that you could
reopen those communities? Or is it still too early to tell?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

The turnaround is a day or 2, and it will indeed build confidence as a component of a thoughtful reopening
and admissions plan.

J. Justin Hutchens
Executive Vice President of Senior Housing - North America

And I'll just add one other point to that. This is Justin. All of our operators are considering their move
in protocols at this point and about 70% of our operators are operating in states that are starting to
loosen their stay-at-home policy. So this is a very active conversation. And the advantage that testing
gives you, obviously gives you a lot more certainty around the potential for spread of infection. But the
other advantage is it's recognized in the CDC guidelines. If testing occurs, then it can accelerate the time
that someone can move in, where the regular quarantine is around 14 days, I think testing allows for
something closer to 2 or 3 days.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Right. And that's a good point because the test may also be available for new residents in certain cases.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Jordan Sadler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I hope everybody is doing well. My first question, I think, is maybe for Bob. I'll leave it to you, Debbie
to quarterback. But regarding the revolver drawdown and I think some subsequent repayments post the
senior note issuance in April, you did mention in your conversation that Ventas has passed the peak from
mortality in your SHOP assets and triple-net. And so I guess I'm kind of curious, I know you're waiting
until the last minute to make a decision on the dividend. But what do you want to see vis-à-vis the virus
before -- in order to sort of pay down those borrowings and sort of what is that sort of drawdown? Is that
reflecting concerns surrounding the ability to potentially borrow still?

Debra A. Cafaro

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Well, I will turn it over to Bob. But one thing we know for sure is that having been through many decades
of this that having assured liquidity is the #1, 2 and 3 attributes that you want to have to manage
successfully through any kind of uncertainty. And so we have that. And that's kind of a golden rule, and it
served us very, very well.

In terms of the past the peak. Again, there are numerous models. There's a lot of uncertainty. But as of
a point in time, I'm glad that you noticed our data that shows that a lot of our NOI in our senior housing
communities on both triple-net and SHOP is in states where, according to a single model as of a certain
date, the peak of mortality is behind us. Now that could change again, and that, of course, would affect
our outlook.

Jordan Sadler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. I guess I'm trying to understand the difference between that assured liquidity as it relates
to sort of that revolver borrowing or drawdown versus the dividend that you actually pay. So there's some
uncertainty surrounding the potential to be able to draw or have access to cash, but it seems like you
have -- you're not yet willing to sort of cut the dividend down to 0 in order to sort of stave off or protect
yourself from any uncertainty? Or maybe I'm misreading that.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, I think what we've said clearly about the dividend is that the Board will make that decision at
the right time, which -- our dividend is a July dividend historically. And so that would basically defer that
decision to be made by our Board until mid- to late June. So do you have a question for Bob about the
revolver Jason?

Jordan Sadler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

It's Jordan.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Jordan. I'm looking at...

Jordan Sadler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I think you answered it.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Sorry about that.

Jordan Sadler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's okay. I think you answered it. But maybe you mentioned, Justin, I wanted to welcome him back
to REIT land, unfortunately, under these crazy circumstances. But I would have asked him for a review
of the portfolio is probably not fully appropriate Debbie. A couple of years ago, you spun off the skilled
nursing portfolio at a time when there were some real distress in that sector. Any thoughts surrounding
management and/or the potential spend of the seniors housing portfolio? Or are we just -- is that way too
soon and I don't mean to be flippant at all in that question?

18

VENTAS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Yes. I think that on the skilled nursing, I think we -- I'm glad you reminded us of that, that we really did
that at the absolute peak time and valuations at a 7% cap on rent at that time. And we really continue to
believe that was a very sound strategic decision, particularly as we look at infection mortality rates and
skilled nursing now. I think we -- given all the uncertainty, right now, we're focused on health and safety
as Justin said and really this strong effort to keep Ventas strong and stable and get ready for any scenario
and opportunities in the future. So we'll defer that discussion, if you don't mind.

Operator

Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

I clearly have too many people with the first initial J in my list. Anyway, go ahead. I'll try to get it right this
time.

Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. Just curious on the Holiday switch to the management contract. Was that something you were in
discussion with before the pandemic? Or was it really the pandemic was the driver that kind of got you
going on that discussion?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Well, we've talked about Holiday for a while and have been pretty clear about what the performance was
over the past couple of years. I think we're in a good spot because we were -- Holiday remains current
and paying full rent all the way through the first quarter, and they've been great about that. And we
were the sole beneficiary of the guarantor. So of course, we had EBITDAR kind of one-to-one coverage.
So we felt like we were in a good spot. But we did feel mutually that it was the right time to take a
different approach. And we did so in a way that we think was beneficial for both and preserves upside and
operational flexibility. So we're happy that we've done it. We're going to -- we're going to optimize that
portfolio, especially now that Justin is here.

Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then just on the senior housing triple-net rents. I see in your presentation, you mentioned,
I guess, for May rents are allowing up to 25% of the rent to get paid from the deposits, you expect $2
million or so to be paid. Do you have a sense of like, I guess, back into it, but what percent of tenants are
taking advantage of that? And I guess, later on, would you require the tenants to kind of backfill those
deposits?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Right. Justin?

J. Justin Hutchens
Executive Vice President of Senior Housing - North America

Yes. It's actually a very low percentage. If you think about around, what, $30 million of rent per month
and only around $2 million of -- up to $2 million, we think, will be paid with the cash escrows or security
deposit. So not a lot. I'll mention 2 other things on the triple-net. One is that, as we said, it's -- our May
collections are really right on track. So looking good in May. Also, some of our April tenants that took
advantage of that deferral have already paid back, so that was a good encouraging sign as well. And in
that case, there were smaller operators that had taken advantage of government assistance. But our

happy that some of the operators have taken advantage of that.

Operator

Your next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Welcome Justin. I had a question on -- I had a question on your deposits that were mentioned. We had
deposits in senior housing. Is there any difference regionally? Does New York, New Jersey have more or
fewer deposits than some of the other markets not impacted by the virus?

J. Justin Hutchens
Executive Vice President of Senior Housing - North America

Well, and this is Justin. Let me just mention, first of all, we don't normally track deposits because it's
senior housing, particularly assisted living and memory care, where we focus is need driven. So tracking
deposits is usually a very short-term indicator of a move in. But given the environment, we've started
to track recently. A lot of those deposits are in Sunrise. And Sunrise has kind of a northeast footprint
with us. So there is certainly some New York and Massachusetts and other. If you look at our Sunrise
footprint, a lot of those deposits are with them. There's another stat I'll mention that's around leads,
which is something that we do track regularly. And leads have stabilized over the past few weeks at about
half of our typical lead volume, which is encouraging in a sense because it shows that there's still ongoing
demand, even though we're not giving physical tours and we're giving virtual tours in lieu of those. There's
still ongoing demand. And it's ahead of that move in pace that we've been experiencing so far. But there's
a long answer to a short question, and that is I'm not ready to really point out specific geographies except
to say that Sunrise is a big part of those deposits.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And then Pete mentioned in the prepared remarks, the high retention rates you guys had in the
medical office business. Can you provide some terms on that? Are these short-term or month-to-month
lease extensions? And also what the cash leasing spreads were?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Pete?

Peter J. Bulgarelli
Executive Vice President of Office

Yes. So John, let me just be sure that I understand what you're asking. What we talked about was 96%
receipt of cash rents overall in the office portfolio. Is that what you're asking?

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

No, I was talking about the retention rates, the renewal rates.

Peter J. Bulgarelli
Executive Vice President of Office

I see. Okay. So for retention rates, yes, the 90% for the quarter, 94% for March and for April is 98%,
which is a phenomenal set of numbers. And I would say it's a mix. In some cases, they're short term,
where they're just uncertain about their future. And so they want to just take a year extension. In other
cases, we view the opportunity to take advantage of maybe some rent relief in exchange for a couple of
years of additional term. So we've been fairly entrepreneurial in doing that. And then there's also some

practical reasons. I'll tell you kind of an interesting story of an OB-GYN, who is 70 something years old,
who was going to retire. Then he sat back and he thought, you know what, with this shelter-at-home,
maybe there's going to be a lot of births in 9 months from now, so I'm going to extend for one more year,
and I'm going to work and cash in on this opportunity. So it's been a mixture of things.

Your next question comes from Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors.

Lukas Michael Hartwich
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Whenever we do come out the other side of the COVID pandemic, I'm just curious what you think the
recovery in SHOP looks like. Do you expect there to be pent-up demand? Or do you expect something
more gradual?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think our focus right now is really getting through the biggest part of the pandemic Lukas. And
then there remains really a lot of uncertainty about the depth and the time period where it will be most
active, and then what's the slope and pace of recovery will look like. And those will -- those could very
significantly affect what the recovery in senior housing looks like. So I'll be really happy for the day when
we can discuss that with more specificity in terms of timing, pace and slope. But right now, we're focused
on maximizing during the course of the toughest period of the pandemic.

Lukas Michael Hartwich
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then second one for me is just can you provide a little more color on the performance trends of
the Sunrise SHOP portfolio?

Debra A. Cafaro

Justin?

J. Justin Hutchens
Executive Vice President of Senior Housing - North America

Yes, sure. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the year-over-year stats that were down and the
reasons for that given the fact that we are starting off at a lower starting point. And then I also mentioned
the strong sequential performance. That performance was driven by Atria and ESL. Sunrise was not as big
of a contributor to that. There's some less good performance from the Sunrise portfolio during that time.
So it is actually contributing on a sequential basis closer to down around 9%.

Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho.

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya

Yes. Justin, good to have you back from Jolly Old England old chap. So a couple of questions. The first one
is actually on the office side. The 96% of April rents collected, is there a way you could help us break it
down kind of what's the rates of MOB versus life sciences, were there big differences there?

Peter J. Bulgarelli
Executive Vice President of Office

Tayo, this is Pete. So the 96%, we're very pleased with it, and one of the items I did want to point out is
that those are receipts. Those are -- deferrals are not included in that number. And as a matter of fact, for

April, there are almost 0 deferrals. We're talking like $150,000 worth of deferrals in April, and those were
for retail tenants. So this is true cash receipts and collected in a very positive way.

The MOB portfolio had a slightly higher collection rate for April, and the R&I had a slightly lower number,
but really nothing material. And it's interesting is that many of the universities are just -- they still write --
they do hand checks. They actually write checks out. And it's a slower process in a normal month, and it's
a slower process in a turbulent month. So that's my assessment.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

I mean, those portfolios performed very well.

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then on the life sciences side, again, very strong same-store NOI this quarter. Again, its been
a positive on the overall Ventas story. So I guess a little bit surprised when we look at the development
pipeline that the projects that were halted are all kind of life science Wexford projects. And there was
one other project, also life sciences where the completion date was deferred or pushed back a year. So
just kind of curious how you're kind of thinking about that business that is having such a big positive on
your overall story and again part of what's kind of happening on the development front either halting or
delaying some of these development projects?

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

You are absolutely right. We are happy that we have grown our office portfolio, and particularly this
exciting life science university-based portfolio over the past years. It's really -- you're seeing the benefit
of that right now, both in the fact that, that's where all the action is on the virus and the vaccines and the
search for a cure as well as the diversification benefits we're getting from that portfolio within the broader
Ventas enterprise. And so we do have -- it is a significant capital allocation priority. We do have a number
of ongoing projects with Arizona State and Penn to name a few.

And basically, what we did as a matter of, I think, really good discipline and approach is that we -- when
we really understood quickly the potential from this coronavirus, we paused, aggressively paused on the 2
developments that really were not yet significantly underway. And so the ones that are ongoing are going
to be delivered and will have 80% pre-leased. And the ones that are on the drawing board have been
paused, I think, intelligently to take a look at capital conservation. And of course, as I mentioned, we'll be
able to make a decision on those at the appropriate time as to moving forward and timing and the like. We
are happy to have this portfolio, and it will continue to be an important part of the Ventas story.

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Okay. One more, if you would indulge me.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

You bet.

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So when Justin was announced as joining the team, and you guys announced your kind of plans around
senior housing, stock outperformed that day, today you announced solid plans around Holidays, the stock
is outperforming. So clearly, I think the market is looking for you guys to kind of rectify potential issues
that people see in the portfolio. Just kind of given that, I guess, why is -- why are you guys maybe not a
little bit more aggressive in regards to kind of trying to address some of these issues, whether it's some of

the triple-net portfolio that still has weak rent coverage and things of that nature. It just kind of feels like
the market is basically saying do it, we're expecting you to do it, but it's in the near term, it just doesn't
seem to be happening as quickly as I think some of us are anticipating.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Well, I would say that we, over a long period of time, have a good track record of taking action and that
we think is going to be beneficial for our shareholders, and we've taken many actions to evidence that,
whether they've been with Kindred or today with Holiday. And we will continue to do that. We've made a
ton of progress. We're proud of what we've done on the leadership front, as you mentioned along with the
portfolio front. And we will continue to do that with urgency and purpose. And hopefully, we'll continue to
get rewarded for doing the right things at the right time.

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So that's helpful. Well, I just feel like the runway is clearly open and everyone was waiting for you guys to
take off.

Debra A. Cafaro
Chairman & CEO

Well, thank you. We appreciate that support. We -- our wings are flapping. Thank you, Tayo. I think
we have one more operator. Anything further? Okay. If we don't have any further questions, I want to
sincerely thank you for your time, your attention, your interest in Ventas. We have a great team here
that's really committed to protecting and preserving the company and for really delivering for all the
stakeholders who depend upon us.

So we look forward to seeing you on the other side of this terrible pandemic. And until then, stay safe and
strong. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now
disconnect.
