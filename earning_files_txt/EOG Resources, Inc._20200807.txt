Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the EOG Resources Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results
Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial
Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.

Timothy K. Driggers
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, and good morning. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter
2020 earnings and operational results.

This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking
statements have been outlined in the earnings release, in EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by
reference for this call.

This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions, as well as
reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures, can be found on
our website at www.eogresources.com.

Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call are in the accompanying investor presentation
slides, may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily
calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the
cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday.

Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating
Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP, Exploration and Production;
Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing, and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations.

Here's Bill Thomas.

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG's second quarter results demonstrate the company's
ability to quickly adapt to an unprecedented drop in commodity prices. We exceeded our own expectations
by delivering more oil for less capital and lower operating costs, allowing the company to generate
significant free cash flow during the quarter.

In May, we published our revised plan, which aggressively reduced our full year of capital, more than
45%; and LOE, more than 20%. EOG employees rose to the challenge, not only achieving the incredible
reduction targets we set but beating them. Compared to our aggressive plan and guidance for the second
quarter, we produced 7% more oil, spent a whopping 26% less capital and our cash operating costs, which
includes LOE, transportation and gathering and processing were 10% lower. With the rapid reduction in
capital and operating costs, the company generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow, while oil prices
averaged less than $28 a barrel.

Our second quarter results are a testament to the return-focused culture of EOG employees and our ability
to pivot quickly in response to the unprecedented level of market volatility and industry conditions. Last
quarter, we laid out 7 strategic focus points for the remainder of 2020. Here's a quick progress report.

Our first strategic point is only to invest capital if it generates a premium rate of return. Premium return
is defined as a 30% or higher direct after-tax rate of return using a price deck of $40 flat oil. In this
downturn, we have raised the return bar even higher by using $30 oil instead of $40 to calculate our 30%
rate of return.

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

Our second focus point this year is to exercise operational flexibility to quickly reduce costs. With capital
26% below target and cash operating cost 10% below target, our second quarter results demonstrate our
ability to move quickly in a volatile environment.

Our third focus point is to accelerate our technical innovation across the company. This is an area
we're most excited about. While we anticipated some additional opportunity for innovation because of
the slowdown in our pace of development, our employees' ability to accelerate innovation even while
working remotely has exceeded our expectations. We recently completed our yearly technical conferences
across each discipline, all via video conferencing. We are amazed at the volume of new innovative ideas
presented from creative ways to cut costs to new tools to identify and evaluate prospects. I am confident
that the tremendous progress we've made this year will accelerate EOG's lead as these sustainable
improvements start paying dividends in the future by driving down the price of oil required to generate
double-digit returns and extend EOG's industry leadership and return on capital employed.

Our fourth focus point is to exit 2020 with momentum into next year by increasing production into the
price recovery. As Billy will cover in a few minutes, we've increased our quarterly and full year production
volume estimates. In addition, with the cost reductions we're making this year, we have improved
our maintenance capital outlook for 2021. We now expect we will be able to maintain higher volumes
for the same capital and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow at less than $40 oil. Our
improvements in volume, coupled with reductions in well and operating costs, are setting us up for strong
performance next year.

Our fifth focal point this year is to remain hyper-diligent about maintaining our financial strength. Our goal
each year is to spend within cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet to support operations
and protect our dividend. This downturn has demonstrated the value of EOG's historically strong balance
sheet more than ever. With this goal in mind, we reduced CapEx more than 45% to $3.5 billion, so that
full year cash flow funds CapEx in the low 30s. If oil prices average $40 for the year, full year cash flow
also funds the dividend and generates free cash flow.

Sixth, our focus is to continue to invest in the long-term value of the business. In fact, once again, this
break in our pace of development has actually accelerated our progress by creating more time to fine-
tune our quality exploration market. We continue to drill on prospects that we believe will further improve
company performance. You will hear from Ezra in a moment regarding recent exploration progress.

The seventh focus point this year is the most important. Protecting and enhancing EOG's culture is the
key to our continued success. We have highly skilled employees who are focused on constantly improving
every area of the company. We remain committed to our employees as they are the ones who are making
EOG a much better company during this downturn. Armed with extensive data, proprietary apps and
information technology, EOG employees are overcoming the challenging conditions by continuing not only
to innovate but to accelerate innovation. We believe we're in the process of making another significant
improvement in EOG's performance similar to the last downturn when we initiated our premium drilling
program in 2016.

As a reminder, with premium standards in place from 2017 to 2019, EOG delivered an industry-leading
average return on capital employed of 14%, generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow, increased the
dividend by 72% and reduced net debt $2.2 billion and increased proved reserves by 55%. The EOG
culture is rising to the challenge again with innovation that is significantly improving the company's
current and future performance.

EOG's long-term game plan has not changed. We remain focused on high-return reinvestment, disciplined
organic growth and generating substantial free cash flow to fund a sustainable growing dividend and
maintain a strong balance sheet. EOG will emerge from the downturn a much better company and our
commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders has never been stronger.

Before I turn it over to Tim and Billy, I want to note how excited we are to continue our progress towards
reducing GHG emissions. We are near the start-up of our 8-megawatt solar and natural gas hybrid
electric-powered compressor station. In addition, we recently formed a sustainable power group within the
company. This group will support our innovative culture to bring return-focused, low-emissions technology

and projects forward quickly. EOG is committed to being an innovative leader in sustainability and the
long-term energy solution.

Next up is Tim.

Timothy K. Driggers
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Bill. EOG proved to be exceptionally resilient during one of the most severe quarters for the
industry in our memory. I'd like to review the high level changes in EOG's cash position during the second
quarter.

EOG had $2.9 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter. During the second quarter, the company
generated discretionary cash flow of $672 million. And after deducting CapEx of $478 million, we
generated $194 million of free cash flow that nearly covered dividend payments of $217 million.

Over time, EOG's working capital position tends to be fairly balanced between current assets and
liabilities. However, during periods of market volatility, our working capital balance can fluctuate
significantly from quarter-to-quarter. Changes in working capital in the second quarter represented a net
cash outflow of $1 billion, which was more than offset by net cash inflow from working capital in the first
quarter of $1.2 billion. We expect changes in working capital will be approximately neutral for the full year
2020 based on the current outlook for commodity prices.

Moving on to the financing side of the ledger. EOG issued $1.5 billion of new debt and paid off a total of
$1 billion of maturing notes during the quarter. This left the company with $2.4 billion of cash on hand at
the end of the second quarter. Considering total debt of $5.7 billion, this yields a net debt to total cap ratio
of 14%. In addition to cash on hand, our very strong liquidity position is further supported by a $2 billion
unsecured revolving line of credit, which has no borrowings against it.

Looking ahead, we expect discretionary cash flow to exceed CapEx and dividend payments for the
remainder of 2020 at oil prices in the mid-30s. In late April and early May, we elected to close out most
of our hedge positions for the remainder of the year as the volatility in commodity markets had abated
and prices seem to have more upside than downside. We effected this primarily by entering into offsetting
contracts for those hedge positions we elected to close. Therefore, the timing of cash received or paid for
settlement of these closed-out hedges will remain in the periods for which they are effective. We expect
to receive $360 million in net cash payments in the second half of 2020 from these hedge positions that
have been closed. As 2021 comes into focus, we will be opportunistic about adding hedges if prices look
attractive relative to our assessment of market fundamentals.

Next up is Billy to review our operational performance.

Lloyd W. Helms
Chief Operating Officer

Thanks, Tim. Last quarter, we made the decision to shut in existing production and defer new wells rather
than sell into an uncertain and low-price market. Our intent was that our lowest activity levels, lowest
capital expenditures and lowest production volumes would coincide with the lowest point of the commodity
price curve. In doing so, we enhanced the cash flow and margins for each barrel produced and maximized
the rate of return for our investments.

Our employees' execution of our challenging new plan during the second quarter was stellar. They
answered the challenge by beating by a wide margin nearly every capital expense and production goal we
targeted under the new plan. After rapidly reducing our full year capital plan by nearly half, second quarter
capital came in an additional 26% below target. We also reduced our cash operating expenses a total of
10% compared to the target.

One of the hallmarks of EOG is driving for continuous improvements, but the downturn brought a new
intensity to this effort. Our employees delivered even more by continuing to innovate capital and expense
reductions that will benefit future operations. For example, we increased our full year total well cost

6

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

reduction target to 12%, up from 8% just a few months ago. Our operating teams continue to drive
efficiency in every aspect of our business. Drilling times are consistently improving, yet completion costs
have seen the most improvement during the quarter, down more than 15%.

About half of the capital savings can be attributed to cost efficiencies and the other half to service cost
reductions. Our drilling rigs and frac fleets are largely under existing term contracts, so service cost
savings have been more from ancillary services. As rig and frac fleet contracts expire, we expect to see
further cost reductions. Therefore, we believe most of these savings to be sustainable.

Our cash operating costs were down more than $50 million or 10% relative to our second quarter
guidance. Our operating teams went into high gear to identify opportunities to reduce expenses during
the second quarter with a focus on every category. Some of the largest cost reductions are our reduced
work over expenses, water disposal and lease maintenance and repairs. These reduced expenses played
a major role in helping to generate free cash flow during the second quarter. It is also important to note
that we have reduced our full year cash operating cost guidance by almost $20 million or 6% on a per unit
basis.

On the production side, we also beat our forecast. This is mainly due to bringing the shut-in volumes
back on sooner than anticipated. One observation from our production data revealed that almost every
well exhibited some level of flush production before returning to its previous decline profile, further
evidence that the well sustained no damage from the shut-in period. In addition, the decline observed
from the base production was less than previously forecasted, also contributing to the production beat.
As a result, we have raised our full year oil production guidance by 16,000 barrels of oil per day or 4%.
Our dramatically reduced activity and the temporary shut in of production, combined with the expense
reductions, generated positive net cash flow and deferred a large amount of production into a higher-price
quarter.

Slide 12 of our presentation this quarter illustrates the updated shut-in volumes and the corresponding
product price.

While we have slowed our overall spending, we have maintained our commitment to reducing GHG
emissions by continuing to invest in innovative new technologies and initiatives. Our focus on reducing
flaring continues with our gas capture rate now exceeding 99.5%. To further minimize flaring, particularly
when caused by unpredictable downstream market interruptions, we tested a new EOG innovation we
have named closed-loop gas capture. Closed-loop gas capture is an automated process developed in-
house to reroute natural gas back into existing wells when a downstream interruption occurs. Initial
results were successful and indicate that our closed-loop gas capture process has the potential to both
reduce flaring and return the majority of the captured gas from the well back to production.

In late 2019, we initiated a pilot project in New Mexico to combine solar and natural gas to power electric
motor-driven compressors. Compressors typically use natural gas to power the engines and are a source
of GHG emissions from stationary combustion. Since solar power is only available during the day, we
designed a hybrid power plant to supplement daytime solar power generation with reliable natural gas
generation at night. During the day, the solar panel should produce 8 megawatts of power with no
combustion emissions. Compared to the traditional natural gas-powered compression, we believe our
hybrid power compression will result in lower operating expenses and a meaningful reduction in emissions.
This facility will become operational later this month.

Both of these projects demonstrate that we approach ESG like every aspect of our business, focusing on
sound economic decisions and continuously improving our operations. EOG has a long history of adapting
to changing industry conditions and using technology to improve the company. As Bill noted earlier, to
further enhance our efforts to be a leader in GHG reduction, we recently announced a new strategic
initiative to identify and implement returns-focused, low-emissions power generation within EOG. We are
confident that this initiative led by our sustainable power group will be another area in which EOG will
lead the way in finding more cost-effective methods to generate power while reducing our impact on the
environment and generating a healthy rate of return.

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

And finally, I am extremely proud of how all of our employees have responded to this year's challenges
and doing so while adapting to remote working conditions.

Here's Ezra for an update on recent exploration success in Trinidad.

Ezra Y. Yacob
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Thanks, Billy. EOG has had a very successful business in Trinidad for 27 years. About 20% of EOG's
natural gas production comes from shallow water offshore fields in the Columbus Basin of Trinidad. Most
of the gas is sold as feedstock into a sizable petrochemical industry on the island, primarily producing
ammonia and methanol.

Trinidad has had a competitive financial profile within EOG due to our competitive advantages in the
country as a low-cost operator and our long track record of exploration success. While our capital
investments in Trinidad typically make up a small percentage of our overall CapEx budget, the returns on
that capital are competitive with EOG's domestic portfolio and consistently generate free cash flow and net
income.

The latest round of exploration and development in Trinidad kicked off in the spring of 2018 with the
acquisition of a set of modern seismic images. The combination of new seismic and updated geologic
models provided a deep inventory of prospects to develop our exploration plan. This plan included farming
into new acreage held by another operator where we could apply our low-cost structure to improve the
economics on these high-potential exploration blocks. Drilling began in July 2019, and we have recorded
4 initial discoveries with estimated natural gas potential of 1 Tcf gross and 500 Bcf net to EOG. The
discoveries are located in shallow water off the Southeast Coast of Trinidad.

Our 2 open water exploration wells support the installation of new production platforms beginning in
2021. The final 2 wells in the current drilling campaign are in process and should be completed by year-
end. Production from this drilling campaign will more than offset natural declines from existing wells
and provide a foundation of growth for EOG's total production in Trinidad. Lastly, the initial success of
this latest exploration program sets up the potential for additional delineation and exploration drilling in
Trinidad in future years.

I would also like to take a moment to discuss our ongoing domestic exploration effort. We have made
good progress moving multiple prospects forward during 2020 despite a reduction to our initial capital
plan. Leasing across multiple basins is going well, and we are capturing contiguous positions in what
we feel are the sweet spots of these plays. We have initiated drilling in some projects and are currently
incorporating modern well logs and core data into our geologic models. We look forward to providing
updates regarding the testing of these prospects at an appropriate time.

Next up is Bill to provide concluding remarks.

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Ezra. In conclusion, I would like to note the following important takeaways. First, our second
quarter operational results were outstanding. We rapidly reduced capital and operating costs while
increasing volumes. This resulted in significant free cash flow. Second, we have improved our full year
2020 guidance by increasing volumes and further reducing costs. Third, our 2021 maintenance outlook
has improved to include more oil with no increase in capital. We can maintain higher volumes and cover
both capital and the dividend with cash flow at less than $40 oil. Fourth, as demonstrated by our results,
the EOG culture continues to rapidly and sustainably improve the company. During this downturn, we
believe we're in the process of making another step change to improve profitability. And finally, EOG's
fundamentals have not changed. Our focus on returns, disciplined growth and generation of significant
free cash flow to fund a growing sustainable dividend and strong balance sheet have not wavered. Our
commitment to creating long-term shareholder value has never been stronger.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color on some of the cost reductions on the well side from a
capital perspective this year. Just looking through the slides, I mean, it looks like maybe it's a little bit
more concentrated in the Permian in terms of your expectations. I know that's where a lot of your activity
is occurring. But are you seeing kind of outsized gains there maybe relative to the Eagle Ford in terms of
your expectations for rest of the year?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thank you, Leo. We're going to ask Billy to comment on that.

Lloyd W. Helms
Chief Operating Officer

Yes, you're right. Most of our CapEx is generally directed towards the Delaware Basin. So certainly, on a
dollar basis, that's where most of the savings are as well. Just to give you a little more color on the capital
savings, about 1/3 of the capital savings are from efficiency gains, 1/3 are from pricing improvements and
1/3 is really just delaying facilities and infrastructure from the second quarter into the future third and
fourth quarter. So from that, we were able to see most of the cost savings probably on the completion
side of our business, as I mentioned during the notes on the call. And you have to remember, we're still
under some long-term contracts for drilling rigs and frac fleets. So as those roll off, we expect to be able
to capture some of the market rate savings on those in the future. But we're seeing savings on some other
ancillary services that I mentioned, largely things like maybe chemicals being down 20% to 25%, some
of the equipment rentals being down 20% to 30% and things like that. So you're seeing some savings on
some of the other aspects of the business, not necessarily on the frac fleets and drilling rigs.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful color for sure. And I guess I was hoping maybe you could talk a little about the
potential issue surrounding federal acreage here. Certainly saw from the slides that you guys are kind of
saying roughly half your premium inventory is located on federal land. So obviously, the election is clearly
uncertain, but do you guys have any thoughts as to kind of whether or not there might be any limitations
going forward on the event of a Biden victory?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Leo, this is Bill. We've got a lot of experience drilling on federal land for decades. And we've been able
to successfully navigate all the changes in the past. We've had many changes over the years. And so I'm
confident we're well positioned to continue to adapt and not let those changes significantly affect us. There
are 2 reasons why I'm confident, and then I'll ask Billy to add some additional color. The first is we've
got a large amount of premium quality drilling potential on nonfederal land. So we have a tremendous
inventory that's really not affected federal changes that provides significant operational flexibility. On top
of that, our exploration program that Ezra mentioned, we believe, is going to provide some outstanding
opportunities to continue to improve our inventory with better rock, and most of that is located on
nonfederal land. So we've got a lot of confidence that we can continue to generate and add nonfederal
potential that's even better than what we have.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

And then we've got a very strong growing backlog of approved drilling permits on federal land. And I
think Billy has got some numbers on that. And then number two, our government has a system of checks
and balances that allow the voices of many stakeholders to be heard. And as a part of these checks and
balances, any changes would take time and have to consider all those stakeholder interests. And so the
success of our responsible development is aligned with many important states and communities where
we operate. For example, from federal lands, they're shared -- the revenues are shared with the states.
And in 2019, over $2 billion of revenue was paid out to over 35 states. So it's not an easy thing to change
significantly the federal drilling potential.

So I'm going to ask Billy to add some more color.

Lloyd W. Helms
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, we're starting with a lot of flexibility. With our decentralized culture,
multi-basin approach, we have the ability to move activity around quite extensively. On top of that, our
exploration program, which is in basins really outside of our current operating areas, has the opportunity
to further add to our nonfederal drilling inventory. As Bill mentioned, we have quite a few premium
locations that we've announced. And about half of those are on nonfederal lands. In addition, almost half
of our premium locations that work at $30 are also on nonfederal lands. And you can look at Slide 10 of
our deck that illustrates that. So the part of those that meet the rate of return hurdle at $30, about half
of those are nonfederal. So a pretty good distribution of both federal and nonfederal make up that entire
inventory list.

And the nonfederal inventory is just as high-quality as our federal. So in fact, of our nonfederal inventory,
it supports at least 8 years of drilling with similar capital efficiency as we're experiencing in our 2020 plan.
And Bill mentioned, we have quite a few federal permits. We have about 2,500 federal permits that are
approved or in progress, which is certainly more than 4 years of inventory. And also in the Permian Basin,
over 90% of our federal acreage is held by production. Our government also provides, as Bill mentioned,
an important system of checks and balances, which provides for due process before any regulatory
changes, and these changes have to consider the interest of all stakeholders. Ultimately, regulatory and
legislative changes that deny access to current property rights could amount to a government taking. So
there'll certainly be some legal consequences of going through the process.

And then just to point out, too, we have a very close alignment with our stakeholders, including the
communities we work in. New Mexico is a great example of that. We recently conducted a very successful
partnership with the state to complete our closed-loop gas capture project that I mentioned earlier. And
on a day-to-day basis, I'm very proud of that close working relationship we have built with the regulatory
agencies really to have a responsible development, open communication, paying attention to their needs.
It also enables us to meet our goals and operate in a timely and efficient manner. And our success, in
turn, has helped support the quality of life for the people of New Mexico, for example. In 2019, the state
received nearly 40% of its overall revenue from the oil and gas industry. And that certainly supports the
initiatives to increase funding for public health, education, infrastructure improvements and so on. On
top of that, oil and gas development supports 100,000 jobs in New Mexico, along with the associated
economic activity and benefits.

A significant amount of that revenue from oil and gas activities on federal lands is also disbursed to the
state governments to support local communities. And of course, the 2 states that benefited the most are
New Mexico and Wyoming. New Mexico received $1.2 billion and Wyoming $641 million in 2019 alone.
And the BLM estimates that oil and gas activity on federal lands provided about $70 billion of economic
uplift nationally and supported about 300,000 jobs. So there's a lot of important considerations and
stakeholders involved in any of these decisions to consider when changing the rules on federal land. So for
these reasons, along with our diverse and really growing inventory, we remain extremely confident that
EOG will be able to continue to navigate through any changing regulatory landscape just as we have in the
past.

And our next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I'm intrigued by the comment that bringing back shut-ins led to flush production and lower-than-expected
decline. Is there a learning there to apply to future developments? And is the mechanism understood?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Billy, do you want to comment on that? Or Ken?

Kenneth W. Boedeker
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Yes, this is Ken, Bob. The majority of our wells are single-zone wells under primary depletion. So as we
shut those wells in, they continue to build bottom-hole pressure. And then when we turn them on, those
wells will show flush production until that bottom-hole pressure has gone down to what it was prior to
that. So it's a mechanism that's well understood for the horizontal wells that we have that are under
that. We don't have any wells that are under waterfloods or multiple zones where you can have one zone
damaging another. So it is well understood, and it's following exactly what we expected on the flush
production profiles.

And then what about the lower-than-expected decline?

Kenneth W. Boedeker
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

On the base decline, in terms of the base decline, we see the lower base decline was just that we saw
those wells. We had forecasted them conservatively, and the wells are performing better than what we
thought they would.

Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Bill or Billy, I'm just curious, I mean, one of the comments is that with the slowdown in the activity, you
have seen a substantial improvement in the efficiency because you have more time there to work on. So if
we extrapolate that, I mean, even when the commodity prices are returning to a higher level, is it better
off for the company from a return standpoint for you to slow your activity level and not trying to grow as
fast?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Paul, thank you. The efficiencies, we've seen a substantial amount of innovative ideas that have been
generated. And I think when people have more time to think, instead of doing things, they think through
and able to look at the data and analyze it, they're able to come up with more ideas and a lot of creative
ideas. One of the basis of our disciplined growth strategy is to grow at a pace that we can get better. We
don't ever want to grow so fast and have so much activity that we cannot get better at the same time.
So it really is a balance. You can only allocate capital at a certain speed. If you go too fast, you outrun
your learning curve, et cetera, et cetera. So there is a benefit to a proper pace, and we have been able to
benefit from this slowdown.

Every downturn that we are in, and we experienced multiple ones over my 40 years, every downturn,
we make the biggest improvements in the company. It's a challenge. The times are challenging. This has
been, though, different than any of the others, other than we're working more remotely than we ever
have. And we're very fortunate to have in place our very extensive inflation technology system and our
database and all of our apps in that we've leveraged all that technology to analyze and to make changes
and to come up with ideas how to try to continue to improve the company. So we're super excited about
where we're headed. I think we're going to exit this downturn a much, much better company, able to
generate even higher returns than we have in the past and really do all of our business better than we
have in the past. So it's a very exciting time for us.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Can I follow up on that slightly different way? One of your major competitors is also a well-known
premium growth E&P company had drastically shifted their business model and taken a more balanced
growth and cash return and with a well-defined cash flow reinvestment approach or a distribution
approach. And one of the arguments that they also make is that while growing faster may, on paper, see
a higher net present value but in the margins, you are at the mercy of OPEC. And I think the behavior
of MBS and Putin in the recent times show that, that may no longer be reliable to depend on. So I mean
do you guys agree with that kind of argument? And if not, why not? I mean we're trying to understand
why a premium operator like EOG will not want perhaps to have a more balanced growth and cash return
business model and trying to grow at a slower pace than what you previously has been, even when the
commodity price is getting much higher?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Paul, yes, that's an excellent observation. And we are fundamentally a return-focused company, and that's
what we've been doing for a number of years. If you look back at the last 3 years -- we gave out these
numbers, they're on our slide deck, and I talked about it in opening -- we've been a leader in the industry
in return on capital employed. So we're focused on improving returns every year, and we've also been a
leader in generating free cash flow. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow over the last 3 years, every
year, for $4.6 billion. And that funded a very sustainable growing dividend. We increased the dividend by
72%. And we reduced our debt, our net debt by over $2 billion.

So we've been a very disciplined company, and we did all that at a spending level that was our cash --
our CapEx to cash flow ratio was about 80%. So really, what you're hearing from really the rest of the
industry is we're now moving into the model that EOG has been working really for the last 3 years. And
we're thrilled about that. That is fantastic for the industry, for investors. And certainly, it's very positive for
oil prices as we move forward. So we agree. They're doing the right thing. And that's the thing that we've
been doing for a number of years, and we fully support their move.

Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc.

Nice to see the continued diversified approach. My first question is around comments in your release
about the improved 2021 maintenance CapEx leading to a higher 4Q exit rate. And really, I guess, Bill, my
comments on this, based on this, could you speak to what this means for the trajectory for next year as
well as what this potentially could mean for even '22?

William R. Thomas

Billy, do you want to address that?

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

Chief Operating Officer

Yes. Neal, this is Billy. So our 2021 maintenance capital, previously, in the previous quarter, we outlined
the same capital number for about 420,000 barrels a day, which was believed to be, at that time, what
our exit rate would be for 2020. And certainly bringing on a bunch of extra production this year, but also
incorporating the cost savings we're achieving this year, we believe we can do the same capital dollar
number, $3.4 billion, but maintain the exit rate we're seeing this year of 440,000 barrels a day, which is a
significant improvement again in our capital efficiency number. So we believe we can maintain that as we
go forward. That is not just meant to be a single snapshot.

I think one thing it doesn't bake into -- and to make sure everybody understands this, it's forecasted on
what we're achieving today. It doesn't bake in any improvements in well performance that we expect to
be able to continue to see as well as cost reductions. If things stay where they are and we're staying in
this environment, we're extremely confident we'll continue to see cost improvements that will drive our
maintenance capital number improvements in the future. So yes, I'm extremely confident we can have an
ongoing maintenance capital program in this same kind of area that we're talking about today.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc.

Very good. My second question, just around your technical innovations. Given the strength that I think you
all have really above anybody else on the upstream side, would this ever lead you to consider broadening
the business by considering any sort of clean tech or NGL-related investment?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Neal, yes, our focus on GHG reductions is -- and forming this sustainable power group within our company
is to really focus on technology, bringing technology forward more quickly inside the company, and it's
really another organic like we do everything else inside the company to really improve our emissions
but also make sure that we can do it at a very high rate of return. And so it's really to facilitate our
ongoing culture. We have tons of ideas that are coming from our divisions and our folks involved in the
field operations. And so we're really excited about the technology and the innovations that's coming
forward, and we're really excited about continuing to reduce our emissions. And certainly, any kind of
technology in this area, we believe, will not only benefit EOG, but it could benefit the industry. And so
we're open with that. It's not a proprietary thing. It's something we're doing to really continue to improve
our environment.

Operator

Our next question will come from Phillips Johnston with Capital One Securities.

John Phillips Little Johnston
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just a follow-up on Paul's question. EOG really stands out because unlike all your peers, you never cut
the dividend over the last 6 years. And you also resisted all the pressure to buy back your stock over the
last few years, while most of your competitors destroyed a lot of value doing that. The company that Paul
talked about has laid out plans to start paying variable dividends or special dividends on top of the regular
base dividend. I realize you guys want to continue to grow the base dividend at a healthy clip. But my
question is, is there any appetite at the Board level to supplement your regular dividend with a recurring
variable dividend? And if not, what kind of flaws do you see with that type of payout strategy that would
prevent you guys from going down that road?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Phillips, yes, your observation is right. We believe a sustainable growing dividend backed by an
impeccable balance sheet is certainly the best way to return cash to shareholders, and we're very
committed to that. And we don't want to take anything away from that. Having said that, we're certainly

13

open to consider other additional options. And so we certainly welcome any shareholder input on that, and
we remain open and flexible to do what's best for everybody.

John Phillips Little Johnston
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Are there any flaws or drawbacks that you kind of see with that type of variable dividend strategy?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think the biggest one is it's kind of unknown and inconsistent. And the feedback we've received
from many folks is they would rather us focus on a more consistent growing dividend. And certainly,
as you pointed out, we've never ever cut the dividend. And we want to make sure it's sustainable and
certainly backing it up with an impeccable balance sheet. And so the mix we've had over the last several
years, as we talked about, we believe, is a really good mix, and we believe that that will create a very,
very significant shareholder value going forward.

Operator

And our next question will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I hope everyone is doing well out there. Bill, I'm afraid I'm going to beef up on Paul's question a wee bit,
Paul Cheng's question. I'll just play a couple of things back to you, if I may. It's not that long ago that
EOG talked about 15% to 25% oil growth between $50 and $60 oil. And the $58 oil price you referred
to was subsidized by Saudi who ultimately sent a bunch of cargoes to the U.S., presumably to teach the
U.S. a lesson. So my question is, when you walked through all the things that you're laying out about
reinvestment rates and so on, the feedback from your peers is that their shareholders are telling them
they don't want as much oil growth. So I guess my question to you is what are your shareholders telling
you and asking you to do? And why is it not right to tap oil growth in a market that just doesn't need it?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Doug, I think as we stated in the opening remarks, fundamentally, we believe we've got a very, very
strong game plan. And we've got a tremendous track record to back that up, being the leader in return
on capital employed in the industry while generating very significant free cash flow and giving it back in
a very strong dividend increase and strengthening our balance sheet. And we believe that was the right
strategy before the downturn. It certainly has put the company in a tremendous position where we are
right now. And going forward, we believe that's the right strategy going forward: to continue to create
significant shareholder value going forward.

So we believe our game plan is really solid. Our growth has always been very disciplined. Again, we've
only allocated about 80% of our cash -- the CapEx. And so we've been able to grow the company at a
very disciplined pace. And as we go into 2021 and in the future, obviously, we need to keep our eye on
the macro view of oil. We need to be aware of the market conditions. We're not interested in growing oil
volumes at a strong pace in an oversupplied market. Certainly, that's not the right thing to do. But we
want to continue -- when the time is right, we want to continue to grow the company at a disciplined pace,
at a pace to where we can continue to improve our returns and improve our performance.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Bill, but as a footnote to the question, I think people would really appreciate your leadership as a company
here because you are one of the bigger companies, and capital discipline needs to be defined, and I
would urge you to try and do that. My follow-up is maybe an obtuse way of asking the same question.
You're running 10 or 11 rigs right now. You've got the potential clearly to run 3x that amount. So I guess

14

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

what I'm really trying to get at is, are you planning to retain the same operational capability? In other
words, the risk that you'd move back to that level or is -- like, some of the other companies, is there
an opportunity here to address the cost base of the company by rightsizing to perhaps a lower level of
activity? And I'll leave it there.

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Doug, the -- we are really committed to our employees. They are the ones that are making our
company better. They're the most valuable asset we have in the company. And so we have a lean, we run
lean. We actually peaked on employment about 4 or 5 years ago. Even though we've gotten a much bigger
company, our employee base has really not grown. And so they're very highly productive. They're highly
motivated. And they're certainly the part of the company that we want to keep intact and take care of and
encourage. So we believe we're at the right size to be effective, to be ready as the downturn is over. So
we're focused on continuing to maintain and to actually increase our culture, our ability as we go forward.
So we're very committed to keeping the company in great shape going forward.

And our next question will come from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Can you hear me?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Yes, sir. We can hear you.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I actually think -- your rig count today, I think, is around half a dozen rigs. Correct me if I'm wrong on
that number. Given the continued efficiency gains that you guys continue to achieve, what is the new level
of maintenance rig activity and frac activity?

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Billy, do you want to answer that one?

Lloyd W. Helms
Chief Operating Officer

Sure. Scott, this is Billy. So yes, you're right, we have actually 7 rigs, counting the 1 in offshore Trinidad,
so 6 domestically and 1 offshore. And our maintenance capital plan would require about 20 rigs and 10
frac fleets, and we're generally running, as I mentioned, 7 rigs and 5 or 6 frac fleets today. So we're well
under. And when we pulled back our activity, we dropped to a level well below our maintenance capital
level. And that's important to note. So the plan, certainly, going into the third and fourth quarter, is to be
looking at whether or not we want to add a rig or 2 going into the next year to get to that maintenance
level or not.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then you had mentioned also that you have -- most of your rigs and frac is under long-term
contracts. I imagine those were the ones you kept just given the cost of ending those contracts. Are these
generally multiyear contracts in support of new e-frac fleets? Or did the majority roll off over the next 12
months? I'm trying to ascertain when those savings manifest. I imagine the rigs and frac crews today,

15

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

given the deflation on other services, these rigs and frac crews may be pushing towards 40% or 50% of
your direct well cost. So just trying to get my head around when you could see those savings roll through.

Lloyd W. Helms
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. Sure, Scott. Yes, they are multiyear contracts. And I'd say there are various terms on the contracts.
But in general, they're starting to roll off in the next 12 to 18 months. I think the one thing that's
important to note is we build what we think are valuable relationships with our most trusted service
providers. And we work through this in partnership with them to make sure we retain not only the
performance and the high-performing equipment and personnel but the ability to ramp back up when we
need to. So it gives us a lot of flexibility as we work through this.

And I think certainly, we build a lot -- by building that relationship, it's a very trusted relationship we have,
it allows us to capture some cost savings, just being able to capture rates at below market rates in current
times, but also maintain the high-performing levels of activity that we need to sustain our business. So
we're very proud of our relationships we have with them. But they typically roll off in the next 12 or 18
months. And we'll kind of reassess where we need to be working with those trusted partners.

Our next question will come from Juan Jarrah with TD Securities.

Juan Jarrah
TD Securities Equity Research

Congrats on the exploration success in Trinidad. I did want to follow up a bit on your onshore exploration
efforts. And I know this is easier said than done, but can you comment on any other exploration efforts
you'd consider pursuing outside of the Lower 48? And with that, Canada comes to mind. And as you know,
one of your peers recently announced adding a position to their Montney in Canada. So just curious on
that, and I'll stop there.

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Ezra?

Ezra Y. Yacob
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Thanks, Juan. This is Ezra. As you know, we've got -- you mentioned our Trinidad exploration effort, and
then our domestic exploration effort. And so when we think about anything else outside of the Lower 48,
it really comes down to how competitive can it be with our preexisting domestic portfolio. And that's the
main driver on it. When we talk about any of our new exploration ideas, whether it's Trinidad or the new
domestic portfolio, we're exploring for prospects and rock quality that will be additive to the front end of
our preexisting inventory. At 10,500 premium locations, I'm not sure if we necessarily just need more to
continue to backfill that deep inventory. What we're really trying to do is add to the front end of it. And
that's what the exploration effort is focused on.

The next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

You mentioned in the 10-Q that you expect to replace the $750 million of debt coming due next year with
other long-term debt. And I thought that was interesting because you've been talking a while, I think,
about paying down debt and having the cash on the balance sheet to do so. And so I wondered if you
could add a bit more color on, a, how you're thinking about the right level of free cash flow to pursue; and
then, if not allocated to paying down debt, where you see the best areas of allocation between incremental

drilling, returning it to shareholders or keeping a high amount of cash on the balance sheet or deploying it
elsewhere, like M&A.

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Tim?

Timothy K. Driggers
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the reason we chose to keep the debt and long-term debt at June 30 was just the uncertainty of
the market going forward between now and February when our next debt is due. Certainly, the goal has
not changed, and that goal is to pay down debt. So if market conditions play out as such that we have the
cash -- sufficient cash, then we will pay down that debt. But to be conservative, we left it in long-term just
because of the uncertainty in the market. And I guess Bill will address the capital allocation portion of your
question.

William R. Thomas
Chairman & CEO

Yes, the right level of free cash flow, Brian, is really a function of -- it's obviously variable every year,
number one, based on the oil price. We -- normally, we have and we will continue to kind of use a
conservative view, our macro conservative view, of what oil prices will be that year. And then we certainly
have a goal every year to generate significant amount of free cash flow. As an example, the last 3 years,
we've generated about $1.5 billion a year, on average, free cash flow. And we want to use that to continue
to, as Tim said, consider paying our debt down. Our goal is to continue to pay our debt down more and
certainly continue to work on our dividend when the environment is healthy. And then after that, we will
allocate the capital, continue to allocate it at a very disciplined level just like we have in the past.

And discipline means that we're not going to allocate the capital at a speed that's too fast to where we
cannot learn and grow and get better. We want to always be increasing our capital efficiency, lowering
our funding costs, continuing to lower our operating costs and those kind of things. And so you have to
go at the proper speed to do that every year, and that's really the governor on allocating the capital. And
whatever free cash flow is left over after all those things are done, obviously, that will be variable year-by-
year according to the commodity prices. We will continue to be committed to using that capital to continue
to create shareholder value and making sure we get the highest return possible avenue on using that
cash.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up goes back to the exploration program. I think Ezra, you mentioned a couple
of comments I thought was interesting. One was that the exploration you're pursuing is even better than
what you have and then that it's in basins outside the current operating area and largely not on federal
land. And I wondered if you could add a bit more color on what type of impact the onshore exploration
you're pursuing could have on your potential production or capital investment 1 or 2 years out, how
-- what the proximity is to being able to really move these plays into development and have a level of
materiality on your production and then whether there are aboveground issues that need to be worked out
with the areas from a midstream or other perspective.

Ezra Y. Yacob
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Yes, Brian. This is Ezra. Let me try to unpack that one by one here. First, I'd say our -- as we've talked
about in the past, our domestic exploration effort, these aren't really in frontier or wildcat basins. These
are in basins where there is established legacy oil and gas production. And so if these prospects work
out, the way that we think they will, and they're additive to the front-end quality of our inventory, we
should be able to move them into an active development basis pretty quickly, obviously, pending results.

17

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

The second part of that, going back to just the quality of what we're looking for, this is -- it's a better
rock quality, as we've talked about before. A lot of what we're looking at is tied to what we think we can
develop with our horizontal completions technology. And what I mean by that is just exactly how does the
rock, how is it going to respond, how is it going to actually be stimulated and fracture in combination with
our stimulation designs.

And so those are the 2 things we think are really -- we're focused on. It is definitely not traditional,
unconventional types of rocks that have been focused on in the past. And so as we continue to kind of
push these prospects forward and get data on them, we will update you guys with our results on the
testing. But we're feeling very confident, everything that we're seeing to date, that they are going to
continue to be, as I said earlier, additive to the front end of our -- of what really is a pretty deep inventory
to begin with.
