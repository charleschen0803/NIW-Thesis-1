Question and Answer

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I don't know if you can hear me because the voice is breaking up pretty bad on my phone. I think 2
questions. One, can you tell us what's the mechanism of the $1.5 billion debt reduction since that you
have no maturity? Is it going to be a tender or that you're just going to buy from the public market? And
secondly that on the special dividend and why we are not using that money for buyback given how cheap
is the valuation the stock is currently in?

Jeffrey L. Ritenour
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, this is Jeff. So as it relates to the debt repurchase, the $1.5 billion that we've highlighted, our
expectation is to do probably a mix between open market and tender. That's going to be dependent upon
market conditions. So we're going to evaluate the maturities across the curve and where the best value
sits. And then we'll enact that as we work our way through the rest of this year and likely into next year
as well. So it's likely going to be a mixed bag. We certainly want to see interest reduction -- excuse me,
interest costs come down as we've highlighted as our new annual run rate, but we also are going to have
a focus on reducing absolute leverage. So it's going to be a balance between the 2.

As it relates to the special dividend, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which you all probably could
not hear, the feedback from our investors has been incredibly clear. They're looking for a continuation of
cash dividends from the space and specifically from Devon. And so we think with the work that we've done
around our cost structure, lowering our breakeven, we're uniquely positioned within the sector to provide
those cash returns to shareholders. So it's really consistent with what we're hearing from our largest
shareholders. And we're excited to move forward with not only our quarterly dividend but the potential for
variable dividends as we move through the next couple of years and evaluate market conditions.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Jeff, can I just follow up that on the debt reduction? Do you have a time line when you think you will
complete it?

Jeffrey L. Ritenour
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We're certainly going to look to do some of that here over the next several months, again, as
market conditions allow. And then likely, some of that will move our way into 2021 as well. So again, it's
going to be a function of the market conditions and what we see with how the debt's trading. We're also
comfortable holding the cash on the balance sheet to the extent that the value proposition isn't there. But
the key point we want to make is that, that cash is earmarked for debt repayment. So we are absolutely
expecting to continue to lower our absolute leverage over time.

Operator

Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on the $150 million reduction in sustaining CapEx, from
$1.1 billion to $950 million. Just help us think about the broad buckets that drove that pretty material
decline there.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

Arun, this is Dave. I think David Harris is going to have some good information around that.

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Arun, this is David. Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes. As you've noted, we've driven that 2021
maintenance capital level down about $150 million from our prior disclosure to a level that we think we
can carry out in 2021 of about $950 million. In broad buckets, I would tell you that's equally split between
capital efficiencies we're seeing particularly in the Wolfcamp as well as the impact of lower decline rates.
I'd note that a lot of the production outperformance we saw this year has come from the good focus we've
had on our base production levels, and we continue to outperform from a base perspective. So those lower
decline rates certainly give us a boost as we think about the maintenance capital we need to drive the
business forward. And then the other half would be service cost savings that we believe we have line of
sight to here just given the environment we're in.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Got it. How much would you view that as, call it, sustainable in the future or more permanent,
David?

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Well, it's a good question. I would tell you, as I've told you in the past, I mean we always look to try to
make all of this as sustainable and as permanent as we can. Certainly, here in this part of the cycle from
supply/cost perspective, we've seen some pretty material reductions. We believe we can capture that. We
haven't baked a lot of that, that we don't have line of sight to and going forward. So I think it's consistent
with what we think we're going to see here over the next 12 to 18 months.

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Arun, I might just add that we've even seen some service cost reductions beyond what we've built into
this at this point. So we're not building all of the leading-edge cost reductions that we have into this $950
million.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Great. I guess my follow-up was just on -- I appreciate the disclosure around your federal permit
backlog in both the Delaware and the PRB. My understanding is that the permits are valid for 2 years, and
you can get up to a 2-year extension on those. How, call it, automatic are the -- is that extension process?

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Arun, you're correct that our federal permits have a 2-year initial term and then they're eligible for a 2-
year extension period. Typically, it's a routine part of our business. We file for those extensions, say, 3
months out from when those permits will expire. Typically, it's a very quick approval process. We've never
been declined an extension. And importantly, the environmental assessments that underlie those permits
are good for a period of 5 years.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Great. And so you're saying today that under a sustaining CapEx mode, that 75% of your
contemplated activity over the next 4 years would be kind of with permits in hand? Is that the correct
understanding?

Your next question comes from Douglas Leggate with Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I don't know what magic wand you swung there, but it seems the audio is now fine. So thank you for
getting that sorted out. Hopefully, you can hear me okay.

Dave, you and I have gone backwards and forwards on this model for some time. I just want to commend
you guys for introducing what I think is a really differentiated model. And I'll be curious to see how this is
received by the market. My question, however, is I wonder if you or Jeff could explain the mechanism by
how you intend to share, I'll use your words from the last call, windfall cash flows with investors.

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think -- thanks, Doug. And we're very proud of the model, and we think it is the right business
model. And certainly, we feel like we have moved this model quickly and probably as quick as anybody in
the industry. And hopefully, others continue to follow it up with actions as we have already started to do
here.

I think the first thing to keep in mind is that our breakeven is now -- that funds our maintenance capital
is around $35 WTI. And then -- and we actually then funded the dividend, the normal dividend plus our
maintenance capital around $39 WTI. So where you start really getting into the issue is when you start
to balance our growth opportunities beyond -- if we're in an environment above $39 WTI, how do you
balance that with the return of free cash flow to shareholders. And certainly, we're going to look at the
economic climate that we're in at the time to make that call whether we would undertake select growth
opportunities or whether we think it's better to return that cash to shareholders as we move above that.

As we sit here today, we're obviously still in the middle of a global pandemic. And so even though the
strip is sitting there at currently somewhere right around $45 today, the way I would describe it is there's
a big error bar on that strip. There's a lot of uncertainty associated with that strip at this point and
how sustainable that is. So we are not, at this point, prepared to say, "Okay. It's $45 strip." Now we're
going to start going more into growth mode. Our thought process is more we're going to stay closer to
maintenance capital or at maintenance capital and return those incremental dollars to shareholders.

Now there may be an environment in the future where we don't feel as much risk as there is on oil pricing
right now given the global pandemic that we're still under. So there may be at some point where we
do start to -- as we get above $40 and towards $45 where we say we're going to mix it a little bit of
growth and with the return to value to shareholders. But we're going to take into account all the economic
conditions at the time on how to best make that judgment.

So it's not going to be an absolute formula. I think if you -- inevitably, I think whenever you try to live
by an absolute formula, you will find that the formula doesn't work as well as you wish it had. And so
it's going to involve some level of business judgment, where our business judgment is right now that we
feel it's more appropriate to fund at maintenance capital level and return at incremental dollars to the
shareholder. But that could change at some point in the future.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I appreciate the answer, David. If I may offer a comment, I think there is a subtle difference in perception
between a special dividend and a variable dividend. So presumably, you're talking about a variable
dividend.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Yes. We are talking about a variable dividend. And yes, I think we see there's a subtle difference, too,
in that a special is one -- it's really special when you actually do it. And so that's why we call it special,
and we've done it.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. So my follow-up is hopefully...

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

I'm being a little funny there for you.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. Capital allocation, Dave, if you're slowing down the growth rate up to 5%, how does that change your
capital allocation across the portfolio? And I guess it's really a question about high-grading inventory. I'm
just wondering if the incremental drilling activity sees another upward reset in productivity and capital
efficiency because you're obviously slowing down the activity level as well. I'll leave it there.

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think you can look for us to continue to drive more capital efficiency into the business in general.
You're seeing how we're continuing to drive down the drilling and completion costs and improve the capital
efficiency in the Delaware Basin. You can -- if you look at the stack play, we've done a couple of things
there where we have really redesigned our wells. And when we go back out there, that we feel that we're
going to be drilling and completing those wells for significantly less than when the last time we were
out there. In addition, we did the transaction with Dow where we brought in promoted capital, where
essentially we'll be paying 1/3 of our costs in a given well for 50% of our working interest. So that is
certainly going to drive capital efficiency.

Eagle Ford, we work very closely with BP to drive the efficiency there and really the economics on the
remaining development inventory as well as the redevelopment opportunities we're seeing are very capital
efficient.

And finally, we're learning an awful lot about the Powder River Basin particularly in the Niobrara. And we
have really just been in appraisal mode up there so far. So as we go into full development in the Powder
River Basin, you will see those well costs potentially move down dramatically as well. So absolutely, we'll
be -- in a sense, we'll be high grading by drilling the best opportunities, but all of these opportunities are
going to continue to improve because of the measures that we have been executing on internally.

Your next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Dave, you guys talked a lot about these cash dividends. I mean my question is around sort of the debt
and production growth levels. So I just want to make sure to clear. Is there a certain level you want
to get debt down to and sort of a certain minimum level of production growth you'd like before sort of
considering these more frequent variable dividends? Or how should we think about that?

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

Well, I tried to say -- first, on the debt, I mean our target in mid-cycle pricing is get the debt to EBITDAR
down around 1.0 or less. Now we're not quite there yet, and we're probably going to need a little bit
better pricing to do it.

On the variable dividend, so I tried to lay out that it's going to depend somewhat on our perception of
the economic outlook as to how much we want and our confidence in forward pricing as to how much
we would just return cash to shareholders versus invest in a limited amount of growth opportunities up
to 5%. So -- and I tried to highlight that we're going to assess that at the time. Right now, we're not
particularly confident in the economic outlook on prices. It may prove better, but we're still in the middle
of a pandemic. So there's a lot of uncertainty around it. So we'd be leaning more towards the cash return
side of it right now.

Jeffrey L. Ritenour
Executive VP & CFO

Neal, this is Jeff. But just one thing I would add is a distinction for Devon versus some of our peers is we
have the cash on hand to accomplish our debt objectives, our target debt levels. So any free cash flow
that we generate can then go back to shareholders, as Dave articulated. A lot of other folks in the sector
are going to have to generate free cash flow and then try to accomplish their lower leverage objectives.
But we're in a unique position with the cash that we have on hand. We can take care of that and then
generate free cash flow with the lower breakevens that we've created and return that to shareholders.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great clarification. The cash is certainly obvious for you all. It gives you a lot of options. And then just one
follow-up. On -- Dave, you mentioned with the strip, it doesn't cause you to think about boosting activity
and sort of with this whole ties in with this plan you've been talking about. But I'm just thinking when --
if the strip does get up to a certain point where you have more confidence behind that, would the focus
essentially still initially just be Delaware? Or would you continue -- would you start looking more at the
Eagle Ford, Powder, Anadarko, et cetera?

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Neal, this is David Harris. I think as we move into 2021, I think you'll continue to see us have a capital
program with a pretty heavy Delaware emphasis. But I do think you'll see us bring back some activity
across all 3 of those areas and take advantage of the diversity in the portfolio and, as Dave alluded to, the
high quality opportunity set we have across those areas as well.

Your next question comes from Jeanine Wai.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I hope you can hear me.

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We hear you fine. Hope you can hear us now.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. We got you. So I guess my first question is on the reinvestment framework. And apologies if
you addressed this in your prepared remarks. But the 70% to 80% target for CapEx to cash flow, you
mentioned this is at a mid-cycle price. What mid-cycle price are you using? And could you provide any

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

color on the price band or the sensitivities that you looked at around various reinvestment and payout
ratios?

Jeffrey L. Ritenour
Executive VP & CFO

Jeanine, this is Jeff. Yes. So when we talk about mid-cycle pricing, we generally talk about $50 oil. So
that reinvestment ratio that we talk about, the 70% to 80%, it obviously really kicks in when you get
to those sorts of levels. Prior to that, again, as Dave has articulated, we're going to be focused on the
maintenance capital and generating free cash flow and returning that to shareholders. But once you get
to those higher levels of WTI pricing, given our low breakevens, we do think that it makes sense to limit
our reinvestment to that 70% to 80% kind of level. And effectively, we can accomplish all of our objectives
of the 5% growth, our quarterly dividend and generating free cash flow when you get to that kind of mid-
cycle type pricing.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. My follow-up is just moving to the Delaware and well productivity. Maybe following up on
Arun's question on the federal. In maintenance mode, it looks like you've mitigated a significant amount of
risk in the Delaware through a lot of good forward permitting. But can you talk about in terms of the well
productivity? How does this vary between your federal and nonfederal acreage?

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Jeanine, it's David. As we've said before, although about 55% of our acreage in the Delaware is federal,
certainly, as you think about the core of Lea and Eddy County, that's where some of our highest return
opportunities are. And so that's why we wanted to highlight, from a permitting standpoint, of those 400-
or-so permits that we expect to have by the fall in the Delaware, about half of those include our drilling
program for the next 2 years. So they're specific to those programs and what we would expect to see. And
so I would expect that you'll continue to see us lean on that permit inventory, drill those wells and then
supplement it with state wells where we can and need to.

Your next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH.

Matthew Merrel Portillo
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

Two asset-specific questions. Just curious as you look out into 2021. With the improvement in the gas
forward curve, curious how you're thinking about capital allocation to the stack, specifically with the carry
that you have with the Dow JV.

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Matt, it's David. We were scheduled to begin that activity this year. Obviously, with what we've seen from
a pandemic and a commodity price standpoint, we've deferred that activity. We're currently working with
our partner and would contemplate restarting that activity in 2021. I think that our best guess based on
those discussions and sort of how we would see that plan laying out is probably something like a 2-rig
program in 2021 potentially to prosecute the initial stages of the Dow partnership.

Matthew Merrel Portillo
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

Perfect. And then just a follow-up question. Your partner in the Eagle Ford laid out a pretty significant
strategy shift over the next 10 years. And I was just curious how you guys are thinking about capital
allocation to the Eagle Ford with that as the backdrop.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Well, we work very closely with BP on the capital allocation there. And so far, we've remained aligned. I
will say I think probably better to hear this from BP, but I think, overall, they're extremely happy with that
asset and feel that's one of the best assets they've picked up and, if not the best, they picked up in the
BHP transaction. So I would think that even though they're having a strategy shift, I would suspect that
this is one that's going to continue to be highlighted within their portfolio. So far, we have not seen any
significant alignment issues with them around that. Obviously, if there's some point they don't consider
that asset to be very valuable in their portfolio, we'd love to talk to them about that as well. But right now,
I can tell you we remain very aligned.

Operator

Your next question comes from Scott Hanold.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Question on the 2021 plan in the DUCs. And so how should we think about that? I mean do you all expect
to work through the DUCs in 2021? Or what are those decision points?

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're still finalizing our 2021 capital allocation. So it'd be a little premature to say how much. I do
know that we'd have 22 DUCs down in the Eagle Ford that we've -- that have been there that we docked
in the second quarter. And so those are definitely going to be drawn down in early '21, which will give us a
really good start to 2021 production.

I think beyond that, the level at which we may consider drawing down that inventory, we're going to have
to -- we're working on that right now and deciding whether -- how much we may consider doing that. For
the most part, I think you would consider that to just be normal working level of DUCs that you would --
always going to have some inventory, but there probably are a few that we could draw down if it seems
appropriate.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Right. Right. So just to clarify. Of the I think it was roughly 100 DUCs, some of that, you would include
normal work-in inventory. Is that right?

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

That's right. That's right.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. Yes. Okay. Fair enough. And then with regards to the special dividend -- and correct me if I'm wrong.
The way you guys laid it out, it doesn't sound like it's going to be highly consistent going forward once
you start to initiate it and that it could be off and on, I guess, depending on your view of the commodity
and the macro and some other things. Is that a fair statement? Or are you guys designing this to be
something shareholders can understand we're going to get something this quarter, we don't know what it
is, but you're going to have some sort of a plan for that?

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2020

Well, make no mistake that we are very dedicated to the cash return model to shareholders. And I feel
that, frankly, we're the first ones to actually take action with a special or variable dividend. There are
probably a couple of different cases where you can do this. And we use the words synonymously, frankly.
One is in this case, where we have some extra cash we're anticipating because of the Barnett sale. The
other is, I believe probably Pioneer talked about this morning, and certainly, we're going to be doing the
same thing, is as we generate excess cash flow from our ongoing business, that we will be returning that
to shareholders as well.

Now are we going to be absolutely formulaic around that approach and say we're going to do so much
every quarter? No. We're not saying that. But when we are confident that we've generated excess cash
flow in the right business environment beyond what we need as a company, and again, we're limiting our
growth to 5%, then you can look for us to return that cash to our shareholders. We're just not being so
specific as to say exactly how it might be. Now Jeff I know may have a few additional comments on some
thoughts that he's had around this as well.

Jeffrey L. Ritenour
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Scott. No, I think Dave said it well. The one thing I would add is obviously our quarterly -- our
traditional quarterly dividend is going to return cash to shareholders throughout the year. And then as
Dave articulated, depending on market conditions, we'll evaluate what makes sense at the time as it
relates to the variable dividend. But our expectation is, again, I would just point you to our breakeven
levels, and you all can use whatever price deck you prefer. But as we've articulated, with the breakeven
that we have in our maintenance capital level, we should be generating free cash flow into the foreseeable
future. And our game plan is to return that to shareholders via the dividend, both dividends, the quarterly
traditional dividend and the special.

As it relates to timing, obviously, we'll debate that with our Board. Our Board meets multiple times
throughout the year, at least quarterly, and evaluate what makes sense based on the market conditions
and the other objectives we're trying to achieve at the time.

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

And we -- you might look at Slide 13 in our operations report, too, that also shows what amounts of free
cash flow we could yield at maintenance capital at various WTI prices. So just as Jeff said, we anticipate
that there is going to be significant free cash flow and that we would look to return that to shareholders.

Operator

Your next question comes from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo.

Nitin Kumar
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess a lot of ground has been covered on this cash return side. You did mention in your slides that the
buyback is still a component of -- the share buyback is a component of your cash return. Can you help us
understand the prioritization of how you are looking at the different avenues for shareholder return?

Jeffrey L. Ritenour
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Nitin, this is Jeff. You're right. Certainly, in the past, we've utilized the share buyback approach as
a way to return cash to shareholders as well. As I said, and I appreciate you didn't hear them given our
audio difficulties, but in our prepared remarks, the feedback that we've got from shareholders has been
pretty loud and clear and consistent around cash returns and cash dividends. And so going forward, our
absolute expectation is to return the cash versus -- excuse me, to return cash via the dividend versus the
stock buyback.

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then this is going to be for you as well, Jeff. But on Slide 12, you've talked
about the financing cost reductions of $75 million, but you also mentioned about $125 million in
reductions from LOE and GP&T. Granted there may be many moving parts here, but just could you help
us understand what are the targets? And how are you improving your LOE? And then particularly, I'm
interested in how you're improving your GP&T going forward.

Jeffrey L. Ritenour
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So -- and I'm happy to answer that. The $125 million of LOE and GP&T cost reduction that we
highlighted, about $65 million of that is an MVC that we have in Oklahoma and our stack asset...

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Volume commitment.

Jeffrey L. Ritenour
Executive VP & CFO

Sorry, minimum volume commitment that we have in Oklahoma is rolling off in 2021. So that's about half
of that $125 million. And then beyond that, frankly, we're seeing lower costs in all of our categories. David
mentioned some of this earlier. He can add more detail. But whether it be chemicals, compression, our
teams have done a great job of -- as we've changed our level of activity and our cadence of work to really
work hard to lower the cost. Some of that, of course, is the benefit of the deflation that we've seen here
lately. But what we're really seeing from the teams is an ability to lock some of that in and, again, we
believe keep those lower cost sustainable into the future. I'll let David add any color that he may have.

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Yes. Jeff, I think you covered it well. I think what I would tell you is from an operating perspective on the
LOE side, we always start with trying to reduce downtime as best we can. We've got our decision support
centers that feed us data on our operations on a real-time basis. And so not only are we able to respond
more quickly to downtime events, in many cases, we're able to predict them and get in front of them. And
so that's keeping our operations up and running, as always, the first order of business. It varies a little
bit by area how we attack the line items just given the nature of the different assets, but Jeff, I think,
covered it well. Certainly, compression costs, chemical costs across both the Anadarko and the Eagle Ford
are things that we're focused on pretty heavily and the Rockies.

We're doing -- we're piloting some additional technology opportunities to automate the way we work.
So far, those have allowed us to cut our downtime in half year-over-year while improving those costs
and our environmental performance. And so there, we believe we've got a stretched target there to get
our recurring LOE in the Rockies down from something on the order of $6.50 down to the mid-4s. So we
believe there's a step change there that we can continue to get. And then in the Delaware, obviously,
those types of things as well, but we've got a lot of important infrastructure there from both a water
standpoint and otherwise that we're leveraging to manage our costs and keep those down.

Your next question comes from Brian Singer.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Wanted to follow up on that growth outlook, and it's really just to ask if there were an above mid-cycle
scenario, i.e., price is above $50, is the 5% still the max growth outlook? So at any price, 5% would be
the max you would consider. And then as you think today...

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then I guess as you think about the impact of having a growth rate that's maybe a little slower
than it was at some time, does that impact or maybe even limit the consideration that Devon would have
to either participate in or be a part of M&A and consolidation?

David A. Hager
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'd say M&A, consolidation is something that we obviously recognize there can be benefits out there.
There's too much overhead sitting in the entire E&P system. And to the extent at which there can be some
consolidation and eliminate some of that overhead and also, in many cases, capture operational synergies
that may exist between various companies, there could be some benefit there. So I don't really see that
the limitation of the growth rate has a significant impact one way or the other. I think, frankly, many of the
companies are pivoting to the same model that we are. I think we're just a little more advanced with the
implementation of this model than they are. So I think it's -- I think this is a strategy that can make sense
with acquisitions if there could be something that would be appropriate.

And just on the -- I gave the very quick answer, one-word answer of yes on limited to 5% growth rate.
That is absolutely the answer. Now the rationale behind that, I think, we all understand is that why does
it -- it just doesn't make any sense for our industry to grow at a much higher rate than the demand for
the product is. And we count on OPEC to cut supplies to bail us out on prices. And so I think hopefully,
everyone is learning their lesson on that. And I think -- and frankly, I think the industry is learning their
lesson on that. So that's why it's just so straightforward for us to answer it the way I did.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Fair enough. And then my follow-up is with regards to base decline rates. Assuming you're at that 5% or
lower growth level, how do you see the evolution of your corporate base decline rate? And can you talk
about where you've been most effective in managing that base decline here more recently?

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Brian, it's David. As we've talked about previously, as we came into 2020, our decline rate was probably in
the high-30s percent on oil and the low 30% on a BOE basis. I think as we roll forward a year, we would
expect that, that oil decline rate moves to the low 30s and on a BOE basis into the mid-20s or so.

And then really, I would say from a base production standpoint, it's become a big emphasis for us across
all of our asset areas. I think all of our teams have done an excellent job arresting base declines and
accretively deploying workover capital and some creative solutions to try to shallow these decline rates out
as much as we can. And certainly, as we move into this cash return model with a more moderate growth
rate, that's an extremely important part of the business that maybe people took for granted in times past,
but I can tell you, our team certainly don't.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brian Downey with Citigroup.

Brian Kevin Downey
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

From the prepared remarks on Slide 9, you're understandably still restricting flowback on newer wells
due to market conditions. I'm curious if that experience has changed how you're thinking about early

time initial flowback or pressure management on a go-forward basis, if there are any surprise learnings
throughout that whole process during the quarter.

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Brian, it's David. It's good to talk to you again. No, I wouldn't say that there's been any surprises or any
differences in terms of how we would approach that. Certainly, as we think about flowback strategy, that's
an important part of how we develop our asset. And so from time to time, we do experiment with that a
bit. Certainly, as we're doing some appraisal work, we'll have projects where we're restricting flowback for
interference testing and the like but no big or shattering changes or revelations that you should expect in
terms of how we conduct the business.

Brian Kevin Downey
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. So sort of back to normal in the second half of the year, we should anticipate on the completions
there?

David Gerard Harris
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Yes. I think that's right.

Scott Coody
Vice President of Investor Relations

All right. It looks like we're at the top of the hour. And I think we've got through all the questions. We
appreciate everyone's interest in Devon today. And once again, given some of the audio issues we've had,
we'll send out the prepared remarks to our audience. And then we'll also post them on the website for
everyone's convenience for viewing. If you have any other further questions as well, please don't hesitate
to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any time.

Thank you, and have a good day.
