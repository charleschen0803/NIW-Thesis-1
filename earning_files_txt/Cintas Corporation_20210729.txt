Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas First Quarter FY '21 (sic) [ FY '22 ] Earnings Release
Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thanks, Shelby. Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our first
quarter results for fiscal 2022. After our commentary, we'll open the call to questions for analysts.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-
looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's
current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject
to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.
I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.

I'll now turn the call over to Todd.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2022. First quarter total revenue grew 8.6% and
diluted earnings per share or EPS grew 11.9%. Every business, whether goods-producing or services-
providing, has a need for image, safety, friendliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas
can fulfill to help get them Ready for the Workday. Our financial results are indicative of our strong value
proposition and vast total addressable market.

Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.51 billion, compared to $1.39
billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.2%. We expected solid growth over the year prior period in
which the economy was in a weakened state. But we also made solid progress on a sequential basis and in
total, revenue grew stronger than anticipated. We continue to make measured investments to support our
growth.

The labor market remains challenging. U.S. still hasn't recovered 5.3 million pre-pandemic jobs. This
represents an opportunity for us. Most of our customers are open. However, most are not operating at the
same capacity and employment levels as pre-COVID. We are seeing inflationary signs, including higher
cost of freight, energy, wages and supplies. We continue to take actions to minimize the impacts. These
include reviewing and challenging our processes and procedures, reduce efficiencies and reduce costs and
thoughtfully implementing increases to the pricing of certain products and services in response to higher
operational costs.

Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for first quarter was $199.1 million
compared to $204.5 million last year. First quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison.
In last year's first quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment, or
PPE, sales were surging, propelling the business to grow organic revenue over 17%. At that time, PPE
comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. As discussed on previous
earnings calls, the amount of PPE has declined as COVID case counts have fallen from peak levels.
However, PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix that was pre-COVID.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

Over the same period of time, the recurring First Aid cabinet service business revenue has increased.
We welcome this shift in mix because first aid cabinet service business is historically higher profit margin
business and more consistent.

Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All
Other revenue was $189.7 million compared to $147.7 million last year. The fire business organic revenue
growth rate was 17.8%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 68%. Both businesses
benefited in part from the increased activity in a period of reduced COVID case counts.

Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remains strong. Recently, on September
15, we paid shareholders $98.8 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock
paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue
to allocate capital to improve shareholder return.

I'm proud of the execution of our employees, whom we call partners. They continue to navigate an
unsettled environment by focusing on our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, of course,
fueled recently by the surge of the Delta variant. We remain well positioned headed into the fall and winter
months to provide potentially life-saving items, such as face masks and gloves; to provide hygienically
clean garments, such as health care scrubs and isolation gowns; and conduct services, including hand
sanitizer dispensing and sanitizing spray services.

Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight a recent announcement of our ambition to
achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model.
Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. We view our
ambition to achieve this objective as a natural extension. Also, as part of our steadfast commitment to
corporate responsibility, we will soon issue a more robust environmental, social and governance report. We
are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and maintaining accountability.

I will now turn the call over to Mike.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 first quarter revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $1.75
billion in last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures
and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.6%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '22
was $902.8 million compared to $826.2 million in last year's first quarter. Gross margin as a percentage
of revenue increased 30 basis points to 47.6% for the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 47.3% in the
first quarter of fiscal '21. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility
Services; 44.8% for First Aid and Safety Services; 46.1% for Fire Protection Services; and 41.5% for
Uniform Direct Sale.

Selling and administrative expenses of $508.7 million increased 6.7% compared to last year's first quarter.
This increase reflects investments in our sales teams as well as slight incremental travel and meeting
expenses, somewhat offset by the sale of assets within our Uniform Direct Sale business.

Operating income of $394.1 million increased 12.7%. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to
20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21.

Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was 11% compared to
7.8% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the
amount of stock compensation expense.

Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $331.2 million, an increase of
10.4%. Diluted EPS was $3.11, an increase of 11.9% from last year's first quarter.

We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a
range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion, to a range of $7.58 billion to $7.67 billion. And diluted EPS from a
range of $10.35 to $10.75, to a range of $10.60 to $10.90.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

Please note the following regarding our guidance: fiscal '22 -- our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected
to be approximately 19.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate
negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.77 and diluted EPS growth by about 760
basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. Guidance
assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by the surging COVID-19 Delta variant. However, guidance
does not contemplate significant pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders and other
restrictions commonly referred to as lockdowns.

Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note the following regarding
last fiscal year's financial results: in last fiscal year's second quarter, certain Uniform Rental and Facility
Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and
administrative expenses and impacted second quarter operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax
gain and the related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. And in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were
able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with large supplies of
personal protective equipment. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in
any other.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Can you talk about the primary factors that led you to raise revenue guidance this quarter? Was it
primarily related to the better-than-expected result that you generated here in the first quarter? Or is it
more related to your outlook for the remaining 3 quarters of this fiscal year?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Tim, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Well, certainly, our performance in Q1 exceeded our
expectations, but we like the momentum that we see in our business. Our -- we like the new business that
is a driver of growth for us. And we're providing more products and services to our customers, so to those
who are open and hopefully, they'll be back to full strength here very shortly. But in general, yes, we like
the momentum that we see in our businesses.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. I was wondering if you could also maybe talk about growth by vertical a little bit more this quarter. I
know hospitality was showing a strong recovery last quarter. Did that vertical stall out a little bit as COVID
cases ramped up here in August and September? And are there any other end markets that you call out
here as being somewhat stronger or weaker than you had expected?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Well, great question, Tim. Certainly, the hospitality business is -- well, so far down, hospitality was -- that
it's coming back and it's coming back nicely. I wouldn't use the word stall it out by any stretch. Certainly,
there is a bit of a tail to that. So orders aren't received and shipped in real time, meaning that they make
those decisions about staffing. There's a process, they place the orders, we ship them, et cetera. So
there's a little bit of a tail there.

But we still like what we see in the hospitality business. Certainly, they are anxious about business travel
coming back, convention travel specifically, but the -- in general, the hospitality business is doing so much
better. And -- but they're a little bit anxious, right, about how things will be impacted because of the
variant, but also when will business travel come back.

As far as the other areas, health care continues to do well for us. We've talked about those offerings that
we have, and they really resonate with those folks. So whether it's helping them clean their facilities,
helping with isolation gowns, scrubs, et cetera, all that is very attractive for folks.

And I'd just like to take a moment to talk about what we compete with in those markets, in many cases,
is disposables. And with the focus on ESG, that value proposition of providing an item that is essentially
relaundered and recycled is very attractive, separate from the economics of it. It's very attractive for the
health care institutions and many institutions to say, "Well, you can provide me a product that doesn't just
go to landfill after a use." So again, that value proposition is very much resonating.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Andy Wittmann with R.W. Baird.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. I don't usually ask about the Direct Sales segment, but I'm going to this quarter. The segment
margins in All Other came out very strong. We haven't seen them this strong in a while, obviously, plus
68%. It's a big number, but we all know that the compare was fairly easy.

Todd, could you just talk a little bit about what drove the margin leverage? Was there an unusually large
order that came back with somebody kind of redressing folks? Or maybe just a little bit of color what -- as
to what drove the great profit margins in the All Other reportable segment.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Well, Andy, first off, thanks for your question. Our partners in that area of the business really appreciate
you calling it out and citing that their performance is really, really good. You're right. The comps are
-- were more than reasonable because of what happened to the hospitality business, in particular, last
summer. But our revenue is coming back very nicely there, hence, the revenue growth. But -- and we're
getting leverage over the organization staffing levels that we have in place. And Mike cited that we had a
sale of an asset that occurred in that area.

So -- but in total, if you put it all together, we see -- you shouldn't anticipate that level of increase in the
future. But nevertheless, we like the leverage we have there. And we think we're well positioned. Our
organization is -- was, as you can imagine, right-sized as a result of what occurred last summer. And we
think we're in a really good spot and -- to capture opportunities in the marketplace and gain leverage on
our investment.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Well, the other half or part of that All Other segment is the fire business, which also had a great first
quarter. And so we're very pleased with that business and the momentum in that business as well. We
saw some nice sequential improvement in the gross margin of the fire business. And at organic growth of
17.8%, we're thrilled with the performance that we've seen.

Andrew John Wittmann
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Okay. And then I guess, just for my follow-up question, I wanted to just get a little bit more specific
on the labor market, both as it relates to your own business, your ability to hire and compensate people
as well as the impact on your customers. I don't know if there's a way for you guys to talk to us about
the level of staffing at your -- you're always selling new business, but the historical customers that you've
had through this whole time, what does the head count look like for those customers? Are they still -- can
you quantify how far down they are? I mean we talked about the 5 million jobs that are still missing. How
many of those were former Cintas wearers?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Andy, first of all, you can't open up a newspaper without hearing about wages and pressure in the
market on labor. So we are certainly not immune from that nor are our customers. And so we are battling
it every single day in staffing at levels that we feel very good about in our business.

And as far as our customers, I mean it's really difficult to say -- to put a number on it. It varies so much
based upon geographies and industries, because the restaurant business is certainly -- they're nowhere
near back to where I think they -- hopefully, will be someday and certainly not back to where they were
pre-COVID. As an example, warehousing and distribution is back very, very nicely and probably at or
above pre-COVID levels.

In total, we're certainly down from pre-pandemic levels. And I think we're a representative of the 5-
point-something million jobs that we have less in the U.S. versus pre-COVID. So we're anxious for our

customers to get back to previous levels. And when we think about labor and we think about those
functions, we always focus more about how it impacts our customers, we'll figure things out and how to
manage it.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

On not only 5.3 million jobs lost, right, versus pre-pandemic, but still 10 million, 11 million job openings
that haven't been filled, which is great opportunity for us.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes. The latest number I saw from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that they reported out earlier this month
was 10.9 million job openings. So I don't know how many of those would be people that would wear a
Cintas uniform and utilize items out of our first aid cabinets, et cetera, but we'd like to see those all be
filled.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just had one question for you guys. And I was just hoping, you talked about wage and labor a bit, but
can you just talk about the moving pieces on the cost side? We've heard a lot about driver shortages
and fuel costs and supply chain. I was just hoping you guys could just give us a quick state of what's
happening with you guys.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

So Manav, I'll start, and then Mike can assist with this. Certainly, energy costs are increasing. We're
seeing that, whether it's at the pump, natural gas to run our facilities. But we've worked really hard on
efficiencies in routing in our production facilities to maximize efficiencies there to mitigate all of that. And
we're -- I think we're doing a very good job there.

Wages, we talked a little bit about. But we have discussed in previous earnings calls that we've been
addressing this wage issue with particular focus on our frontline partners over the past couple of years. So
we weren't flatfooted when it came into this wage subject. We're continuing to address it. We've got to be
very competitive in the marketplace to attract the right partners on our team, and we're doing that. And
we're going to be able to continue to navigate that successfully. And then as you can imagine, we've been
very diligent about managing discretionary spend. There is some travel that is back, but certainly not near
the levels that they were pre-COVID.

Mike, anything else?

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

No, I think that hits the cost side, but, Manav, also keep in mind, we talked a little bit about this in July,
but we have begun to increase prices here in the first quarter. It's a strategic local customer-by-customer
view but early indications suggest a positive reception from our customer base. And certainly, that's
important as we look at things, like energy being up 40 basis points year-over-year.

We're not immune to some inflationary pressures, but we are -- as Todd said, we're managing them very,
very diligently. We're looking for automation opportunities, efficiency opportunities. And if we need to, we
can strategically increase prices, and we've started to do that here in this first quarter after taking a few
years off.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And actually, maybe if I can squeeze in one more. Just hoping you could give us an update on
the M&A pipeline, perhaps in the non-uniform businesses? Like are there opportunities that you guys are
actively seeking?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Great question, Manav. We're active and acquisitive in every business we're in. We'll say that activity
has ramped up here in the back half of the year, probably anticipation of tax changes, et cetera. But
nevertheless -- so we like the activity. We have -- we are in a great financial position. We love our balance
sheet and right after investing in our existing facilities to help grow those organizations, our #2 use of
capital is for M&A. And so we're very acquisitive and looking very active, and looking forward to closing on
more deals in the near future.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.

Hamzah Mazari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on pricing. You had mentioned you hadn't taken pricing for a while, I think,
maybe 2 years or 18 months or whatever. And I think you just referenced you're beginning to take price
now. What kind of price is baked into your guidance? And how are the customer conversations? I assume
customers see inflation headlines all over the place. So -- and given you have an increased pricing for a
while, could you maybe talk about order of magnitude? Are you doing a pricing catch-up? Or how should
we think about pricing strategy?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Hamzah, I wouldn't think of it as a catch-up. And we had not raised price in 2 years. But these are -- Mike
mentioned, these are strategic decisions. Their pricing is a local subject. It really gets down to what type
of -- what industry is that business in, what even geography are they in, and what condition of their -- is
their business and to be able to handle it, so that we're able to be fair with our customers as we look out.
Meaning, that there are certain organizations that are -- their business is doing a whole lot better than
others. And we're conscious of that.

But as far as the conversations, again, that would depend upon the particular business. But it does make
the conversation easier when inflation is so much in the headlines. So that certainly gives us a little
benefit. But these conversations are -- they're never easy, right? Because from our customer standpoint,
it's a tough subject. And -- but we're focused on the long-term value of those customer relationships, and
we handle them appropriately.

Hamzah Mazari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just my follow-up question would just be around -- just the -- I know it's been a while since
the SAP implementation was completed but then COVID hit, and we were sort of caught up in that, and
it's still kind of going on. But maybe you could just give some examples on how the SAP system is maybe
benefiting you now as organic growth comes back? Maybe if you want to talk about it qualitatively or
quantitatively, however, either on the cost side or revenue side. Any examples would kind of be helpful.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

Yes, Hamzah. So a few items on SAP that -- where we're benefiting from. Certainly, one view of the
customer is significant for us and that helps us with cross-sell. And we know when we do that, when we
are able to provide more products and services, the customer sees more value. And when they see more
value, it's a better retention tool for us. So that's been significant for us and has been and will continue to
be moving forward.

We get some other, certainly, advantage from a data analytics standpoint, the cash cycle, those types of
subjects. But some other items that I think you might be able to see out in the marketplace is routing
efficiencies are a real opportunity for us. We are focused on that from a dollar efficiency from our ambition
on the 2050 net-zero emissions. And we see that we can advance that subject, advance up all much
further than we have in the past by bringing technology to that. So that will be exciting.

The other item is, with SAP, it allows for us to have an online experience for our customers that they
haven't had in the past. And what we realized is that our customers want -- they don't all want to
communicate with us the way that they did when I started with the company 32 years ago, meaning they
don't want to just have to call during working hours. They want to do business when they want to do
business, whether that's to pay a bill, whether that's to communicate a request, to order something, those
types of items are all -- we want to make it easier to do business with us. And on our online presence,
and we call it My Cintas, allows for our customers to do just that. So providing more value to them, more
conduits for them to communicate with us, instead of having to do it in the old traditional 9-to-5 type
model. So those are significant for us.

Another operational item would be our ability to speed up the process from when we see an order
from a customer -- receive an order from a customer to when we can get it out to them. Having that
transparency throughout our supply chain is an absolute advantage where we can anticipate better. And
even once we receive the order, get it out the door faster than what we were historically. And so that
efficiency shows up to the customer in speed to market and then able to get them products and -- faster
than we had in the past. So we want to leverage that system. And I think we've done that quite nicely to
date, but there will be more coming.

Operator

We'll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Revenue growth in the quarter was stronger than you expected on a sequential basis. Can you elaborate
on the sources of upside, specifically? And where you see the most promising trends over the next year?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

George, I'll start, but I'd say two significant drivers of growth for us have been new business. It's still
quite robust. Our value proposition is resonating very much. And many companies are still struggling with
staffing. As we cited earlier, 10.9 million job openings. And when you're struggling with staffing and you
can find a company like Cintas, you can outsource certain functions too, it makes it very attractive. So
they look at it and say, wow, you can take care of these items and maybe they were a do-it-yourself in the
past, so that resonates with them. So that's been quite nice.

Most of -- and moving on to another driver, most of our customers were, I'd say, are open and probably
were open going into the first quarter. But we are providing more products and services to them. We are,
again, anxious for them to get back to their preemployment levels, and we think that will be even better.
But new business and then I'd say, again, adds within our current customers are two significant drivers for
us that we think will continue to help us throughout the year.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

Got it. That's helpful color. And then I wanted to dive into pricing increases, which you touched on earlier.
To what extent do you think that pricing combined with efficiencies can fully offset the input cost increases
that you're seeing? And could there be a timing lag as to when those pricing increases will take effect and
the real-time nature of the input cost increases that you're seeing now?

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, George. Certainly, timing, it is difficult to match up the timing exactly to when costs increase and
when we see changes in the supply chain, for example. But we're doing our best to manage. And the -- as
I mentioned a little bit ago, when we have those conversations today, the message resonates that look,
there are increases in cost and these price increases, when we do make them, they are reasonable and
they make sense to our customers. That's been our experience so far.

The really nice thing about our -- if you think about our cost structure as well, Todd hit on this a little bit,
that our labor, we've been working on that for a while. And so we may not be -- while not immune, we
may not be as affected as some of our peers and others. And so that's important for us. The other part is
that many of our material costs are amortized. So when we see spikes in supply chains in various areas,
whether it is labor throughout the world or cotton or other things, we're amortizing costs and it tends to
be a bit of a natural hedge for us.

And so it does slow down the impact and it requires the impact to be greater for a much longer period of
time before it really starts to hit us. And in those cases, we can get ahead of the inflationary pressures
a little bit with our pricing strategy. So generally speaking, we feel like we're -- while it's not perfect
matching of expense and benefit, we do a pretty good job, and we get a little bit of benefit from just the
way our business works.

We'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.

Ashish Sabadra
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Good results. Mike, I just wanted to drill down further on the cross-sell opportunities that you mentioned.
I was wondering if you could provide any color on where you are in penetrating, let's say, hygiene
products, safety as well as first aid and fire services within your existing customer base? And how can you
accelerate that cross-sell either through organic or through M&A? Any color on those fronts?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Ashish, thanks for the comments and the question. We have our sales and service organization well
positioned to offer the various products and services. Again, they have tools that allow them to understand
where those opportunities exist. They're certainly not perfect, but they are allowing them to get pointed
in the right direction to help provide that value to the customers. And as I mentioned, the more value
-- or excuse me, the more products and services we provide to the customer, we know that stickier that
relationship will be, just like most relationships, right? If it's just one product, it's probably more at risk
than having two and so on and so forth.

So it's very much a point of focus. When you think about our relationships, every single customer,
virtually, needs our fire surface, right, because of the legal requirements around that subject. But we see
very nice overlap with those who would -- who are uniform customers who would need some direct sale
their uniform rental. And we also see overlap with those who are uniform rental customers who would
need First Aid and Safety products, training, CPR, all the various items that we provide.

So it's -- our big issue has been in the past that our customers weren't aware of everything we provided.
And that's a nice problem to have, but nevertheless, it's still very much a problem for us. And we're
trying to change that position in the marketplace that our customers realize that not just through our
sales and service organizations but also through our mass media spend, which you may have seen this

past weekend where we had a significant position on -- in golf's Ryder Cup, where we're trying to get
the message out about all the products and services we provide. And not a complete one-stop shop for a
business, but we sure do get them a long ways on that path. Mike, anything else on this?

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Well, the only thing I would add is the really good news is we're in the early innings of penetration. And so
when you think about the rental customers and the opportunity to continue to penetrate with even rental
items, such as our restroom products and our things that we've talked about recently in the last year, like
isolation gowns and hand sanitizers, we're in the very early innings. And when you couple that with the
First Aid and Safety and fire opportunities, again, less than 20% penetration. And so we've got a lot of
work to do and a really exciting thing is much opportunity remains.

Ashish Sabadra
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's very helpful color. That's great. And maybe just a quick clarifying question. I was just wondering at
a very high level, can you provide what are the key categories of spend and the percentage of expenses
from labor versus fuel versus amortization of equipment? Any color will be helpful.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Sure. Let me start with energy. So energy, and that would include fuel for our trucks and the running of
our laundry operations, in the quarter was 2.1%. That is up 40 basis points from a year ago, flat with
our fourth quarter. So it's a -- while it is up some, it's still a relatively insignificant part of our overall cost
structure.

When you think, Ashish, about our cost structure, though, you can -- I'm going to use cost of rentals. You
can think about it in 3 buckets, the cost of the materials, the cost of running the laundries and then the
cost of the service component. And while they're not exactly the same, you can think about them as 1/3
each. And each of those buckets are a little bit different. I mentioned the materials, many of which we
amortize over certain periods of time. So we get a little bit of smoothing of those costs. And then we also
have some that are direct sale type, like the restroom products that we expense immediately.

The major component of that would be those rental items that we're amortizing. When you think
about the laundries, then you're -- then we're into the depreciation of the buildings and certainly, the
equipment that's in our wash alleys, but also the labor component within that as well. And then the
service component, you've got our drivers, our trucks and the amortization of the trucks and the gas to
run those. When you put it all together, certainly, labor is a large part of our cost structure. The materials,
the products that we sell, certainly a large part of our structure. And we manage each one of those quite
tightly and look for improvement opportunities.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.

Jeffrey Daniel Goldstein
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is actually Jeff on for Toni. I know this question was asked earlier related to revenue guidance, but I
wanted to ask it slightly different as it relates to EPS. The EPS guide is up by about 2% for the full year,
but it seems like a lot of that is maybe flowing through the buybacks and a better-than-expected tax rate.
So is that fair? And is that to say from an operating standpoint, maybe you're a little bit more optimistic
on the revenue side, but maybe some cost headwinds keep you a little conservative here? Just some more
color on that would be helpful.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

13

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

Sure, Jeff. I don't think that's a fair reflection of our guidance. You think about our guidance of $10.60
to $10.90 that's a 3.5% to 6.4% increase in annual EPS. But you referred to a lower tax rate, our tax
rate is going to -- based on our guide today, is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. Now that's quite a
significant impact. And if you think about the 760 basis points that I referred to in my opening remarks,
that takes EPS growth from about 11% to 14%. Now certainly, the buyback that we had done in the fourth
quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit, but that still gets to a pretax earnings growth in the
range of double digits. And so it's a pretty good year.

And then if you kind of move further up, we talked in July about our guidance of implying operating
improvement of -- at the low end 0 basis points to 70 at the high end, we're still right around in that
neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today. And keep in mind, that's on the heels of
a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of say that our
guidance is based on share buyback and taxes, I think, is not a great reflection of really what's going
on. The guidance on the EPS side is nice, healthy margin improvement, pretax increases of right around
double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that EPS down. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more
color on that EPS guidance.

Jeffrey Daniel Goldstein
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

No, understood. That was helpful. And then I want to ask about first aid margins, which were pretty strong
in the quarter. Are you able to quantify at all how much PPE is still constraining margins there, just given
its greater than normal mix? And then I guess based on that, how should we think about near-term upside
as that rolls off? Like is that really going to kick up in the next few quarters as that roll off? Just kind of
overall, if you could talk about the path back to pre-COVID level margins in that line of business.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Sure. We certainly -- PPE has been a major factor in that business. And Jeff, you're correct in pointing
that out. And it was a -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year, and we
invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers, even if it was at a bit of a lower gross
margin for us. But we've seen some nice sequential improvement there. Our 44.8% is still lower than our
pre-pandemic of, call it, 48-ish percent. And so we're -- we still believe we can get back to those kinds of
levels.

Now the PPE that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than
the First Aid comes back because, as Todd and Paul have referenced, we still have a lot of job openings,
quite a bit fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. And so as those people come back and
as those job openings get filled, that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets. And that creates some
nice momentum.

One of the nice things that we really have seen coming out over the last few quarters is our customers
and our new customers, so prospects turning into customers, are really seeing the value of keeping their
employees safe and healthy, and our first aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. And
so our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space. But it's coming back. And while
we like the momentum, we're not there yet. And we do expect to see sequential improvement. And I'll
maybe step that back a bit. We expect to see improvement in the year. Every quarter can be a little bit
bumpy here and there. But generally speaking, we continue to look for improved gross margin in that
business.

We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

If I could go back to labor for a minute. I think a lot of your comments have been about cost and working
on wages, but are you fully staffed both from a service and a sales perspective? And if you had seen any
elevated turnover relative to history or had any increased difficulty hiring to support the rebound in growth
you're seeing?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Gary, a very good question. I guess the way I'd describe it is we're having to run at higher RPMs to get
the output that we want. So it's harder. There's no doubt about it. Attracting, retaining and developing the
talent is core to what we do as a company, and we're working that much harder now to get to the levels
that we want to be at.

So are we staffed at the levels we want to be at? Yes. Yes, we like our staffing position. Turnover is still
very manageable. And I think it speaks to many, many things. Certainly, the total compensation that
we provide, the attractive benefits, but it really speaks to the culture and the investment that we put in
to people, because for so many partners that have grown up in the company and have advanced in the
company, and that's part of our culture. So we've always had to be really good at painting a picture for
people about, this is where you start, but we will invest and develop you. And we're having to work harder
at it, but it's still resonating with folks. And so that's where we are now.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then on -- you've talked about the PPE and some of the pandemic-driven sales in First
Aid and Safety. But I think you also had some of that in uniforms handling that stuff through the facilities
business. Is -- and I'm not going to ask you when it's going to go away because who knows, but is there
a meaningful chunk of revenue there that probably churns off in the future? And what I'm really trying
to think through is how that could impact the rate of growth over the next several quarters or whatever
in the core uniforms business. Is it elevated? Or is that just not a big deal in the grand scheme of that
business?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Gary, what Mike spoke of, it was a significant portion of our First Aid and Safety business. There
was certainly some revenue that went through our rental business sold on route, that was for PPE, but
nowhere near the amount as a percentage that would go through our First Aid business. So is there some
there today? There's a little bit, but it's not significant whatsoever.

So -- and as far as when we look out about demand, we're still in a good spot if the demand is there
for those types of products and services. We're managing that inventory. And there is still demand. We
sure hope, as a country and as North America, as a world that, that is -- that will be diminishing over the
course of the balance of our fiscal year. So our guide takes all that into account. And we're focused on
building the core of our business. And -- but if our customers need those types of products and services,
we're there for them, and we will help them with this.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Gary, I might just add, as you're thinking about -- I believe you referred to the next several quarters,
as I said in my opening remarks, we talked last third quarter about $45 million that we did not expect
to repeat in our fourth quarter. And so that's going to be, as you think about the growth of quarter-to-
quarter, definitely keep that in mind as a third quarter growth impact.

Now again, as it relates to this PPE, look, the safety and cleanliness themes that we've sold under for
years is really resonating. And we certainly believe that those areas will be larger moving forward than
pre-COVID and that certainly is exciting for us.

We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.

Scott Andrew Schneeberger
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I want to hone in a little bit on the offsetting efficiencies of the environment in the automation just
anecdotally, if you could speak to a few things you're doing. I know on Hamzah's question, you talked
about SAP and automation of payments and customer facing. Just curious if you could elaborate maybe a
little bit on what you're doing in this environment, maybe at facilities or otherwise and some of the longer-
term goals of other automation?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Scott, a couple of obvious ones for us, I mentioned routing. That is obviously a significant one that we
think is going to pay dividends for us. Scott Farmer always spoke about, we don't generate any revenue
when the wheels are turning on our trucks, right? We generate revenue when the wheels stop. And we see
an opportunity to improve that efficiency and that we're investing in technology there to do so, and we're
excited about the impact that will have not only on our cost structure, but also on our emissions as we
move forward.

In the production facilities, we are managing very tightly our wash alley and making sure that we have
much better efficiencies there, meaning we're tracking very closely the number of loads that go through
our facilities versus the quantity that went through pre-COVID on the same playing field, meaning same
amount of volume that's going through. And we put some technology in place to help us with that instead
of just doing it through elbow grease. And as a result, we're seeing some real benefits there. And again,
that will help us in our cost structure, but also in our emissions. And so we're focused on making sure that
we're managing that very tightly, and we're seeing some benefits there.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, I'm not -- one other one I might talk about, I don't know that Todd mentioned the stockrooms in
our laundry facilities and the ability to get those automated, and that creates visibility and it creates
the opportunity to share. And when we are more efficient in our stockrooms, so let me be clear, our
stockrooms are within our -- within all of our rental facilities, they are garments that have been in service
already. And so when we are efficient, that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing
in our cost structure. And so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either
already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully.

And so we get some real nice incremental margins when we can more efficiently use those or put back
those garments into service. SAP has allowed us to get visibility and to be able to improve the use of those
garments within our stockroom. So that's another example, Scott, of something that's really benefiting us.

Scott Andrew Schneeberger
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Excellent. Sounds good, guys. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on -- it
sounds like you're very active in M&A, that came up, I think, particularly before calendar year-end, maybe
with some consideration for tax implications. But you've done over $1 billion worth of stock buybacks in
the fourth and the first quarter here, back to back, and that's just kind of looking back, that's as big, if
any, year going back for a while.

So I'm just kind of curious how -- the thought process there, if -- it sounds like you're getting closer on
some M&A, but it's not really a lot of allocation of capital is going into repurchase, is that something we
should expect to continue?

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 29, 2021

Scott, we are -- as I mentioned, we're active, and it takes two to dance, and we're seeing more folks at
the dance as anecdotally, my guess is because of tax reform. And as a result, we think more deals will
come through. Now, that being said, we are in a great position on our balance sheet. And we are ready,
willing and able to activate that balance sheet as appropriate that is best for the long-term value for our
organization.

And just as a reminder, the #1 priority for our capital is, has been and will continue to be the investment
into our current business to help grow the sales and profits of our organization, whether that's through
additional products and services, additional facilities, training, staffing levels, all those is our #1 priority.
And then after that, #2 is M&A, and we're steadfast in that commitment, and we'll allocate appropriately.

And then thereafter, then we'll return it to the shareholders as available in the form of stock buyback and
dividends. And I think we've got a really good track record of managing those priorities appropriately and
intelligently for the long-term value.
