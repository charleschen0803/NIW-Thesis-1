Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q3 AMETEK Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator
Instructions]

It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Coleman.

Kevin C. Coleman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for AMETEK's Third quarter
2020 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;
and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

AMETEK's third quarter results were released earlier this morning and are available on market systems
and in the Investors section of our website. This call is also being webcasted and can be accessed on our
website. The webcast will be archived and made available on our site later today.

During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change
based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from
expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is
contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC, including in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. AMETEK
disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

Any references made on this call to 2019 or 2020 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-
tax acquisition-related intangible amortization and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys
in the first quarter of 2020 and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations
between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of
our website.

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions. I'll now
turn the meeting over to Dave.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered a strong third quarter despite ongoing
challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. While sales continued to be impacted by the pandemic,
the demand environment showed solid improvements from the second quarter as customers return to
work and travel restrictions began to slowly ease. In addition, our businesses delivered outstanding
operating performance, allowing us to expand margins, generate excellent cash flow and drive earnings
ahead of our expectations.

I would like to thank our employees who are managing exceptionally well through this pandemic,
overcoming both personal and professional challenges to provide essential products and services to our
customers. I continue to be impressed by the strength of our workforce and the dedication to our mission
of solving our customers' most complex challenges. We remain vigilant and focused on our employees'
safety. Our site and country-level pandemic coordinators are doing an excellent job adapting to the
shifting guidelines provided by the CDC and local health and safety agencies. The flexibility our teams
have shown in implementing new processes and protocols to ensure a safe working environment has been
excellent.

Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Third quarter sales were $1.13 billion, down 12% compared
to the third quarter of 2019. Organic sales were down 14%, with the recent acquisitions contributing
5 points to growth, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3 point headwind and foreign currency adding 1

point. As expected, our commercial aerospace business, which is less than 10% of the overall company,
experienced the largest impact from COVID with sales down approximately 35% versus the prior year.

Our businesses continue to drive operational excellence initiatives to help mitigate demand weakness.
These efforts led to excellent operating results in the quarter. Third quarter operating income was $270.7
million and operating margins were a record 24%, up 40 basis points compared to last year's third quarter
while decremental margins were an impressive 20% in the quarter. EBITDA in the third quarter was $332
million and EBITDA margins were a record 29.5%, up 210 basis points over last year's comparable period.
This led to earnings per diluted share of $1.01, down just 5% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Furthermore, our business has generated a strong level of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter
was $310 million and free cash flow conversion was an impressive 146% of net income.

Next, let me provide additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group
performed very well in the quarter despite end market weakness, delivering outstanding operating
performance, resulting in strong margin expansion. Sales in the third quarter for EIG were $748.4 million,
down 8% from the comparable period in 2019. As expected, we saw solid and widespread sequential
sales improvements from the second quarter. Organic sales were down 15% year-over-year, with the
acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing 6 points and foreign currency contributing 1 point.
Commercial aerospace remains the largest driver of organic sales weakness in EIG. EIG's third quarter
operating income was $203.7 million and operating margins were an impressive 27.2%, up 30 basis points
compared to the same quarter last year.

Our Electromechanical Group also saw sequential sales improvement and mitigated a weak demand
environment with solid operating performance. EMG sales were $378.6 million, down 18% from last year's
third quarter, driven in part by the impact of the Reading Alloys divestiture. Organic sales were down 13%,
with a divestiture an 8 point headwind, the acquisition of PDT adding 2 points and foreign currency adding
1 point. EMG's operating income was $84.3 million and operating margins were solid at 22.3% for the
quarter.

Let me comment briefly on end market dynamics for some of our businesses. Overall, we saw solid
sequential sales improvements across all markets in the third quarter. We expect continued sequential
improvements in the fourth quarter for all businesses other than commercial aerospace where we expect
largely flat conditions sequentially. Our strongest market remains defense where we continue to be
well positioned with content across a wide range of important defense platforms. We are also very well
positioned within our medical and health care businesses, although they experienced a delay in the return
of electric procedures during the third quarter, which offset solid COVID-driven demand. And our most
challenged markets remains commercial aerospace, remain cautious of a trajectory of a recovery given the
uncertainty caused by COVID-19.

Given the uncertain and challenging end market dynamics, our businesses remain highly focused on
driving operational excellence initiatives, both structural and temporary, to manage top line weakness,
while assuring we maintain our investments in key growth initiatives across the company. AMETEK's
asset-light operating model provides us with the flexibility to do both. Our ability to expand margins and
generate strong levels of cash flow during this pandemic is evidence of the strength of our operating
model. In the third quarter, we generated $70 million in total cost savings, which was at the high end
of our expectations, with $40 million in structural savings and $30 million in temporary cost reduction
savings. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a slightly higher level of structural savings, while
temporary savings will be reduced from the third quarter levels as we add back additional temporary costs
during the quarter. As a result, we expect approximately $55 million in total cost savings in the fourth
quarter, with $45 million in structural and $10 million in temporary cost savings. And for the full year, we
expect approximately $230 million in total cost savings, with $140 million in structural savings and $90
million in temporary savings.

Our businesses continue to implement new and innovative ways to reach our customers around the
world and in new markets. Through virtual meeting platforms, augmented reality product demonstrations
and service and enhanced digital marketing initiatives, our businesses have adapted quickly to the new
landscape. Seeing our businesses adopt these new ways of doing business quickly and effectively has been

very impressive. Our businesses are also collaborating across platforms. As an example, AMETEK Land and
AMETEK Rauland recently partnered together to help support Rauland's reopen schools safely campaign
for their Telecenter U solution. Rauland is a leading provider of critical communications, workflow and
safety solutions for hospitals and schools. Their Telecenter U solution connects classrooms and educational
facilities to district offices for emergencies, event management and everyday communications.

As I mentioned in our last earnings call, AMETEK Land, a leading manufacturer of noncontact temperature
measurement solutions, recently developed their new VIRALERT 3 system for rapid detection of elevated
skin temperatures at points of entry to various facilities, including schools. Through this collaborative
effort, Rauland was able to incorporate Land's VIRALERT 3 technology into their Telecenter U solution
to help their customers safely reopen their schools by allowing for temperature screening of students
and faculty. In return, AMETEK Land will reach thousands of new potential customers through Rauland's
well established network of school districts. The result was a valuable solution for our customers.
Congratulations to the AMETEK and the AMETEK Rauland team for the success on this project.

We're also finding ways to support our customers through new product innovation. Throughout the
pandemic, we continued to invest meaningfully in our research and development initiatives, and we're
seeing great success from these efforts. Our Vitality Index, which measures the amount of sales generated
from products introduced during the last 3 years, was very strong at 25% in the quarter. During the
quarter, Creaform, a worldwide leader in 3D measurement solutions, unveiled its R-Series 3D scanning
solution that is designed for automated dimensional quality control applications. The suite of R-Series
solutions includes the new robot-mounted MetraSCAN 3D scanner with [ Q bar ], a turnkey industrial
measuring cell that is designed to be integrated into factories for at-line inspections. Together, the solution
provides customers with much faster cycle times, more accurate and repeatable results, higher resolution
and operational simplicity to increase productivity by measuring more dimensions on more parts without
compromising on accuracy. Congratulations to the Creaform team for launching this outstanding new
solution.

Now shifting to acquisitions. While deal flow during the second and third quarters has been impacted by
the pandemic, we are starting to see a healthy pickup in activity. Our pipeline is strong and conversations
with acquisition targets are accelerating. As Bill will highlight in a moment, over the last 2 quarters, we
have further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position and remain poised to deploy significant
capital on strategic acquisitions. We will remain active yet disciplined in our acquisition process. We
continue to focus on acquiring niche technology leaders with attractive growth profiles with opportunities
for us to add value commercially and operationally.

Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While the global economy continues to present
challenges and uncertainties, visibility has improved across most markets. As a result, we're providing
guidance for the fourth quarter. Overall sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be down high single
digits with a similar level of organic sales decline. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the
range of $1 to $1.04, down 4% to 7% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter decremental margins are
expected to remain solid in the low 20s.

To summarize, our businesses delivered a solid quarter in a difficult environment. AMETEK continues to
manage this global crisis well with the proven strength of the AMETEK growth model and with a talented
workforce. Our cost mitigation efforts have allowed the company to weather this ongoing storm, and we
are confident that we will overcome these challenges with a bright future.

I'll now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter. Then we'll be
glad to take your questions. Bill?

William Joseph Burke
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave. I'd like to echo Dave's comments on the quarter as we saw outstanding operating
performance, driven by the tremendous efforts of our team in a very challenging economic environment.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and
administrative expenses were down $4.5 million compared to the same period of 2019, primarily due to
lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts. As a percentage of sales, general and
administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales in the quarter, down from 1.7% last year. The effective tax
rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, down from 19.5% in the same period last year. The lower tax rate
in the quarter was due to a return to provision adjustments and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings. For
2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the
past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year
estimated rate.

Operating capital -- working capital was an impressive 17% in the third quarter, down sequentially from
the second quarter's 19.6% on outstanding working capital management. Capital expenditures in the
quarter were $10 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million,
which is $5 million higher than our full year expectations last quarter as we are investing in incremental
growth opportunities. Our full year capital expenditures estimate remains below our initial expectations to
start the year of $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $63 million. For
the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes
after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted
share.

Our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash flow despite the challenges presented by the
pandemic. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million. Free cash flow was $300 million, and free
cash flow conversion was excellent at 146% of net income. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.8
billion, up slightly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $68 million from the end of the second
quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio
at the end of the third quarter was 2.1x as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances.
This ratio was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5x. And our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x
at quarter end, which improved by 0.2x in the quarter. We remain well positioned to manage this ongoing
economic downturn with approximately $2.3 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth
initiatives. This includes approximately $1 billion in available revolver capacity. As we've highlighted on
previous calls, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023.

In summary, our businesses continue to manage through the pandemic exceptionally well, delivering
strong operating results and high levels of cash flow. The dedication of our world-class workforce to
serving our essential customers has truly been impressive. We remain well positioned to manage ongoing
economic challenges while investing in our long-term growth initiatives.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Dave, I was wondering if you can maybe start by doing your more detailed walk through on the
businesses, please?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Sure. I'll start with the Process business. Overall sales for Process were down mid-single digits in the
quarter. We had the contributions from the Gatan acquisition, and they were offset by an organic sales
decline, and it was in line with AMETEK's overall organic sales decline. We saw sequential improvements
in sales during the quarter, with this improvement being widespread across our Process businesses.
Our CAMECA and Zygo businesses had solid quarters, driven in part by their exposures to research in
semiconductor markets. They did very well. And we expect continued solid sequential improvements in
sales for Process during the fourth quarter.

I'll go into Aerospace next. Both overall and organic sales for our entire A&D business were down mid-
teens in the quarter, showing nice sequential growth from the second quarter. Similar to the second
quarter, there was a meaningful difference in performance between our defense and commercial aerospace
businesses. Our defense businesses continue to see solid demand with sales up low double digits on a
percentage basis versus last year, while the commercial aerospace businesses were down about 35%
versus last year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect demand to maintain -- to be relatively flat
sequentially versus the third quarter as the broad commercial aerospace market continues to adjust to the
uncertain demand environment due to COVID-19.

And then next, our Power & Industrial market segment. Overall sales for Power & Industrial were down low
double digits in the third quarter, with contributions from IntelliPower being offset by a mid-teens organic
sales decline. Demand levels in the third quarter improved nicely from the second quarter, and we expect
sequential improvements again in the fourth quarter.

And finally, for our Automated & Engineered Solutions market segment. Organic sales in the third quarter
for A&ES were down mid-teens on a percentage basis. We saw modest sequential improvements across
these businesses in the third quarter as we had expected with applications tied to medical markets
performing well. We also saw a return to growth in China for our automation and engineered solutions
business in the quarter. And as with the other subsegments, we expect sequential improvements across
both our automation and engineered solutions businesses in the fourth quarter. That's a walk around the
company, Matt.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And then as my follow-up, can you comment on what your price realization was in Q3? And what you are
looking for in terms of sourcing savings for the full year?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the -- I'll go with the price first. The -- we're very pleased to see our pricing held up well. Q3
was similar to Q2. We achieved about 1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the
impact of tariffs was about 1 point. So we had a 50 basis points of positive spread added to margins. And

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

your second question was on sourcing savings, that -- we consider that part of structural savings, and it
was about $60 million.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The one point, though, to finish, it was $60 million for the year, to Matt. And go ahead, Deane.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great to see you guys are back in the quarterly guidance business because that does speak to your
earnings visibility. So first question is kind of related to this visibility. If you could take us through the
cadence of the months in quarter organically and maybe how October month-to-date has looked? And let's
start there, please.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Sure. In terms of orders in Q3, it was pretty typical trend for us with September being the strongest
month of the quarter. In fact, it was our strongest month since, I believe, February, back in Q1 when we
started to really feel the impact of the virus. That's orders. In terms of sales, September, again, was our
highest month of the quarter and the highest month of the year so far. And in terms of October, obviously,
it's not completed yet, but it looks good. Orders are trending well and is supportive of our guide in Q4,
which shows solid sequential improvement.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So did you see in the months that sequential improvement consistent through the quarter?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

We saw sequential improvements in orders. In sales, I believe, August was a bit of an outlier, but August
is always tricky for us. So in general, it was a trend upward with September the highest in both sales and
in orders.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And then just kind of bridge this degree of confidence in the sequential improvement, how this
translates into your confidence in restoring guidance?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the confidence is really based on us becoming more confident with our ability to live with
the virus. And we got visibility in our markets. We're seeing consistent improvement and consistent
engagement with customers across all of our markets. And we just got to the point where we were
comfortable with giving guidance. Our guidance range is a little bit wider than it typically is, and that's into
-- takes into account some of the uncertainty for the fourth quarter. But we just got comfortable because
our businesses are operating in a good rhythm, and it builds a level of confidence with us.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Great. And then just my last question. Not to oversimplify your mix and with respect to how you -- in
the last question, Matt's question, you gave and highlighted those businesses. But if I thought about
AMETEK in the strength of your medical and defense, those are probably the strongest here, how did those
collectively do in the quarter? And then the weakest, which is more secular. It's not execution, we get
that. And actually, the commercial business, you've outperformed a number of your peers in that space
-- in this market. So -- but the 2 sides of this medical, defense, how they do versus the oil and gas and
commercial aero on the other side?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

That's a great question. One way to think about it is, if I take the 2 most challenged markets out, the
commercial aerospace and oil and gas, sales were down approximately 10%. And another way to think
about that is our defense showed strong growth in the third quarter, up mid-teens. Our health care
business was just slightly down because of the -- we had COVID-related demand that was strong, but we
had a -- people weren't calling to hospitals and getting surgical procedures. So that was off a little bit. But
the combinations of both the defense and medical was clearly our strongest, and that was about flat.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Terrific. And just a quick clarification. When you said flat 4Q for aero, was that commercial aero and
defense? Or was it combined?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

So sequentially, we're saying it's going to be flat, and that's both for military and commercial aerospace.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Well done, again. I do have a question first on, I think, an area that you might be most proud of this
quarter, operating working capital. What did you do there to push that percentage down as much as you
did? What happened?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The first comment is that's the -- one of the hallmarks of AMETEK is our -- we think about working
capital as being very -- you have to run businesses where you're efficient with working capital. And there
are some elements that really overperformed, and I'll let Bill comment on that.

William Joseph Burke
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think what you saw was our receivables performance has been fantastic. Our businesses have
really done a great job staying close to our customers and understanding that pushing for payment. Our
receivables were down to 46 days on a DSO basis, which is as low as it's been in quite a while. So I think
the teams did a fantastic job there. And then the other thing, it's a little more difficult, especially when
sales are declining as rapidly as they did earlier in the year is getting your supply chains realigned to
that level of demand, and they did a great job with that as well. And I think you saw that play out in the
third quarter. So I think those 2 things in combination really enabled us to reduce that working capital
percentage to 17%, and the teams have just done a fantastic job on that around the company.

Scott Graham

10

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

That's great. Now here's another one, the $90 million of expected full year temporary cost reductions. A
lot of companies are saying, "Hey, not all of that comes back." What is your view on that for 2021at this
point, how much of that comes back? How much of it is maybe permanent?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The first point I'd make is the temporary cost savings will be at a run rate of about $10 million in
the fourth quarter. The second point is related to next year. We were in a situation -- we have to sit down
with all of our teams, our budgeting processes in November. It's a bottoms-up comprehensive planning
process for each business unit. They're going to look at growth in each of their markets, customer plans,
competitive dynamics, investments, opportunities, capital projects, cost reduction. And part of that
discussion is going to be how fast the temporary costs are going to come back and what the impact is
year-over-year. At a high level, travel is a part of that, and it's going to come back slowly through the
year. But some of the costs have already been restored. So we really don't have a detailed plan on that
next year because we haven't done our budgeting yet. We start that process in November. But that's how I
think about it.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. Last question. On the M&A pipeline, obviously, you have a much broader swathe of businesses
today than you did even 2 to 3 years ago, particularly, I look at Gatan and how you've gotten even more
into the scientific markets. Could you give us maybe something a little bit more granular, Dave, on what
you're looking for? And I know competitively, you got to be careful there. But I'm assuming that medical
scientific research would be really kind of at the top of the list for things you're looking for. Could you
comment on that?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I think that's an area that we're definitely looking at. I mean it's broad-based. We -- as you know,
we have a decentralized business model, and we get acquisition plans rolled up through our businesses
through an adjacency process. And we're looking at all parts of the business in all areas. And the --
we're seeing an uptick in opportunity -- uptick in discussions. But they could come from all parts of our
business, but the area that you highlighted is a particularly interesting one to us.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett.

Ivana Delevska
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

So just wanted to ask what percent of your portfolio, maybe excluding aero and defense and medical, is
levered to CapEx? And what are you seeing in those CapEx-levered businesses?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Most of the products that we sell are at a price range that could be considered both OpEx or CapEx.
So we really don't segment it that way. But certainly, the -- you think about the big projects, and the
big project businesses and our oil and gas business and our metals business and some of the heavier
industries are delayed right now, but the operating expenditures are continuing. So I really don't have a
percentage to give you, but that's how we think about it.

And then in terms of the CapEx-levered businesses, are those like down significantly more than the other
rest, would you say?

William Joseph Burke
Executive VP & CFO

No. In fact, our -- in the research market for CAMECA, they're selling $1 million, $3 million tools, and that
was one of the businesses that I highlighted in Process that I talked about in our -- so that's not the case.
I mean that's a university market or a research market, very expensive. The key there is that we have the
best products, and we're the only one in the world that makes an ADAPREV. And we have a unique sims
capability. So people save, they budget for our products, and we build products and they deliver them. So
-- and CAMECA, which is a CapEx market for us, had one of their best quarters. So it's really dependent on
customer dynamics.

And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Dave, I want to go back to the Aerospace, down 35%. It's a steep decline for sure, but compared
to sort of down 50% to 60% we've seen from some of the other suppliers into that market. So I'm just
curious, would there be a reason why your decline would be significantly decoupled from what we've seen
in the industry? I'm thinking about maybe programs or other factors because that -- it doesn't sound like
it, but that was actually a pretty good performance.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. I mean it was a good performance. Remember, we thought we were going to be down in the
mid- to high 40s, and we ended up down 35% in the commercial aerospace. Our teams did an excellent
job. When you look at the different subsegments, the third-party aftermarket and the commercial OEM
ended up being down similar with business jet. And we thought the business jet would be higher and the
third-party aftermarket and the commercial OEM will be lower, and those 2 subsegments perform better.
But I -- that's as much of backlog and things like that. Commercial is finding a bottom. There are many
variables, including government support, airline capacity decisions, obviously, the confidence of the flying
public. And when we thought about our business sequentially, that's the only part of our business, we
think will not improve. So definitely a better quarter. I can't comment on how -- the performance of other
companies because I really don't know them. But I know our teams did a good job on shipping product on
-- and it was negative 35%. Pleased with the performance as strange as that sounds.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Right. That business is definitely getting better. And then just on structural costs, you gave some
great detail there. And I think you said $45 million of cost during 4Q, is that a full run rate? So as we go
into 2021, are we looking at maybe, I don't know, $40 million or so of kind of like carryover benefits into
'21?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. First of all, Nigel, it's $55 million of savings in Q4 and $45 million of it is structural and $10 million of
it is temporary. And I'm going to give you a -- there's a $50 million carryover from the restructuring that
we did earlier in the year. But in terms of getting into any specifics, I'm going to not answer the question
for next year. Our budgeting process is going to be in November. And really, there's a lot of discussion on
cost reduction, investments and the temporary costs that are going to come back, and that all goes into a
mix. And it will be a pretty complex budgeting process this year with the pandemic so there's some extra
variables in it. So I'm not going to comment on what the savings will be for next year.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So it sounds like you're still maybe contemplating additional action for 4Q to kind of like maybe set up for
'21, would that be fair?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

No, I don't think so. But we're going to go through our budgeting processes and something may come out
of there, but we don't have anything planned in Q4.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.

Christopher D. Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So just wondering if in the current environment where some smaller companies might be concerned about
global dynamics, supply chain, trade, et cetera, if you're picking up on any new motivations by sellers,
including some you've tracked and courted for some years.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think there is some activity out there where people are anticipating possibly a tax rate change.
So there's some people that are -- have their businesses out there as part of the uptick in pipeline
opportunities. And in terms of the overall uncertainty in the global environment, if you're a smaller owner
of a company that has all these dynamics in terms of COVID and geopolitical issues and issues with China,
you're certainly a little unsettled. And we've known those people for years, and we're certainly having
discussions on them in terms of what the right time for them for the sell their businesses.

Christopher D. Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And any changes in the competition for deals that you're interested in seeing?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

I would say no competition change that's noticeable. It's been about the same for the last couple of years.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a couple of people actually asked me. Did I miss -- did you guys actually give us actual orders in the
third quarter? You usually do that.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I can do that. Our overall orders were minus 8%. Our organic orders were minus 12%, and our book-
to-bill was 1.01.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Okay. That was easy. And then the second question just I'll ask on elective procedures. I think most of
your competitors sort of said that elective surgery is back to 90%, 95% level pre-COVID. Are you just --
has that been your experience? And what are you seeing on elective procedures into Q4?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think elective procedures for us, we think is going to stay at a reduced level until next year is the
-- we're hearing from customers. So we think we'll have another quarter in Q4 of some kind of reduced
elective procedures, and then it will recover next year. And I anticipate working on a backlog and there's
less demand with COVID. So that market will correct itself as time goes on.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

But your experience is consistent sort of with the data that I cited, that your competitors are citing, right?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'm not sure what the competitors have cited, but we're down a bit in the numbers that you put out
there, 90% or 95%, kind of makes sense.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then just to ask Ivana's question in a slightly different way. On the way up as IP recovers, what
kind of revenue leverage to IP should we be thinking for your portfolio, ex aero and maybe ex health care?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Right. That's [indiscernible] we're going to talk about with our businesses, but historically, AMETEK has
recovered very well from significant downturns. And we're seeing the improvements in Q3 versus Q2.
We're anticipating seeing it in Q4 versus Q3. And historically, we've really performed well in upticks. So
we have a mid- and long-cycle business, and we're seeing good improvements. And what you're seeing
now is the short-cycle activity is picking up. So that should bode well for the future, but we're going to go
through our budgets and figure everything out.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

First question, just on defense and medical. First, on the defense side, very strong 2020. It continues to
look pretty good here. What is your visibility in that business next year based on wins or platforms you're
on? Clearly a tough comp, but can you see that growing still next year? And then on the medical side, any
identifiable COVID-related opportunities that you could point to or even quantify that could pop up here
over the coming months?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The first question is, I'm really not going to comment on the military demand environment next year,
but the spending pattern, those things are relatively healthy. And we'll see what the political environment
brings, but usually, those changes occur slowly over time. So you think that the overall spending
environment will be supportive next year, and we -- our quoting activity shows that. In terms of the
COVID-related products, I mean, the first thing I'd point you to is the Land temperature measurement.
So we're doing body temperature scanning. When I came into the work today, I went through the

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Land system. It's very quickly, easy, efficient and measures body temperature. The other things that
are happening in our automation business, there's a lot of COVID-testing devices that require sample
automation, movement of samples very precisely through testing. The demand in that business is very
strong. And we're also seeing some demand for temporary setups in hospital-type situations with our
Rauland health care businesses. So we're really seeing some pockets of improved demand and that's built
into the overall story.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Got it. That's great. And then just in terms of the geographic complexion, could you maybe give us a
little more color what sales or order rates? And then I'm actually curious specific on Europe in October
where the lockdown chatter and maybe even enactment was starting to percolate a little bit. Did you see a
slowing kind of late in October in Europe?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. I'll take the second question first. I mean our orders for October are very good. They're in line
with what we are expecting, and we're seeing no geographical problems at this point. In terms of the
third quarter, the geographical third quarter, we had positive sequential trends across all geographies,
with Europe and U.S. remaining the most challenged. So the U.S. was down, I think, 13%, broad-based
weakness. Europe was down 20% on broad-based weakness. Asia was down mid-single digits. We had
good strength in EMG in China, and China was positive at plus 3% for us. So -- but all geographies
improved sequentially.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen.

Robert G. Jamieson
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

It's Robert in for Joe this morning. A lot of grass has been covered. I guess, just a quick one on the
structural and variable costs for 4Q. Is there any -- is that pretty evenly split between EIG and EMG? Is
that the way to think about it?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes, yes, it is. It's pretty well split between the 2 groups. EIG is a little bit higher because of the relative
size of it, but it's split based on volume.

Robert G. Jamieson
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then can you provide another update on Gatan's performance so far and how that's been
progressing versus expectations and synergies into next year?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean we met our year 1 profitability targets. We're going to be reviewing that with our Board next
week. We had a very good first year. Team did an excellent job. We had -- we were helped by COVID-
related sales, about half of that business was life sciences. And we also announced the combining of
our Gatan with our EDAX business. They're in similar markets, so we drove excellent synergies. So very
positive. And the K3 camera helps -- helped to solve some of the COVID-related problems being the first
camera to structure the virus. So all very good, and the people at Gatan are very proud of that.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

So David, you talked about -- you reinstated the quarterly guidance, and you mentioned visibility getting
a little better, which is interesting. Some companies aren't willing to say that yet or hesitate into year-
end as there's still a lot of uncertainty. So I guess, where are you seeing across your space? Where are
you feeling more comfortable? Obviously, some areas that, by nature, like military spending, you can only
have better visibility just all the time. But I guess, where do you get more comfortable saying that? And
maybe is this coming from some sort of the conversations you're having with your customers?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. That's a great question, Andrew. And when you think about it, we're getting better at living with the
virus. Our customers are getting better at living with the virus. Our suppliers are getting better at living
with the virus. And there is an uptick in cases, especially in Europe and Western U.S., and we're watching
that closely. But we expect to continue to run as an essential business, and our customers are essential
customers, and they're expecting to continue to run. So business activity levels are continuing to improve.
And even in Europe, when you have some increased lockdowns on certain degrees, essential businesses
are still operating. So that's really the broader context that we use to reinstate guidance. And talking with
our teams, they're confident they can deliver their fourth quarter.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Yes. That's fair. And you talked a lot about -- this quarter about some benefits from COVID and some
COVID-related products. I guess you have a lot going on, on that side. I guess, how much of it do you
think is sustainable demand into 2021? I guess, I mean, how would you characterize sort of a temporary
bump in demand related to those products versus something that might linger into next year and beyond?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. As I said a couple of times, we're not going to talk about next year. We're going to work with our
teams. But in general, we're seeing a pretty substantial improvement quarter-to-quarter. And we'll find out
the details with our teams, but I would expect that improvement trend will continue into next year. And as
I've talked earlier in this call about AMETEK typically has responded positively to deep downturn. So we'll
find that all out. We don't know about the timing. And there may be some COVID-related demand that
falls off, but there's also going to be some demand that was impacted by COVID that's going to improve.
So we'll figure that all out during our budgeting process.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo.

Michael Lawrence McGinn
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Mike on for Allison. I want to go back to the capital allocation discussion. So as you move into these
heavy R&D industries with the bolt-on acquisitions from -- versus maybe more material and direct COGS
industries, is there any discussion on the way you approach and report gross margin, which I believe,
differs from your peer set?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Our cost of sales includes engineering and that's historically how we've done that, and we have not
had a discussion recently of changing that.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Michael Lawrence McGinn
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess, switching to some of your end markets. I believe you have an
Automation & Engineered Solutions platform that was approaching $1.5 billion prior to the downturn. So
I was curious what near-shoring or re-shoring kind of play or theme would look like for you guys in the
businesses that would be most impactful for?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Automation is one of them. Automation did well in the third quarter. It did better than our engineered
services business, and they are seeing that demand. They also saw good strength in China from that. And
when you think about the product that I talked about today from Creaform, that's also product for at-line
metrology. So our automation businesses and our instrumentation businesses are very well positioned to
do -- to improve in an environment that includes re-shoring. We have a lot of products that our customers
use to make their manufacturing more efficient and more productive. So that's kind of in our sweet spot.

Michael Lawrence McGinn
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And so is it fair to say that some of those businesses have a higher Vitality Index than maybe the
legacy AMETEK platform? I believe you said it was like 25% this quarter. Just -- is that where the R&D
focus is now and going forward?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the R&D focus is EIG-biased versus EMG, and the Vitality Index is higher in those kind of
businesses. So that would be a correct view from your viewpoint.
