I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Berkley. Please go ahead, sir.

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Chantel, and good afternoon, all. Thank you for joining us for our Q2 call. We have on the
phone, in addition to myself: Bill Berkley, Executive Chairman; and Rich Baio, Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer. We're going to follow a similar format to what we've done in the past. Rich is going
to lead us through a summary around the numbers and the performance in the quarter. I am then going to
offer a couple of thoughts on the heels of his comments. And then we will be opening it up for questions.

So with that, Rich, if you want to get us started, please.

Richard Mark Baio
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Starting with our premium production, gross premiums written grew 2% to more than $2.1 billion
despite a shrinking economy arising from the global pandemic. The growth was driven by an overall rate
improvement and a comparable historic premium renewal retention ratio that Rob will be discussing
shortly. Offsetting this improvement is a decline in exposures from the economic downturn as well as the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies. Net premiums written of approximately
$1.7 billion was relatively unchanged from the prior year's quarter. The insurance segment decreased 2%
to approximately $1.5 billion primarily due to reduced exposure and rate decline in workers' compensation
as well as higher reinsurance reinstatement premiums. The Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment grew
16.5% to about $200 million in the quarter relating to improving markets. Pretax underwriting income of
$23 million was adversely impacted in the quarter due to approximately $86 million of COVID-19-related
losses. This compares with $100 million for the prior year underwriting income. In addition, we reported
approximately $20 million of catastrophe losses for civil unrest and $40 million for severe weather-related
losses. This brought our total catastrophe losses to approximately $146 million in the quarter or 8.7 loss
ratio points. COVID-19-related losses represented 5.1 of these loss ratio points. The reported loss ratio
was 67.7% in the current quarter, compared with 62.4% in 2019. Prior year loss reserves developed
favorably by $3 million or 0.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter. Accordingly, our current accident
year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 59.2% compared with 61.4% a year ago. The improvement
is driven by lower non-cat property losses and a change in business mix. The expense ratio was 31%,
reflecting a decrease of 0.5% compared with a year ago and the 2019 full year. As we've seen over the
recent quarters, the growth in net premiums earned has outpaced the growth in underwriting expenses,
which has favorably impacted the expense ratio. In addition, due to the global pandemic, expenses are
considerably lower in travel and entertainment, resulting in relatively flat underwriting expenses in dollar
terms quarter-over-quarter. To this end, the impact from COVID-19 may cause some variability in our
expense ratio attributable to normalized operating costs and investments we make in the business. The
accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and COVID-19 for 2020 was 90.2% compared with

W. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2020

92.9% for the prior year. Net investment income decreased to $85 million primarily due to investment
funds. As we mentioned last quarter, the net investment income for investment funds did not reflect the
turmoil in the financial markets due to the one quarter lag. Accordingly, we are recognizing the effects
of the downturn in our second quarter results, which amounted to a loss of $58 million. This decrease
was evident in the energy, financial services and transportation funds. We understand that for modeling
purposes, you may want some direction regarding net investment income for investment funds in the third
quarter. We've not received any estimates yet from the investment fund managers and accordingly, are
unable to provide any guidance at this time.

In addition, a combination of the low interest rate environment and the defensive position we've taken to
enhance our liquidity and shorten our duration to 2.4 years has resulted in lower net investment income in
the current quarter for fixed maturity securities. You'll note that our cash and cash equivalent position has
increased to almost $2.7 billion as of second quarter-end or 13% of net invested assets. We believe this
is prudent given the uncertainty in the financial markets and the economy. The fixed maturity investment
portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, maintained a high credit quality of AA- and reported a
significant recovery in after-tax unrealized gains in the quarter. From the first quarter of 2020, the total
after tax unrealized gain in stockholders' equity improved from an after-tax unrealized loss of $110 million
to an after-tax unrealized gain of $209 million. Pretax net investment gains in the quarter of $78 million
primarily attributable to the change in unrealized gains on equity securities of $62 million and a reduction
in the allowance for expected credit losses on investments of $16 million. The change in fair value on
equity securities is largely driven by Fannie and Freddie preferred stock. The favorable change in the
allowance for expected credit losses is driven by the improved prices on foreign government bonds.

Our net income in the quarter is $71 million or $0.38 per share. Stockholders' equity was approximately
$5.8 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of more than $300 million after share repurchases and
dividends of $117 million. The company repurchased approximately 2 million shares for $96 million at
an average price per share of $49.29. As a result, book value per share increased 7.7% before share
repurchases and dividends. The company had strong cash flow from operations in the quarter of $427
million, which benefited under the Care Act from the deferral of tax payments until July 15. The liquidity is
strong at the holding company with more than $1.5 billion in cash and liquid investments.

At this point, I'll turn it back to Rob.

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Rich. That was great. So a couple of quick comments from me. Clearly, a challenging moment for
all of us on many different levels. Everyone is appropriately very focused on COVID-19. Having said that, I
think we're all struggling with the reality that there are more questions than there are answers. Hopefully,
that will not be the case in the future. Hopefully, the behavior of many people will change, and that will
help us bring the situation more under control. And hopefully, a pharmaceutical solution is not too far in
the distance.

Having said that, while, again, COVID-19 is the topic du jour, I think it's important that we not lose sight
of some of the other realities or factors that are impacting the industry and by extension our business. If
one thinks back to last year, there was a growing groundswell of a firming market. You could probably see
it before 2019, but during '19, it very much came into focus. We saw it accelerate throughout the year,
and we saw it continue to accelerate into 2020, very evident in Q1. The evidence of this was demonstrated
at least in part by business leaving the standard market, make its way to the specialty market and, in
particular, the E&S market. We saw rate increases that we, as an industry, have not seen in some number
of years, and we could see a reduction in capacity that various carriers were offering. All of these things
were being driven, in our opinion, by 2 major factors: one, being a low interest rate environment and
the knock-on effect for what that means for investment income; and number two, loss cost trend in part
driven to -- actually, to a great extent, driven by social inflation, which have been benign for an extended
period of time. And then, in our opinion, crept up on the industry when it was least suspecting it, and it
has proven to be much more of an issue. These drivers that I just referenced remain alive and well. And
quite frankly, I would suggest, if you thought during 2019, interest rates were low, then you must think
that they are really low today. And if in 2019, you were worrying about loss cost trend and inflation --

W. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2020

social inflation, then you probably should be worrying more about it today than you were then. One needs
to be careful that the current circumstance stemming from COVID-19 does not overshadow the underlying
issues that are driving loss cost trend because we expect that this will just be a brief hiatus.

Today, we continue to see business exiting the standard line, making its way to the E&S market and the
specialty market overall. We continue to see a reduction in capacity being offered. And we're certainly
seeing the leverage moving back towards those that are selling the product and in part, we are seeing that
demonstrated by the rate increases that are coming through. And as we referenced in our release, we got
13 points of rate in the quarter. It's worth noting that the rate increases came through without our renewal
retention ratio coming unfastened. Our renewal retention ratio continues to be consistent with what it's
been for not just many quarters, but many years sort of hovering between, I would say, approximately
80%.

In addition to that, another data point that we've shared with you all in the past is our new business
relativity metric, where we measure the rate that we are getting on new business compared to our
renewal business. For the quarter, it came in at 1.084%. What does that mean? That means we are
getting 8.4% more rate on new business than our renewal business, and that is something that we look
for and expect because you know more about your renewal book than new business. These factors have
allowed us to maintain a top line. While we have not been able to grow at the same rate that we did in Q1
or that when we were doing our planning, we thought we would be growing in Q2. We were still able to
maintain a top line. And in addition to that, I would add that when we do see an economy that begins to
open up again and recover, which hopefully is in the foreseeable future, it is likely that, that will have a
very meaningful positive effect on our top line when you combine growth in the overall economy with what
we are able to achieve on the rate front, along with business making its way into the specialty market.

Let me give you a little more granularity on a couple of lines of business and how we see the pricing and
the competitive nature. I think as it's widely understood, the property market rates continue to move up.
The larger the account, generally speaking, the more the rates are moving up. Similar story on the GL
front. I would tell you that the excess and umbrella market very much stands out. And quite frankly, both
of these product lines need the rate that they are getting and probably more. Professional liability, it's a
very broad spectrum. I would tell you, virtually all components of the professional space, we are seeing
rates moving up. Public D&O, particularly on the large accounts, continues to stand out. And we have
gotten to the point where we are getting rate on rate in a meaningful way. And I, again, would suggest
that the industry needs every last penny. As it relates to workers' compensation, which has been marching
to the beat of its own drum, most other commercial lines products, we have been seeing some level of
rate for some number of quarters, comp has been moving in a different direction. We are seeing early
signs that workers' compensation pricing may be in the early stages of bottoming out. And I would not be
surprised as we make our way into 2021, if you started to see a change in trend and rates actually start to
move up at some point next year. Lastly, the reinsurance market, clearly, has been waiting, give or take,
I don't know, call it, 1.5 decades for perhaps the moment that is upon us. Things are firming. We'll have
to see how much discipline really returns to that market. As we see that disciplined return, you will see us
grow our reinsurance division more and more and certainly, it may have an impact on how much business
we choose to seed to the marketplace.

Rich did a nice job, as always, covering the loss ratio, I just want to tack on a couple of quick observations
around that. One, as it relates to COVID, the number, both that we put aside for COVID in Q1 and now in
Q2, when you total that up, approximately 75% is sitting in IBNR or approximately 1/4 is either paid or
cased with lion's share of it available for incurred, but not reported. I'd also make the comment around a
topic that has been widely discussed, and that is what is the impact, at least in the short run, of COVID-19
on loss activity? I don't think anyone knows with certainty what it is going to be when the dust settles,
but certain -- without a doubt, there are product lines that have found themselves in a situation where
frequency is considerably down. Shouldn't be a surprise to any of us, given people sheltering in place and
the slowdown in the economy. Having said that, it is our expectation that when the economy opens back
up, you will see frequency return to a more normal level. I should also mention on this front as a result of
what we're seeing with frequency, our actual versus expected continues to run more benign or the actual
has proven to be less than the expected as far as loss activity in many lines. Most of those lines are longer
tail in nature, few are shorter tail. Shorter tail, for example, auto physical damage or property, as Rich

W. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2020

referenced in his comments. The line's share of our business is on design loss ratios. So even when we
have a reduction in loss activity, specifically stemming from a reduction in frequency, that is not reflected
in our reported numbers because we, again, book the business on a design loss ratio, which we hold for
some period of time as those reserves season out.

Pivoting over to the expenses. Rich covered this well, I would just offer the observation as far as
the expense ratio benefiting in the quarter, I would tell you that, give or take, probably 75% of the
improvement comes from higher earned premium with the balance coming from, we just don't have
people getting on trains, buses, planes or staying in hotels. And obviously, there are some savings
associated with that. My opinion is that it's fair to assume that the company continues in a normalized
number running somewhere between 31% and 32%. I'm not going to belabor the discussion around
the investment portfolio, again, Rich covered that, but I would offer a couple of thoughts briefly. The
investment portfolio is something that we view very clearly through a lens that we think about as risk-
adjusted return. There is a huge amount of uncertainty in the world today. And from our perspective, we
have reached the conclusion, I should say, that it is better to take a defensive posture. We have had a
duration that has been shortening for some period of time. And we have, quite frankly, not seen much
of a reason, given where rates are, to take that back out, so there is a limit. And as far as quality goes,
we have gone from what I would define as a moderate AA- to a very strong AA-. I was chatting with a
colleague earlier today, half of our portfolio can get reduced by a notch, and we will remain a AA-.

I think this brings us to one last point that I'd like to make, and then I promise we'll get on to your
questions. When we think about the business, including the investment portfolio, we think about it as
owners. We don't think about it as people that collect the paycheck every 2 weeks. We think about it with
a long-term view and a sense of obligation and commitment as if we, as a team, 6,500 of us, own this
business. We think about risk-adjusted return. We think about the uncertainties there are in the world,
and we have made an active decision that this is a moment that we are willing to pay the price for taking
a defensive posture and for having flexibility given the unknown.
So let me pause there and, Chantel, if we could please open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. And I guess, the attritional loss ratio, particularly on the insurance business side, felt like it had a nice
improvement. In my mind, part of the rationale may have been the slower frequency that we've seen on
the heels of the economic slowdown given COVID. And it feels like, Rob, in your prepared remarks, that
wasn't the case. And it sounds like most of the...

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Actually, the way I would characterize it that there certainly was some benefit as a result of the slowdown.
But please, again, understand that much of the difference in actual versus expected or things -- or the
reduction in frequency does not come through in our reported numbers. So you will see the impact on
the auto physical damage front of fewer cars, trucks, et cetera, on the road, but you're not going to see
that on the auto liability. You will see that, again, on the property, but you're not going to see that on the
comp or the GL, et cetera. So in Rich's comments, he referenced that one of the contributing factors was
non-cat property. And it was, quite frankly, in my opinion, there are a couple of different reasons within
the non-cat property that we had this result. One of them has to do with some re-underwriting that we've
been doing over some period of time, and that has come through. But I would tell you that -- go ahead.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Is there any way you can help us kind of conceptualize the frequency benefit versus price versus trend?
And I think the third metric that you had mentioned was a mix of business.

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

So I would tell you that there are a couple of things at work here. First of all, I think we all have a sense
that frequency for many product lines is down considerably given the environment. Number two, I think
the other piece that should not go unnoticed is that the rate increases that we have been getting for some
period of time now that are no longer just on a written basis but are hitting our earned, are meaningful.
And I think if you look at our mix of business, which we disclose in lots of public information and you can
get a bit of a glimpse into that in the release, I forget which page it is, but where we show the mix of
business, you can see the different product lines and how much of our portfolio would fall under shorter
tail products, where that would be coming through in our P&L now versus longer tail that would be on a
design loss ratio where you would not see an impact of any consequence on a reported basis.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And just one more for me. It felt like if we think back a couple of years ago, interest rates
were heading lower. There was reinvestment pressures for the portfolios. But it didn't have an impact to
pricing. Does it feel like reinvestment rates -- has something changed? Has rates just dropped below a
point where they are now a lever to pricing, I guess?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Well, I think clearly, rates are notably lower now than they were after the financial crisis or the Great
Recession or whatever you'd like to label it. They're extraordinarily low. In addition to that, we clearly
have a federal reserve and counterparts around the world that seem very determined to manage interest
rates for at least the moment, at least as long as they can. And finally, you got to remember that an
insurance company, ultimately, it takes time for that book yield to come down as the new money gets

W. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2020

invested at lower rates. So from my perspective, I think we're hitting new lows as far as interest rates.
And I think ultimately, it will take a little bit of time, but we're starting to see the early stages of it actually
having an impact where it's going to hit investment income. But that takes time because it's the new
money.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

First question. Regarding the COVID-related losses, and I appreciate the stat on 75% IBNR, just curious if
there's any more color you can offer on the newly available information or legal developments that arose,
so we can kind of better understand whether there's potential for that to persist in a meaningful way in
the back half of the year?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

So the work that we have done, and obviously, we're in a much better position to try and get our arms
around it now than we were when we were talking to you, give or take, 90 days ago. But given the work
we have done, by and large, we are assuming that this is going to be more under control by, call it, the
end of this year, early next year. And the -- as far as the activity, again, there hasn't been a huge amount.
There's not a lot paid, let -- or for that matter, in case reserves, the line's share of it is just sitting there in
IBNR. And it's just our best estimates as to what we think the impact could be. From our perspective so
far, workers' compensation has not proven to be a big issue and neither has casualty. The challenge has
more been in the shorter tail lines. And probably some -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I
would say the biggest component of that is event cancellation.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Understood. That's helpful. Moving to the top line growth conversation, it feels like what you're
trying to say is that clearly, your fortunes will be tied to the economy. Hopefully, the economy improves.
Although there seems to be some other variables, the comps declined by 20% year-over-year. So anything
else we should be thinking about in terms of 2Q being the nadir versus ongoing choppiness?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the way we think about it is that the opportunity to make sure that we have rate adequacy
continues to be there, and you can see that in the rate that we are getting. We are an underwriting shop
and rate adequacies, the be-all-and-end-all, when we see it in certain product lines where the rate is not
what we think it needs to be, i.e., in certain parts of the workers' comp market, we're prepared to let the
business go with the understanding it'll be back someday when we find the rates to be more acceptable.
The broad point that I was trying to suggest earlier in the call was, we are able to maintain our top line
because we're seeing the flow of business coming in to the specialty E&S market. We're able to maintain
our top line because we are getting meaningful rate increases and in spite of the challenges that everyone
faces, including us, none of us are completely insulated from what's going on in the economy and society
in general, those factors are helping to offset those challenges. And in addition to that, if you subscribe as
we do, this will be, over time, brought under control. A lot of the fundamentals will remain in place, the
economy will recover and it is likely to bode very well for how this business could grow, in addition to that,
what it may mean for margins.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And I guess, finally, we saw that you continued to buy back some stock during the
quarter. Any thoughts on the stocks, somewhat recovered? Any thoughts on whether you still view the
stock as being attractive from a buyback perspective?

W. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2020

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

So I appreciate the question, but we're not going to answer that the way you want us to. But I'm happy to
pause, my boss is on the phone, he's the one who's more focused on that than me. Are you there?

William R. Berkley
Executive Chairman of the Board

I'm here. And of course, we always think the stock is attractive. It's attractive today. However, we are
always looking at uses of our capital, what we can do with it, how buying back stock impacts everything
having to do with our shareholders. We don't have a single rule. We -- our average price in the first
quarter was different than in the second quarter. It's the judgments we make and how we see the
opportunities, so we don't really have a single rule. And if there's an opportunity that we think at that
moment in time is to buy stock at an attractive price, we'll do so. But we don't really have a rule per se.

Operator

Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.

Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question just goes to better understanding IBNR. What I did not realize in the first quarter was
that there are some definitional differences there. And just want to make sure I understand how you're
thinking about it. So when we talk about incurred but not reported, do you also include losses for events
that have not yet occurred, but you think have a high probability of occurring?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

We have looked at -- so I appreciate the question, and let me try and clarify it. We look at our portfolio,
we look at our exposures, we think about how it will be affected by COVID. And that's how we came up
with our number. So some of it is events or losses that have not even occurred, but the exposure is out
there, and we think that there's a possibility that there could be a loss associated with the exposure.

Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And is that mainly for short-tail lines? Or is that also for longer tail lines...

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

We have looked at the full portfolio.

Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then my second question, a bit more broad, conceptual, on social inflation. Can you maybe
talk about how it's manifesting itself today, it doesn't seem like it's COVID-related, given that you're
expecting more of the losses to come from short-tail lines. So where -- or how is it playing out in the
current environment?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Well, I think in some ways, it is COVID-related, and I think you're going to see it potentially in the
professional liability space. An example of that would be with EPLI would be certainly 1 specific example.
I think there is a reality that we have an emboldened plaintiff bar. And we have an environment in society
overall that is more empathetic for the moment to the plaintiff bar. And that is a reality, whether one likes
it or not. And the insurance industry needs to recognize that and adapt appropriately.

So is that also reflected in, for example, business interruption claims?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Well, I think that we have an aggressive plaintiff bar. And as I think we may have touched on in the last
call, certainly, they have viewed business interruption as an opportunity. I think perhaps, it's a plaintiff-
friendly environment overall. I don't think that judges are willing to just completely turn their back on
the words in a contract or a policy, which is why you have seen many of the rulings, though it is still
early, come out suggesting that physical damage is required in order to trigger business interruption. And
in spite of the efforts so far to suggest the presence or possible presence of COVID-19 being physical
damage. Most of the judges that I'm aware of have not subscribed to that view.

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Rob, I want to go a little bit deeper into what you just talked about with the exposure for lines like EPLI to
increase COVID-related losses. I appreciate the fact that there's no -- that you're not booking lower loss
picks for lines of business where claim counts were down, frequency was down in the second quarter. Are
there any increased provisions for lines where now the reality has changed? And maybe social inflation, et
cetera, makes things worse?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

We -- every 90 days, we look at our loss picks. And we look at the data, and we try and assess whether
we feel as though we are in a good place. Our general philosophy is that we want to try and air a little bit
on the side of caution, recognizing all the unknowns. And as those reserves season out, we will tighten up
that pick. We don't always get it right, but we certainly try. And when we get it wrong, we're not shy about
acknowledging it and trying to address it. So as far as the specifics of what we're doing with our picks by
product line, that's generally speaking, just not something that we get into at that level of granularity.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. Maybe a different question. In the past, I think we've worked or I've worked under the
premise that economic inflection points take 3 to 6 months to actually impact written premium volumes.
Does that make sense? Does that make sense in the current environment? Can we expect maybe if --
we're seeing if recovery continues right now that exposure units have already bottomed?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

I think one of the tricky parts is it really have things bottomed out as far as the recovery, if you talk
to people in New York, they might say, yes, if you talk to people in Florida or Texas or Arizona or parts
of California, I don't think that they would say yes. So ultimately, we -- in the New York area, we had
our experience. Hopefully, we won't have another, but we should not lose sight of what the recent
circumstances in other regions of the country are facing, and for that matter, parts of the world. So my
opinion is that, it would seem as we saw things looking better in June than they did in May. And May was
maybe less ugly than April. And certainly, early returns for July were encouraging, but we'll have to see.
So I'm a little bit guarded to suggest that things are recovering. As far as the lead time, it can be a couple
of months, yes.

W. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2020

A couple of questions for you. Just one, could you talk a little bit about what's going on with terms and
conditions right now and what the industry is doing? And related to that, specifically, is there anything
you're doing to protect yourself from, call it, third-party liability claims, and you just mentioned EPLI stuff
as we kind of look forward and people go back to work and economy, those kind of things?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Yes. So as far as what are we doing to protect ourselves? We are actively looking at our policy wordings.
And we are looking to make sure that the policy wordings appropriately address things such as
communicable disease and related types of exposures. There are some exposures where we're very
focused on making sure that communicable disease is excluded. There are some situations where we use
a much finer brush than that. But we've been -- actually been a bit surprised that the broader market
has not been more active in trying to make sure that they are managing their exposure to communicable
disease in general and in particular, COVID. I think people were so consumed by what was going on with
business interruption, they haven't thought through what does it mean for the liability market, both
casualty as well as professional. And I think that that's something that the industry needs to be more
actively grappling with because there is real exposure there, to your point, as things open back up. As far
as what do we see happening with wordings, certainly, we are seeing policy wordings tighten up, just the
mere fact that business is making its way from the standard market to the specialty or the E&S market,
I think is a leading indicator that policy wordings are tightening up and coverage that is being provided is
contracting a bit. So that -- I hope I answered your question or questions.

Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. That's very helpful. And then my second question, Rob, conceptually thinking about this. AA corporate
bond yields, we see you're kind of looking at AA corporate bond yields as kind of your new money yield
right now that you're looking at, it's the lowest it's been since I've been working, right? So as I look at
where we are right now, is the pricing environment adequate enough to, I guess, one, earn a double-digit
return on equity? Or even two, just earn your equity cost of capital at this point?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

We think with the rate increases that we are getting...

Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

That the market is getting, yes.

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Yes. And again, I can't speak for others. I don't know their business, their portfolio, but for us, with the
rate increases that we're getting today, we certainly think we are comfortably above our cost of capital.
And I -- based on my math, we are comfortably in the double-digit space as far as return goes. But there
is no doubt we need that rate. The comments that I made earlier about the impact of this low interest
rate environment and what it means for investment income and what it means for the industry's economic
model, that is real, and we are very focused on it.

Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So just a couple of questions, more investment related than insurance related, I guess, I see that you're
moving the money to cash and you're shortening the portfolio. Should we expect that the 2Q traditional
investment portfolio result is a good indicator of where the future is going to be until you decide to
redeploy that cash again?

W. R. BERKLEY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2020

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Sorry, Josh, could you ask the second part of the question again? You broke up a little bit. I beg your
pardon.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I'm sorry. Should we assume that the 2Q result for traditional investment income is sort of a good
guidepost to think about until you decide to redeploy the cash that you're stock holding right now?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Yes. Obviously, putting aside funds as far as the core portfolio.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. And can you just talk a little bit about the results in the arbitrage portfolio for the quarter?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

They had a particularly strong quarter. Part of it was some of their traditional activities. Part of it has to do
with some activities they participate in, surrounding specs.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And that as onetime in nature, the $58 million loss in LP, we shouldn't expect, there's a change in how
you're deploying and that could continue into the future?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

As much as I wish it was a new normal, I don't think you should assume that's the case.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And can you -- just we don't get the number, can we know what the reinsurance recoverable was for
the quarter?

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

I honestly, I don't have that in front of me, but either Rich or Karen will make that available. They'll both
follow-up with you, if you don't mind.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

No problem. Fantastic. And good luck and be safe.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Berkley for closing
remarks.

W. Robert Berkley, Jr.;President, CEO & Director

Okay. Thank you, Chantel, and thank you all for dialing in. Obviously, challenging times and a fair amount
of uncertainty. But hopefully, from our discussion today, you have a sense for how the business is well
positioned. From our perspective, we are well positioned in order to weather the circumstances that we
are navigating through. Even more so, we are well positioned to take advantage of a market when we
come out the other side of the tunnel. So I think that is all for us. We will look forward to speaking with
you in 90 days. Thank you again, Chantel. Have a good night.
