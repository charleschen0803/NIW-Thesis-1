INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and thank standing by. Welcome to today's International Paper Fourth Quarter and Full
Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Guillermo Gutierrez.
Please go ahead, sir.

Guillermo Gutierrez
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining International Paper's Fourth Quarter and Full
Year 2020 Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer; and Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal
disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to
risks and uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP
financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is available on our
website.

Our website also contains copies of the fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings press release and
today's presentation slides.

Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, Slide 2 also provides context around
the financial information and statistical measures presented on those investments.

I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3 with full year
2020 results.

The way International Paper navigated the impacts of the pandemic in 2020 reaffirms my admiration and
appreciation for our employees and their ongoing commitment to take care of each other and to take care
of our customers. I'm really proud of the outstanding collaboration across our commercial, supply chain
and manufacturing teams to adapt to our customers' rapidly changing needs. We ran our manufacturing
system well and leveraged the flexibility of our mill and converting systems to overcome significant
challenges due to the pandemic while managing costs extremely well across our 3 businesses.

Looking at our performance, International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow
in 2020. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow and delivered the company's 11th consecutive year of
value-creating returns. Our performance demonstrates the strength and resilience of our employees, our
diverse customer base and our world-class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.

Given the significant of economic uncertainty, we took prudent and early actions to reinforce cash
generation and enhance our financial strength. On capital allocation, we're making choices consistent with
our capital allocation framework. We repaid $1.7 billion of debt to further strengthen our balance sheet.
We're also seeing significant benefits in our pension plan from the actions that we took to derisk the plan
during the past few years, which contributed to a 95% funding level at year-end 2020. Also in 2020, we
returned $800 million to our shareholders, and we continued to invest in our North American and EMEA
corrugated packaging business to enhance our capabilities and grow our earnings.

We're really excited about the path we're charting to build a better IP. We're building on the strength of
our corrugated packaging business and taking meaningful actions to drive sustainable, profitable growth

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

and accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders. In a few minutes, I'll discuss some of
the initiatives we have underway to deliver on our commitment.

Turning to the full year results on Slide 4. We delivered EBITDA of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3
billion. Lower year-over-year sales was driven by the decline in Printing Papers demand due to market
disruptions from global pandemic. Earnings were impacted by lower demand for paper as well as lower
average pricing for the packaging of cellulose fibers. These headwinds were partially offset by strong
volume growth in our packaging business, outstanding cost management and lower maintenance outage
expense. In 2020, we made choices around plant maintenance and other spending priorities to mitigate
the impact of market disruptions.

Our equity earnings were $77 million, including $48 million from our Ilim joint venture, which was
impacted by challenging pulp markets and a noncash foreign exchange loss of $50 million. For the full
year, we received $141 million in dividends from Ilim. Across International Paper, we proactively managed
cash levers to deliver another year of outstanding cash generation.

Moving to Slide 5. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we established 3 principles to focus on what
we needed to do as a company to remain strongly resilient for all of our stakeholders. First was to keep
our employees and contractors safe, second was to take care of our customers and third was to maintain
the financial strength of the company. I believe International Paper executed extremely well against that
success criteria. We did not experience any material operational disruptions due to COVID-19 while taking
care of our customers.

It all starts with our employees, and their health and safety remains our most important responsibility. Our
performance reaffirms my appreciation for our 48,000 employees worldwide. We recognized our teams
financially for their tenacity, commitment and resilience with a bonus totaling $25 million in the fourth
quarter.

I'm also proud of the work we're doing to support the critical needs in our communities, which included
the donation of 2 million corrugated boxes to agencies that have delivered essential food and supplies. We
remain absolutely committed to our COVID-19 principles, and we'll continue to focus on what we need to
do to further strengthen the company for all of our stakeholders in the short term and in the long term.

Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our first quarter outlook. Tim?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6, which shows our year-over-year operating
earnings bridge.

Our 2020 results reflect strong execution and effective cost management to mitigate the impact of market
disruptions associated with COVID-19.

Looking at the bridge, price and mix were a significant headwind mostly due to the full year impact
of 2019 index movements in our North American packaging business as well as lower average pricing
in cellulose fibers and the Printing Papers business. Volume was a drag on earnings due to the
unprecedented decline in demand for printing papers. The impact was partly offset by strong volume in
our packaging business driven by higher demand across most consumer segments.

We managed operations and costs well in a challenging environment with no material operational
disruptions due to COVID-19. Our teams performed at a high level under reconfigured work systems to
protect our employees and contractors. We did experience higher operating and distribution costs in the
latter part of the year as we flexed our system to meet very strong packaging demand.

Input costs were favorable for the full year driven by lower wood, energy cost and distribution costs, partly
offset by higher recovered fiber costs. I would also note that costs for wood, recovered fiber, energy and
distribution increased in the fourth quarter.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Corporate items were favorable driven by outstanding cost management and lower interest expense based
on significant debt reduction.

For the full year 2020, our operational tax rate was 25% compared to 26% in 2019.

And equity earnings decreased due to the lower Ilim earnings, which includes $0.13 of unfavorable FX
impact.

Turning now to Slide 7, which shows our fourth quarter results. Operating earnings were $0.75 per share,
which includes a $0.05 impact related to the employee recognition bonus that Mark discussed earlier.

Sales improved sequentially and came in better than our expectations driven by strong demand in our
North American packaging business.

EBITDA decreased due to the higher operating and input cost.

As already mentioned, we generated robust free cash flow, which we'll continue to apply in a manner
consistent with our capital allocation framework.

In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by about $600 million, bringing our full year 2020 debt reduction to
$1.7 billion.

Turning to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 8. Fourth quarter operating earnings were
$0.75. Looking at the bridge, lower price/mix was driven by prior period price flow-through in packaging
and cellulose fibers.

Volume was favorable driven mostly by strong demand in corrugated packaging in North America and
EMEA as well as higher seasonal demand for papers in Brazil and Russia.

Operations and costs were a significant headwind in the quarter. We experienced some reliability issues in
our North American containerboard system, most of which are behind us now. We also experienced higher
marginal operating and distribution costs to meet very strong packaging demand.

We had a $20 million asset write-off in cellulose fibers in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, our
sequential earnings were impacted by the non-repeat of $30 million of favorable items in the third quarter.

I'd also like to note that the employee recognition bonus is reflected in operations and costs, which was
allocated to each business.

Input costs were unfavorable due to higher wood and recovered fiber, higher seasonal energy costs and
higher distribution costs. We're experiencing significant rail, truck and ocean transportation congestion.
And we expect recovered fiber and distribution costs to trend higher as we enter 2021.

Higher corporate expenses reflects the effective tax rate of 26% in the fourth quarter as compared to 19%
in the third quarter, which included a favorable adjustment after finalizing our 2019 tax returns.

Equity earnings includes a noncash foreign exchange gain of $0.05 in the fourth quarter for Ilim as
compared to a $0.14 loss in the third quarter.

Let me turn to the segments now, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 9. Volume improved
sequentially across all regions, with strong demand in North America outpacing the impact of the 3 less
shipping days in the fourth quarter. We're seeing broad-based demand strength across all of our channels,
including boxes, sheets and containerboard.

Just about every consumer segment accelerated in the fourth quarter.

We continue to see strong, double-digit growth in e-commerce, and we believe the vast majority of e-
commerce adoption is permanent. We're also seeing strong demand for consumer and durable goods,
especially for building materials. Foodservice categories continued to lag, and the pace of recovery will
depend on the restaurant and travel industry recovery. Export containerboard demand is also robust. We

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

have strong backlogs as we have prioritized containerboard shipments to our integrated system here in
North America to meet our customers' demands.

Operations and costs were a significant headwind due to several factors. We experienced some isolated
reliability issues late in the quarter, most of which are now behind us. We also faced higher costs in our
mill and box system to meet the strong demand, including the impact of less optimal containerboard
sourcing to our box plants. We also experienced higher supply chain costs and overtime with just about
every box plant running on weekends. And lastly, recall that ops and costs includes the employee bonus
we discussed earlier, which for packaging represents about $15 million.

Maintenance and outage costs improved sequentially as planned. Input costs increased driven by higher
recovered fiber, seasonal energy and distribution costs. Cost pressure for recovered fiber and distribution
continued as we entered the first quarter, which reflects the broad strength in demand that we're seeing.

Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 10. Price and mix was unfavorable on the contract flow-through
of lower third quarter list price. Volume was stable. Demand for fluff pulp improved late in the fourth
quarter following the expected destocking. Operations and costs were impacted by a $20 million write-
off of capital and engineering costs following a review of the capital investment needs for the business.
Maintenance outage costs increased and input costs were essentially flat.

Taking a closer look at fluff pulp demand. As I mentioned, demand improved throughout the fourth
quarter. Demand continued to improve as we entered 2021 with healthy backlogs for fluff pulp. In
addition, port congestion is stretching supply chains due to the high levels of imports in the U.S.

Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 11. The business delivered earnings of $80 million in the fourth
quarter with continued strong cash generation. Our North American, Brazilian and Russian regions
delivered returns above the cost of capital. We continue to leverage our strong brands, our world-class
customer service and our low-cost system to maximize performance as we navigate a challenging demand
environment.

Looking at the fourth quarter performance across the segment, price and mix was stable. Volume
improved sequentially across all regions with stronger seasonal demand in Brazil and Russia. We're seeing
a gradual recovery in demand across all regions, which we expect will accelerate with broader return-to-
office and return-to-school activity.

Operations and costs includes higher seasonal energy consumption and the non-repeat of favorable
items in the third quarter of about $10 million. Fixed cost absorption improved with economic downtime
decreasing by nearly 100,000 tons sequentially. Maintenance outages increased, as expected, and input
costs increased primarily due to higher transportation and seasonal energy costs.

Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 12. The joint venture delivered $53 million in equity earnings in the
fourth quarter with an EBITDA margin of nearly 30% on improved commercial performance. Volume
improved 16% year-over-year on strong softwood pulp exports. Price and mix was also favorable with
price realization for softwood accelerating in the fourth quarter.

Fourth quarter equity earnings include a foreign exchange gain on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt,
of which IP's aftertax portion was $22 million or $0.05 per share. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was
$519 million, which represents a 26% margin. Full year 2020 equity earnings were $48 million, which
includes a $50 million foreign exchange loss on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt.

Although 2020 was a challenging year across global pulp markets, Ilim's strong operational performance
and low-cost system make it a powerful cash generator. We expect to receive about $100 million in
dividends from Ilim in 2021.

Moving to Slide 13. As Mark said in his opening remarks, we generated outstanding free cash flow of $2.3
billion in 2020. In our first quarter earnings call last year, we highlighted the company's financial flexibility
and some of the cash levers we had available to enhance our cash generation. Given the significant
economic uncertainty, we chose to pull some of those cash levers to reinforce the company's financial
strength.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

We executed well on the things that impacted cash. In addition, COVID-19 changed the way we worked
in 2020 and the choices that we made around our plant maintenance and other spending priorities. In
the fourth quarter, we also benefited from a tax refund claim, which contributed $115 million to free cash
flow. Our early actions and strong execution across the company enabled us to deliver another year of
outstanding free cash flow generation.

Turning to Slide 14. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in 2020 and
provide clarity on what you can expect from International Paper as we move forward.

We will maintain a strong balance sheet, and we're committed to our current investment-grade rating with
a targeted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.8x on a Moody's basis.

We're very pleased with the progress we made on the balance sheet, debt and pension in 2020. We repaid
$1.7 billion of debt, and our pension gap improved by $500 million.

Our pension plan is sufficiently funded. We closed 2020 with a healthy 95% funding level, and we feel
really good about the actions we have taken over the past few years to derisk the plan.

We closed 2020 at 2.9x leverage. We're in a much better place, and we're committed to getting to our
target range.

Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In 2020, we
returned $800 million to shareowners. Over the past 5 years, we've returned nearly $5.2 billion to
shareowners through dividends and share repurchases or just over 50% of our free cash flow.

We remain committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend with a target range of 40% to 50% of
free cash flow, which we review annually as earnings and cash flow grow. And we will continue evaluating
our free cash flow and intrinsic value to ensure that share repurchase opportunities are weighed against
other capital allocation options, always with a commitment to maximize value creation.

Investment excellence is essential, growing earnings and cash. We expect CapEx in 2021 to be around
$800 million. We will continue to proactively manage CapEx and have the ability to increase or pull back as
circumstances warrant. You can expect strategic capital to be deployed mostly to our packaging business
to build out capability and capacity needs to drive profitable growth.

We will continue to assess disciplined and selective M&A opportunities to supplement our goal of
accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our
packaging business in North America and Europe.

Continuing on Slide 14, I want to provide an update on the 2006 timber monetization installment notes.
After careful consideration, we've decided not to extend the notes. When these notes mature in August of
2021, we expect to receive $630 million in cash, which represents our equity. We expect to pay about $75
million in taxes upon maturity of the timber notes.

Now I'll turn to Slide 15 and our first quarter outlook. Demand for corrugated packaging is very strong as
we entered the first quarter. Demand for fluff pulp accelerated in the fourth quarter, and that momentum
continues in the first quarter.

In Printing Papers, we're seeing a modest recovery in demand, but challenges will likely persist until we
see a broad-based return to offices and schools.

Taking a closer look at Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $65 million on the
realization of our November 2020 price increase. Volume is expected to be flat sequentially with strong
box demand offset by 1 less shipping day in the first quarter. Operations and costs are expected to
improve by $35 million.

Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $87 million,
and then the costs are expected to increase by $30 million mostly due to higher recovered fiber and
distribution cost.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $15 million on realization of prior price
movements. Volume is expected to be stable. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $35
million, maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $6 million and input costs are expected
to increase by $10 million mostly due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs.

Turning to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to decrease by $15
million on lower seasonal demand in Latin America and Russia. Operations and costs are expected to
improve by $15 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $2 million, and input
costs are expected to increase by $10 million, again mostly due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs.

And under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture.

Coming back to plant maintenance outage expense, for the full year 2021, we plan $155 million of higher
expenses. This increase includes deferrals we chose to make in our packaging mill system to meet strong
customer demand as well as the impact of higher coal maintenance outages across the system.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Tim. I'm on Slide 16 now.

As we shared with you in December, we are taking meaningful actions to build a better IP and accelerate
profitable growth with a focus on corrugated packaging. We're committed to deliver $350 million to $400
million in incremental earnings by the end of 2023.

As part of our commitment, we will deliver $50 million to $100 million of incremental annual earnings
growth in our businesses through commercial execution and investment excellence. We'll also deliver $300
million of structural cost reduction.

We have initiatives underway in 3 areas. First, we will streamline and simplify our organization to support
a packaging-focused company with a more focused geographic footprint.

Second, we will redesign processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs in areas such as maintenance
and reliability, distribution and logistics and sourcing.

And third, we are identifying opportunities to better optimize our fleet of assets to make the right products
on the right assets to further improve our cost position and to be more efficient with our capital.

As we move forward, we will be sharing with you the multiple streams of earnings initiatives we have
underway and when you should expect to see them enhance our earnings. Today, let me describe one of
the key enablers to delivering on our process and asset optimization cost savings. And as you noticed on
the slide, that area accounts for about 70% our structural cost reduction target.

We will use new approaches that leverage technology and data analytics in our businesses. We established
a dedicated team that's been working closely with external partners and our businesses over the past year
to identify, develop and pilot a wide range of highly attractive opportunities, which are now moving to
scaled implementation.

Turning to Slide 17. You can see a few areas where we're using data to provide greater visibility and
actionable insights. These tools enable new approaches to optimize our value chain, from our mills to our
box plants and ultimately to our customers. We expect these initiatives to deliver between $150 million
and $200 million in annual earnings improvement. We are making excellent progress scaling up several of
these initiatives and expect to realize about half of these benefits in 2022.

Let me give you a few examples of what this looks like. We will use real-time data to optimize production
scheduling across our box plants in North America. Although many of the benefits result in lower costs
across our system, we'll also gain low-cost incremental capacity in our box system to pursue profitable

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

growth with very little incremental capital. We're also using third-party logistics technology to optimize
transportation planning and reduce distribution costs in our box plants.

In our mills, we'll use continuous online monitoring and data analytics to improve fiber, chemical and
energy consumption. In addition, online equipment monitoring will also enable us to predict potential
equipment failures, improve reliability and reduce our overall maintenance costs.

And in sourcing, we have greater visibility and more effective tools across a broader set of our
procurement activities. We'll use internal and external data to develop a more targeted catalog of sourcing
options to drive savings in operating and repair materials.

Working with our external partners, our team is moving quickly to scale these opportunities and integrate
them into our business processes. The team is also working closely with our businesses to identify more
opportunities.

Let me close on Slide 18. Our 2020 performance adds to my confidence in the path we're charting to
build a better IP. We're motivated by the opportunities we have to accelerate value creation for our
shareowners.

Now I'm mindful that we're still in the midst of a global pandemic and there's still significant uncertainty.
International Paper's strengthened resilience endures. We're proud of the essential nature of our products
that we make. Our employees have demonstrated a commitment to take care of each other and our
customers, and that commitment continues.

Our customers can count on International Paper to be there for them and deliver superior solutions. And
our communities can count us to be responsible partners to improve the lives of the people who depend
on us.

We have an exciting and ambitious agenda. We will continue to focus on what we need to do to further
strengthen the company in the short term and in the long term for all of our stakeholders.
With that, we are ready to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

How should we think about inflation when we think about 2021, particularly some of these bigger buckets
you called out that's a little more volatile whether it's freight and OCC? And certainly, really good to see
operation costs improve sequentially. But are there any costs like distribution, for example, that we should
be expecting to be more elevated just given how strong demand is?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

So we think about inflation in a couple of ways. We have the general inflation of employee wage increases
and general materials and operating materials. And that roughly runs around $200 million a year for us. It
can be a little bit more, a little bit less.

On the input side, of course, we track those quarter-by-quarter, and it's really driven by what's happening
in the market. So in the moment, given transportation, we see that as a bit of a headwind just given
the economic activity that we're experiencing across the country. Spot rates on truck are elevated. As I
mentioned in the speaker notes, congestion across most of the transportation modes. So we'll have to see
how it plays out.

And some of it is driven marginally by just the incremental demand growth that we're seeing in the
moment and sourcing transportation to make sure we get it to customers on time. So yes, it's a bit of a
headwind.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then I noticed that most of your maintenance downtime, particularly in your
corrugated segment in North America, was going to be first half loaded. It sounds like demand is still
really strong and market is pretty tight to begin with. So I just want to get some comfort on do you have
enough inventory to kind of meet demand? And give us a little flavor how lead times and backlogs are
looking right now.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Well, we've got long backlogs, extended backlogs in the export channel. As we mentioned, we've been
pivoting and prioritizing that to the North American market through our integrated system.

I would say our inventories are lean right now, and we will manage our outages accordingly to balance
outage time and customer demand and the need for more. But we ran very lean in the back half of 2020,
and we still see pressure.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Mark, Tim, hope that you all are well.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Gabe.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I was -- I guess the first question would be on industrial volume trends. And I think from the outlook
in terms of flat, it would seem to imply kind of 1.5% growth directionally on a per-day basis. Can you
comment at all as sort of what you're seeing currently and then, given the difficult March comp, how you
would kind of expect that to progress just given what you're seeing in your backlogs?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

We're continuing, Dave, to see the kinds of demand profile we saw in the fourth quarter continue through
the month of January. We expect -- based on the backlogs we have based on our conversations with our
customers, even though the comps are going to be harder starting in March, we expect on an absolute
basis a really strong market. And that's why it's really critical that we manage what Phil was asking about,
which is the supply we have available of containerboard and box plant capacity with the demand we're
going to have and also navigate the necessary maintenance outages. But the market for our customer
order book is really strong.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

All right. And then flipping gears kind of quickly to the summer ramp-up. There wasn't much commentary
or anything in the kind of prepared remarks. Just curious how that ramped up for you and is helping kind
of ease some of those inventory pressures that you're seeing. Any incremental costs? And does that kind
of contribute to the difference relative at least to our model to what we were expecting in terms of profit?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question. It's going extremely well. We're ahead of our ramp curve. Ramp curve will
continue building through 2021, but I'm really pleased with how the machine is running and the quality
we're getting off of it so far.

Operator

All right. And our next question will come from the line of Dr. Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.

Mark, as best you can, I'd like to talk about any impact on IP from cyber attack at one of your largest
peers and maybe also what IP is doing to defend itself from similar things.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, the -- it seems like cyber issues are in the news almost every day. We haven't had any material
impact related to any cyber issues. We are working constantly with our information technology process
control and our Chief Information Security Officer and our Board to make sure we're staying ahead of
the curve. And there's a lot of techniques, Mark. Every company has got approaches and outside help.
But what we focused on is making sure our manufacturing network, where it's connected, it needs to be
connected, and where it doesn't need to be connected, it's not connected. So it's a hybrid of connectivity
to share data that's necessary to share and a distributed system where it's not necessary to share. So
isolating into sectors the different potential entry points on the business back-office systems, again using
our own and third-party protection protocols.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

But I'll tell you it's a moving target, and we are continuously working on it. And we always feel -- and I
think it's a healthy way to feel that we're behind. So that keeps us laser focused on it.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

And Mark, just the -- the other piece of it, Mark, is from a disaster recovery and business continuity
standpoint, those are things that we run drills on, on a regular basis to hopefully make sure that we are
able to recover should we have an attack. But Mark's right, there's a huge dose of humility in all this stuff.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Is there any impact on just like swaps that you do sort of amongst companies to kind of minimize freight
costs? I mean one of the things we hear about is that there's just -- there's issues with shipping from
some of those sites right now.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I really can't comment on the company you're talking about. But I'll tell you every...

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I talked about IP, though. Does this have any impact on IP because somebody is not able to meet their
side of a slough?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

We haven't seen any -- sorry, I misunderstood your question. We haven't seen any impact. We are --
it's all we can do with or without those disruptions to supply all of the channels to market that we have
demand from right now. But no, Mark, we haven't seen anything that's affected us in a noticeable way.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

Hey ,my first question, Mark -- and we're not going to hold you to this but just want to get a sense for as
you look at Global Cellulose Fibers and hopefully a better demand outcome as we go into '21 and what
looks to be a better market pricing across all of the cellulose markets, do you think the business can turn
profitable this year? Or does more work need to be done either in terms of demand, cost, commercial
efforts? How would you have us think about that? And not looking for the quarter, but just conceptually,
do you think the business now is at a level of profitability that we can see some positive numbers at some
point?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

I think the answer is yes, you'll see positive numbers at some point. I mean the reason we didn't go
beyond the first quarter with anything specific is because of the uncertainty and the likelihood that no
one really knows how things are going to play out until we get this pandemic under control. But what
you ought to be looking at and what we're looking at is continuous improvement in cellulose fibers on all
fronts.

We've got internal things that we can do, and we're working on them to improve our cost position post
the integration of Weyerhaeuser and IP. And then there's the market pricing and volume with selected
customers. And all of that is moving in a positive direction right now.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

What I can't predict sitting here today is the wait, but you'll see quarter-after-quarter more positive
results. And the business is going to start gaining some momentum, and we're beginning to turn that
corner now.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay, Mark. And I wanted to do kind of a longer-term question with you here. So if we go to the slide that
you and Tim were discussing on, on longer-term cash flow, the compound rate of growth over 10 years
has been something around 3%, which is quite good given the capital intensity of the business and a lot
of the challenges that you've had to consider over time. When you think about the outlook over the next
5 years, the next -- we'll, let's keep it to 5 years, given the demand pickup that you've gotten from e-
commerce, given some of the optimization opportunities you're working on, but also given what might be
a more inflationary environment, what would you advise investors and analysts to think about in terms
of your growth rate and cash flow over the next 5 to 10 years? Should it be accelerating? Is it 3%? And
qualitatively, what would be the biggest drivers of that outlook?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

George, that's a really great question. A little heavy for a quarterly earnings call, but it's a fair question.
And...

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

I figured I'd spice it up a little bit.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Okay. We always want more strategic questions. And our objective of building a better IP is obviously to
generate consistent, credible earnings growth, and that's going to have a positive effect on cash. But I am
sitting here with my CFO who really wants to answer this question. So Tim, why don't you?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Well, I want to just give a little bit of perspective. So Mark's right, I mean, the key is growing earnings
and then grow cash. But the other things that we're working on, as we have mentioned, is our capital
investment process and making sure that we are more robust about how we deploy capital. Hopefully,
that's going to lead to higher returns from projects we do and fewer projects where they don't meet the
criteria that they need to meet. And so on balance, we should get more for less cash.

The other place is just what Mark talked about earlier. Some of these technology-driven earnings
improvement opportunities are giving us capability around -- both capability and capacity without the
normal capital investment dollar on the front end. So I just -- I thought it was worth highlighting them.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I have a question on the port delays and supply chain congestion impacting cellulose fibers. Just
wondering if there's any detail you can give in terms of how that sort of stands in February and in terms of
potential impact to 1Q. You talked about nonrepeats on -- in the outlook slide. I think you said $35 million
improved ops and costs. Is supply chain and ports a big part of that sequential improvement? I'm just
wondering about the finer point you've put on.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think the -- it's yet to be determined, but that is -- we do expect that to improve. It's part of it, but
we haven't seen the improvement really take hold in any meaningful -- in meaningful way. I mean it's,
in a way, a result of the impressive demand improvement. So I think it usually works itself out through
a quarter, and we are hopefully beginning to see that and -- so we can get our products all the way to
market.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just a related question. I mean can you talk about the current pulp market
conditions, especially in China? I mean we're seeing some price increases and spot prices there that are
pretty eyepopping. Can you just talk about what's driving that, maybe the sustainability? And then if you
could just remind us in terms of IP's cellulose fibers business and then from Ilim what percentage of your
shipments in pulp go to China versus North America versus other parts of the world?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

So on -- I mean, what we see generally in China, so in our cellulose fibers, probably fluff pulp we're selling
there, we're [Indiscernible] softwood pulp market environment, the Chinese economy is improving. Paper
and board production is increasing, and that's increasing their need for softwood pulp, which improves the
entire market supply/demand dynamics, and that flows to fluff pulp. So we think it's, the broader Chinese
economy, improving. It looks to be sustainable as China seems to be first in really recovering from the
economic impacts of the pandemic.

Most of Ilim's -- so I think your second part of your question was the -- regarding softwood that Ilim
makes. Almost all of what Ilim makes goes to China, if not all of it. There could be a couple of other
markets that are not technically China. But it's all China and the greater Asian market in that area because
remember, Anthony, 2 pulp mills are in Siberia. So we ship directly that way and virtually nothing goes
anywhere else.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great And then IP's kind of cellulose fiber footprint proper in terms of U.S. versus China versus rest of
world?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So to China, if memory serves, I think it's roughly 30% of what we ship. Virtually everything
goes offshore. We have some customers here in North America, but 80% of what we make is offshore,
somewhere either Europe or to China. I think China, if I remember correctly, is roughly 30% for the
absorbents.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Tim, one on the price/mix guidance you gave for Industrial Packaging. It implies about $20 a ton of higher
prices sequentially. So assuming you didn't realize much of the November increase in the fourth quarter
for obvious reasons, then that would suggest that cumulatively, you will have realized maybe half of the
$50 increase by 1Q. If -- am I thinking about it correctly? And is that the typical length of time that it
takes you to realize these price increases? Any more detail you could give would be helpful.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Adam. Two things. One, first of all, in the fourth quarter, we had a last residual of the price
published down impact for January in the fourth quarter. So they -- a very small percentage of these
things have a lag effect it takes a few quarters to work through.

I would characterize our price realization on the containerboard and box price increase that was
announced in November as following a typical pattern. We usually -- it usually takes a couple of quarters
for the majority of it to flow through, but then there is a residual that'll continue into the third and the
fourth quarter of this year.

But it's no different than what we've experienced in past increases. We're expecting the same kind of flow-
through.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then also related to guidance, Tim. Normally, this time of year, you give full year EBITDA
guidance. Obviously, you did not do so this time. Can you talk about how strongly you consider giving
guidance and why you ultimately chose not to? And -- because obviously, we know what the price impact
could be, you have your idea of what cost inflation could be, you know if maintenance will be up, you
know if corporate will be up. So obviously, you've got some of the pieces. So just wondering what your
thought process was there.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Certainly a great question. So from a technical standpoint, we don't really give guidance. We provide an
outlook. And you're correct, we have in prior years given a rough outlook for what our expectations were
in the coming year.

We -- if you had asked me that question in October about what we would do right now, I would probably
have been in a different place. But I think with COVID stretching longer than we imagined and the
vaccines not coming into play to as great a degree as what was forecasted, we didn't see at this point in
time a reason to change our practice from the past few quarters.

I'm hopeful that as things play out in the first quarter, maybe second quarter, we'll have much more clarity
and we can start looking a little bit longer term. But that was the rationale around thinking about our
outlook for this call for the first quarter.

Operator

All right. And our next...

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

I'm sorry. Sorry.

Operator

It's okay. Our next question will come from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Two follow-ups. First, on the capital spend. It really is noticeable that you have been able to bring down
that spend and apparently get what you need done. In particular, 2020, it was only $430 million on
maintenance and regulatory. Is that -- do you think that type of number is sustainable? What's really a
good number for you to meet those needs on maintenance and regulatory?

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

And kind of more generally, what should we be thinking about or where do you think you are as to how
much you need to spend to effectively run in place so -- to offset inflation and then presumably anything
above that would drive growth through cost reduction, strategic, et cetera?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's a great question. So I would say that our maintenance capital investment in 2020 was on the low
side. We try to optimize and maximize every dollar that we put into the facilities and do it in a targeted
way. But we have cycles. Some things, some types of maintenance are due on a calendar basis because
certifications are required and whatnot. We're looking at some of that this year. We're just on a higher
cycle.

We also took it as an opportunity, given the unusual nature of last year, as we referenced, to think a little
bit differently about to what extent and how we would deploy our maintenance outages across the fleet.
So the trend would -- or the normalized, if you will, would be higher than last year.

But with the offsets that we mentioned earlier, we are trying to become more efficient on capital, and
some of these predictive reliability capabilities are giving us an opportunity over time, we think, to
anticipate a problem before it actually happens, which should yield a lower cost, whether it's capital or
expense, in our facilities.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

So Mark, this last comment you made is really important. I made this point a few calls ago.

We really look at maintenance in totality, so there's a capital expenditure component. But there's an
expense component that oftentimes is 2x the capital component.

So when we look at lowering the cash needed to run in place, as you say, to maintain today's earnings and
cash flow, we look at the total number. And sometimes well-placed capital expenditures can significantly
and dramatically lower your ongoing expenses, and the company would be better off and the cash
generation profile will be better off. So we're constantly looking at that.

What's exciting about some of these new technological approaches is we can probably, if we're successful,
save not only on CapEx so it's mostly condition based, not time or inspection based, but also on the
expense side. So there's a huge multiplier if we get it right.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

And I -- and definitely appreciate the complexity. So maybe a different way to ask would be, with what
you spent last year on both capital and, as you said, the maintenance, et cetera, that gets expensed, were
you -- would you say that you were at a level that was meeting that run-in-place, maybe above it? Or
because of the unusual environment, had you elected to go below it?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

I think we were at a level that allowed us to run in place. I answered that without knowing the impact of
every decision we made because it's a continuum. We made choices to do and not do certain things in
2020 because of the pandemic-influenced disruptions on the market. Some of those look like they've been
good decisions. Some of those may end up being bad decisions in the month of April when we realized
something we didn't do created a disruption. So you'll have to constantly look at it on a continuum basis.
But I feel like the combination of capital beyond expense and the performance we delivered and continue
to deliver, albeit a couple of operating issues in the fourth quarter, that we struck about the right balance.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Great. And then just on pulp, a quick follow-up. Recognizing there's a lot of volatility, unpredictability,
2 questions. One is on Ilim. You have not that much of a change in the equity in earnings for the first
quarter versus the fourth quarter. Given what we have seen in the Chinese spot market, that there's sort
of -- seems a bit surprising. I don't think -- any color you can add on that?

And then second, is there a methodology you would provide for us on the outside to think about how
to translate what we see in list prices to what flows through and how quickly it flows through into your
cellulose fibers results for the North American operations?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

So on Global Cellulose Fibers, to start there, we have a fairly predictable and normal overtime ramp curve
on containerboard. The full business is different. It has a different set of dynamics. We have different
segments of customers. Contracts vary across the customer base. And our experience has been over the
past few years that the price increases tend to take longer to work their way through to the bottom line.
So confident in the price increases that we've put out there, but it always takes time for them to be fully
realized.

On Ilim, I think most of what you're seeing contributing to flat is just FX and expectations around FX.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So I was hoping we could talk about pulp a little more long term. Softwood demand tends to be pretty
reliable end markets, pretty attractive growth characteristics. But the returns over time tend to be really
inconsistent. We saw that with some of the assets long before you bought them. Is it realistic to think
that there's going to be a time when contract terms start to delink from commodity pulp? Or have the
specification barriers broken down because of advanced pulp processing? I'm really trying to understand
how you think about the long-term profile of pulp when we think about that in contrast to what you've
accomplished in containerboard.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

It's a great question, Mark. The commercial strategy that we deployed and what the market deployed
was that fluff for a long time was an extra product on top of a broad pulp offering. It's now becoming
a real market on its own and probably warrants a different commercial approach. And that's always
difficult once you started one way to change it, but that is definitely our objective, to change the way we
value the product and to make sure we understand that we're getting appropriate value for what product
and service we provide. It will take some time. But I think the downside of not improving it is that the
investment in making sure that product is available long term will be less attractive. And I think most
markets, the product's really valuable and the technical specifications are really important. And it seems
that they are. Usually it can correct over time. And it's not easy, and you make a good point.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. And if we could just squeeze something in. Your process optimization program, I'm just trying to
understand how it differs from what you've done before because we tend to think of IP as a leader in sort
of process management, especially containerboard. So is it focused on different things? Or is it that just
bringing in new technology? I'm thinking back to Carol Roberts' 7-year program.

Timothy S. Nicholls

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Yes. Thank you for that, Mark. There's always opportunity to improve. And we have systems and
capabilities and talent across the organization that have helped us manage to where we are today. We're
seeing new opportunities to use data in a different way and different types of data to make real-time
decisions.

So for instance, if you think about the supply chain from fiber to the mills, containerboard to box plants
and then to customers, and thinking about how we manage board combinations across our system based
on availability, and where to arbitrage transportation for fiber cost is an opportunity that we think we can
really exploit.

And so the tools are giving us a way to compare options that are just, quite frankly, too complicated do in
the moment by hand. And we're building technology tools that will help us do that and make better trade-
off decisions.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

That's super. I appreciate it. I mean obviously, IP has been a leader in that space and nice to see you
making even more progress.

Operator

And we do have time for one last question. And our last question will come from the line of Neel Kumar
with Morgan Stanley.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

In terms of the OCC prices, we've seen them start to run up a bit recently. Can you just give us a sense of
the expectations for how OCC prices evolve through 2021 as well as longer term?

And then just in terms of China's ban of OCC imports, it seems that produces are already facing a
shortage of fiber. Do you have any thoughts on whether China's ban will stick and how they'll address their
fiber needs going forward?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Just we couldn't hear exactly. I think you asked about OCC prices, but you broke up a little bit at the
beginning of your question. Is that what you were asking, OCC prices?

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. I was just asking about what your price expectations are for OCC in 2021 is the longer term.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. 2021, the crystal ball is not that clear going out towards the second half of the year. In the quarter,
we expect the trend that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue in the first. And so on average, I think
we're expecting $15 to $20, maybe a little bit more than that on OCC. But it really will depend. It's such
a fast-reacting market to circumstances and conditions, so we'll have to see what happens as we go from
first into second quarter.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And then just in terms of China's ban of OCC imports, do you think that's going to stick? Or how
are they going to address their fiber needs going forward?

Well, we -- again, we always have said we take them at their word. And I think you've already seen the
market beginning to adjust. So it was adjusting last year and maybe even late 2019 in anticipation of
this. So I think you see some of that rotation from one fiber type to another in China, and you see a
rebalancing across other export markets for OCC. So yes, I think that probably stays in place.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

So thanks, everyone, for joining us today and for the call -- for the questions, excuse me.

Just a closing comment. We are excited about what's in front of us with International Paper. We have
strong demand in our packaging and cellulose fibers business. Our paper business is recovering. We're
still navigating the pandemic. But as I said in my comments, I have total confidence in our employees to
be able to continue to do that. We have improving market conditions, and so we're excited about the way
2021 is going to unfold and lead us into a very strong position as we enter 2022 in what I'm very hopeful
is a pandemic-free economic playing field.
