Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Sharon, and I will be your operator
for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the
company's most recent filings with the SEC.

Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's
current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO;
and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations.

For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Preston with some perspective on the recovery
trends across our diverse businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly
results, before opening the call to Q&A.

I'm pleased to report that we returned to growth in Q3, posting organic sales growth of 3%. This
represents a rapid improvement in our business, driven by a progressive return of elective procedures,
ongoing demand for our Medical capital products and continued strong Mako performance. In the quarter,
we saw uneven growth globally that correlates to the state of the pandemic. Preston will speak to this in
his section.

While we are pleased with the recovery of our business, the environment remains uncertain as flare-
ups of positive COVID cases are continuing. We had many achievements in the quarter that exemplify
our commitment to innovation and providing our customers with the technologies needed to serve their
patients.

Beginning with Mako, we celebrated the installation of our 1,000th robotic system in the quarter. We've
seen tremendous success with Mako since the launch of the total knee application in 2016 and this quarter
was no different. We continue to believe that we're well positioned for sustained future success with Mako.

Our Spine and Trauma & Extremities businesses benefited from numerous recent product launches, and
Medical launched an exciting new acute care bed. Our Neurovascular business also achieved some new
product approvals in important markets, which helped contribute to their double-digit global growth in the
quarter.

We maintained many of the policies put in place at the beginning of the pandemic, focused on maintaining
the safety of our employees and customers and aggressively managing spending. While sales and
manufacturing have approached more normal levels, our spending levels were unusually low, given the
uncertainty regarding the pace of the recovery.

Our R&D spending on an adjusted basis was 6.1% of sales, slightly below our expectations as a result
of COVID-related execution challenges and some timing of spending. But none of this has caused any
meaningful delays to new product time lines. The combination of sales growth and suppressed spending
resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up 12% versus the prior year. While some of our
measures remain in place, our spending measures, we do expect some return to hiring and investments to

support future growth in Q4. Due to the continued uncertainty and lack of stability in many markets, we
are not providing Q4 guidance at this time.

We saw good momentum across many of our businesses in Q3, although the recovery curve acceleration
moderated meaningfully in August and September and has been on a similar trend so far in October.
We are proceeding with the integration efforts related to the Wright Medical transaction and are working
cooperatively with regulators to obtain the necessary approvals for this transaction.

This includes, as previously announced, the proposed divestiture of our STAR total ankle replacement
product. We expect to close the transaction in November. Please note beyond this update, we will not be
taking any questions regarding Wright Medical on today's call.

Finally, I would like to thank our employees for continuing to serve our customers and finding ways to
succeed during such challenging times, from our sales and service personnel in the field every day with
our customers, to the marketing and R&D teams that are finding creative ways to connect globally, to
advance new innovations, to our manufacturing teams and the office staff who ensured the continuity of
our business. We are living our mission statement, which is, together with our customers, we are driven to
make health care better.

And now over to Preston.

Preston Wells
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Kevin. Today, my comments will focus on providing additional thoughts on the current
environment and the recovery of select businesses and geographies during the third quarter.

We have generally seen a V-shaped recovery through the second quarter with continued momentum and
growth in the third quarter, although at a more moderated level of month-over-month improvement. The
sales growth and improved performance in the third quarter was driven by 3 main factors: the continued
acceleration of elective procedures, strong demand for many of our large capital products and the return
of our more event-driven businesses like trauma and stroke.

Small capital products, including our video cameras and power tools, showed nice improvement but
lagged other products in their recovery. These products generally trail elective procedure volumes by a few
months.

Despite a resurgence in infection rates globally, we saw sales growth in most developed markets led by
strong recovery in the United States, Australia, Germany and Canada. These markets were operating
around pre-COVID levels throughout the quarter. Our China business returned to double-digit growth
in the quarter, with procedures returning to more normal levels despite the government taking a more
aggressive approach to lockdowns around COVID infections. The U.K., India and parts of our Latin America
businesses continues to lag as they work through heightened impacts of the pandemic.

Procedural areas that were deferred or soft during the second quarter showed significant improvements
in the quarter. Our Knee, Spine, Trauma & Extremities and Sports Medicine businesses all achieved year-
over-year growth. Hips also showed significant improvement in the quarter, reaching prior year levels.
Each of these businesses benefited from the acceleration of elective procedures during the quarter that
was fueled by the addition of new patients and the recovery of the previously deferred backlog.

Surgeons and health care providers continue to work through the new and existing backlog by adding
incremental procedures to their normal schedules. With the continued variability of infection rates, we
believe that hospitals are better prepared to ensure that these types of elective procedures can still be
performed at some level, unlike the dramatic drop that we saw in April. However, the situation remains
fluid, and procedural impacts and recovery will continue to vary across geographies.

Demand for our large capital products drove strong growth in the quarter, including ongoing high demand
for our Mako robotic technology. In the third quarter, we were very pleased with the acceleration of Mako

installations, both within the U.S. and in markets outside the U.S., where we continued to expand our
Mako presence.

Recently, Brazil approved full use of our Mako robotic technology for both hip and knee procedures. We
are also experiencing increased utilization with a growing percentage of hip and knee surgeries being
performed with a Mako robot.

Within our Medical division, we saw strength in our emergency care business, along with continued high
demand for our beds and stretchers, demonstrating the improved financial stability of our customers
aided by government subsidies like the CARES Act and the resurgence of positive cash flow driven by the
continuation of elective procedures. As a result, our order book remains robust for both Mako and many of
our Medical products.

The launch of the new acute care bed, ProCuity, is a contributor to that order book and a demonstration of
our ongoing commitment to innovation during the pandemic. With our specialized business unit, category-
leading product portfolio and innovative technologies, we are well positioned to continue our above-market
med tech growth.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and related drivers.
Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.

Our organic sales growth was 3.3% in the quarter. These results included growth in the U.S. of 3.5% and
international growth of 2.8%. As a reminder, the quarter included the same number of selling days as Q3
2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4% from the prior year quarter, while foreign currency had
a favorable 0.4% impact on sales.

During the quarter, we returned to growth as demand for our procedural-based products came back
strongly in most key geographies, and demand for large capital, primarily Mako and medical beds,
remained strong. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.14 represents growth of 12% from the prior year
quarter. The foreign currency impact on the third quarter EPS was accretive by $0.01. The strong EPS
growth was mainly driven by sales drop-through, favorable sales mix, disciplined cost control and better-
than-expected gross margin leverage as our manufacturing output returned to more normal production
levels.

I will now provide some brief comments on our segment sales. Orthopaedics had constant currency and
organic growth of 3.8%. This included U.S. growth of 7.5%. We saw growth across Knees, Hips, Trauma,
Extremities and Mako, which grew 30.2% in the quarter. Additionally, all these products are growing off
strong U.S. comparables from Q3 2019.

Internationally, Orthopaedics had an organic decline of 4.7%, which reflects the slower recovery of elective
procedures in Europe as a result of COVID restrictions, partially offset by a positive Mako performance.

MedSurg had constant currency growth of 2.9% and organic growth of 2.5%, which included organic
growth of 1.4% in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 1.9%, reflecting increased
demand for our safety-related products, including waste management and smoke evacuation products, the
latter of which have double-digit growth.

Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 1%. This reflects a return to growth primarily driven by
our Sports Medicine business, where we had double-digit growth. This was partially offset by moderate
declines in core Endoscopy and Communications businesses.

The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 3%, resulting from strong demand across its bed
business, growing double digits and emergency care business growing high single digits. These were
partially offset by a decline in our Sage business. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales of 6.7%,

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

reflecting very strong demand for Medical products combined with positive performances across most of
our MedSurg product categories in all major geographies.

Neurotechnology and Spine had a constant currency growth of 5.5% and organic growth of 4.3%. Our
U.S. Neurotech business posted constant currency growth of 3.1%, including 1.7% of organic growth for
the quarter. Overall, this reflects positive performances in our Spine, CMF and Neurovascular businesses
and included double-digit growth in our ischemic products. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had
organic growth of 9.8%, including double-digit performances in our hemorrhagic and ischemic products
and a very strong performance in our Spine business.

Now I will discuss our operating metrics in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.9% was favorable
20 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin was
favorably impacted by volume and business mix, which was partially offset by price and some unabsorbed
fixed costs. Although our manufacturing output returned to more normalized levels during the quarter,
there was a somewhat negative impact related to our idle manufacturing lines at the beginning of the
quarter.

Adjusted R&D spending was 6.1% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 31.7% of sales, which was 210
basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, SG&A was favorably
impacted by operating expense savings actions enacted in March, which continued in the third quarter.

In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 28% of sales. All of the spend control
measures that were enacted in March continued through Q3. These measures covered most of our
discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and outside consultants. As our
businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels, we do anticipate that there will be increases
in hiring, discretionary expenses and other costs that support future growth and business expansion.

Related to other income and expense compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment
income earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense related to additional debt outstanding. Our
third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 16.1%.

Turning to cash flow and liquidity. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of $7.2
billion, which includes $5 billion of funds related to the Wright Medical acquisition. We also generated
approximately $830 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which was again ahead of our internal
targets. This strong operating cash flow reflects strong net earnings and a reduction in core working
capital versus the prior year.

The actions that were implemented in the first quarter to conserve cash continued in Q3, which included
discretionary spending controls, reductions in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing
on opportunities and accounts payable and slowing our M&A activities.

As it relates to guidance for Q4 and the full year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to
withdraw guidance, given the continued significance of uncertainties at this time.
And now I will open up the call for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Vijay, we can't hear you. Vijay, are you on mute?

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Guys, can you hear me?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Now we can.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Perfect. Fantastic. Well, congrats on a really strong [ quarter ], Kevin. So -- and I guess, looking at these
numbers here, some of your peers in the quarter, they are seeing low single-digit declines. You guys are
seeing positive declines.

Maybe parse out what is the underlying market versus this constant theme of Stryker gaining share? Is
that what's happening -- what's driving the strength here? And perhaps also touch upon trends you're
seeing here in COVID. Any reason -- and I saw that we didn't have a Q4 guidance, but perhaps sequential
trends, what we're seeing here in Q4. Is there any reason to believe that Q4 trends should be perhaps
different from what we saw in 3Q?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Well, thanks, Vijay. We're pretty excited about the performance in our business. It's not a one quarter
thing. I think you've seen our joint replacement division, which includes Hips, Knees and Mako have been
performing well for some time. And that momentum is continuing.

I mentioned in my opening remarks that we're pleased with October. It's going well so far in the month.
But I really don't want to speculate on November, December, just given all the flare-ups that are recurring.
Assuming that the market stays fairly stable, we're going to have a good fourth quarter. But that's a big
assumption, given this is obviously a once-in-a-lifetime type of pandemic.

So I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we're feeling good about the business through the month of
October.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got you. And then maybe one on the capital side. You guys had mentioned a strong order book for Mako,
large capital. I know you guys just launched a new bed. Perhaps just talk about the visibility you have on
the capital side of the business. And is that a confidence that you can perhaps extrapolate into next year?
Or is this perhaps Q4 and then we'll see how the market shakes out for next year?

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Vijay, it's Preston. Just to expand on that a little bit, I mean, we do continue to have confidence in our
capital business. I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if you look at our large capital business
and demand that we saw on Mako and then on the Medical business, in particular, we feel really, really
good about that.

Small capital, as we talked about in the remarks as well, we expect that to continue to come along the
recovery curve as well. Although it has shown that improvement but lags a little bit some of the other
products in terms of that recovery.

And I think overall, we feel good about it. We feel good about where orders have come in. We feel good
about where our customers are in terms of their financial stability at this point in time, certainly compared
to where it was a quarter ago. And because of those items, we feel confident in where our capital business
is headed. I think all of that is underscored, as Kevin said, by the uncertainty that still remains with
regards to flare-ups and how the virus continues to kind of move through different regions.

Operator

Next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And again, congrats on a much better-than-expected quarter. Kevin, how should we think about
interpreting the comments on a go-forward basis in respect to how much of a backlog is worked through?
Are there still patients who deferred procedures that still need to get into queue here and -- because it
sounds like July was probably the best quarter of third quarter. Would fourth quarter if current trends hold
be similar, better or worse than third quarter here?

Preston Wells
Vice President of Investor Relations

Robbie, it's Preston. So I would say in general, it's hard to predict exact percentages with regards to how
much of the backlog has been worked through versus what are new patients that are coming into that
funnel. Based on the feedback that we've got and we know that surgeons are continuing to work through
that backlog, and that they're also adding new patients. So it's definitely a mix of the 2.

We also know that there are some patients that are still waiting with anxiety to get their procedures done.
But all in all, clinics and surgeons remain busy, and they're continuing to look to add additional shifts or
additional opportunities to add surgery or even a shift to the outpatient setting. Our expectation is that,
that trend will continue, again barring any major disruptions from a COVID perspective.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Once again, you had another great Mako quarter here, even in
the tough times of COVID. And I was wondering if you could speak to how willing hospital systems are to
go out still and buy the large capital, considering it seems like your main competitor in robotics has shifted
strategy to place a lot more units rather than recognize revenue upfront, it appears you're still able to
recognize a healthy amount. So just wondering what the environment is like and if you're seeing them on
the competitive side?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, we continue to feel very bullish about Mako. I think in Q4, we're going to have -- unless
something bizarre happens in the marketplace, it will be a record quarter in Q4 because the order book is
still very strong. With over 1,000 -- and we've kind of hit an inflection point. And robotics -- the interest in
robotics is increasing every day. Teaching hospitals are adopting robotics and they're feeling the pressure
to have robotics as part of their programs. And in some cases, they have been holding off a little bit.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

So for us, the momentum is palpable. It's continuing. It's strong, and it's even starting to pick up in other
markets such as Japan and countries in Europe. They did a little bit of a pause in that second quarter. We
saw them coming back, frankly, in the third quarter.

So the outlook for Mako continues to be very bullish and it's really irrespective of competition. This is sort
of a market trend that's changing. The market's shifting and we really love the offering that we have in
this category.

Operator

next question we have is David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Kevin, I wonder if we could just talk maybe 2021, if we can't get any kind of specific numbers either
relative to 2019 baseline? Or maybe just some top line qualitative commentary about how you're sort of
seeing the top and bottom line for 2021 or specific product launches and innovation pipeline we should be
thinking about for 2021? And then I have a quick follow-up.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes, David, we're not going to really get into sort of guidance for '21. We do that in every January. And
right now, we're planning to provide that in January.

I think we've gotten good momentum across a lot of our businesses. You saw the Trauma number, we
posted a really strong number. They've launched a number of new products and feeling very good about
that. And that's frankly before Wright Medical kicks in.

So we're really excited about the momentum we're going to see across Trauma & Extremities next year.
Our Neurovascular would be one I'd point to that I'm really excited about. We have the Surpass Evolve
next-gen flow diverting stent approved in the United States, and that had very good growth even though
we're still having to go through the pains of proctoring in the midst of a pandemic.

So admittedly from a small base, but that's going to pick up steam next year as well our aspiration
offerings within Neurovascular. So Neurovascular, I feel very good as I look through into next year. And
of course, Mako will continue its positive trajectory that affects not just the Mako business, but of course,
hips and knees. And so those are all going well. Instruments continues to be a really strong business for
us, and smoke evacuation, you see, is now becoming a standard in many areas.

The whole safety push, I think, will continue beyond, frankly, the pandemic. And we've really established a
really great stable of products related to safety. So a lot of tailwinds, I think, that will continue on a sort of
underlying basis.

The big unknown is sort of how does this pandemic evolve, and it's still going to be with us, obviously,
through the first half of next year in some way, shape or form. And so that's the big unknown. But a lot
of the businesses that we have, we're feeling good about the momentum, the product cadence and new
products, which I've already touched on some of them, we think, will position us well for 2021.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Very, very helpful. And the one business I wanted to highlight was just Spine. Obviously, that's been
the a sore point these last several quarters and your -- some of your performance, frankly, was better
than some of the emerging mid-cap Spine players.

Just what you're seeing in Spine? Have we finally turned the corner from an integration perspective? Are
you seeing more traction on sort of rep hiring? But it was a surprisingly strong quarter for you in Spine.
Just curious in the underlying drivers.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We're really pleased with the performance in Spine. I think that K2M, which was obviously a tough
integration. We knew it would be tough. It was tough. We feel that that's largely behind us. I think we
actually got a little bit of a reprieve in the second quarter, honestly, to sort of get our inventory and get
our position more stabilized.

OUS has been strong, frankly, from the beginning, but getting that U.S. business on a better footing, we
feel very good about that. They launched some new products, including Niagara, which is a lateral access
product, our Corpectomy Cage. And so getting back to launching products, which as you know, is a big
part of the K2M offense, excited that they're now back to launching new products versus sort of dealing
with all of the integration challenges.

As it relates to the sales force, very stable. In fact, and we're actually having sales reps wanting to come
to join Stryker now in Spine. So we really do feel the tide is starting to shift in Spine and it was definitely a
very good quarter.

Operator

Next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just first question I wanted to ask Kevin about your hip growth in the quarter and then just hips generally.
Your hip growth in the quarter was maybe a smidge below peers. So I just wanted to talk about or ask you
about dynamics there. But probably more importantly, I also want to get your view on your pipeline in hips
and when you've got new launches coming because I think in previous conversations, we've talked about
some exciting launches, potentially, in that area.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bob. We're actually very pleased with our hip performance. We had good growth in hips, and
we had a very tough comp from the prior year quarter where we outperformed the market in hips. So
overall, yes, competitors did well in hips. We also did well in hips as hips are a little less deferrable than
these, which really speaks to the strength we had in knees.

But as it relates to hips, we're very excited about 2 aspects of the pipeline. The first is the -- on Mako, we
have a new software upgrade for hips that we launched in the second quarter. Because of the pandemic,
we haven't really been able to roll that out fully. It will get fully rolled out probably by the end of Q4. So
it's a progressive rollout, but really will have more of an impact next year.

And then the second part of the pipeline is a new stem that we have planned sometime in the middle of
next year. We'll get more specific around timing maybe in the January call, but that's kind of an exciting
stem, which has some features that surgeons like and a little bit of a gap in our portfolio. But overall, still
a pretty good quarter.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. Yes. Okay. And then I also wanted to ask you a little bit about the potential for durability of growth
in the Medical division. And I'm not asking about fourth quarter, I'm thinking a little bit more longer term
because there are a lot of moving pieces in that division right now. It sounds like Sage might be struggling
a little bit, but then OUS strength has been enormous. You're launching a new bed and then there's the
core underlying bed market.

Maybe just talk about your thoughts on the durability of the growth outlook for that business in light of all
the moving pieces.

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Preston Wells
Vice President of Investor Relations

Hey, Bob, it's Preston. I think as I've mentioned before, specifically on the capital side, we feel very
confident where we're heading in terms of the durability on that business, particularly as we think about
things like beds and stretchers with the launch of the new bed adding to that portfolio, very, very excited
about what that's going to bring and do for us.

Sage, Sage had a slower quarter in terms of its growth, obviously, an improvement from the second
quarter, but still a little bit of a decline versus prior year. Given that business in terms of stocking and the
purchase cycle, we really do expect that business to turn the corner as well as we go into the next quarter
and into 2021. So I think we'll see some positive dynamics from that business.

And then overall, obviously, we've seen some impact from the pandemic, and we would expect that we'll
continue to see momentum on our businesses as we go forward. Specifically, as it relates to the OUS
business, as you noted, we had a very strong Q3, performance really across both emergency care and
our acute care businesses. I think it's important to note that we were really having good performances in
the OUS space even before, really, the impact of the pandemic. And our expectation would be that even
though while we're seeing some benefits certainly from the pandemic that we'll continue to build on the
momentum that had started even before that as we go forward.

So I think all in all, feeling very good about the future from a Medical standpoint.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'd just like to add one comment. The other part of the physio business is called Public Access. So
that's outside of the emergency in the hospitals. And that business really got very, very quiet in the
second quarter. It came to a halt almost and so that will come back. That will probably be a little slower,
maybe more in the first quarter, second quarter of next year.

So Sage will come back a little bit sooner, maybe towards the end of the year. And then Public Access will
come back maybe in the first or second quarter of next year. So there are parts of the business that are
drags right now that will turn positive. And there are, of course, some pops that we got from the pandemic
that will start to moderate.

But we love our Medical business. We love the leadership we have in that business and it will continue to
be a really good performer for us.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Kevin, I just had a follow-up on this ASC strategy you've been pursuing and talking about a little bit. I
know you don't want to dip your hands too much as to exactly how that all is going to work. But we'd love
to get anything you are willing to share progress so far, how it complements your other efforts to grow and
maybe how it complements your relationships with some of the larger networks, which have an outpatient
channel often? And I have one follow-up.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, I'm not going to get into too many of the details about how we're doing it, but we are very
pleased with our performance in ASCs. The Mako number in the third quarter in ASCs were the highest
number we've had so far in ASC. So Mako is part of the solution.

We had double-digit growth in our Sports Medicine business. And of course, that plays in the ASC
primarily. And so those are the proxies that you could use to figure out sort of how we're doing in the

ASCs is look at our sports med business, look at the growth that we're having with Mako. There's a lot
of other products that we have that play very well in the surgery center market. And we've just basically
created an aligned offense that aligns our divisions.

As you know, in the hospital, we tend to operate very separately and we go in by product category. We're
not doing that in the ASC, and this aligned offense is really working very well. And I want to give credit
to Andy Pierce and the entire team that sort of established this offense. It's working ahead of what I was
expecting and feel very bullish about it going forward.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's terrific. And then just a follow-up, you mentioned strength in growth in China despite some of the
pandemic controls are putting back into effect there. And you mentioned in the last call and the call before
just about the move into China with Mako going forward. And understanding that, I'm guessing that a lot
of that early activity is in the sort of premium self-pay market. And maybe any update or progress as to
how that's going? And any early results that you've seen in terms of feedback or uptake?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Thanks, Matt. So let me start with Mako. So we only have the hip approved right now in China. We
don't have -- yet have the total knee. We hope to get that in the first or second quarter of next year. It's
taking longer than we had expected. But we're on track. So we'll get it eventually approved. But we are
getting sales in Mako for hip.

But of course, once you get the knee on the robot, and of course, the sales will start to really accelerate.
There's just been a general pickup in general. So the pandemic, they've done a good job controlling the
pandemic in the country. We've seen a pickup both in our Trauson business, which is our lower-priced
products, as well as in the premium segment. So it's kind of, I would say, an across the board pick up
that's occurring and really related to the coronavirus.

We had a great year last year in China, our best year on record and a good year the year before. We have
a strong management team, both on the Trauson side and in the premium segment. As you know, that's
been a more recent thing for Stryker. So I would expect that we'll continue to see that kind of performance
since the market conditions have improved markedly.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So Kevin, on the operating margin in Q3, it obviously stood out the 260 basis point or so improvement
year-over-year. And I heard the comments that some of it was spending that you deferred because of the
pandemic. But my question is, how much of this may be durable because of things you've learned to do
more efficiently during the pandemic? And how does it make you feel about the 30 to 50 basis points of
operating margin improvement on an annual basis that you've targeted?

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

Yes. Larry, this is Glenn. You're right, during Q2 and Q3, we obviously continued a lot of the cost-
containment measures that we had enacted in March. And these were kind of things that other companies
probably have looked at: travel, meetings, training, consulting. And just the real whole gamut of
discretionary spending was really kind of locked down.

We also slowed our hiring. We slowed project spending on sort of non-R&D type projects. And I would say
coming out of this, you're absolutely right. We've learned sort of new ways to work. We're doing this call

virtually, and it seems to be working fine. We also have launched virtual training with customers and also
internally that has worked very well. And so I would say some of that very definitely will carry over to the
future in terms of how we sort of emerge from the pandemic and what our operating structure looks like.

That being said, though, as we get back to more normalized operations and back to a growth trend that
we expect to be at, there will be increases to all those expenses. And some of them will return to pre-
COVID levels just because that's what we'll need to support sort of the growth assertions that we'll have.

Key projects will start back up. We'll see hiring pick back up. So all of that will start to grow with -- as
we emerge from this. So as you think about the 30 to 50 basis points, I do think that probably a more
normalized basis to look at would be looking at 2019 in terms of an op margin that we might assert
relative growth off of.

But we have not backed away at all from our financial assertions. We will grow at the high end of med
tech, and we will continue to expand our op margin 30 to 50 basis points.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's super helpful, Glenn. And one follow-up question just I think for Kevin. On M&A, with the exception
of the Wright deal, you've been relatively quiet on the M&A front. Any thoughts? And is it due to
valuations? Just any thoughts on kind of your appetite and pipeline for M&A.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. We intentionally slowed down M&A in the second quarter just because we were not sure what
was going to happen with the pandemic. We asked the teams to sort of put their pencils down, stay active
in discussions. But we really wanted to be sure that we -- we didn't know the recovery would happen quite
this quickly. So we're pleased with that.

We do have our M&A teams back up and running because of the Wright Medical and the debt that we're
taking on because of that, we don't expect to be doing very large deals in the next year or so. But look for
more tuck-in deals.

But we do want to stay busy with M&A. We've said that to the rating agencies. Our teams are actively
looking at targets that they sort of never really stopped. They did just slow down a little bit while we saw
sort of a pace of recovery. But you should expect us to get back to our normal kind of tuck-in offense,
which will complement the Wright Medical acquisition.

This is Patrick on for Matt. I want to start with Mako. I know you've done a really nice job with placing
Mako, and the underlying demand is really strong. But I'm curious if you could give us more color on the
sales cycle. Specifically, I'm wondering if there's a chance that the sales cycle kind of over the longer term
remains elongated as some of these hospitals work through financial pressures. So any color you have
there would be really helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up.

Preston Wells
Vice President of Investor Relations

This is Preston. Just to answer that, no, we don't expect that the sales cycle is going to elongate. A matter
of fact, it's one of the things that we've seen over the last couple of quarters is we've actually been
able to get out and drive Mako even faster. And so there's still quite a bit of runway as we think about
opportunities for Mako. So we don't expect that cycle to elongate.

Next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.

Ryan Benjamin Zimmerman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Kevin, you called out Sage performance being maybe a little weaker than
expected. Was that a reflection of procedural volume? Or is there anything from a protocol perspective in
terms of preoperative sterilization that may have changed for some customers, given the pandemic?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, I would tell you, first of all, we weren't surprised by the sales. It wasn't weaker than expected.
It was certainly negative sales growth. In fact, it was -- everything we had was a little better than
expected in terms of the pace of recovery.

The nature of the sales cycle for Sage, you need to have a lot of activity in the hospital, where you have
procedures being done, where the products are being used because they're consumed as you have people
in the ICU that -- people that are getting procedures done. And so the census in the hospital was lower in
the second quarter for sure and certainly even in the third quarter. And they -- these products are bought
in bulk, and they're put on the shelf because they're consumed daily. So you have this sales cycle that it
sort of has to be depleted -- the inventories have to be depleted before they're reordered.

So that's not at all a surprise. But the fact that the sales were negative. It just sort of explains why that,
that was a drag in the U.S. on our Medical business. We don't have a very big Sage business outside the
U.S., it's more of a U.S. phenomenon.

But we love the products. In fact, we launched a new product, a self oral care product, which is really
exciting in the midst of the pandemic, which is getting great customer feedback. But of course, that's just
going to take time for that to be ordered and then put on the shelf.

So once the ordering -- once the usage starts to happen and the inventory start to bleed down, we're
going to get sort of this bolus of reordering. And again, that may not occur fully in the fourth quarter, but
towards the end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, we'll expect Sage to get back to its normal
very strong growth.

Ryan Benjamin Zimmerman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just as a follow-up, one on Mako. Not so much on the unit volumes, although it was
certainly encouraging. But I think there was a software upgrade cycle earlier in the year. I could be wrong
on that. You certainly called out the hip software upgrade.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

But how should we think about the upgrade cycle for software of Mako in the installed base and what that
can do for growth maybe over the next 12 to 24 months within your existing customer base?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, software upgrades are important. They just help with the ease of use and really productivity for
the surgeon. We did a software upgrade on hips in the second quarter. We are working on one for knees as
well.

The hip one had some very important -- but it wasn't just a software upgrade that had ease of use to do
with registration, which is one of the frustration point for hips, but it also provides new information to the
surgeon on pelvic tilt, which they're finding really beneficial. So I do expect it will cause -- it was already
increasing the use of Mako for hips, but that will probably accelerate into next year.

But that software upgrade is still being deployed in the field, and we'll share more about the knee software
upgrade when that happens as well. So this is not new. We constantly look to provide better usability and
usage factors for our surgeons. And that's a common thing.

But I wouldn't call that an inflection point. It's just a continued good customer experience, which we like
to have with all our products. The real boon is just the adoption of Mako, the success surgeons are having,
the hospitals purchasing their second and third and fourth Makos, the growth in teaching hospital, the
growth in surgery centers. There's just -- it's just kind of an inflection point that we're seeing that I think
will continue to last for many quarters ahead.

Next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Very nice quarter. Two questions. The first one is Mako related. There's a lot on this call, so I'll throw mine
in.

Can you give us an idea of what percentage of hospitals currently have a robot? And where do you think
it ultimately goes to? And instead of a 2-part question because when we do our survey work, I talk to
hospital administrators and physicians that have 1, 2, 3, they seem to not be able to get enough robots or
enough type of robot. I'd love your sort of view on the landscape.

And then, really, the second question has to do with seasonality. Is there anything happening in the big
broad world outside of the pandemic that you think will impact the fourth quarter?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thanks, Joanne. So look, the first question, it's really just about when you're in a new market
adoption, it's not easy to predict, right, how far will it go? Could robotics become standard of care as
we've seen happen in some other procedure areas? Maybe. And if it becomes standard of care, you can
do the math of how many hospitals who do robotic procedures and surgery centers that are being added
that do robotic procedures. There's a huge number of robots still to be sold. And so that's the underlying
question is will it become the standard of care that's expected in all procedures? And we're obviously
striving for that. And the industry is moving in this direction. The pace of the curve is really hard to
predict.

But your point's right. And what we're seeing is we always like to have surgeon champions with every
robot that we sell. So we don't do mass sales of robots. We don't to see C-suite sales of robots without
surgeon champions. That's just not the way we operate. And so what happens is the robots that we do sell
get used right away. And when they're used, the surgeon shares their experience in the surgeon lines with
the other orthopedic surgeons. And then they want to watch this procedure, they get interested, and then

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

STRYKER CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

they'd like to use it. And then what happens is the robot's fully booked, and that surgeon gets frustrated
and then goes to the administrators and says, "I'd like a robot for my procedures."

That's a dynamic that we've seen happen over and over again, and that will continue. So at this point, you
know how many hospitals there are that do the procedures. It's a large number. And we think that there's
a long, long runway. We're still in the early stages of robotic adoption in orthopedic procedures.

Sorry, I lost the -- what was the second question again? Joanne, do you mind repeating that?

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Of course. Second question has to do more with seasonality. I get we have a pandemic, but -- there we
go.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Oh, yes. Seasonality. So -- yes, sorry. On the seasonality question, Q4 is normally our strongest
seasonally quarter that we have. And so November, December, it's really hard to predict this year. Will we
see the same type of seasonal impacts? The surgeons are saying they still want to be busy hospitals and
realize the importance of elective procedures to their own profitability.

And so will we see the normal push? I don't know. The surgeons we talked to seem to think that they're
going to be busy, but it's a question I can't answer because we really -- we've never been through this
with a pandemic. But right now, we're not seeing any signs of something changing. It seems like that
there's a normal dynamic outside of the pandemic. So as long as surgeons can go to operate, they're
going to operate. And they've become very creative in terms of figuring out how to do their cleaning
protocols. They're actually very efficient. Some hospitals are opening longer hours or even opening up on
a Friday or on the weekends to stay busy.

So we'll have to watch it closely, but I really don't have any new insights to provide. I don't expect
something different from what we've seen in the past.

Congratulations on the strong recovery. I wanted to ask future Mako indication question. I know you're
not giving time lines, but just thinking about the development of the shoulder indication, should we be
thinking about the development there being exclusive for Wright Medical upper extremity portfolio? And
does just a push out of that acquisition do anything to the time line of Mako shoulder indication?

Kevin A. Lobo

We're not really going to get into the time line. We believe that the robotics for shoulder is going to be
compelling. Shoulder is a very difficult procedure to do as sort of more akin to partial knee than it is to
total knee or total hips. And we believe it's going to be very, very compelling.

Next question comes from Kaila Krum with Truist.

Samuel E. Brodovsky
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

This is Sam on for Kaila. First of all, I just wanted to ask about the Airo system out of Mobius. I'm just
curious how you would describe about a year in now, how that's performing? And then, generally, how the
capital market for imaging versus, say, the strength in robotics is performing? And then any impact you're
seeing on pull-through to other businesses from that system?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Listen, we're thrilled with the Mobius acquisition. We bought a terrific technology. Our biggest
challenge, honestly, has been scaling up the manufacturing. So we've had very, very high demand for
Mobius. It was a small company based in Shirley, Massachusetts, and we're just -- large challenges really
scale up. And it's the same challenge we've had, frankly, with TSO3, which is the sterilizing company that
we've bought.

And a lot of times when we buy smaller companies, the demand tends to overwhelm us. And we have to
go back to the design robustness and be able to scale the manufacturing, build new production lines. And
so that's a high-class problem, I would call it.

We're really, really pleased with the Airo product. It performs extremely well. It, frankly, had an increase
in demand. In some cases, they were using it to look to do imaging for COVID. And so we've been,
frankly, struggling to keep pace, but it's, like I say, a high-class problem. We're really excited about it.
They also have good products in their pipeline as well. So it's a deal that will very much help correspond
business for the long term. But we're still in the scale-up phase.

Samuel E. Brodovsky
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then just with resuming more spend on rep hiring into the fourth quarter, if you can maybe
tease that out a little bit. How should we think about that in terms of more return to normal rep hiring? Or
are you thinking about maybe pressing your strength a little bit and getting a little more aggressive while
some of your competitors may be struggling?

Glenn S. Boehnlein
VP & CFO

Yes. It's a good question, Sam. I think as the divisions look out towards 2021 and they're planning sort of
their budgets and where they can get to, it always will include new rep hiring. And so -- and absolutely,
our regular cycle is that we would get started on that in Q4. So I think that most divisions are planning to
expand their rep sales forces towards the end of Q4 and certainly on the end of January of next year.

And that would be just part of the sort of the general territory management that we go through every
single year.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

The first one I had, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on your bed launch and the bed market.
And I had kind of a 2-part question. Really trying to understand if you're seeing a trend towards the bed
market expanding, and that could create more opportunity for you. And then I was just hoping that you
could comment on how this new rollout could go. Do you expect it to go into your own base and do mostly
conversion of your older beds? Or do you think there's a share gain opportunity?

Preston Wells
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. So in terms of the bed market itself, I think there's probably a bit of both, right? So there's obviously
going to be the replacement cycle of bed that's going to continue to happen. But I think the pandemic has
also created some opportunity for expansion in that market as well. So I think there's going to be a mix of
both of those items as we go forward.

With regards to ProCuity and what that's going to do for us, again, we feel really strongly about that bed
and the opportunity. And then there will be some opportunity, like I said, both in terms of replacement
cycles that will fit into and then expanding into competitive opportunities as well.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And can I just ask a follow-up? I was really interested in your comments about standard-of-care robotics
with Mako. And I think we've seen the knee value proposition is very strong. I was wondering if you also
think that you can convert that to being the standard of care for hips over time in other areas. Is that your
vision that it will be standard in many areas or more siloed?

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, the vision is for it to be standard of care everywhere where we have an application. Now I think it
will take longer. You've seen the adoption of hips has trailed knees. The adoption in partial knee was very,
very strong. I think the adoption in shoulder will be very, very strong. Knees will continue. And then I
think hips eventually, it's just going to take a little longer because, frankly, the satisfaction level of patients
with hips has been quite good relative to knees or relative to shoulder.

And I think over time, total ankles, there's many other areas that robotics will play in. And that's -- our
expectation is that it will become standard of care. Just a question of how long will that take, and then
what iterations are required for us to get there.

Sure. On the smoke evacuation, yes, I did reference that we had double-digit growth in that product line.
And honestly, even before COVID, most hospitals and caregivers have been very focused on safety and
smoke evac lines up extremely well with that safety focus.

I think with COVID, it's just sort of even more emphasized in terms of what that product does to the
environment that they operate in and how it contributes to the overall safety sort of platform and focus
that we're seeing across all hospitals.

curious to get your thoughts on how sustainable you think that is with some of the new product launches
you have heading into 2021.

Kevin A. Lobo

Yes. Look, we're accustomed to seeing our Neurovascular business do double-digit growth. This is
something they've been doing for -- since we acquired the business almost. Once the target launches got
rolled out and the ischemic segment started to grow and now that we have the flow diverting stent in the
U.S. market, the China market is continuing to grow very, very strongly.

So we expect to continue double-digit growth for some time with the tailwinds in ischemic and now really
addressing flow diverting stent and Aspiration, we've really got a -- we've had a terrific management
team for a long time that continue to be humming, and we expect that business to continue to perform

Stephen Christopher Beuchaw
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wonder if you could spend a bit more time on the ASC and outpatient environment. I think once upon
a time, there were questions around the category that were probably alluded in, in some concern about
pricing. But in this environment, it's clearly a tailwind. I know there was a question already about market
share. But can you speak a little bit about your procedure growth trends in ASCs and outpatients relative
to hospitals? How much you think that's a sustainable trend beyond COVID? And how do you think about
that commercially in as much as it could be a structural advantage as a multiline player versus a more
concentrated line-specific player? And then I do have a follow-up.

Kevin A. Lobo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, first, let's start by keeping in mind that a small number of our procedures, let's call it, around
10% of our large joint spine procedures that are being done in ASC. So it's not a big, big part of our
business yet, but the trend is no doubt headed for more of these procedures being done in the ASC. Part
of that is the change in Medicare around knees, and we expect that to happen in hips, and so it's a trend
that was already happening pre-pandemic. It's a trend that will accelerate going forward.

There's all kinds of prognostications about how much it will be. Could it be 50% of our procedures? It's
hard to predict how fast it will move. But we believe we're really, really well positioned for this trend.

And we do intend to be a multiline player. That's what the ASC actually wants. It's unlike how the hospitals
buy. They have a different buying pattern in the surgery center. And the breadth of our portfolio is a huge
advantage, and we plan to really leverage that strength wherever we can.

So we're feeling very good about it. It's a trend that -- and in terms of pricing, we're not seeing really any
change so far in the pricing dynamics. There is a constraint around capital. ASCs are much more capital
