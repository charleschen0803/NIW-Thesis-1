CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the CMS Energy 2020 First Quarter Results. The earnings news
release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's
website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern
Time, running through May 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's
website in the Investor Relations section.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and
Investor Relations.

Srikanth Maddipati
VP of IR & Treasurer

Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti
Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer.

This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please
refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially.

This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most
directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.

Now I'll turn the call over to Patti.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. We hope
that you're staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times.

This morning, I'll discuss our first quarter results and long-term outlook as well as provide an update
on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rejji will add more details on our financial results later and
discuss sensitivities related to COVID-19. And as always, we'll close with Q&A.

I'd like to start by acknowledging that this health crisis is affecting scores of people in really unimaginable
ways. My heart is with each of you, and I know that there will be a post COVID. May your family and
friends be stronger, closer and at peace when all of this is behind us.

You know what always keeps my team and I anchored is our focus on the long term and our commitment
to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. We have a track record of delivering industry-leading
financial performance, and we have solid fundamentals in our favor that have served us well in years past,
and will enable us to navigate today and in the future.

Now let's get to the numbers. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.86 in the first quarter,
despite challenging weather conditions in the onset of this unprecedented global pandemic. Our
first quarter results were $0.11 better than 2019 results for the same period, mostly driven by cost
management, regulatory outcomes and our ability to adapt to changing conditions, whether it be the
temperatures outside or adjusting to life under a stay-at-home order.

As the Stay Home, Stay Safe order is still in place for Michigan, and the situation is continuing to evolve,
it's too soon to provide an update on our guidance we issued on January 30. So given the fluidity of the
situation, at this time, we're not changing our guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

Though the current circumstance is certainly challenging, our investment thesis remains intact and our
business model resilient, both of which will support our long-term operational and financial objectives as
we continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%.

Let's take a moment to get everyone up to speed on what we're seeing here in Michigan, and what
we're doing to lessen COVID-related impacts on the communities that we serve. On March 23, Governor
Whitmer issued a stay-at-home order requiring all nonessential businesses to close until April 13,
which has now been extended until mid-May, with some loosening of retail and recreational restrictions
previously in place. Schools are closed for the remainder of the academic year.

Prior to the Governor's order, we established our Incident Command Structure, or ICS. So we were already
functioning in our emergency response mode as conditions worsened, particularly in the Southeast portion
of the state. Early on, we retained a Chief Medical Officer to help guide our operational decision-making
and ensure we could perform our necessary work safely. We instituted a travel ban for business activities
and the necessary self-quarantining for employees after any personal travel. We quickly transitioned
to a remote workforce, and I'm pleased that the team responded with great agility. For team members
in critical on-site operational roles, including those working in control rooms and at generating plants
and natural gas compression stations, we've implemented numerous safety protocols following all CDC
guidelines, including, and in some cases, sequestration.

For the remaining workforce, our coworkers are either working from home or reporting directly to the
job site from their homes to continue operations in the field and ensure their safety. At this time, we've
experienced 0 fatalities. And 11 of our over 8,000 coworkers, our work family, have tested positive for
COVID-19. Yet we're thankful that 7 of those coworkers have been able to return to work, and the each
identified case has yielded fewer and fewer ancillary cases of contact, which means our social distancing is
working. Our COVID-19 case rate is 3x less than the broader Michigan rate. We believe that our safe work
practices have been essential in protecting our coworkers from exposure to this virus.

We're taking biweekly poll surveys of our coworkers to see how they're doing during this time. And
I'm very proud to report that over 90% of our team is satisfied with how we're handling the COVID-19
pandemic as a company. Our safety culture and commitment to our people has been a source of strength
for all of us, and we'll remain deliberate in our efforts to keep our coworkers and our customers safe.

Beyond safety, we know our customers are facing economic challenges, and we've stepped up to support
them. Some of the most deeply impacted, at this time, are our small business customers, who are at the
heart of Michigan's economic engine. When we get on the other side of this current crisis, and there will be
another side, our small businesses will serve as an essential role in fueling the economy once again.

We know and love these customers and understand the hardships they're going through and have tailored
our services accordingly. We've redeployed our business customer care team to help our customers
navigate the state and federal assistance programs. We trained our team on the federal and state funding
available and created scripts and content, specifically tailored to our small business customers. And on
a personal level, some of you may have seen my husband, Eric, and I set up the Dream Maker Fund at
the onset of the crisis with a personal contribution, which has provided emergency relief to our small
businesses in Jackson, Michigan, where we live and where the company is headquartered. This has given
us a front-row seat on the small business impact of COVID-19 here in Michigan.

The company and Consumers Energy Foundation have also taken a number of actions to help our
vulnerable residential customers, including extending our payment protection plans through June 1,
disbursing over $1 million in grants and donations to facilitate the needs of our health care workers,
supporting our local food banks and charities as well as matching our coworkers' donations to local
charities.

Needless to say, we haven't lost track of you, our investors. We're mindful of the COVID-related risks on
our business, and we're always on the job identifying those risks and managing the work every year, in
every aspect of the business.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

We operate both the natural gas and electric business, and natural gas represents 1/3 of our revenues
at the utility, and is the fastest-growing segment. The bulk of our gas business margin comes from
our residential customers and is earned in the heating season, which ended in March. And we expect
residential gas sales to be normal in the fourth quarter.

While our electric deliveries are certainly down year-over-year, we'll remind you that we have a track
record of mitigating financial risk given the inherent volatility in our business, which I'll cover on the next
slide.

We're grateful for the leadership and partnership our Public Service Commission has demonstrated. We're
working together to make sure our coworkers are safe and our customers are cared for. The Commission is
collecting and reviewing costs related to COVID-19, including uncollectible accounts and sequestration and
quarantine-related costs. The Commission established deferred accounting for uncollectible expense above
what's currently approved in rates, which Rejji will elaborate on later, and speaks to the constructive
regulatory environment here in Michigan.

As we turn to Slide 6, we'll remind you that we've seen significant unforeseen challenges and double-
digit EPS downside in previous years. In fact, in 2016 and 2017, we had as much as $0.13 and $0.16 of
negative variance. And through conservative planning and a bottoms-up approach to cost management,
we were able to deliver on our operational and financial objectives. With that said, as a result of
anticipated COVID-related financial risks this year, like most, we've implemented several cost control
measures, such as a hiring freeze, reduced overtime and minimized travel and training expenses. Plus,
more sustainably, we'll rely on our ability to accelerate cost savings and waste elimination through our
Consumers Energy Way, to pursue our financial objectives without compromising customer service. Rejji
will provide some of the sensitivities for the risks we've highlighted and potential offsets.

As we gain more visibility in Q2 and beyond, we'll adjust our plan accordingly to remain agile and make
choices that mitigate the impact in 2020 and protect our long-term operational and financial performance.
While we don't know the ultimate impact of COVID-19, we do know how to manage and operate a world-
class business that delivers over the long term, and that brings us full circle as we talk to you today.

Our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged despite the near-term uncertainty presented by
COVID-19. Over the years, we've been good stewards of the balance sheet, maintaining a healthy level
of liquidity, and we plan conservatively. We still have a large and aging system and need a significant
investment. We still have a constructive regulatory environment, and we still have the CE Way that
enables us to serve our customers, while keeping their energy costs affordable.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Let me first echo Patti's comments by wishing each of you
and your loved ones safe passage through these trying times in which we live.

As Patti highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2020. We delivered adjusted net
income of $245 million or $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings excludes select nonrecurring items,
primarily related to costs resulting from a voluntary coworker separation program, which we commenced
in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the favorable reversal of an accrued expense related to tax reform.

For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.11 above our Q1 2019 result, largely
driven by rate relief, net investment-related expenses of utility and solid cost performance throughout our
business.

Switching gears to the COVID-19-related financial risk. As Patti noted, we are ever mindful to potential
impacts of COVID-19 on our business and have begun to implement cost control measures to mitigate
these risks. On Slide 9, we have provided a summary of potential impacts as well as several mitigating
factors, which should help reduce our exposure to some degree.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

First, I'll start with utility, which I'll remind you, represents over 90 -- about 90% of our business.
The effect of the pandemic in Michigan that Patti referenced has unsurprisingly reduced commercial
and industrial activity in the state, which has begun to materialize in our electric sales. Based on daily
volumetric trends extracted from our smart meters over the past month or so, we've seen declines in
weather-normalized commercial and industrial load of about 20% to 25%. The C&I load reduction has
been partially offset by residential load, which is up over 5% over the same time frame, presumably due
to mass teleworking and self-quarantine measures.

As noted in the past, the residential customer segment offers our highest margins and represents over
60% of our customer contribution for electric and gas combined, which I'll discuss in more detail later.
The other noteworthy financial risk to utility attributable to COVID-19 are potential increased costs and
uncollectible accounts due to delays in customer payments and sequestration and quarantine-related costs
to ensure the safety of our coworkers. As mentioned, we are working hard to mitigate these risks through
cost control measures and customer outreach programs. We also recently received an accounting order
from the commission to apply deferred accounting to uncollectible account expenses in excess of rates, as
Patti noted. And we'll soon file a response to this initial order, seeking approval to defer other costs related
to COVID-19, including sequestration and quarantine-related costs.

As for our nonutility businesses, which collectively represent about 10% of our earnings, the potential
risks are largely on the revenue side, and broadly speaking, are fairly well mitigated. At Enterprises, the
vast majority of its revenue streams are contracted at fixed prices with creditworthy counterparties.

It is also worth noting that Supreme Court of Michigan recently issued an order, upholding the MPSC's
ability to enforce a local clearing requirement for all energy providers in the state. Longer term, this
decision could create opportunities for DIG, given the favorable trends we've observed in the last 2
planning resource auctions in MISO for Zone 7, which just cleared at the cost of new entry.

With regards to EnerBank, the primary risk in the current environment are loan origination volume and a
potential increase in charge-offs. But it's important to remember that the business model of EnerBank is
unique. We are not underwriting mortgages or making auto or small business loans. EnerBank underwrites
home improvement loans, primarily to premium credit quality borrowers, whose average FICO scores are
above 750. This borrower base has proven to be relatively more resilient during economic downturns. And
in fact, in 2008, EnerBank's originations increased, given the relative elasticity of its core borrower base
and through market share gains at the expense of weaker capitalized competitors.

The final notable risk from an earnings perspective is in our parent and other segment, which is largely
comprised of nonrecoverable financing costs. And I'm pleased to report that due to proactive and cost-
effective liquidity management, from our treasury team, we have no remaining maturities in 2020. And it
fully priced our planned equity issuance needs for the year through forward contracts, which I'll elaborate
on later.

Circling back on the utility sales risk, which we view as the most substantial risk to our business in the
current environment, Slide 10 highlights the relative contribution mix of our customer segments and the
lower reductions we've witnessed since late March.

As you'll note, the residential segment represents approximately 60% and 75% of the customer
contribution for the electric and gas businesses, respectively, and over 60% of the total customer
contribution at the utilities I highlighted earlier. So any uptick in growth in the residential segment should
partially offset the expected declines we anticipate in the commercial and industrial segments. All in,
given the current sales trends we've observed since the public response to the pandemic, we estimate
approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS dilution per month.

As Patti noted, at this point, it's too early to tell how long and to what extent social distancing measures
will remain in place, or how strong the economic recovery in Michigan will be upon its conclusion. As such,
we have provided this monthly sensitivity for your modeling purposes, and we'll keep you abreast of any
material changes to our plan.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

On Slide 11, in our waterfall chart, you can see the key factors impacting our financial performance
relative to 2019. Despite an unusually warm winter, which offered $0.23 of negative variance versus Q1
of 2019, the absence of the substantial service restoration cost due to storms we experienced last year,
coupled with last September supportive gas rate order and cost performance throughout the business,
delivered $0.11 of net positive variance versus the first quarter of 2019. Depending on the extent to which
the financial risks of COVID-19 manifest, we believe the glide path illustrated on this slide could enable
us to achieve our EPS guidance as we plan for normal weather and anticipate a constructive order in our
pending gas case in mid-October.

As mentioned, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on Michigan's economy and our business remains
uncertain, so we have referenced the estimated monthly EPS dilution of $0.03 to $0.04 in the event the
level of sales degradation that we have witnessed to date persists. Further, we will closely monitor the
potential risk to our business, some of which have been mitigated through regulatory support. We have
also added the historical range of annual financial risks that we have successfully mitigated over the past
several years, which equates to approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share or $40 million to $70 million
pretax.

Clearly, we have a strong track record of managing work and delivering cost reductions through our lean
operating system, the CE Way and other initiatives. And as Patti noted, we have already implemented an
initial wave of cost control measures.

Needless to say, we are not here to represent that any downside scenario can be overcome, particularly
given the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic. However, we are confident that we can minimize
the financial risk in 2020 without jeopardizing our long-term value proposition to our customers and
investors.

As we execute on risk mitigation strategies, you'll note on Slide 12 that we have prioritized liquidity
management and have over $2.3 billion of net liquidity available, which includes unrestricted cash and
untapped -- uncapped revolving credit facility capacity as of March 31. We've always managed our balance
sheet in a conservative manner. And so while there have been a lot of concerns regarding access to the
commercial paper market, I'll remind everyone that we do not rely on CP as a permanent layer of funding,
nor do we have any outstanding at this time.

As part of our funding strategy for the year, we put in place term loans at the parent and the utility for
$300 million each, and those don't mature until 2021. And in mid-March, we issued $575 million of first
mortgage bonds at a rate of 3.5%, which addresses our sole maturity across our debt-issuing entities in
2020 and funds our capital programs.

From an equity financing perspective, we announced on our Q4 call, our plans to issue up to $250 million
of equity, all of which is priced under existing equity forward contracts. And we drew down approximately
$100 million of that capacity in late March. We expect future equity issuances can be completed through
our ATM program, which we will likely refile in the coming months. All of our financings have been
executed at terms favorable to our plan, which offer entry year savings and help derisk the future. As
we look forward, we'll continue to maintain flexibility and capitalize on accommodative market conditions
when they emerge.

I'll end with our credit metrics on Slide 13, which remain well above the threshold for investment-grade
ratings among all 3 credit rating agencies. Our focus on maintaining a strong financial position, coupled
with a supportive regulatory environment and predictable operating cash flow growth, supports our strong
ratings. And we'll look to maintain our strong credit quality, with an eye toward the future, to the benefit
of customers and investors.

And with that, I'll pass it back to Patti for some closing comments before we open up the lines for Q&A.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Rejji. My coworkers and I remain on the job every day for our customers and for you, our owners.
We're focused on delivering an essential service to nearly 6.7 million of our fellow Michiganders. The

capital you all provide is critical, and our long-term track record of managing that capital speaks to that
commitment.

As I mentioned, we've been good stewards of our balance sheet, with prudent planning and our
conservative liquidity management continues. Already for 2020, we executed financings at attractive rates
that enable us to fund our capital programs. Our operational excellence shines through during times like
these. As we continue to rely on the CE Way and lean in on that lean operating system we have in place,
we improve each and every day. We put to work efficiencies that drive down cost and eliminate waste. And
I can tell you, that system is in overdrive right now, which speaks to our agility as we shift accordingly
depending on how this current environment evolves.

Since the 2008 energy law was established and updated again in 2016, Michigan has remained a top-
tier regulatory jurisdiction. With forward-looking test years and 10-month rate cases, we're fortunate to
have such a constructive regulatory framework in statute. We also have a supportive commission, as you
can see by the recent order responding to the pandemic for the protection of vulnerable customers, while
being mindful of the utility being able to fund its operations and attract low-cost, long-term capital.

Our system remains in great need of replacements and upgrades, and that won't go away as a result of
the current pandemic. Again, we're fortunate that our plans have embedded structural cost reductions
in the form of retiring coal plants and PPAs expiring. Finally, none of this comes at a price to our planet
and the great state of Michigan we all love so dearly. Our net-zero carbon and methane goals remain as
important today as the day we established them.

Our model holds together well. That's why this thesis remains intact, and that's why we can rely on our
triple bottom line to get us through this current crisis just as it has in the past and will do so in the future.
With that, Allison, will you please open the lines for Q&A?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Couple of questions here. So first off, you talked about the $0.03 to $0.04 impact per month based on the
sales sensitivities that you provided on Slide 10. You're, obviously, levelizing this. But should we expect
any kind of peaks or troughs over the next 2 quarters? I mean some utilities assumed business closures
in Q2, some return in Q3, and a bit more of a mean reversion in Q4. I know we're only 2 months into this,
but just trying to get a sense on the monthly profile of your sensitivities you assume and plan or really
what the guidance can withstand. Obviously, on Slide 4, there seems to be a little bit of cautious language
around the uncertainty of duration and the full impact of COVID. So I know what are your prelim thoughts,
even though it's very early stage?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Shar, thanks for asking. We've tried to be really transparent here. We have a track record of offsetting
negative impacts, the EPS, as you mentioned, ranging in as much $0.10 to $0.15. We also have a track
record of transparency, which is why we've tried to be as direct and forthcoming as we can about the C&I
sales that have dropped 20% to 25% versus expectations. And with then the offsetting residential sales
up over 5%, the earnings impact, as you've mentioned and what we've said, is $0.03 to $0.04 per month
under the current conditions.

Now here's the variables. How fast will businesses bounce back? How soon will people gather in public
spaces? How quickly will manufacturers be able to start making nonessential goods again? Our stay-at-
home order is still in place until May 15. Will the government stimulus help so that the small businesses
can come back after this? At this point, there's just too many unknowns, Shar. And so while we'll continue
to remain conservative, we don't feel that we know enough right now. And so, I guess, I would offer
this thing. One thing you can count on us to do is to call it straight. We've never overpromised and then
underdelivered and nor have we really underpromised and overdelivered. We do what we say.

I'm comfortable in the fact that our long-term fundamentals are the same, and our short-term actions
will stand the test of time. One of the things, Shar, that I think about a lot is that our customers, our
coworkers and our regulators, will long remember how we handle these temporary times. I feel good
about that because we're doing the right things. And we, like always, are acting with the long term
in mind. And the long-term outlook has not changed, and our fundamentals remain sound. So as we
think about any adjustments we would make this year or any actions we would take this year, we're
always thinking about the next year and the next. And so we're balancing all of those factors and doing
everything we can to serve the triple bottom line.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then let me just -- let's assume this is a little bit more protracted. Can you talk about sort of
the incremental levers? As you mentioned, 12 to -- $0.10 to $0.15 of historical flex range on Slide 11. Do
you have more?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

What I would say is our historical performance is a good indicator, but we've also -- now we're about 4
years into the CE Way, and that thing is on overdrive. And our team is on the job. They're looking for

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

waste elimination all across the organization. We have 1,254 projects already identified this year, started a
time reduction.

Some of the things that we're doing now, as a result of the crisis, such as job site reporting, are actually
saving money. And so it's both a combination of current factors. There's current environmental things that
allow us to save money, plus our CE Way and the waste elimination and our ability to deploy our team to
as much long-term capital work are the kinds of ways that we see tackling this challenge in a sustainable
way. We're always thinking about the next year and the next. And so the cost savings that we would do
would only be those that don't do damage to the future. The one thing we think about, we're not going to
pull out all the stops and do damage to future years to hit some kind of unreasonable outcome this year.
We're going to be in it for the long haul. And I think that's why people trust us and invest in us.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just lastly, the volume reductions on the C&I side, the 20% to 25% reduction that you've
seen since March. Can -- is that sort of auto or auto supplier related? What drove that?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

We have limited exposure to auto, less than 2% Tier 1 suppliers plus the automotive themselves to
our margin. What we're seeing is more the stay home order closed all restaurants. It closed all retail,
other than nonessential retail like grocery. And so that's where we're really seeing a lot -- and small
manufacturers that aren't making essential goods.

As I mentioned, my husband and I did this fund, and so we've had an opportunity to look at all the
applications just in Jackson County. And it's a whole range of things, golf courses, restaurants, bakeries,
retail, little manufacturing shops, welding shops. They're in a holding pattern right now waiting for the
order to be lifted. And some of those businesses, even after the order is lifted, will be affected by people's
reticence to gather in groups. Others will get right back at it. And so we see a balance between some
of them just purely waiting for May 15, and they'll be back on it full time, and there will be others that
may have a demand reduction because of people's fear. And so again, there's a lot of unknowns. And
fortunately, our smart meter data is very accurate, and we can see real-time what's happening, and it
helps us make better decisions and better choices.

Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research, LLC.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just first on the sales, that March to April data. Do you have just an overall number across the class --
the overall sales change?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Rejji, what's our total sales adjustment then?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we don't have -- if you're talking about post Q1 beyond March 31, we do not have a full read
across all of our customers. Because smart meter data, while it hit a good portion of our customers,
there are select classes of large industrial and commercial customers that do not have smart meter data
available. We do get good anecdotal evidence from those customers and do get good visibility, but we
don't get perfect information really until we get to the end of the quarter. So there are some limitations in
that.

But I would say, Steve, going back to Patti's comments, the 20% to 25% we highlight here again,
that is not indicative of all of our customers, but it's a decent read for now for that monthly read that
we've offered from late March through kind of mid- to late April. So that's -- again, it's not every single
customer, but it's a decent portion of them.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Yes, I was just curious because when we've looked at regions, we're not really seeing any region
down more than 10% or so. But, obviously, that doesn't get 2 individual states or territories. So I'm just
kind of trying to compare it to some of the regional data we've seen. But -- yes.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Steve, I would say 10% total is a decent bogey that -- for our customer base as well. You're in the
neighborhood for sure.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

That's exactly right.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. And then on this $0.03 to $0.04 per month thing data, a lot of utilities have different
-- depending on the season, the earnings impacts of the same sales change can vary, like a summer
month might be worth more than a shoulder month. So could you just talk about the seasonality of that
sensitivity, and just thinking about it this year?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Well, we always deal with seasonality in the weather, and that's what we, certainly -- weather and storms,
we've done a good job overcoming. In this scenario, there are so many, I would suggest, Steve, bigger
drivers than just the weather. That seasonality is, obviously, clearly, a variable, but not nearly as much as
some of the unknowns associated with the rate that businesses return to action.

I don't know, Rejji, you might want to add something to that, so go ahead.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The only thing I would add is, certainly, the timing of this is somewhat fortunate because we do
expect higher volumes as it starts to go a little warmer, particularly in the residential class now. So you'll
see more industrial activity sort of as you get past those shoulder months. And so the timing of this, I
guess, is you could have it happen at any time, which you don't root for, this would be the time to have it.
And so certainly, there are greater expectations for load once you get beyond sort of the March, April time
frame.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Maybe I should have asked the question different.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll just chime in one last thing, Steve. One of the points that we recognize is that even after an order
is lifted, it's likely, and I'm hearing from a lot of businesses, that they'll keep their people working from
home if they can. And so that residential bump may continue into the summer months. And obviously, air

conditioning load is a big driver in Michigan sales in the summertime. And so if all of those folks are still,
or if a lot of people are still working from home, that, obviously, has a favorable impact in the summer
months.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Maybe I should have just asked. Do you have a summer, winter kind of rate differential? Or is it
pretty much the same rate all year?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Generally, the same rate all year. So next year, we'll be implementing a more of a summer peak rate, but
it's generally about the same throughout the year.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. Okay. And then one last question. Just could you talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing so
far on nonpayments? And kind of how notable that might be? Any color there?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

We are watching that. One of the things with the uncollectible accounts is they do lag. And so we can
see, to some degree, it's very early. If you can imagine, it's at a minimum, a 30-day lag, before we know
if somebody didn't pay their bill. And so sometimes the uncollectible accounts really take almost 3 to 6
months to show up and to really be accounted for. And so we're watching. We're seeing a slight uptick, but
it's early. We haven't even crossed all of the cycles for some of the customers.

Operator

Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just to follow up on some of those last questions. Can you speak to how some of this will be handled in
the ongoing rate cases, right? You have almost annual electric rate cases. And there's an ongoing case
that we just saw in February. So how does that case get updated for changes to load, changes -- and
changes to uncollectibles and everything else?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The cases are filed. Our gas case, we filed in December, and our electric case, we filed here in
February. So there's not a clean way to have a significant substantive change to sales. And frankly, it
would be hard to do it because we have forward test years. So what sales figure would we predict. So
we expect that our rate cases will continue as planned. And because we do annual filings in the future,
if there's a permanent degradation to sales, then, we would reflect it. But it's pretty hard to capture a
temporary degradation in sales like the one we're seeing in any kind of active filing.

The good news is that our commission has been very supportive. Just a shout-out to the Michigan Public
Service Commission, and all their folks, for adapting so quickly to this changing condition. They've already
started holding their meetings and conducting business remotely through webcast. They, too, have had a
significant impact. So thanks to all of them for acting so quickly and working with us on this new order for
the CV-19 costs as well as the uncollectible accounts and trying to make sure that we, as a utility, are in
a position to serve our customers well, do what's right, care for our most vulnerable customers and know
that we can still function in a strong financial position that reflects the capital attraction that we need to

demonstrate. And so great partnership with the Commission and all their team working so hard to just
figure out these unknowables together.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. And could you contemplate lower capital spending, if necessary, if things drag on long enough?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Right now, we're not seeing that in the plan. And in fact, we're working hard to make sure that, for
example, our power plants, because energy load and demand is down, are an economic reserve, a couple
of our coal plants. And so that gives us an opportunity to pull ahead of capital outage at that plant earlier
in the year than we had originally planned. So I don't -- we don't have any plans in the near term to have
any adjustment to our capital plan. In fact, we're going to really work hard to make sure we keep that
plan on track.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And on DIG, just wanted to ask about the local clearing requirement. It doesn't look like the impact
of that Supreme Court decision would probably have to be coming from 2024 and beyond. I just wanted to
make sure about that.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It -- because DIG is basically fully contracted, it doesn't have any certain impact on 2020, minimal in
2021, but there could be some out-year impact that could be beneficial. But again, just keep in mind that
DIG is predominantly contracted, as Rejji had mentioned, with high-quality off-takers.

We are pleased with the outcome of that order though. And shout-out to our legal team, took it all the way
to the Supreme Court of Michigan, did a great job advocating for the Public Service Commission and their
authority to require a local clearing requirement. The law that we worked so hard to pass back in 2016,
that was a fundamental element of it to make sure that Michigan, as a Peninsula Zone 7, has adequate
supply to serve the load. And with our kind of hybrid retail open access, 10%, it does put at risk reliability
in the state. So very happy with that outcome, and very thankful and proud of my legal team for the great
work that they did.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes, it looks good. One last question on AMT credits and acceleration in the stimulus bill, have you guys
quantified that at all?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we've benefited -- and remember, it's just a cash benefit, but about $30 million of AMT credits will
pull forward in 2020 that would have originally been refunded in 2021. Again, that just affects cash, not
earnings any way.

Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So just wanted to follow up. So you all are maintaining your guidance. So when you think about the sales
forecast that you're embedding in that, I understand the $0.03 to $0.04 here and sort of as a sensitivity,

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

but what are you specifically thinking about in making that statement to reaffirm rather than withdraws?
We've seen perhaps more so in other sectors, and to be even more specific about it, I think you alluded to
perhaps $0.15 or $0.16 historical perhaps cost flexibility in your plans. Can you talk to that, too, as you
think about what the latitude reaffirmed here?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

So Julien, and I know everyone wants precision in these uncertain times. And there's a reason why the
word unprecedented is like the #1 word in use these days. We just haven't been here before. So as
we said, it's just too soon for us to update our guidance. And it would mean that we know exactly how
the health crisis ends, how the economy will look afterwards. And frankly, we don't know. And so there
are reasons to believe in a bounce back. The federal stimulus is working, we're watching it help small
businesses. But can the businesses get access to it? Construction, manufacturing, ag can bounce back
quickly and work safely, but will there be demand? I talked to an office furniture CEO. Most of the office
furniture in the world is made right here in Michigan. And I talked to one of the CEOs last week, and they
may be at all-time highs because they say workplaces need to be reorganized and new furniture is going
to be required, or maybe none of us are reporting to an office ever again. There's just a lot of changes.
Will there be a drive in residential electricity demand? We've talked about that already, maybe there will
be. The shelter-in-place order can be lifted, but how long will people feel -- will it be before people feel
safe to congregate in a public gathering? I don't know. We don't know. But here's what we do know,
Julien. We know that we need our coworkers healthy and motivated to do our capital plan. And it's a good
infrastructure plan that serves the people of Michigan. We need our regulators to trust that we're doing
what's right and taking care of both our coworkers and our customers. We need our customers to be with
us and to survive this pandemic and be open for business when it's over, which is why we're working so
hard to serve them with new information and help them navigate the circumstances.

What we can do is continue to run this business and look to mitigate costs and risks as they come up and
never lose focus. And as I mentioned earlier, on the long-term fundamentals, they're solid, right? The
fundamentals of the business are the same. How we handle it in this temporary condition, as I mentioned,
will be long remembered. And so the cost savings, additional cost savings, what we would do to mitigate
it, are all going to be with an eye on the future. We're not going to take short-term risks on tomorrow's
performance. And so we're going to do our darndest, you know us, you know how we think and how we
operate. Again, our CE Way is a great source of comfort to me because we've actually developed some
real capability across the organization. And this is in overdrive, as I mentioned. So given all of that, I
would say it's too soon to say, but trust me, we're not waiting on the sidelines to figure it out.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And then related question, super quick. I mean, you all are working proactively with the PSC here
to address recovery of certain items. How do you think about that being reflected? Again, in numbers,
specifically, I just want to hear as you continue to move through the course of the year. I just want to be
clear about that, given some differences in the sector.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're going to have to see. We'll be filing our response. They've asked for comments, which is very
important and constructive. We need to hear from a lot of people as we make these determinations. Once
the accounting is clarified and we've got certainty about that, then we can account for it. And it will have
benefits, obviously, in 2020.

They've been pretty clear about the uncollectible expenses as a result of a mandate to not shut off our
most vulnerable customers, our seniors and low income, through June 1. And so they've been pretty clear
about those uncollectible expenses and the accounting treatment thereof, but it's really some of the other
expenses and exactly the timing of that uncollectibles, when it materializes, et cetera. So others, we'll be

weighing in. And certainly, I can't speak for the MPSC, but I can just say that we're working together to
make sure that we're able to serve the most vulnerable constructively.

Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Wanted to give congrats on all the community outreach efforts that you all are making, looks like a lot of
great stuff going on. Wanted to -- a lot of my questions have been addressed. But just on the EnerBank
side of things, could you just talk a little bit more about new business opportunities that you're seeing? I
guess I'm certainly not a bank analyst, but I would have thought sort of home improvement activity will
be going down a great deal. But I was just curious what you're seeing on sort of new business.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Well, I've been doing all the talking. So I'm going to hand it over to Rejji. He is the Chairman of the
EnerBank Board. I'll let him speak about the great work that the EnerBank team is up to. Go ahead, Rejji.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Patti. So Stephen, I would say that, certainly, we did see a little bit of a slowdown in March on
origination volume, but we've actually been encouraged with what we're seeing in April. And it's important
to note a couple of things. So every state has a different approach to the executive orders that have
rolled out. But financial services is deemed an essential service, and that's a federal mandate. And so
we've managed to continue our underwriting, and also construction projects that are work in progress are
equipped for all intents and purposes. Those bits of work have also been permitted to continue on. And so
we really haven't seen the type of slowdown you would anticipate for some of the loans that EnerBank has
historically underwritten. So I would say, encouraged by what we're seeing in April, unsurprisingly, a little
bit of a slowdown in March, and we still think they started the quarter off -- or the year off pretty well,
about $0.01 above the prior year. And we're only asking for about $0.01 to $0.02 of growth year-over-
year for them, and they appear to be on track.

And so the other opportunities, as you think about origination volume, is also on the gain share side. And
so what we've seen in the past, particularly in '08, '09, is you had a lot of weaker capitalized competitors
who kind of fell by the wayside, and we've already seen anecdotally some large customers come our
way because they know that EnerBank is in it for the long haul. This is their primary focus. And so we've
actually taken some share, which we also did in '08, '09.

And so just existing originations and continuing to execute on our plan as well as taking share also create
opportunities this year. And so we feel good about the road ahead where we sit at this point.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's really helpful, Rejji. And then just one other question on your 2020 EPS slide, Slide 11, more of a
housekeeping item. But just, you mentioned the historical flex range of $0.10 to $0.15 on that slide. And I
just wondered what time frame. Is that annual? Is that for the 9 months to go? I just want to make sure I
understood that.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Rejji, you can go ahead.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

Sure. Great. So yes, we look at that range, and it's based on what we've done historically over the last
several years. And so we've seen that level of negative variance in a quarter, we've seen over the course
of the year. But we've managed -- in historical context, overcome levels of flex of that magnitude or levels
of negative variance of that magnitude. As I look at this year, we certainly think that $0.10 to $0.15 year
to go is certainly within us. And let's just think about what that math equates to. So on the low end, about
$40 million pretax, on the high end, call it, $60 million to $65 million. And when you think about our
year-to-go spend, we've got about $1 billion of, I'll say, actionable opportunities between operating and
nonoperating cost pool. So that reduction equates to a little more than 5%, which is certainly within us.

And so not to suggest it's easy, and to Patti's earlier point, we're not going to do anything that's rash or
detrimental to the years to come. And so we do feel like it's within us. But at the end of the day, we'll have
to see how this situation in Michigan materializes, and we'll make prudent decisions as we always do.

Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

My questions were just answered.

Operator

And our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

To go back to this $0.03 to $0.04 monthly EPS impact from lower volumes, if I'm reading that correctly,
that's only on the electric side. Do you have preliminary April data for gas demand? And what that might
mean for a monthly run rate? It's a shoulder season, of course, but do you have any kind of ballpark rule
of thumb for the gas side?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. First of all, as I mentioned, Andrew, our -- the bulk of our gas is certainly during the heating season,
and that is behind us, that ends in March. And so the $0.03 to $0.04 represents electric and gas for your
sensitivities.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Good. Then last question is for the 2 rate cases outstanding, have the conversations changed
much given COVID-19? I know you're always laser-focused on affordability. But are you hearing more
concerns about things like the jump in unemployment and that we're presumably in a recession? And as
part of that, do you see any potential for the timing to be elongated, whether that's due to logistics or
affordability concerns?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Affordability is always factored into our filings to begin with. And so, for example, gas. Our gas bills, our
customers' bills are down 30%, because of commodity benefits. And so I personally think there's no time
like now, with the commodity prices where they are and how, it's clear, they're going to remain where they
are, that we make the system safer.

The system safety and the priority of the infrastructure investments on that system don't change because
of this. And thankfully, the commodity price is so low, so we can continue to keep our bills affordable, both
on the electric and the gas. Net-net, we're starting to really pay attention to the percent of household

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

wallet that our bills play in. And they're in the 3% to 3.5% combined gas and electric. And we feel like
that's extremely affordable. And so that's always been the focus in our cases, and it will continue to be,
but we feel good given the combination of the commodity price, plus the value that the infrastructure
investment has for customers.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Andrew, you also asked about just process and timing. And the only thing I would add to that end
is that the Commission has, like a lot of organizations and businesses and Michigan has transitioned
quite nicely to mass teleworking and they have not missed a beat to date. And so we've had very close
communications with them. They have managed to keep up their adjudicated processes. And we also
highlighted that they had a meeting on the 15th, where they gave us that very constructive order on the
COVID-19-related costs.

So they are on track. But it's also worth noting that per the statute, there is a 10-month stipulated period.
And so in the event, there are delays, we do have the legal right to self-implement at that 10-month
period, which for gas, is around mid-March, and for electric, it's in very late December.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And just clarify though, on affordability, I think that was a great recap of
your side of it. My question was more from interveners or regulators themselves or staff, has there been
any kind of heightened concern about it, given what's going on in the economy?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

I think their concerns are consistent with concerns in the past, that we will be concerned and they are,
too. And so we're pretty well aligned in that attention and focus.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Andrew, one more thing, just to circle back. Apologies, but gas, the timing of that is mid-October, I
mentioned mid-March, mid-October, excuse me.

Okay. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the renewable side. How much
were you expecting in terms of project completion or contracts to sign this year? And what are your
thoughts? What are you seeing in terms of being able to get to those numbers, plus or minus, your
expectations for the year?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Our big projects this year are a couple of wind projects that are scheduled to close by year-end, and
both of those are on track. We have been issued force majeure letters, but that doesn't mean that work
stops. It's just sort of a forewarning that there may be a shortage in access to equipment, whether it's
turbines or some other equipment.

So we have been notified. But to date, the projects have not been delayed. And so we are on track. We've
continued construction through this time period. And so, as of now, everything is on track.

knew the seriousness of the COVID situation. Any chance, any metrics that they might be looking at here
in the next couple of quarters in terms of making a dividend change, given the raise last quarter?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would suggest that there's no planned change to our dividend policy or strategy. Things would have
to change very dramatically for there to be a change in that light. So we have a Board meeting next week.
We'll be reviewing with them, certainly -- later this week, rather, we've got a Board meeting. And so we'll,
obviously, be talking with them about a range of scenarios, but none of those scenarios, at this time,
contemplate any change to the dividend policy.

Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Going to appreciate the granularity in the slides as always. Just wanted to start with a quick clarification.
I think I'm understanding this correctly, but in response to Steve's question, you mentioned 10% decline.
Is that across all classes? So the sensitivity of $0.03 to $0.04 EPS hit per month, that is based on the
commercial industrial, 20%, 25%. That's what you're seeing as of March, but the 10% is across all
classes, is that right?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Correct.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up. You mentioned you've previously been able to offset
double-digit EPS headwinds through some of the cost mitigation efforts. Could you point to something in
terms of what can you do? Are those things onetime in nature? Or could you take costs out of the business
longer term? Any examples or any color would be helpful.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Well, Durgesh, thank you for asking. I've been waiting to share my story of the month. I'm just going to
assume that's what you're asking me for. So here we go, even in these times. So in fact, I think this one
might be the story of this era. We've discovered that we can work remotely. So let me just give you some
numbers. So in an annual period, we typically spend about $10 million a year reimbursing mileage. We
have a large geographic service area, and people have felt compelled to be in person for meetings and
events. Frankly, I'm the one who makes them. I like to see people. I like to be with people. So I say, hey,
come on out, be in person.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

But based on this circumstance and the COVID-19, we've been forced to learn to use technology, and it's
working actually. And it's sort of a triple bottom line story of the month because, first of all, people are
safer, certainly, at this time because of COVID, but also minimizing mileage and driving reduces the risk of
a vehicle accident. The planet is better off with less vehicle emissions, and our profits are better because
the costs are lower.

So we can do video calls. They work. I used to avoid the face-to-face video calls, we'd just do the dial-
in, and they're not the same, and we've learned. And frankly, I think there's a business to be had for the
Judy Jetson masks. And if you're too young to know what I'm talking about, just YouTube, Judy Jetson
mask. There's an opportunity because sometimes we don't want to see our messy hair. And without
the salons being open, everyone's hair is looking pretty messy and the dog's barking. But the truth be
told, we've set this big ambition that we come together by staying apart, and we're finding our culture
is getting activated. People actually are coming closer. It's very interesting time. But on the fundamental
cost, $10 million in mileage, you can bet we're going to be reimbursing less than that. There's other
things that we do on the waste elimination. We've got a host, as I said, 1,254 projects. Some of it is
shortening our, what's called, nonpremise time. When a crew goes to a service center, shows up to pick
up materials and then reports to the job site, there can be an hour there that is considered nonpremise
time, that's expensed. Their capital work doesn't commence until they start on the job site. So the fact
that we can get people to job sites more quickly, and we're redesigning our supply chain so that materials
can be available on-site as opposed to people having to come to service centers, is actually another great
example of how this current circumstance is, it's creating innovation, but permanent waste elimination
that we can deploy in years to come.

Our next question today will come from Ryan Levine of Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Do any of your O&M or CapEx contracts have force majeure contract provisions that are impacted by this
pandemic?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Well, as I mentioned, we've had force majeure notices on some of our large renewable projects, but
they're not affecting the timing or the outcome of those projects at this time.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

So there's no impact on O&M contracts or any of the other contracts?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

We've not had any notifications of that on our other contracts.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And then can you provide more color on the potential items included in the cost reduction initiative
flex that you highlighted? And what portion are more temporary in nature versus long term?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So a hiring freeze is obviously temporary. But things like -- we've started using technology, and we
were starting this before the pandemic, that's why I'm so grateful that our CE Way has been in place now
for several years because we've been deploying capabilities to our top waste opportunities.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2020

So here's a great example. We've been, what's called, auto dispatching storm crews. So in the past, we
would wait for, in that -- call it, a year ago, we would have a customer call us, notify that their power was
out. We would start to aggregate all that data in a dispatch center, and then a person would determine,
okay, we have this many outages on this circuit, and they would schedule a crew. Well, now we have
automated all of that. We've used our digital capabilities, our IT team and our engineering and operations
teams have been working together and agile teams actually all across the company, but this is one
example of how they now auto dispatch storm crews. That saves 30 minutes on an outage per customer,
and it eliminates the actual work of doing the dispatching because it's done by a computer. It's more
accurate, and it's cheaper. So it's just things like that all across the company. I think it's tempting for
management teams to want to have big line items. We're a believer in the CE Way and our continuous
improvement mindset says little line items all across the company are going to be more sustainable and
have grander benefits in the long run to both the experience for customers as well as our fundamental
cost structure.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then last question from me. What are you seeing in terms of working capital fluctuations in light of
the directionally 10%, will it decline post COVID-19? Is there any meaningful fluctuations that impact your
financing plan?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Rejji, you want to talk through the financing plan a little bit?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, happy to. Yes. So the quick answer is working capital actually has been fairly smooth, or I'll just say,
aligning with plan. As mentioned, we have no CP outstanding. And generally, that would be, I'll say, a
supplemental source of financing if we saw unpredictable working capital swings. But we, obviously, have
been able to manage the working capital volatility to date, and there hasn't been much of that. And so we
have not seen, at this point, any really material changes in working capital.

But as Patti highlighted earlier, there's a bit of a lag when it comes to receivables aging. And so we'll
continue to keep an eye on that. We, obviously, are very flush from a cash perspective as evidenced by
our proactive financings that we did at the end of the quarter. So a little over $700 million in cash. And
that plus our revolving facility capacity gives us about a $2.3 billion net liquidity position. So we certainly
feel like we have enough dry powder to manage any future volatility. But I haven't seen a whole lot to
date, to be honest.

And our next question today will come from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Just wanted to go back to the C&I demand numbers again. I think I remember that there was a large
customer kind of pre-COVID that sort of already was a bit of a drag on your kind of your year-on-year
comparables. Am I remembering that correctly? And kind of how much of that 20% to 25% that customer
represents, those already known?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

That is correct. We have one large customer who had some contracts bought out at the end, actually
partway through last year. And so they're reflected in last year's sales and this year's sales, and they're

operating now. So they are actually essential, which is good, but they are at diminished loads. So they are
a portion of that 20% to 25%.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. But some of that then would already have been planned for when you were thinking about your
2020 guidance?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

That's true.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Heading into the year.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

We factored that into our plan for this year.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then not to, I guess, beat a dead horse here, but just on the flex range, when we think about
the $0.10 to $0.15 that you guys have talked about historically speaking, now I know there's a lot of
unknowns going forward with 2020. But when you kind of achieve those levels, those were more or less to
kind of meet your earnings target specifically, like you had a certain amount of negative in that year and
then you flex to meet that, and that's kind of what you're illustrating for us here today?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

That's right. That's right. And it's been true on the other side as well that when we've had favorability,
we've pulled in costs and prepared for the next year. And so the thing that I don't want lost on anyone is
that we are always preparing not just for this quarter or this year, but for years to come. And that's what
has made us so reliable at delivering and doing exactly what we said we're going to do. And so that flex
has upside and downside, that's why Slide 6 shows that, that range of up and down. And obviously, this is
a down year, and we are doing everything we can to leverage our skills and capability of adapting in that
range.

Our next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So just, first of all, congratulations on the Supreme Court victory. Is that -- I'm assuming that's it for the
state. But is there any other appeal or anything going on at the federal level? Or are we finally finished
with this proceeding?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

There's one other aspect to the local clearing requirement that is still being determined, and it's a very
procedural element. But fundamentally, reconfirming that the Public Service Commission has the authority
to establish a local clearing requirement was a very important outcome. They have returned then the
proceedings, the procedures back to the MPSC for implementation. So there's -- it still needs to be

implemented, I guess, I should say. But the order was very important, and the ruling by the Supreme
Court was very important.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay, great. And then with respect to the bill payment trends that people have been asking about. I'm
sorry if I missed this, but in terms of not, let's say, technically what's uncollectible or bad debt or anything
like that, but just in general, do you have any -- if you gave it, I apologize for missing it. But -- so just
what the cadence has been in terms of people paying, let's say, for April? Like for instance, we're hearing
-- I saw one statistic that 1/3 of people didn't -- yes, this is nationwide, didn't pay their rent for April that
they were sort of late paying their April rent in the first few weeks. Do you have any numbers sort of like
that for what you're sort of experiencing there on the ground?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Not yet, but we do know. We do have call volume from business and residential customers asking for
what we would call grace and extension of payment plans, and so we are doing that. As we talk to these
businesses, they typically have 3 big concerns. One is rent, as you've described, two is payroll, three is
utilities. And so we've been able to be a source of support to them, and we feel comfortable extending
those payment plans, but that doesn't necessarily then translate into an uncollectible, particularly for our
business customers. And so -- and we've got some really good community action agencies and support
resources for residential customers that can help them make their payments on time in the short run as
well. So I would suggest that our forecast isn't good yet. There's more to come and more to learn. And
certainly, by Q2, we'll have a much better eye on being able to quantify that.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then just finally on Enterprises. The $0.04 benefit, and I apologize again if I just missed this,
but what drove that?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Rejji, do you want to talk through the Enterprises' quarter?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Happy to. Yes, Paul, it was a combination of 2 things. So one, it was just the absence of an outage in
Q1. So Filer City did an outage last year, and so there was the absence of that. And then just good cost
performance at Enterprises. And so that's really what drove the $0.04 positive variance.

Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the
conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remarks.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Allison. And again, thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our call. Please continue to
stay safe, and be well. And we really look forward to seeing you face-to-face when we can. We miss you
all. Thanks so much.
