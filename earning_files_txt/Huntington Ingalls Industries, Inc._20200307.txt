HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2020 Huntington Ingalls
Industries, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mike Petters, Chief Executive
Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.

Dwayne B. Blake
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Misty. This is Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Good morning, and welcome
to the Huntington Ingalls Industries First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Mike
Petters, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kastner, our Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer.

As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking
statements and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may
differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results
to vary materially from anticipated results.

Also in their remarks today, Mike and Chris will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of
these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation
that is posted on our website.

We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to supplement our comments. Please
access our website at huntingtoningalls.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view the
presentation as well as our earnings release.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Dwayne. Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on the call. So before
getting into my remarks on the quarter, let me first provide a COVID-19 update.

As this national emergency began, we established 3 very important objectives. Our first objective
was to minimize the impact to our workforce and to provide a work environment that is as safe as
possible. Now this resulted in some benefit changes and some actions designed to give each individual
employee as much flexibility as possible to help them navigate through these uncharted waters and make
arrangements that they needed to make. And in doing this, we assured them that their job was safe.
We also made adjustments to shift schedules to facilitate social distancing, and we enhanced cleaning
activities in our shipyards. And since taking these actions, we have approximately 25% of our employees
working remotely and are experiencing about a 70% to 75% attendance rate at both shipyards.

Our second objective was to protect the national asset that is Huntington Ingalls Industries. We have been
identified as critical and mission-essential by the Department of Homeland Security, by the Department of
Defense and by the U.S. Navy. So we took action during the quarter to enhance liquidity and strengthen
our balance sheet, and Chris will discuss those actions in more detail during his remarks.

And importantly, our supply chain is a critical part of the industrial base. And our ability to help our
suppliers, especially those small businesses, will reap benefits as we come through this pandemic. To this
end, we have accelerated more than $50 million of payments to our critical supply chain partners. This not

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

only helps them, but it also helps their communities, as our supply base resides in nearly every state in
the union.

Now our third objective was to be the reliable source of information for our employees. And to that
end, we have kept a very frequent and steady drumbeat of communications to our employees and to
our communities through multiple vehicles, including social media. We've kept them informed. We've
answered many of their questions and provided them the resources and guidance they need to help keep
them and their families safe.

Now additionally, I have been personally engaged in multiple strategic efforts centered around this
pandemic, and I participate in weekly calls, along with the other defense industry CEOs, with the Assistant
Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, James "Hondo" Geurts. And I would
be remiss if I did not add that the U.S. Navy has really leaned forward during this crisis, ensuring
uninterrupted contractual payments and the continuation and even acceleration of contract awards, such
as LPD-31 that was awarded in early April. These efforts are a great help to our industry and provide
stability, liquidity and business continuity, and I credit Assistant Secretary Geurts for his immediate action
to these kinds of issues.

As a nation, I believe we need to focus and adapt to what is being rightly called the new normal. We knew
early on that this crisis was not going to be over in a few weeks or even months, so we have worked
to change our business to effectively operate in that new environment. For example, we have now over
11,000 people working remotely. That's a tenfold increase from where we were just 8 weeks ago.

Now fortunately, we had already started transforming our business. So this crisis has provided us a
catalyst to accelerate this transformation, and we believe we will be able to weather this storm and
continue to provide our critical products and services to our customers around the nation.

Now let me share some highlights from the quarter, starting on Slide 4 of the presentation. Sales of
$2.3 billion for the quarter were 8.8% higher than 2019 and represent record highs for the company.
And diluted EPS was $4.23 for the quarter. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately
$900 million, resulting in a backlog of approximately $45 billion at the end of the quarter, of which
approximately $21 billion is funded.

Regarding activities in Washington, our actions in early February supported Congress' consideration of the
budget in regular order. But our focus rapidly shifted mid-quarter to mitigating the impact of COVID-19
on our workforce and supply chain, and we will continue to work with Congress and the administration
to support authorities and investment that will enable our nation's economic recovery through the entire
defense industrial base, which is uniquely postured through tens of thousands of suppliers across all 50
states to be the engine for that recovery. We also look forward to congressional consideration of the fiscal
year 2021 budget request in the coming months.

Now let me share a few business segment highlights from the quarter.

At Ingalls, the team delivered LHA-7 Tripoli in February and launched 2 ships in the quarter, DDG 123
Lenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee in January and LPD-28 Fort Lauderdale at the end of March. DDG -119 Delbert
D. Black completed acceptance trials during the quarter and then delivered on April 24. NSC-9 Stone
is progressing through final assembly and test activities and is expected to deliver later this year. And
finally, DDG-62 USS Fitzgerald completed sea trials and planned production work during the quarter and is
scheduled for sail away this summer.

At Newport News, CVN-79 Kennedy is approximately 72% complete, and the team remains focused on
compartment completion and preparation for primary system testing. Newport News is working closely
with the Navy to pursue a single phase delivery approach on CVN-79.

Now this change from a 2-phase delivery would extend the Newport News' performance duration, while
supporting the Navy's plan for efficiently delivering a completed ship in 2024. Initial indications are that
incorporating a single phase delivery will increase the scope of work under the contract and stretch the
construction schedule and the test program to the right. However, the ultimate financial and schedule
implications will not be clear until we definitize the change with the Navy.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

CVN-73 USS George Washington is progressing through its final outfitting and test phase and is
approximately 74% complete.

On the submarine program, SSN-794 Montana is expected to launch in the second half of the year and
remains on track to deliver in the first half of 2021. And we anticipate SSN-796 New Jersey achieving the
pressure hull complete milestone in late 2020.

In our Technical Solutions segment, we received several contract awards across the Department of
Defense for manned and unmanned airborne intelligence and ISR support and secured recompete business
with the U.S. Postal Service for enterprise IT operations. In January, we announced our largest award of
the quarter, a task order to support the U.S. Air Force Europe's ISR operations, with a total potential value
of $954 million over 5 years.

In addition, we closed the Hydroid acquisition at the end of the quarter, which significantly expanded our
capabilities in the important and rapidly growing autonomous and unmanned maritime systems market.

So in summary, I am encouraged by what we have been able to accomplish during these unprecedented
times. Our leadership team has demonstrated flexibility and agility to respond to new developments, while
continuing to achieve a number of key milestones.

And finally, our $45 billion backlog, unprecedented program visibility, strong balance sheet and thoughtful
leadership through the COVID-19 crisis allow us to remain confident in the long-term financial targets and
value-creation strategy we provided at our Investor Day in February.

Now I will turn the call over to Chris Kastner for some remarks on the financials. Chris?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our first quarter results and also provide
some comments on our 2020 and long-term outlook in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. For more
detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our
website.

Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 5 of the presentation, our first quarter revenues of $2.3
billion increased 8.8% compared to the same period last year, driven by growth across all 3 divisions.
Growth in Technical Solutions was driven primarily by mission-driven innovative solutions, where results
included a full quarter for Fulcrum, which was acquired in late February 2019. Growth in Newport News
was due to higher submarine construction volume, and growth at Ingalls was driven by higher volume on
the LPD and DDG programs.

Operating income increased by $54 million or 33.5% to $215 million when compared to first quarter 2019,
and operating margin increased 176 basis points to 9.5%. These increases were primarily driven by a
more favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment and higher risk retirement at both Newport News and
Ingalls.

Net earnings in the quarter were $172 million compared to $118 million in first quarter 2019. The increase
in net earnings for the quarter was mainly the result of higher operating income and a more favorable FAS
non-service pension benefit, partially offset by a $16 million loss recorded in other income as a result of
lower returns on marketable securities related to our nonqualified benefit plans. We are pleased with the
operating results for shipbuilding in the quarter, including the 5.7% sales growth compared to the first
quarter of 2019 and the 8.3% return on sales.

In Technical Solutions, our core nuclear and MDI businesses are performing as expected. In the quarter,
Technical Solutions achieved a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.6, which included a significant new win to
support the U.S. Air Force Europe's ISR operations.

As Mike mentioned, closing the acquisition of Hydroid in the first quarter positions us as a leader in the
strategically important autonomous and unmanned maritime systems market. We continue to make
progress on the other portfolio shaping activities that were highlighted at our Investor Day in February,

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

including the contribution of our San Diego shipyard to a new ship repair partnership, which we expect to
complete this summer, and the divestiture of our oil and gas business.

Turning to Slide 6 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $68 million in the quarter, and net capital
expenditures were $66 million or 2.9% of revenues compared to cash from operations of $11 million
and $74 million of net capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we contributed $30
million to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans in the quarter, of which $20 million consisted of
discretionary contribution to our qualified plans.

We also repurchased approximately 391,000 shares at a cost of $84 million, and paid dividends of $1.03
per share or $42 million, bringing our quarter-end cash balance to $28 million. As the COVID-19 situation
evolved, and the high level of uncertainty that came with it, we thought it was prudent to hold share
repurchases, which we did on March 11. Through the end of Q1, we had returned to shareholders 107% of
free cash flow generated from 2016 through the end of the quarter. Share buybacks will continue to be an
integral part of our capital deployment strategy once volatility related to COVID-19 subsides.

Moving on to Slide 7. We have recently taken a series of actions to enhance our liquidity and further
solidify our balance sheet. After the quarter closed, we issued $1 billion in new senior notes and also
entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility with $500 million of capacity.

We are fortunate that our primary customer, the Navy, has taken steps to accelerate cash flow under our
contracts, which we have passed down to our supply chain partners primarily for small and disadvantaged
businesses. Given these changes to our debt profile, we now expect our 2020 interest expense to be
approximately $104 million.

To summarize, the hard work and dedication of our employees during this difficult time has been truly
tremendous. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional cost related to our COVID-19 response
in order to keep our employees safe.

Additionally, as Mike noted, we have experienced staffing levels at about 70% to 75% over the past
several weeks. These lower staffing levels will likely impact program schedules and efficiency and increase
ship estimates to complete, the materiality of which we will not know until we get greater clarity regarding
the return to normal staffing levels and have a full reconciliation of supplier material delivery schedules.

We are confident the cost incurred for COVID-19 response are allowable cost under our contracts. Further,
we continue to evaluate these impacts to programs against our contractual terms and current and pending
legislation for the potential to obtain equitable adjustments to target cost, target price and program
schedules. We are working closely with our customers concerning the treatment of cost, and we will be
able to provide additional details on COVID-19 cost treatment and recovery as we move through the year.

However, as of today, we expect a modest impact to sales in Q2 due to reduced attendance in the
shipyards. We also see shipbuilding sales growth for the year to be at the lower end of the previously
provided range of 3% to 5%. We will gain more clarity as we move through the year and plan to provide a
more comprehensive update during our second quarter earnings call.

Finally, we continue to believe that our strong balance sheet, liquidity and high degree of visibility and
stability provided by our backlog make us well positioned to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our
business. We also do not see changes to our long-term financial expectations we communicated in
February at our Investor Day, including our expectation to generate approximately $3 billion of free cash
flow from 2020 through 2024.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.

Dwayne B. Blake
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Chris. [Operator Instructions]

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Just a question on the performance and the margin this year. I know heading end of the year is going to
be a lower-margin year for a variety of reasons and also backloaded. You reiterated the number for the
year at 9%, but you didn't mention there could be some moving pieces from COVID. Can you just give a
sense for what kind of progression we should see now with coronavirus?

Yes, please. And then I'll have a follow-up.

Dwayne B. Blake
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations

Anyone there?

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

This is Jon Raviv. Can anyone hear me?

Operator

And ladies and gentlemen, we're having technical difficulties. If you will remain online, the conference will
resume.

[Technical Difficulty]

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Was it on our end or their end?

Operator

And your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Can you hear me?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

We're back. Sorry about that. We got dropped there for a little bit. So I imagine there's already been like 3
or 4 questions, and you guys have already answered them. So we'll catch up as we go along.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

So we -- it was just Jon's question, that's it. But yes, I'm glad you're back. I fumbled the mute button
many times, so no worries.

I wondered if you could give us a sense on the most up-to-date data you have on the headcount levels
in the yards. I mean, I can imagine that it's something you're monitoring day-to-day just like we're

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

monitoring any of these other COVID-related curves and the impact that, that has on your estimates for
what the disruption will be and productivity and whatnot.

Have you seen any change since the end of the quarter? In the month of April, have you bottomed out?
Has it improved? Any kind of up-to-date color that's kind of beyond the month of March that you can
provide?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. We've -- it's been pretty steady. The initial disruption for folks to figure out
what sort of disruption they had in their lives, whether they had family members that lost their jobs or
how -- they had kids at home. They had to work their way through that. They've kind of worked their way
through that. And I think, as we said, the aggregate, the attendance is about 75%.

You can parse that a lot of ways, but basically, where the folks who have to be present in the business
inside of the shipyards, that number is lower than 75%. But the rest of our workforce, either they're
working remotely or the -- or we've changed the conditions that they're working in on site, have been
able to support at a higher level than that. So we've been pretty steady for the last, I'd say, the last 2 or 3
weeks anyway. So the number you have is the number we've got.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Okay. If you try to parse it between the 2 yards, what's the difference?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Not much.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Pretty flat.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's pretty much the same in both places. The #1 driver in attendance right now, by far, is the schools
are closed. And folks have to decide how they're going to take care of their kids. And all of the usual
mechanisms for people to take care of their kids are not available either. So that's our biggest driver in
attendance.

I continue to argue that we've got to find a way to get schools back to where parents are going to be
comfortable to send their kids to school. That's got to be at the top of everybody's list. If that happens, we
see this moving ahead. We're moving -- we're shifting our posture as well.

Now that we've kind of stabilized this, we're starting to look now to how do we expand our employment
and fill it back in. So we're moving ahead and leaning forward on this.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Carter, this is Chris. We'll come through the estimates on our ships in the quarter and incorporate that
reduced attendance on the schedules and the impact on the touch labor on our shipbuilding programs.

But we're also assessing the opportunities. Our expenses have changed, right? So the most obvious one
is travel, it's essentially 0. But less obvious is stuff like Teladoc, which is something we put in place a
while ago, and it spiked, which means our people are not in the emergency rooms. And that's much less
expensive for us.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

So when we come through the quarter and the year, it's going to be -- we're going to assess the risk on
our shifts related to reduced attendance, but also the impact on our expenses. So it's more of a holistic
approach than just what's the attendance in the yards and what's happened to productivity on the ships.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. In fact, I'm encouraged the key milestones for our production were -- we're essentially meeting the
key milestones that we have to meet. And just -- off the top, the delivery of the destroyer in the last
couple of weeks is evidence of that.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, 119; 62 is on schedule. NSC-9 is on schedule. Really comfortable with how we're performing in
shipbuilding.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's going well.

Operator

And your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.

Unknown Analyst

This is actually [ Emily ] on for Myles. So on the -- on the recent result of the frigate competition, given
the contract value for the ship, would you have been able to sign up for that aggressive of a price?

And then additionally, what is on your radar now for potential awards at Ingalls? And is the recent award
for LPD-31, how does that impact Ingalls' production line?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

A lot of questions there. Recognize that everybody in the frigate competition was pricing a different ship,
and so almost impossible to do an apples-to-apples comparison of price to what happened.

So I think the Navy tried to run a best value competition and they selected a winner. We're, obviously,
very disappointed with the way that it came out, but we'll get a debrief from the Navy on what happened
and how it could have gone better, and we'll go forward from there.

Relative to other opportunities at Ingalls, we still have a very strong presence and production line right
now in the large deck amphibs, the Phase II LPD program, evidenced by the contract just signed for
LPD-31. We're building destroyers, and we're still building national security cutters. And so the Ingalls
future is bright as far as I can tell. This is a disappointment, but the thing about competition is you get up
off the field and you go learn your lessons and you get better the next day. And so that's kind of the way
we're taking it.

The Navy is starting to rethink -- starting to think about what's the future hold, and we're going to be part
of that future. And so we're excited about that.

Operator

Next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I'll try not to break everything this time, I suppose. Can you guys hear me, though?

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we can hear you.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. Glad to confirm that. So my question had been, I don't know if you heard it, was just on margin
progression through 2020 and 2021. I know this year is always going to be somewhat backloaded. You
talked about 9% this year. You reiterated that number. What is the progression? And how do you achieve
that with various unknowns around COVID-19?

And then related to that, what is the potential menu of outcomes from the new 1 Phase carrier plan?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Well, on the margin progression, you can handle Phase I. No real change to margin progression at this
point, Jonathan, we have to come through Q2. No doubt it's going to be a complicated quarter, but I
wouldn't change the way we're thinking about margin in 2020 or in 2021 actually.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's too early. There's -- as Chris said earlier, there's certainly some risk now that's in our risk
register that we didn't have in our risk register 2 months ago.

But on the other hand, there's opportunities out there that our business is actually transforming itself
organically, kind of -- it's just doing it. And so there's some real opportunities for us in terms of efficiencies
and new ways of doing business and moving ahead. So it's way too early for us to try to back away from
anything that we might have said earlier.

As far as the single phase delivery for 79, what the original plan was, was that maybe the Navy and the
company had decided to split the delivery, to finish the platform and then use the post-delivery time
to upgrade the -- or actually install the sensors and those state-of-the-art things that change 3, 4, 5
generations while you're building the ship. And you want to make sure it's as current as possible.

The Navy has come back and said, it's going to be better to do this in an integrated fashion. Because that
way, we can get a more complete ship sooner and be able to get the ship ready to deploy faster that way
as well.

Now what that will do is that will change the schedule for -- if we're able to work our way through this,
and we haven't, but if we work our way through this, it will change the schedule for how the test program
proceeds throughout the ship, because we'll line that up with the new schedule. It will change the way the
Navy mans the ship, which is part and parcel to our test program and delivery schedule.

So at this point, there will be more scope. It will probably move the schedule around a little bit. And until
we get through it, I'm not sure we can say exactly how much impact it's going to have. But we think it's
actually the right answer for getting that ship to the fleet and into operation as fast as possible.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Just a follow-up on that point, Mike, I appreciate the perspective there. Is it not the case that the late
2020 improvement in margin to get that 9% did somewhat rely on some of those things happening on the
carriers that you just outlined? If those things don't happen, then that -- is that one of the risk items to
the 9% this year, perhaps?

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Yes. I would say that's true. But that's why I say, we actually think that there's -- again, we got to kind of
work our way through the -- what are we going to do contractually to account for this. And then we look at
what are the opportunities we're seeing in the rest of the business from the impact of this virus. So that's
-- we just don't know enough right now to back away from that.

Your next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein.

Douglas Stuart Harned

I wanted -- on Newport News, I wanted to talk about Virginia class and Columbia class, because, this year,
you're going to see some significant Block V work on Virginia class. I know you highlighted in the release
that Columbia class that the amount of work there is starting to grow. And could you talk, say, first, about
what you see the impact of those 2 programs now growing on your margins at Newport News?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, Doug, it's going to be the beginning of these programs. And by now you know that when we're at the
beginning of the program, we're reasonably conservative in terms of that.

Now truth is that we know a lot about submarines. And the arrangement on Columbia is just a little bit
different than the teaming arrangement we have on Virginia class. And so how that works and how the
expansion works and goes forward, I think, is -- we've got that factored into. It's part of our -- it's part
of the way we were thinking about the year and the next several years when we talked to you guys in
February. So there's not really much change in all of that. It's just it blends right in to get us to where we
want to be.

Douglas Stuart Harned
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

When you look at Columbia class, as we looked at this, we were assuming you'd really start to get
production growth taking off kind of in the 2023 time frame. I mean, for Newport News, how do you see
that trajectory of work? How much of a contribution do you expect Columbia class to be making over the
next couple of years?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Doug, this is Chris. We don't have a specific number for you, but it does start to ramp from here and
then really start to get some momentum in 2021. But we don't have a specific number for you.

Your next question is from David Strauss with Barclays.

Matthew Carl Akers
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is actually Matt Akers on for David. So now that Hydroid is closed, I'm wondering if you could give us
sort of an update on your thoughts of opportunity there for unmanned ships and sort of how that business
is impacting on us.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're, obviously, very excited that we were able to close this deal. It took us -- it was a long process
with Kongsberg working through what would make the most sense for both of us. But now that it's in the
portfolio, it's -- we've come -- basically, in the last 5 years, we've come from not really being present in
this space to being as capable as anyone in this space, and we're excited about that.

The Navy will continue as it thinks through what they want the fleet of the future to look like. They're
going to continue to look through -- look at how do you do more missions with less people. And so we
think that's a critical element of what they're going to be doing, and Hydroid certainly gives us a step into
that.

There's a range of programs that the Navy has already announced that we're actually part of. Boeing has
the lead on the XLUUV program, and we are working with Boeing to manufacture that product for them.
The Navy has announced the large diameter UUV program, and we're very excited about the opportunity
for that.

And then Hydroid as a business, before we ever got involved with them, they were a dominant player in
programs smaller than that. So this gives us now a full range of capability in the portfolio of platforms and
missions and capabilities that we believe the Navy is going to need in the UUV space.

It also then gives us an opportunity to expand into the unmanned surface space, because a lot of the
capability that you're going to need relative to autonomy or manufacturing and advanced manufacturing
and those kinds of things are going to be the things that you're going to need to be able to be successful
in the unmanned surface space. My assessment is that the unmanned surface space is lagging the
undersea space. But I don't know that, that lasts. And I'm excited about where this whole program is
going to go. It's going to be a great business for HII to be in because it's going to be a critical mission for
our customer, and that's where we want to be.

Matthew Carl Akers
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, can you comment on the sale of the UPI business? And just given
kind of the volatility in oil markets right now, is that still on track? And sort of any changes to your thought
process there?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Matt. This is Chris. Yes, no doubt, it's a volatile market out there right now. The good news is
that UPI, they've got some really stable long-term customers that are hanging with them, and we have a
strong management team. So that process will continue. We expect it to complete this year.

Your next question is from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Chris, I got a couple for you. First, Newport News and then Ingalls. But following up on Jon's question on
CVN-79 and the single phase delivery, but more from a cash perspective, that delivery in '24. Are you able
to comment at all on what the impact of that would be on '23 cash flow? And kind of the slope of free cash
flow you pointed to back at the Investor Day? I think you reiterated the cumulative target of $3 billion, but
just wondering if this could make it more back-end weighted. So that's the first question.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

I don't think so. We don't know yet exactly because we haven't definitized that change. But I don't think it
materially changes the slope. A little more detail on cash. I think, with all we know right now on free cash
flow and everything moving around, we're still north of $500 million this year, and then we start to ramp.

Okay. Okay. And then just switching to Ingalls. I was wondering if you could provide any color on the EBIT
profile of the NSC program as it exists today, just so that we can get a better idea of how that program
eventually ending might impact the business.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I don't want to do an individual program review right now. We don't really give detailed estimates of
margin rates by ships. I will say from Ingalls perspective in the quarter, the LPD program is performing
very well. Pleased with 28 and 29, the award for 31, so Ingalls had a really good quarter.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I was just going to ask, Mike, if there's any customer interest in a 12th NSC hull.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Sure. There's been a lot of talk about it. I think the question at this point is, where does the budget go?
And I think that's kind of the big question mark out there for everybody.

But the Coast Guard continues to operate the NSC at a high tempo, with lots of mission success and lots of
very positive and favorable feedback to us. And so -- and it has been a program that has been funded and
supported both from the Coast Guard and from the Congress over the years. So I'd say, sure.

Operator

Your next question is from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.

Peter John Skibitski
Alembic Global Advisors

I hope everyone is doing well. Mike, I had a top level question about the Navy and Marine Corp's outlook
for ships, kind of in light of the commandant's guidance and the in-budget pressures connected and I
think there's a new shipbuilding plan in the works in the building also that isn't complete yet, but -- and I
don't know if it's connected. Well, I think it's kind of connected to this idea of a light amphibious warship.
So kind of the net question is, do you think the requirement for amphibious lift is going to be reduced or
modified over the next couple of years in any way? And is a kind of maybe shift to smaller amphibious
ships, do you -- can you compete effectively there?

So just kind of interested in your thoughts overall about what looks to be a lot of change that might not
impact in the near term, but maybe in the mid to long term?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's a good question, and that's certainly something that we're thinking a lot about.

Look at the very top level, there is always a challenge of -- if you want to change direction, if you want
to go in a different direction, the question is how quickly can you do that. And recognize that if you're
going to trade off current capability for potential future direction, that's got lots of unimplied risk there
that hasn't really been -- we haven't been able to kind of break that mold of. You can't really go in a new
direction by trading off current capability.

And I would offer that one of the things that we continue to stress is that current capability actually
includes the infrastructure and industrial base that you have created. We've hired more than 25,000
people at HII over the last 5 years. We've spent $0.5 billion training them, and we spend $3 billion to $4
billion a year in our supply chain, where they've been doing the same thing. And so we have an industrial
base that's ready to support the direction that you want to go.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

If you want to go in a different direction and be successful with it, I think you got to think your way
through, how do I get the industrial base to move in that direction? And so clearly, the Marines are
thinking about a concept of operations that's a little bit different than what they've been talking about.
I don't think -- in the end, I don't think it changes their near-term requirement for heavy lift. And this
discussion is not something that's going to say, here's how we're going to get there in the next 2 years.

I mean you're really talking -- when you start talking about new shipbuilding plans, you're really talking
about what does shipbuilding -- what does the Navy look like 10 to 15 years from now? Because the Navy
that we're going to have 5 years from now, you're building it today and it's at sea today. So time frames
have to be kind of thought their way through.

I think that there's an opportunity here for the industry and the Navy to work together to take advantage
of all of the assets that we have to create a capability that would support going forward.

Now the other piece of what you said is something that we're thinking really hard about is that there
is a bit of a floor for us in terms of as you get smaller in ship size, the market becomes a lot more
competitive. And so we've got to think our way through that as -- just as a business, how do we improve
our competitive position as -- if this is a direction that our customer is going to want to go. And we're
looking hard at that.

And your next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Well, I have a couple of questions, and forgive me if these were obvious. But first, just to be clear on
the COVID impact on profit accrual. Are you assuming -- I guess, percentage of completion accounting,
right, so you accrue less revenue as there are fewer people making progress on ships. But the margin rate
you're assuming is as though there is no COVID impact, is that right? Assuming there'll be some relief
down the road? Can you just kind of...

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

It's a good question. In Q1, there's really no COVID impact. There is no way to estimate that impact
in Q1. We're going to have to assess that in Q2 as we understand the comprehensive impact and the
opportunities related to it. So it's a good question, Gautam.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So meaning in Q2 right now, you have month and couple of days has passed in Q2, there is a COVID
impact. Fewer people showing up at the yard. So you're accruing less revenue, but you're accruing cost at
the same margin that you otherwise would? Or again, I'm just -- I want to be very clear.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

That's right. And you don't change your estimates until you come through comprehensive VACs on your
ships, which we will do in the quarter in Q2, and then assess that in the quarter and deal with that in Q2.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. So right, but let's just say that the Navy hasn't given you guidance on what form that equitable
adjustment will be, would you then take a negative cume catch-up in Q2? And then just wait and hope
that you do come to a resolution and then take a positive...

Executive VP & CFO

Yes, you're getting into claim accounting there. I don't think you should -- from a claim accounting
standpoint, you would not assume that they're going to give you an equitable adjustment to these costs.
So without opportunities, you would potentially have to do a negative adjustment. That's correct.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Okay. Shifting to Technical Solutions. So there was a reference in the release to lower performance
on a host of items, oil and gas, I think, some fleet repair work, et cetera. Could you just elaborate on
what's happening in those? And I think it was nuclear and environmental as well. So was this just, again,
COVID inability to execute or was it something else? And what are the plans on the oil and gas side?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So actually, in the quarter, the major impact was the San Diego shipyard and some performance
issues there. Oil and gas and nuclear, we're okay, but compared to last quarter, their performance was a
bit less. Nuclear is just timing. I'm very comfortable with where they are and still comfortable with the 7%
to 9% EBITDA. And I commented previously on oil and gas, we still think that will get divested this year.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And last one, negative cume catch-ups by segment, if you could give us a...

Christopher D. Kastner

I've got positive 61, negative 29, net 32 and 2/3 of that net is Ingalls.

Your next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Could you speak to -- in the '21 budget, there's not a second Virginia class, and there's been a lot of back
and forth that there could be a second Virginia class. And I think your friends over at BWXT are building a
reactor first second Virginia class. So how do we think about -- is there going to be a second Virginia class
or not? I mean, what's your latest read on that?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, thanks, Ron. I -- look, you've been doing this as long as I have. You know that the budget comes
over, and then there's a process that the Congress goes through to get the budget squared away and
passed and appropriated. There were some late moving items in the budget, frankly, from last year to this
year, that's I guess, my assessment is that the Congress was surprised about.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

And so when that happens, it takes a lot more work from the administration and from all the stakeholders
to work their way through it. My sense of this, though, is that the outlook for that second Virginia is pretty
bright. I think that Congress has pretty much made it's -- it's made its intention is pretty clear. And so I
don't know how all the pieces move around, but I'd say I'm pretty optimistic about it.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then when you think about the current pandemic, what opportunities has that opened
up for you in terms of when you think about the Technical Solutions group? Is there -- are there potential
M&A opportunities out there now that might not have been or are potentially more attractive now? I mean,
as you -- one of the things you guys articulated at the Investor Day is that's an area where you want to
have some growth. Is this an opportunity to try to grow that business?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

I think that the issue right now is that valuations are just, I'd almost say, mythical. To try to get to a fair
value of a business is, I mean, that's a hard read. I mean, we are still interested. We haven't changed our
posture. But if you -- let's just take -- if Acme is out there and suddenly Acme got wiped out by the --
their share price got wiped out by the -- by this volatility, the Board of Acme still would think that they're
worth a lot more than their share price is. And so trying to engage in that is really pretty challenging.

But we're going to keep looking, and we're kind of leaning forward to try to find ways to make something
out of it. So...

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And then, finally, you might have addressed this before, but just dig maybe a little deeper. How is your
supply chain doing, right? I mean, when you think about where there could be more serious stress points,
and in particular, some of your smaller suppliers that you're dealing with sole source, mom-and-pop kind
of shops. I mean, how are they handling this? And what are you doing to try to help them through the
situation, particularly those that might have more exposure to industrial or aerospace markets?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

We're in -- thanks for the question. We're in direct contact with our entire range of suppliers, several
thousand across the country. I'd say, at first cut, we have reached out to everyone and said, let's talk
about what impacts you're seeing and what impacts that might have to our programs. The vast majority of
our suppliers are saying, at this point, no impact.

Now I would say -- because of where we are right now, I would say we put the word yet on the back
end of that. They say no impact, we say no impact yet. There's a group of suppliers that are saying that
they're seeing impact but no impact to our programs. And I would say, okay, no impact to our programs
yet. And then there's a handful of suppliers that are saying, hey, we've got real impact here, and it is
going to impact our programs.

I think what I'm encouraged about, Ron, is that in the near term, we're actually supporting the key
milestones that we need to support, whether it's ship construction activity or supporting the fleet, we
have the information and material we need from our supply chain to do that. What's harder to evaluate is
what's going to be the impact around the corner, not in the near term.

I think, in the near term, we're working our way through that. But I think, in the medium term, the stuff
that needs to be going on today to support us at the end of this year or into next year, how is that going?
And that's why I say we put yet next to that because I don't know that we have -- I don't know that
anybody has a very clear view of that.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

The last thing I would say is that one of the advantages that we have, besides having the $45 billion
backlog to go work through and support our supply chain, is that our supply chain is domestic. We are not
dealing with suppliers in Mexico or suppliers in India or anything like that. I mean, where there have been
some disruptions that I've seen across the industry has been as much about trying to reach across the
borders as it has been about trying to reach and find these small folks.

So we're keenly engaged in this. We're working this every single day. But at this point, I'd say, near term,
not an effect; medium to long term, wait and see.

Your next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Chris, just back to the question on your margin rates and how the EAC recognition and accounting will
work as you go through the year and there's potentially disruption, but you're sort of telling us you're able
to hold to what you thought before this disruption.

My understanding from what some of the other defense companies that had reported already and
spoke to this said was that amongst the handful of things that your customer was doing to help the
industry get through this, that one of them was to the extent you were underperforming cost in what
you had contractually signed up for, if you were able to display that it was attributable to the coronavirus
pandemic, that you would actually be made whole back to your original assumptions. Is that -- am I
correct that, that is going on and that's part of your ability to hold the margins? Or did I totally misread
that from somebody else?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

I think you may have misread it a bit. Now that being said, it's an evolving situation a bit. But I think
there's a lot of news and a lot of discussion out between government contractors and the government on
the appropriateness of getting equitable adjustments through different legislation.

The way we read it right now, based on current legislation, you do not have the ability to recover equitable
adjustments for delay and disruption on your contracts. So we're not operating under that assumption. It
doesn't mean we might not get there.

And there are some types of costs where we think you will get adjustments and recovery for stuff like
quarantining or if a government facility is shut down, you can't go into work, you're not going to be
harmed for that. But equitable adjustments and the delay in disruption, we don't think that is fully
understood yet or fully dealt with under legislation yet. So I would not make that assumption, no.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

I would add there is intent, but there's not coverage. And so where we are, from an accounting
standpoint, at the risk of practicing accounting without a license, where we are with an accounting
standpoint is we're just not assuming that. We are engaged in the discussion about how do we make this
happen and how do we -- what changes need to be made from an appropriation and from an authorization
standpoint, but that has not happened yet.

And so that's where our engagement is, and we'll see how it goes.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

So assuming that doesn't happen then, should I -- would you -- would I then need to model that your
shipbuilding margin in the second and third quarter declines sequentially from the first and then is more

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

back-end loaded to the fourth quarter? Or how do you hold the margin with the amount of disruption
you're seeing?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I wouldn't change anything at this point. No, I think it's just too early. And I think it's just too
early. There's going to be a modest impact to sales for sure in Q2, but there's risk that we're going to
have to deal with relative to reduced attendance in the yards. But there's also opportunities because our
expenses are fundamentally changing right now, and you need to deal with all of that when you do your
EACs.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

And whatever happens with the equitable adjustment is not going to happen in second quarter.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

No. That's just not going to be resolved in Q2.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Is your comment of not changing anything more geared towards you don't think the numbers are going to
change or more geared towards nobody has enough information at this point to really forecast what the
numbers are going to be?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think more of the latter, but also we're making critical milestones within our shipbuilding programs.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Right. We're delivering ships, performing very well within Newport News and Ingalls. So it's kind of a
combination of both.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then last thing on this. As it pertains to revenue, it's, I guess, similarly a little bit hard to square
if you're at 70% to 75% staffing, and its percentage of completion accounting business, why that wouldn't
have a larger impact on revenue?

I mean, I guess sort of to your last answer there, it sounds like, even if you have less of the cost there
or less of the staffing there, if you can hit the milestones, that can -- that's a bigger piece than just what
the staffing level is. But I don't know, I'm surprised -- just surprised to see 70% to 75% staffing minimal
change to revenue and a percentage of completion accounting basis. How do I square that?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & CFO

No, remember, we're going to recover, right? The attendance is going to recover. So we talked about 3%
to 5% for the year. So we're going to recover from a sales standpoint as we get our attendance back for

the year. There's going to be an impact in Q2, no doubt. No doubt. But we still think we're at the lower
end of the -- as of today, we still think we're at the lower end of the 3% to 5%. If the virus goes on for a
prolonged period of time, that could change. But today, it's the lower end of the 3% to 5%.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Do you have visibility right now from sort of state and local economic reopening, stay-at-home order,
revision as to when you'll start to be able to restaff or bring people back on, I should say?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're first -- at the first level, we're the largest employer in both Virginia and in Mississippi. So we're
deeply engaged and connected to the governor's office in terms of how do you go about reopening the
state and what makes the most sense and how do you do that. And we come to that conversation from
-- with the standpoint of we've been open the whole time. So these are the issues that you're going to --
as you start to open these businesses, these are the things you need to be thinking about. You need to be
thinking about employee safety. You need to be thinking about customer safety.

I would just say the whole thing about reopening is it's voluntary. Businesses have to volunteer to open
even if the governor says to open doesn't mean that you're going to open. A business has to volunteer to
open. A business owner is going to say, I can open because I'm confident that I can keep my employees
safe and I can keep my customers safe, and I can do that at a rate that makes sense for me to open. And
the second voluntary action there is on the customer's part, and they have to decide that it's safe for them
to go out.

I think I mentioned earlier, it's the -- when are you going to feel safe to put your kids back in school, I
think, is the number one question relative to all of this opening. So we're deeply engaged in all of that
conversation.

How that plays for us though is it affects the employees that are staying home because they have to take
care of their kids. It does affect them. So that's where the reopening affects them. But our view is that we
-- as I said, we're shifting our posture here to open -- we'll go higher. There's a lot of folks out there that
are looking for work, and there's a lot of qualified people that are looking for work. And so we're looking to
start expanding our attendance again to go and get back to the business of doing what we're doing.

So that's all going to play out in the second quarter, and it's going to be -- as Chris says, it's just way too
early to tell how that's all going to play out. But that's our view, and that's somewhat independent of how
the governors are going to open the states.

And your final question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And Mike, just a follow-up on that budget question. Can you just also talk about the carrier side of things?
I know it kind of comes up every few years and such, but Secretary Esper's office seems to be looking to
reduce that footprint. So just trying to get a little sense of your perspective given the current fiscal and
political backdrop?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Jon, thanks. I think the carrier conversation always comes up because it does -- it turns into a
conversation about can we get more capability by changing structure or changing operations and things
like that. There are lots of folks who have lots of opinions on this. I have been through this many, many
times. The bottom line is you can't get 80% of a carrier for 80% of the cost.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Volume is the cheapest thing that happens on the carrier, making it -- actually making it larger is the way
you capture the return on the investment that you've made. And so the idea that you're going to go and
do something smaller -- maybe you have a smaller fleet, which is a different CONOP for the Navy, which
is something to think about. But in general, if you're looking for a replacement platform, that hardly ever
works out well in terms of the analysis.

I do think the Navy and the Pentagon and Secretary Esper are thinking about -- and rightfully so, they're
thinking about what are the future capabilities that we need and how is the best way for us to get there
and how do we fund that without sacrificing too much of our current capability. And you're going to see
lots of options. Some of them, like the Marine Corps discussion that we had before. It's going to be a
very dynamic time in shipbuilding, and we're going to be in the middle of that conversation as a principal
partner for the Navy to help them achieve whatever it is that they want to do.

But we come into that conversation with a $45 billion backlog of work that's going to be the foundation
where that -- from which that conversation will take place. The investments that we've made in terms of
creating the agile workforce that we need and the agile supply chain that we need, I think, are going to
support whatever direction the Navy and the Pentagon want to go, and we're happy to be part of that.

Okay. It looks like we have no more questions. I just want to thank you all for your interest today. And we
want to make sure that I hope you all are safe and well and your families are safe and well. Please take
care of each other. But we do appreciate your time for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with
you again. Thank you very much.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may
now disconnect.
