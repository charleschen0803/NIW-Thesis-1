NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Nucor Corporation Fourth Quarter of 2019 Earnings Call. As
a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Certain statements made during
this conference call will be forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words
we expect, believe, anticipate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to
identify those forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations
and information that is currently available. Although Nucor believes they are based on reasonable
assumptions, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect their accuracy. More information
about the risks and uncertainties relating to these forward-looking statements may be found in Nucor's
latest 10-K and subsequently filed 10-Qs, which are available on the SEC's and Nucor's website. The
forward-looking statements made in this conference call speak only as of this date, and Nucor does not
assume any obligation to update them, either as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Now for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Leon Topalian,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call and my first call as CEO
of Nucor. I'm honored to have the opportunity to lead this company and to serve alongside the 27,000
men and women of Nucor who inspire me every day.

Joining me on the call today are the members of Nucor's executive team, including Jim Frias, our Chief
Financial Officer; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials and Logistics; Ladd Hall, responsible for
Flat-Rolled Products; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products as well as Nucor's digital
initiatives; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for Plate, Structural and Tubular Products; Dave Sumoski ,
responsible for Merchant Bar and Rebar Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated
Construction Products. I also want to thank John Ferriola for his leadership during the past 7 years as CEO
and the impact he has made over his 28 years with our company. We thank him for his many contributions
to Nucor and wish him all the best in his retirement.

At Nucor, our greatest competitive advantage is our culture, and the greatest measure of that culture
is how we care for one another through the value of safety. 2019 was the safest year in our history,
and I'd like to thank all of my teammates for achieving this tremendous result. Nucor is a continuous
improvement company. Our challenge and opportunity is to achieve breakthrough improvements in this
core value. Over the last several months, I've engaged our team to ask how we can continue to improve
our performance and safety, and we plan to work together with our teammates to implement their ideas
and strategies. I look forward to making 2020 an even safer year for Nucor together.

In 2019, Nucor record earnings of $4.14 per diluted share. This was a good result given the challenging
steel market conditions that prevailed throughout much of the year. Strong performance in many of our
steel products businesses helped partially offset the destocking that negatively impacted our steelmaking
operations. In particular, I'd like to recognize both Vulcraft and Verco and our buildings group, which each
achieved their most profitable year ever, as well as our rebar fabrication operations, which posted much
improved results over 2018, reflecting both strong execution and favorable nonres construction market
conditions. Thank you for this result.

We believe that inventory destocking concluded in the fourth quarter when customers resumed more
normal buying patterns. General business conditions also improved as the fourth quarter progressed due
to a number of factors, including a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the new labor agreement between the
United Automobile Workers and GM as well as progress on U.S.-China trade relations and the passage of
the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement by Congress.

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

With regard to the USMCA, we applaud the House and Senate for passing the agreement with
overwhelming bipartisan support. The new trade deal with Canada and Mexico is a significant win for
the U.S. steel industry, especially given the revamped rules of origin that will greatly incentivize the use
of North American steel in autos, auto parts and other products containing steel. All in all, we sense
noticeably more optimism about the outlook for the U.S. economy as we head into 2020.

I'd like now to share with you my most immediate priorities for our company as I begin my tenure as
Nucor's CEO. There are 4 key areas that we, as a leadership team, will focus on and execute on. First, we
as a team, care for one another through the value of safety to further strengthen our culture, which is a
key driver of our success.

Secondly, the execution of the $3.5 billion of growth projects we are bringing online. Execution begins with
bringing these projects online safely and we have been doing that. Once they begin operating, we need
to ensure that we stay focused on generating appropriate returns from these investments. All of these
investments are focused on Nucor's goal of being the supplier of choice, both today and tomorrow. We're
staying ahead of the curve and adding the high-value products that our customers are asking for.

Third, effective management of our portfolio of businesses to maximize our earnings potential.
Ensuring our future success requires both making sound growth investments and addressing areas of
underperformance. We will harness Nucor's culture of continuous improvement to achieve the full return
potential across our entire asset base.

Finally, I've taken over the leadership of a company whose ability to attract, retain and develop great
people has always been key to our success. We will remain relentlessly focused on talent. Our team
members create the true value in our company. We have more than a 90% retention rate, and I believe
we have the most engaged, passionate and driven team members in the world. We will continue to attract
great team members by making sure the talent and passion of our team is more broadly recognized
outside the company, and we are committed to further enhancements of our programs to develop
and retain our valuable team members. There will be more to come in all 4 of these areas as the year
progresses but I wanted to share these initial priorities with you today.

Let me conclude my prepared remarks this afternoon with an update on some of our more significant
capital projects. We achieved important milestones on several of them during the quarter. At our DRI
plant in Louisiana, the critical work of replacing the convection section of our process gas heater as well
as realigning the reactor refractory was completed in November. The work was done safely, on time
and within budget. We expect these projects will further improve the plant's reliability. My thanks and
congratulations to the team in Louisiana for their successful execution on this key phase of Project 8000
and for the performance in 2019, which was our second-best year ever for uptime and output despite the
70-day planned outage.

Two of our growth projects, our Specialty Cold Mill Complex in Nucor Steel Arkansas and the new
galvanizing line at Nucor Steel Gallatin, continued to ramp up production during the fourth quarter.
Feedback from our customers on the product set of Gallatin and Hickman has been excellent, and now that
we're operating, we've seen even more opportunities to align with our customers. Utilization at Gallatin's
galvanizing line is already over 50% and Hickman's new cold mill is operating 24/7. We had contract
customers for 31% of the new cold mill's capacity at year's end. Qualifications are ongoing and we expect
to be IATF-certified by mid-2020 at Hickman's new state-of-the-art reversing cold mill.

Several other growth projects are coming online early in 2020 as well, including our new rebar micromill
in Sedalia , Missouri, the new merchant bar quality mill at Nucor Steel Kankakee and our JV galvanizing
line located in central Mexico that we are operating with JFE Steel of Japan. We have arced both the EAF
and LMF furnaces at Sedalia in recent days, and our new teammates there are hitting the ground running,
already serving customers with product made from billets. We expect the ramp-up to continue to go well.

Kankakee experienced some delays in equipment deliveries and the permitting process, but we expect to
come in at our initial capital budget of approximately $190 million. We expect to start shipping product
during the second quarter.

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

At our joint venture with JFE in Mexico, we look forward to beginning trial shortly and serving our
automotive customers in central Mexico. The facility's opening has been delayed due to some challenges
that we did not anticipate. For example, more difficult soil conditions required incremental piling, resulting
in higher cost than budgeted. We also found that the local electrical system infrastructure was insufficient
for our needs and decided to acquire additional land for our operational footprint. These events increased
the total capital budget from our initial estimate of $270 million to approximately $360 million, with
Nucor's share of these amounts being 50%. While this was disappointing, JFE and Nucor remain very
excited about the JV's prospects and are very confident in the product and our partnership. This is
especially so following the recent passage of the USMCA with its North American content rules.

Finally, we are excited to report that we have teammates on the ground and have begun excavation work
for our new plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky. The mill is the largest investment in our company's
history, and when it begins to operate in 2022, Nucor Steel Brandenburg will be able to produce 97% of
the plate products demanded in the United States market.

With that, let me turn it over now to Jim Frias, who will discuss our financial results in greater detail.

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Thanks, Leon. Nucor reported fourth quarter of 2019 earnings of $0.35 per diluted share. Included in
these results were noncash impairment charges of $66.9 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Of that
amount, $35 million or $0.09 per share related to our natural gas well assets, $20 million or $0.05 per
diluted share related to a long-lived asset impairment in the steel mills segment and $11.9 million or
$0.03 per share related to the write-down of certain intangible assets in the steel product segment. These
results exceeded our fourth quarter of 2019 guidance range of $0.25 to $0.30 per share. The amounts of
these noncash impairment charges were not included at the time we issued our guidance on December 12.

Our fourth quarter included better-than-expected performance across most of the steel mills segment.
Our fourth quarter results included approximately $35 million or $0.09 per diluted share of preoperating
and start-up costs related to strategic investment projects. That compares to approximately $28 million
in the third quarter of 2019 and approximately $17 million in the year ago quarter. Excluding profits
attributable to noncontrolling interests, the effective tax rate was approximately 24.5% for the full year.
Going forward, we expect Nucor's effective tax rate to continue to be in the range of 24% to 25%, barring
any unusual items.

In 2019's challenging steel market conditions, Nucor generated record operating cash flow of
approximately $2.8 billion. Capital expenditures for 2019 totaled approximately $1.5 billion. For 2020, we
expect capital spending to exceed $2 billion. Major components of this year's capital budget include the
Brandenburg greenfield plate mill, the Gallatin sheet mill's hot band production capacity expansion, the
Hickman sheet mill's new galvanizing line and our Florida rebar micromill.

In addition to investing for long-term profitable growth, Nucor's disciplined and balanced approach to
capital allocation rewards our shareholders with attractive cash returns. Cash returned to shareholders
during 2019 totaled $791 million or 62% of net income for the year. We paid dividends of $492 million. We
also repurchased approximately $299 million of our stock, about 5.3 million shares at an average cost of
just over $56 per share. With the dividend increase announced in December, Nucor has increased its base
dividend for 47 consecutive years, every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973. Over the 10-
year period ending in 2019, Nucor has returned a total of more than $6 billion to our shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases. Our focus continues to be on effective stewardship of our shareholders'
valuable capital via both disciplined investments that we expect will generate returns well in excess of our
cost of capital as well as attractive cash returns to our shareholders.

Nucor's financial condition remains strong. We ended 2019 with $1.8 billion in cash and short-term
investments. With total debt outstanding of approximately $4.3 billion, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was
29% at the end of the fourth quarter. Our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility remains undrawn
and does not mature until April of 2023. Our next significant debt maturity is in 2022 for approximately
$600 million.

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Now turning to the outlook. Nucor's earnings in the first quarter 2020 are expected to increase as
compared with fourth quarter 2019. We are encouraged by improving conditions in the U.S. steel markets
entering 2020. We believe this reflects the end of the severe inventory destocking that occurred last year
and ongoing modest growth in end-use markets overall. We expect first quarter earnings in the steel mill
segment to increase from the fourth quarter due to price increases and expected higher volumes.

It is worth noting that December is a historically weak month, with the highest profit month in the fourth
quarter for our steel mill segment. The profitability of the steel product segment is expected to decrease
as compared to the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality. The performance of the raw materials
segment is expected to increase compared with the fourth quarter due to improved pricing for raw
materials.

It's worth noting the outlook from an end-use markets perspective. We see stable growing end-
use markets accounting for approximately 70% of our shipments. Leon mentioned the strength of
nonresidential construction markets. We see this continuing into 2020. Nonresidential is an important
demand driver for our industry. Both order rates and backlogs are up across our buildings group and in
our joist and deck business. We are also hearing similar things from our structural fabrication customers.
Nucor is the leading supplier of structural beams in the U.S. with the broadest product offering. It's a
privilege to support our fabricator customers on important projects across the country.

Thank you for your interest in Nucor. I will now turn the call back over to Leon.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Jim. At this time, we're now ready to take your questions.

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies.

Martin John Englert
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So you provided some commentary on the demand front, and maybe if you could frame up what your
expectations are for U.S. steel demand in 2020 versus last year, talking about some of the puts and takes
amongst the end markets. And then also based on the activity that you're seeing today in the order books,
what type of sequential change might you be expecting within steel volumes in first quarter here?

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Okay, Martin. Let me begin first by stating how humbled and excited I am to be leading the Nucor team.
I stand shoulder to shoulder. We're the greatest manufacturing team assembled anywhere in the world.
And I'm surrounded with the most experienced executive team in the industry. And so as I mentioned
in the opening comments, we do see 2020 being a -- shaping up to be a better year than 2019. Nonres
construction is strong. We believe destocking has really been completed, seen some of the restocking.
But as we talk about order entry rates, there's a marked improvement in Q4. We see that continuing. Our
backlogs are strong, as Jim mentioned in his comments. The fabrication community, their backlogs are
very strong into 2020. So we see the outlook is fairly optimistic as we move into 2020.

Martin John Englert
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then how -- sorry, go ahead.

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Yes, the second question's about the volumes we're anticipating in Q1, and we don't give that specific
guidance. I'll say qualitatively, especially regarding our sheet business, we've had 15 straight weeks where
order significantly exceeded -- I say significantly, but more than 10% exceeded our production capacity.
And so we've built our backlog by about 2 weeks since the end of September. That's about 2 weeks longer.
So we're going to run the sheet business at least near full for the first quarter. The rest of our businesses
had not really run full consistently for a number of years, other than say, periodically was full. But we feel
very confident sheet will run full. We're not going to give guidance about volume overall other than to
maybe give that data point. I think it's also worth noting that last week, the 3rd week of January, was one
of the strongest weeks of order input we've seen in sheet since the improvements began in mid-October.

Martin John Englert
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

It sounds like a stronger start maybe on a sequential basis than what we've seen in a couple prior -- past
few years or so, based on your commentary.

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Really, maybe the last year. The year before that, it's going to be hard to beat. It's a pretty strong first
quarter pickup in 2018.

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Okay. Understood. And if I could, one more. With growth CapEx increasing, could you touch on any need
to draw on the revolver, perhaps increase other debt to support the growth initiatives? And also remind us
of minimum cash balances and leverage targets for the company.

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Sure. So we're starting here with a very strong liquidity position, $1.8 billion in cash and short-term
investments. And so we're going to have peak CapEx over the next 2 years, and then it should taper off
based on the projects that we've announced and have in our pipeline actively today. And so we could be
slightly cash flow negative over the next 2 years and then -- but over the next 5 years, we would expect
to be strong cash flow positive. So right now, we would not expect to draw on the revolver. We would be
more likely to issue CP if we got to that point. But with the $1.8 billion cushion, I don't see that likely this
year.

Martin John Englert
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. So rather other debt forms as opposed to the revolver, if needed, but you don't anticipate that at
this point?

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

That's correct. And again, we need about $400 million to $500 million cash, you asked that question, I
didn't answer that part, just to sort of support the liquidity in the business.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Congrats on the new role, Leon. The question I wanted to dig into a little bit more was on CapEx. You
touched on that last question but just a few more specifics, if I may. You said, I think, $2 billion around
that level for 2020. You said $3.5 billion for your total projects. So from the calculation we've done, we've
still got about $2.3 billion of that $3.5 billion still to spend. Can you maybe just give some color on how
2021 will shape up as you go through the numbers? And maybe after you've done those expansions, what
the sustaining level would look like.

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Yes. Our maintenance CapEx we think of as being in the range of $500 million per year. It's -- that's
embedded in that more than $2 billion that we expect to spend in 2020. It's too early to say for '21, but
I think '21 will be similar in levels to '20. Both years will be in the neighborhood of $2 billion or just north
of there. And then it would be a fairly significant drop off relative to the things we've committed to at this
point in time. We could, of course, identify other projects between now and then that would increase that.
And the other thing is, each year as part of the year end process, we put up some slides that give color to
our CapEx spending items, and we will be putting those up today after the call on our website for investors
to see.

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And that includes the -- what's the additional spending for the paint line that you announced in
December? I assume that's around the $100 million level or something in that ballpark?

Leon J. Topalian

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Yes. Chris, as we -- we're very excited about the announcement of our paint line and broadening our
downstream offering to our customers. We've not released that number. As we're getting into this and kind
of completing the engineering review, as we get that finalized, we'll announce that to you. I'm sure that
we'll do in the coming weeks.

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Just to reiterate from the first question, so you step through the next couple of years, you're
comfortable funding the dividend and maintaining the business out until the CapEx drops off. You're
comfortable managing your -- sort of the capital management part of the business even though the CapEx
will be elevated for those 2 years?

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

That's correct, Chris.

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Yes. Agree.

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And the last one from me. Just in terms of the new Missouri mill, just wondered if you could give a
few more specifics on the ramp-up of that and then just what you see in the rebar markets specifically.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're very excited about the strategy behind the micromills, and I'll ask Dave Sumoski here in a
minute to maybe provide a little update on Sedalia, specifically. But that investment strategy and that
capital allocation philosophy to become and maintain the low cost position in rebar by serving those
markets where our customers are at, high propensity to scrap, it's critically important to us in maintaining
that. Dave, anything you would like to add? Give us an update on that.

David A. Sumoski
Executive Vice President of Merchant & Rebar Products

Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, I mean, you hear that -- if you look at just the nameplates that it
would indicate that we're adding about 700,000 tons of additional rebar. But there's more to our strategy
than that. We have a very deliberate process to realign the product mix in the bar group -- in other
groups, but specifically, we're talking about the bar group. This includes producing higher-value products
of some of our other divisions. And that process has begun. It's been thought through for some period
of time. And I'll just share a couple of examples. Its Jewett, Texas facility is now on pace to make about
150,000 tons of SBQ. And our Darlington mill now makes about 300,000 tons of rod. And when they add
their degasser down there, they'll move up the value chain even more on the rod market and they'll start
producing more SBQ.

So we are shifting rebar from some of our divisions to these new locations where it makes more sense.
At the end of the day, we're going to move up the value chain, we will not abdicate -- we will not abdicate
markets and customers that have been very good to us over the years, specifically on the start-up. I'm
being told that we're going to melt the heat. We're going to go from melt shop all the way through the
process on Thursday. We've already commissioned some of the proper -- some of the process in this and
we run some billets through the line and shipped 700 tons out of there from other divisions just so we can
get our ERP system up and working. That's where we're at.

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Thank you, David. Did that address your question, Chris?

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. That's great. That's it for me.

Operator

Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America.

Timna Beth Tanners
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So just wanted to step back and ask a couple of high-level questions, if I could. If we look at the steel
products segment, profitability in 2019 was a step-up from 2018. And I'm just trying to figure out how
much, if any, of that was related to declining steel prices? And how much might have been related to
some of the growth projects? So if we look out to 2020, for example, with 2018 underearning and 2019
overearning, or should we consider it to be building from recent years?

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me start out. Now, I'll frame it at the high level and maybe ask Chad Utermark or Jim to chime
in. One of the areas, Timna, that I mentioned in my opening comments was to really begin to look at how
we scrutinize some of the businesses that were not meeting our expectations. So one of the examples
I'll share with you is in our products group, and Chad and the teams have done an amazing job of
rationalizing a market that for many years was about 2 million tons. That shifted down over the last 6 to 7
years to about 1.2 million tons. So we've moved operations, combining the different manufacturing plants
and brands. We run the same plants and really brought the market needs to fit our supply framework, and
by doing so has really created a very positive cash position. So I would say that impact is -- and the result
of the team achieving a record year is largely based on those decisions that we made as opposed to just
the declining steel prices, which did have some factor. But Chad, anything you'd like to add on that?

D. Chad Utermark
Executive Vice President of Fabricated Construction Products

Yes. Thanks, Leon. Yes. Thanks, Timna, for recognizing that. Obviously, lower raw material cost as well
as the solid nonres construction market that we had, had an impact in a positive way to some of the
record we set. But that record performance of the fabricated steel products segment is also benefiting
from what Leon just talked about, this restructure, in particular, of our metal buildings business as well as
rebar fabrication business. We're seeing the results. The restructure is resulting in a lower cost structure.
Some of the capital investments in new equipment, changes to our process flow and the volume impact
associated, especially with metal building group producing multiple brands at the same plant, is really
paying off. So we're excited. I think there's even further opportunity for us going forward for us to improve
our performance downstream.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The thing I'd add, Timna, is this. We took some of the rewards from the changes we've made to those
businesses that Chad talked about, metal buildings and rebar fabrication, but we expect to reap further
rewards from those changes in 2020. And so we're optimistic that 2020 is likely to be a better year. The
other thing I'd say is our tube business, which we've built through 3 acquisitions a couple of years ago,
didn't have its best year. They were much better in '18 than they were in '19, and we expect that business
to do better in '20 as well. So we think 2020 should be a pretty decent year for us in steel products.

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Okay. Super. And then I kind of want to ask the same questions about raw materials and long products
because 2018 was a really good year. 2019 was a not-so-good year in all those categories and especially
for raw materials there's been so much fluctuation. Like how should we think about "normal" EBITDA
per ton or margin per ton or however you want to think about it? And same question for volumes in the
long products. Like they fell off in 2019. And so kind of think about how some of these expansions or
enhancements can result in better 2020.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Again, so I got the raw materials and the long products group, and again, now maybe ask Craig to
chime in here. But look, at the end of the day, the longs business for us was a very profitable sector of our
business. Market leadership in beams allows to operate in the roughly 65% to 70% range through most of
'18. But again as we talked about in sheet, and Jim mentioned, specifically both plate and beams, we've
also seen a market shift in order entries and backlogs.

And so we're seeing that market improve from '19. Again, I think a factor of that is the destocking
that took place throughout 2019. And as we move into 2020, I think you'll see a much more level and
tempered business conditions as we move through whether it's scrap or order entry rates. We believe we'll
be more stabilized as we hit '20. I think '18, we saw our customers overbuying demand. In '19, we saw
them underbuying. I think you'll see that more balanced. But Craig, maybe you've got some color on the
raw materials?

Craig A. Feldman
Executive Vice President of Raw Materials

Sure. Thank you, Leon. Yes, Timna, no doubt about it. The margin compression we've talked about on
prior calls, particularly the DRI plants, has been a real -- it's on both sides. It's on the supply side, and
of course, our selling prices were challenged in 2019. Going forward, we really don't share the EBITDA
per ton numbers in that regard in the raw materials group or DRI. But I've just characterized it that a lot
of the heavy lift that we've done over the last year or so, and we've highlighted Project 8000 a number
of times on the call and the improvements that we made really focused on reliability going forward. So
by the middle of the year, I would say that we'll be towards a more normalized run rate. I suspect that
we'll see some relief on the iron ore pricing standpoint as well, and we feel very good about the work that
we've done related to CapEx in improving the reliability going forward. The team in Louisiana has moved
from between 250 tons an hour closer to 280 tons an hour. So we feel very good about the operational
improvements that we've made there. And generally speaking, we don't know where markets will go, but
a fairly positive outlook once we get past the first half of this year.

David A. Sumoski
Executive Vice President of Merchant & Rebar Products

This is Dave. I'd just make one comments on the longs. If you're just looking at bars and the numbers
there, 2 different businesses. So you got the SBQ product and then you got the rebar and the MBQ
product. And on the rebar and MBQ product, '18 was a year. But we're tracking ahead of 2017, so if you
look at that year on the pure bar side -- so that industry or that business is supported by the construction
industry and that's why we still feel there's a strong construction market out there moving forward. Yes.

Timna Beth Tanners
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. So it sounds -- okay, go ahead -- or I just can say that if I --

David A. Sumoski
Executive Vice President of Merchant & Rebar Products

Speaking on engineered bars -- excuse me, engineered bars kind of lives, in our view, in a different
ecosystem. We don't really sell into the construction market. A couple of our major markets, oil and gas
and ag equipment were actually down. We've got the combined factors of destocking with both OEMs and

service centers. So despite that, our engineered bar group, special bar quality picked up share in 2020 --
in 2019, excuse me. So again, not construction-related but a different market situation. So excuse me,
Timna, continue your point, please.

Timna Beth Tanners
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Oh, no, not at all. I'm just trying to make sure I understood. So it sounds like 2018, tough comps
versus 2019. You expect not the same destocking, better volumes and then sprinkle in some organic
improvements, and that's how we should be thinking about 2020.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It is. Look, I think underlying demand is there. I think it's stable in some of the sectors that Dave
already mentioned. Construction in particular is strong and we're seeing some slight improvements year-
over-year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.

Curtis Rogers Woodworth
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I guess my first question -- Leon, I guess Nucor has had a pretty consistent operating philosophy for
a long time and it seems like the company has definitely sort of accelerated more of the build for spot
mentality with a lot of the CapEx. So I'm just curious, with new leadership that are coming with new
perspective, new opportunities, what do you see kind of changing at Nucor? Where do you think the most
opportunity for improvement lies? And how do you think your maybe near-term agenda will be different
from prior agendas? That's my first question.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Curt, I'd frame it up this way. It's much easier for me to talk about those things that are not going
to change. Our focus on our core and our culture is going to remain very much intact. How we care for
our 27,000 men and women of the Nucor family is critically important. They are the value generators for
our future. The $3.5 billion of investment projects we've slated are equipment. They are things that can
be bought. Our team is what revolutionizes and changes the market and the returns that we're able to
achieve. So I couldn't be prouder of our team and we are laser focused. After the value of safety, Curt,
on executing on that $3.5 billion, it is the second focus for our entire organization that we bring those
projects in safely, on time and ahead of schedule.

And so that is where our focus is at. And then third, we move to really the portfolio management. How do
we continue to think about growth in the short and medium term and long term? And then coupling that
with, how do we scrutinize those businesses that have not returned the levels of profits and shareholder
returns we've come to expect of ourselves, and the analysts and investors have come to expect of us?
And so based on those focus, I would tell you that there's not a shift in what -- in how John led or Dan
DiMicco led. What I would tell you is the destinations are very similar. The routes we may take to get there
might be slightly different, different than the -- all of us use Waze or Google Maps to get into the city. I
may go to New York City 5 different ways, 5 days in a row. But how I communicate the things that we do
to achieve the results, the results are focused on the safety of our team and executing really well on the
valuable shareholder capital that they entrust us with every day.

Curtis Rogers Woodworth
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Yes, that makes sense. And then I guess, with respect to capital spending and sort of dating myself
a little bit here, but if I look at your plate capacity since 2005, it's been pretty consistent around 2.8

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

million tons. And your 15-year utilization rate has been about 80% and you're at roughly 70% the last
2 quarters. So I'm wondering, tactically, if we get into a demand situation where plate stays -- demand
stays weak, would you contemplate postponing plate mill CapEx?

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Let me begin with a short answer. No, is the short answer. The longer answer is we've been in this
business now for 20 years, Curt. We understand the markets that we serve. We understand the customer
base that is asking for this, and this is something that we contemplated since going back to 2008. So our
focus is for the long term. We understand there's going to be ebbs and flows in the markets. It's a cyclical
business and it's a business we know well and we've been in and a part of for over 50 years. So as we
think about plate, don't lose sight of the fact that we will have the most important product offering of any
mill in 1 location located in the heart of the largest plate-consuming region in the United States. And so by
doing so, we really believe we have a differentiated value proposition to offer our customer base that puts
us in a low cost position, a market leadership position. And I'm incredibly encouraged by what MaryEmily
and Johnny Jacobs and the team at Brandenburg are going -- will be able to do in our future in plates.

Operator

We'll next go to Andrew Cosgrove with Bloomberg Intelligence.

Andrew Cosgrove
Bloomberg Intelligence

I just wanted to start off and see if you could shed some light on the nonresidential exposure by product,
your sheet, bar, plate and structurals, if that's possible.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Andrew, give me a little more color. I'm trying to follow your question so...

Andrew Cosgrove
Bloomberg Intelligence

Just curious, I'm just trying to square up -- yes. No, I'm just the square up the exposure to whether it's
sheet, bar, plate and structural in the nonres segment. I mean the only reason I asked is because, just
trying to make sense of I mean long products and -- I mean all longs are down pretty precipitously in
2019. Nonres construction was up low single digits. I understand there was some destocking, but I guess
I'm just trying to see if nonres is still going to be strong and we're not going to get destocking. And we'll
probably get restocking this year, where that might be felt the most?

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, I would to tell you certainly, I think rebar fabrication businesses that are heavily put into the
construction market, certainly, some of the structural capacity that we have is a big part of that. And then
the downstream products in buildings and the Vulcrafts are all factors in nonres construction. So that's
the biggest size of the new markets we serve. Roughly about 30% of our overall products move into that
space. But one of the things you mentioned I would maybe characterize a little bit differently, we think
some of the restocking has already occurred. And again, as we mentioned earlier in our comments, I
do believe you will see a more balanced approach to 2020 in terms of the both service center and OEM
buying patterns. And so we do believe demand is healthy and we're optimistic, too, as we head into '20.
Dave, is there something you'd like to add?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Yes. I would just add that although there is no federal infrastructure bill out there, the states are really
stepping up to the plate and they're doing a lot of work. So that's really been a boost in the nonresidential
construction market, too, so I just wanted to add that.

Andrew Cosgrove
Bloomberg Intelligence

Okay. And then I guess one on plate. I mean plate import last year were down 20-ish percent, and then
obviously, plate shipments were also down 12% on your guys' front. I guess I was just trying to -- again,
is that also just down to destocking? Or is there -- I guess maybe if you could give some color on specific
end markets where there was some weakness in plate specifically? And maybe how you kind of see them
shaping up right now?

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Look, I'll start and then MaryEmily, maybe you chime in if I leave anything out. But as we think about the
plate and the import levels, I would tell you one of the most impactful things is what we've been able to
do over the last couple of years. We've won 12 trade cases since 2016 with plate. That has dramatically
shifted the import coming into this country. Certainly 232 has helped, however, it is the long term of the
trade cases that we've won and something over 160 cases that we've won, some dating back in plates in
1999. So our position through the long term ITC and the Department of Commerce commend them for
what they've done and are doing. But that site has got to remain ever vigilant. And so that is a big part of
why you saw the drop off in plate imports. MaryEmily, anything you would like to add on the market?

MaryEmily Slate
Executive Vice President of Plate, Structural & Tubular Products

Just a little bit of color on that. You're right. We had the lowest level of imports in the last 5 years, last
year, which was great. And we do believe that the overall market retracted but mainly that was due to
destocking activity. And when you mentioned trade cases, there are still 17 active trade cases going on.
So for 2020, we really look for the activity to be consistent. We feel like we're looking at a decent 2020
going forward. Thank you.

We'll next go to Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Market.

Leon J. Topalian

Thank you very much. I'm very excited and very humbled.

Philip Ross Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

In terms of the rebar color, it sounds like you're just getting the Missouri mill started in the last week or
2. What's the thought around the ramp time line there? And then can you give us any color on the Florida
mill as well? Because I know that was something that was supposed to be around mid-2020.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Certainly. Yes. Just at a high level, what I would tell you, Phil, is yes, the micromill in Sedalia is coming
online as we speak. The team has done a great job in taking care of the team from a safety perspective,
operating, costing and schedule. So we're excited about that. And then in the micromill in Frostproof,

NUCOR CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Florida, is still slated to come online in the summer of this year. So the other part of that maybe I'll ask
Jim to frame some color because we do think about how are these investments returning and what is that
long-term outlook. Maybe, Jim, you could add some color to those projects.

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Well, first of all, specific to your question, I think it's likely that Sedalia reaches breakeven sometime in
Q2. And overall, the galv line at Gallatin is already making a positive contribution. We have preoperating
start-up costs in the quarter of -- I think it was $36 million in the fourth quarter. That's going to come
down slightly in Q1 because some of these projects are starting to ramp. The Hickman cold mill is starting
to ramp. So their preoperating start-up costs will come down as they go towards breakeven. On Sedalia,
it's going to start have its preoperating start-up costs come down as they strive towards breakeven.

Now later in the year, we'll probably have other projects increase the pace of preoperating start-up costs.
But the projects that are coming online right now, and that includes the galv line at Gallatin, the Hickman
cold mill, the Sedalia bar mill and the Kankakee merchant bar mill, those 4 are going to make a nice
contribution to Nucor by the end of this year and a really good contribution to Nucor next year. And given
the broader number that the cumulative projects have, $600 million of EBITDA value, I would just say,
if you do the math on the CapEx of those projects, you'll see a nice jump in that EBITDA that's going to
benefit Nucor in '21, and we'll start to see some of that fruit by the end of this year.

Philip Ross Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

At a high level, Jim, in the start-up costs, saying they're coming down a little bit sequentially here in the
first quarter. But are you expecting the preoperating start-up costs in total to be lower in '20 than '19? Or
is that not a good statement?

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

No. I would say -- I'd say, truly say, because you've got 2 big projects getting ramped. And they will --
and because they're bigger, they will have bigger preoperating start-up costs. So the expansion of capacity
at Gallatin and the Brandenburg mill, when they come on, it's going to probably greatly increase our
preoperating start-up costs for a period of time. And I don't have -- we don't forecast that out more than
1 quarter at a time, so I can't tell you what those numbers are other than in Q1, it's probably going to
be slightly down. But I would expect for the year, it might actually be slightly up because those 2 bigger
projects are starting to ramp up their costs.

Philip Ross Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay, fair enough. And then the comment on, I think, you made, Jim, on being cash flow negative for the
next couple of years given the CapEx, are you throwing in the dividend in that discussion? Meaning, you're
including the dividend in terms of you being cash flow negative?

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Yes. I'm saying dividends plus CapEx against operating -- or cash from operations...

Philip Ross Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. So you're not saying free cash flow negative. You're just saying after dividend.

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Yes. Yes.

Or are we saying free cash flow negative?

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

I'm saying after CapEx and dividends.

Philip Ross Gibbs
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of the first quarter so we're thinking about this right. Seemingly some
operating leverage, at least in the sheet division from better volumes in Q1. But overall, as we look at the
Steel business, should we think that realized metal spreads will be a positive contributor versus the fourth
quarter?

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think so, Phil. And again, as we look at scrap, and obviously, an awful lot of discussions. Craig may
want to add some color here, but the market demand standpoint is still strong. And I think one of the
drivers that's not discussed an awful lot as we look at scrap is really the export market and the demand
outside of the U.S. that has an impact on that. So Craig, anything you want to add on the raw materials
scrap side?

Craig A. Feldman
Executive Vice President of Raw Materials

Yes. Just in general, I would say that the -- there was a lot of commentary around and interest in the
scrap market as it relates to steel, but I think the key driver is steel demand. And to Leon's comments
and the rest of the teams, I think you hear a fair amount of optimism here. And that's what we're seeing.
We're seeing the domestic demand for scrap is relatively strong, so -- well, absent the normal gyrations in
the market, I would say. And we see a fairly -- a relatively stable price environment and again, driven by
the steel demand -- underlying steel demand.

Leon J. Topalian
President, CEO & Director

And Phil, just one point I want to clarify. I've made the statement earlier that Frostproof is expected to
come online this summer. They'll start commissioning, but it will really come online in Q4 of this year.

Operator

We'll next move to Alex Hacking with Citi.

Alexander Nicholas Hacking
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Let me add my congratulations, Leon, on the new role. I just have one question. Jim, I just want to follow
up on the CapEx guidance, really, just to make sure I have it straight. I think you said 2021 would be $2
billion-ish, similar to 2020. If we take out $500 million a year for sustaining, that's about $3 billion on
growth projects for the next 2 years. I guess that seems a little high compared to what we were thinking.
We were thinking total budget of around of $3.5 billion with about $2.5 billion left to spend. I mean, I
guess, can you help me close that gap a little bit? I know you mentioned all these...

James D. Frias
CFO, Treasurer & Executive VP

Yes, there are some projects that aren't big enough that we're forced to call out that are embedded in
there as well. They are improvement projects that we don't think of as being CapEx, they're not building

new mill-type projects, so we don't call them out. So there's some other CapEx in there for things that are
improvement projects as well.
