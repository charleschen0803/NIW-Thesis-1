KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Kimco's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please
note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
and Strategy. Please go ahead.

David F. Bujnicki
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategy

Good morning, and thank you for joining Kimco's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call from wherever you find
yourself following social distancing guidelines. Obviously, hosting this call remotely from our homes is a
new dynamic, and we hope to make the best of it, even with the occasional dog barking and kids yelling in
the background.

The Kimco management team participating on the call today includes Conor Flynn, Kimco's CEO; Ross
Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, our CFO; Dave Jamieson, Kimco's Chief
Operating Officer; as well as other members of our executive team that are available to answer questions
during the course of this call.

As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it's
important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such
forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the
company's SEC filings that address such factors.

During this presentation, management may make certain reference to non-GAAP financial measures that
we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures can be found in the Investor Relations area of our website.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Today, we will take a bit of a modified approach to our quarterly
call. I will give you an overview of how we have confronted the challenges posed by COVID-19 and how
we plan to move forward as the country begins to reemerge. Glenn follow with the recap of the numbers
for Q1 and our desirable liquidity position.

First, on behalf of the entire Kimco team, I want to thank all the first responders, medical professionals,
volunteers, grocery store workers and essential retailers that risk their own personal safety to serve and
help all of us. They are the true heroes and their effort should not be forgotten. And on a personal note, I
also want to thank all of you for your support in my personal bout with the virus. Your e-mails, texts and
thoughts were as powerful as any vaccination and were a big part of my recovery.

I would also like to recognize the entire Kimco team for their tireless efforts to ensure our centers
continue to provide essential goods and services to our local communities. All of our centers are open
and operating, and we will continue to provide our shoppers, our vendors, our employees and our
extended Kimco family with a safe experience. Our best health and safety practices have been shared with
companies, both small and large, so that we can help those with less resources and more critical needs.

As an organization, we are battle-tested, having successfully weathered both industry-specific cycles and
macroeconomic downturns. That said, this current situation is unprecedented and poses new challenges.
We have been working seamlessly and remotely since mid-March, focusing all our efforts, as Milton

reminds us, to survive so we can thrive. Our strategy is focused on exactly that, managing through the
current environment with an eye to positioning ourselves to thrive when the economy opens back up.

Our strategy for dealing with COVID-19 was one we implemented quickly to try and help those most
in need. Time was of the essence on all fronts, and a wait-and-see approach was never considered.
First, we prioritized liquidity. Glenn will give the details on how we bolstered our balance sheet, which
included securing a well-timed term loan at very advantageous rates with extension rates. With a well-
heeled balance sheet and cash position, Kimco will not only survive but is in a strong position to prosper.
Moreover, we wanted to have available resources, not only for our own use but to help our retailers, many
of whom don't have the same access to capital.

Next, we refocused our operations by shifting more resources to the frontline. Our team has worked
tirelessly to develop new approaches and launch new programs that address the numerous tenant
requests. Our significant investment in cloud-hosted technologies from companies like Salesforce, MRI,
Microsoft and Zoom have streamlined our operations and created efficiencies across the organization.
These investments have allowed us to roll out programs of size and scale rapidly across the country.
In addition, we deployed custom-developed tools to help us manage and quickly address tenant
communications related to COVID-19 concerns. All this has provided us tremendous real-time data
that allows us to react quickly and be proactive. We have led by example as a number of our peers are
following our lead in technology, website architecture and tenant assistance programs.

Our Tenant Assistance Program, or TAP, is a multi-pronged approach to give our tenants the valuable
resources in a time of need free of charge. At the end of March, we encouraged our small shop mom-and-
pops to embrace TAP, which provides them with a free legal adviser to navigate the numerous state and
federal programs available for small businesses to help them weather this storm. We also engaged quickly
to give these small businesses the opportunity to know that the rent for April was not hanging over their
heads so they could focus on the government assistance programs and try and keep as many employees
as possible. In addition to legal advisers, we have helped identify lenders to work with our small shop
tenants applying for the PPP loans. By our last count, just under 600 tenants have participated in the
program.

For the month of April, we have collected cash rent totaling 60% of our billed rent. We fielded rent
deferral requests for 35% of scheduled rent from tenants and have worked out deferral plans that equal
approximately 14% of the April rent. For the month of May, we are still in the grace period for a number of
leases that allow our retailers to pay over the first few weeks of the month. To date, May rent collections
are tracking near the same level as April through the first week of the month.

Each of our deferral programs is confidential and cater directly to the needs of the tenant. We are in a very
fluid environment, and we plan to proactively address the challenges ahead by quickly implementing any
required changes while keeping an eye on the long term. As such, we don't want to speculate and instead
focus on the facts and provide accurate information as the situation continues to unfold. We are working
to maintain occupancy and bridge our tenants to the other side of the pandemic. We are also on the alert
for dislocation opportunities. We have not seen any assets of quality trade in this environment yet, but
we are ready if and when they present themselves. At the same time, until we get a clearer picture of the
landscape, we have hit the pause button on assets we were considering adding to the portfolio before the
COVID-19 crisis hit.

Our development and redevelopment pipeline remains largely on track, and we're in the fortuitous position
of having limited projects in the active phase. Our 2 main projects, Dania in Florida and Hylan in Staten
Island, are very close to completion and will be tremendous assets for Kimco long term. After a temporary
delay, we received approvals to continue construction at The Boulevard at the former Hylan shopping
center as it was determined to be essential due to the Shoprite grocery anchor. We are hopeful that this
Signature Series' asset will open later this year. At Dania Pointe, construction has been ongoing, with
Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie beginning to build out their newly leased spaces. While we recognize
that the pandemic may pose challenges surrounding the schedule of inspections and achieving final sign-
offs, we remain optimistic that we'll be able to complete these 2 projects on schedule. As previously noted,

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

we have postponed nearly $100 million of capital expenditures originally planned for this year as a way to
further our already strong liquidity position.

Our strategy of focusing on grocery-anchored centers and mixed-use assets continues to validate our
approach as these assets are outperforming, especially in this current environment. Our first 2 Class A
multifamily projects, Lincoln Square in the heart of Philadelphia and The Witmer in Washington, D.C.,
are both operational. And despite the recent shelter-in-place orders, we've been able to continue leasing
activity at both with virtual tours. Based on the success of both the Lincoln Square and The Witmer, we
are continuing to expand upon our existing 4,500 multifamily units that are currently entitled, and our new
goal over the next 5 years is to have over 10,000 units entitled.

Perhaps never before has the local grocery pharmacy and the central physical brick-and-mortar retail been
more important. And while I anticipate e-commerce will continue to accelerate in this stay-at-home period
of the pandemic, it is important to note that the lion's share of e-commerce deliveries are originating at
the store base.

We anticipate curbside pickup, combined with click and collect, to be another trend that will accelerate
both during the current pandemic and on the other side. We have launched the curb -- Kimco Curbside
Pickup Program, and we are already working with our tenants to implement a proprietary system to
provide for curbside pickup in our parking lots.

We want to help our retailers embrace the new normal of retail and help them ramp back up sales upon
reopening with a full suite of services that are now expected by our shoppers. We know the road ahead is
not going to be easy, but with persistence and a laser focus on what we can control, we will be positioned
to thrive over time. Glenn?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Conor, and good morning. Clearly, we are all experiencing an unprecedented health crisis that
is causing a global financial recession or what some may view as a global depression. It is times like
these that bring out the best in all of us. I echo Conor's sentiments in that we salute all the workers on
the frontlines who are caring for the sick and ensuring that we have the most vital essentials, such as
groceries, medicine and medical office and pet supplies. And I cannot be prouder of how the entire Kimco
organization is handling this crisis.

We are fortunate to have significantly invested in our technology infrastructure, which has enabled us
to quickly convert from a multi-office setting to a work-at-home environment for 500 associates within
24 hours. What is truly amazing is we have never skipped a beat. As a matter of fact, communication
and productivity across the entire organization is at the highest level. We've positioned the company to
withstand the severity of the current situation and come out stronger on the other side, of which I will
elaborate on shortly.

2020 was off to a solid start as the first quarter results will demonstrate. Let me provide some color on
the first quarter and spend some time on our balance sheet strength and significant liquidity position. As
a reminder, beginning in 2020, we are reporting only on NAREIT-defined FFO. If we recognize a unique
transactional gain or charge, we'll definitely be sure to point it out.

NAREIT FFO came in at $160.5 million or $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020. This
compares to $158.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019. Our first quarter
results include a decrease in NOI of $7.5 million. This decrease was driven by net disposition activity
during 2019, lowering NOI by $11.4 million and a higher credit loss of $2.8 million due in part from
the bankruptcy filings of Pier 1, Modell's and Fairway. NOI benefited from $3.1 million of incremental
development NOI from our Lincoln Square, Dania Pointe, Mill Station and Grand Parkway projects, and
organic rental growth of $6.1 million. FFO for the first quarter 2020 also benefited from lower G&A
expense of $4.8 million and reduced financing costs of $5.8 million, with the latter resulting from the
redemption of $575 million of perpetual preferred stock last year. We issued a $350 million, 3.7% 30-

year bond and 9.5 million shares of common stock at $21.03 per share to fund the preferred redemptions
during 2019.

The successful transformation of our operating portfolio has put us in a strong position to weather the
COVID-19 impact, but we realize there remain challenges ahead. Pro rata occupancy stands at 96%, down
40 basis points from a year ago but flat to 3/31/19 results. Anchor occupancy is at an impressive 98.6%,
down 30 basis points from year-end but up 80 basis points from a year ago. Small shop occupancy is at
88.8%, down 50 basis points from year-end primarily due to the vacates from Dress Barn and Pier 1.

Pro rata leasing spreads remained strong during the quarter at 7.3% comprised of new leasing spreads of
positive 13.3% and renewals and options of a positive 6.8%. Same-site NOI growth was positive 1.5% for
the first quarter 2020 versus a comp of 3.7% in the same quarter last year primarily driven by minimum
rent increases, which contributed 230 basis points; and increased percentage rent, which added 30 basis
points. Offsetting these increases in same-site NOI is higher credit loss from the bankruptcies previously
mentioned. All in all, a solid first quarter.

Now let's spend some time on our balance sheet and sizable liquidity position. During the first 4 months
of 2020, we have significantly fortified our liquidity position with the execution of 4 key transactions. In
January, we completed the $225 million refinancing for our KIR joint venture comprised of a $75 million 5-
year unsecured term loan used to pay off maturing mortgage debt and a new $150 million 4-year plus 1-
year option unsecured revolving credit facility with 0 drawn on it. The pricing for the term loan is at LIBOR
plus 135 with the revolver pricing at LIBOR plus 120 basis points.

In February, we completed a new $2 billion revolving credit facility priced at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points.
It's due in 2025, including options, and replaced our previous $2.25 billion revolver, which was scheduled
to mature in March of '21. We ended the first quarter with $675 million drawn, including $300 million
drawn in mid-March as a precautionary measure as the COVID-19 crisis was unfolding. Earlier this month,
we subsequently repaid this $300 million.

In April, we closed on a new $75 million mortgage on a joint venture property, replacing a $66 million
secured loan that was the largest individual joint venture debt that was scheduled to mature in 2020. The
new 7-year loan has a fixed rate coupon of 3.13%.

And then lastly, in April, we completed a new $590 million term loan priced at LIBOR plus 140 basis
points, with 15 banks participating. This loan has a final maturity date in April of 2022.

As of today, we have nearly $600 million of cash on the balance sheet, $1.6 billion of availability on our
revolving credit facility and over 320 unencumbered assets, which represents approximately 80% of our
total NOI. Combined, we have the most liquidity by far of any REIT in the open-air sector, and it puts us in
excellent shape to withstand the crisis, assist our tenants who need the most help and provide maximum
flexibility to be opportunistic should suitable transactions arise.

Our weighted average debt maturity profile is 10.1 years, one of the longest in the entire REIT industry,
and we only have $114 million of pro rata debt maturing for the remainder of 2020. In addition, we have
significant cushion with respect to our bank and bond covenants and are confident that we could access
the unsecured bond market if we deemed it desirable.

As previously announced, as a result of the uncertainty and lack of visibility regarding the extent of the
COVID-19 impact, we have withdrawn guidance for 2020. In addition, out of abundance of caution, the
Board has decided to temporarily suspend the common dividend. The Board will monitor our performance
and economic outlook on a monthly basis and intends, at a later date, to reinstate the common dividend
during 2020 to an amount at least equal to our REIT taxable income.

Certainly, there are many unknowns, including the timing of the country reopening, the pace of getting
back to some semblance of a new normal and the financial health of specific companies. But we remain
confident that with our abundant liquidity position, long debt maturity profile, superior portfolio and
incredible team, we will, as Milton says, not only survive but thrive.

And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Christine McElroy with Citigroup.

Christine Mary McElroy Tulloch
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

So Conor, I guess this is for you. We've seen April collection rates from you and all of your peers. The
variance among the group is not that wide, but it's there. How should the investment community be
looking at April collections in the context of what's the most important thing is, which is ultimately the
entire collectibility of these rents? So some national tenants are playing hardball but should ultimately
be in a position to pay, while local and maybe regionals are getting a little bit more support from the
government and landlords. So what are sort of the most important factors we should be considering
ultimately?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Christy, it's a good question. I think it's so early on in the pandemic that the first month of collections that
everybody is tracking should be taken with a grain of salt, I think, because the real question mark is how
long this will last and how deep it will go. And so we're still sort of in the early innings of it. And you're
spot-on in terms of the lion's share of what we did early on was to help our small shop tenants because
we felt -- we've been pretty clear from the get-go that we think our large national retailers who have the
balance sheets and the cash-on-hand position to pay their rent should pay their rent, so we can use our
balance sheet to go and help the small shops, the ones that don't have the balance sheet or the cash
positions to weather the storm.

And so the first month that you're seeing being reported, I would say that the lion's share of the numbers
that are reported probably capture something similar where the bigger players are paying a portion or
all of their rents and then the smaller mom-and-pops are probably working through this to try and make
sure that they survive and get to the other side of it. So as it progresses, I think, obviously, May will be
important and June, and the reopenings will be critical, right? So you've started to see now a few states
start to reopen. And anecdotally, we've heard a few of our retailers from store managers say that so far,
so good. They've been pleasantly surprised. So we continue to monitor the situation but again, taken with
a grain of salt that it is extremely early.

Christine Mary McElroy Tulloch
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And then about half of your projected CapEx reduction is in leasing CapEx. How much of this is a
function of just you expect lower leasing volume in this environment versus a concerted effort to pull back
on leasing incentives? And in that context, how much does the current environment where many tenants
are not respecting that long-term lease contract, how does that change your view on the economics and
the risk associated with some of these upfront leasing costs and how much you're willing to invest?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Christy, it's Dave. So it's a bit of a layered question. So let me just try to break it down a little bit to make
sure I address everything that you did ask. As it relates to the leasing CapEx, right now, a lot of that is
deferred CapEx, and not necessarily we won't be doing but will probably be pushed into 2021. We are
anticipating that there will be some delays in terms of RCD commencements and/or the leasing volume
itself may be accelerated in the back half of this year as we start to get better visibility into the situation
with COVID and the reopening of markets and then targeting those retailers that are actively looking to
expand because there are a number of them that are looking at this as a real opportunity to continue to
strengthen their own brick-and-mortar portfolios. So that's where we'll typically see it.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

As it relates to sourcing of deals and how we evaluate new deals going forward, we've always taken a very
hard look at the quality of the tenant and their balance sheet, and that will continue. Throughout this,
it's always been a historic focus, and it will remain a focus because it's really at these times is where that
matters most. And those with the strong balance sheet and great operating fundamentals will be the ones
that continue to thrive during this time and then on the back end of it as well.

Operator

Our next question will come from Greg McGinniss with Scotia.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Glenn, Kimco has done a really good job in making sure that it has liquidity to survive, and this is
not necessarily a unique position for Kimco operating in this difficult environment. But how are you
thinking about managing leverage throughout the shutdown and once we get on to the other side of this
pandemic? And then Ross, if you wouldn't mind commenting on the transaction environment and your
ability to help fund any expenses with dispositions, that would be appreciated as well.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I mean look, leverage has always continued to be a focus for us. The liquidity that we have right now has
not had an impact on leverage because you have -- it's really net debt, right? You have cash that we've
put on the balance sheet or debt that we've repaid with some of that liquidity. So we really haven't moved
-- the leverage really hasn't moved. And you see that both in the numbers at the end of the first quarter
and where I would expect it to be even at the end of the second quarter. Again, leverage is an important
thing. We keep a very close eye on it. We are a strong BBB+, Baa1-rated company, which is important to
us. We still have desires to get us to a positive outlook.

And I think we're doing really all the right things around that where the rating agencies will see a
difference. I mean they're tapping the bank market, and having 15 banks participate in this environment
is fairly unique. I do feel, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we have clear access to the bond
market if we wanted to do it, so -- and again, we feel like we're in pretty good shape on that standpoint,
and leverage will continue to be a focus of trying to reduce it further.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. And as it relates to the second part of the question, I would just say that the current market is really
taking a bit of a wait-and-see approach to really better determine the longer-term impacts to cash flow,
to tenancy. We have seen a few smaller deals trying to structure around the situation with master leases,
escrows or holdbacks, but it's really a pretty de minimis component of the overall transaction market.

In terms of our own portfolio and utilizing dispositions, I mean, we are extremely confident in the portfolio
transformation that we've undertaken over the last 5 to 7 years. As you know, our intent coming into this
year pre-COVID was to have a very modest level of dispositions, and really, that hasn't changed even in
the midst of this. You'll see a very light second and third quarter from a disposition and transaction overall
standpoint for Kimco. As we get into the fourth quarter, we may evaluate a couple of deals if the market
defrosts to a certain extent. But we do not anticipate utilizing dispositions as a major funding mechanism
in any meaningful way.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Great. And Conor, you've shown a clear focus on helping out the smaller shop tenants. And I'm just
curious how successful your tenants have been at obtaining the PPP funds with guidance from the Tenant
Assistance Program. Do you have any stats on maybe how many tenants have applied for and received
funds?

10

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. It's obviously something we focused on. And I'll tell you that the first round was uninspiring because
typically, as you've seen some of those stats come out, it sort of reflected exactly what we saw in our
small shop tenants that around 5% of them were only successful in the first round. But the good news
is we've seen quite a few be very successful in the rounds following it. And we think that since they've
made tweaks to the program and it's been more focused on the small shop and the small restaurant and
the mom-and-pop, we think that they have the tools now to get through the window and be successful on
obtaining those funds.

So we're cautiously optimistic that -- obviously, they did it extremely fast and had to get it out there, and
there were some loopholes in there that people took advantage of. But now we think that the small shops
that we have, have the right tools in place and are ready to go and hopefully get the PPP loans so that
they can make it to the other side of this. So we're cautiously optimistic that they've made the changes
needed.

Operator

Our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

First, just on the dividend. You guys suspended the common dividend, but it sounds like you're still going
to pay the preferred. So based on where you've paid the common so far and presumably you're going to
pay preferreds the rest of the year, do you guys need to pay a common dividend in the balance of the year
to satisfy tax compliance with the REIT status?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Alex, it's Glenn. Based on where we are currently and based on our own internal forecast, the answer is
yes, we would still need to pay a further dividend to cover taxable income.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Can you share how much is it? Are you close to the line? Are you still on the tee box and you still got...

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, we can't share that, Alex.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I would say it's on -- actually, Alex, it's just -- again, it's too early. There's a lot of moving parts that go
into it, but we -- as I mentioned, we would still need -- based on the current forecast, there would be a
need for further dividend to make our -- make our distributions equal 100% of our taxable income.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay, great. And then the second question is, just in speaking to REITs -- other REITs out there, it sounds
like tenants have credit -- as part of their bank lending, they have to be current on all of their leases, et
cetera. But some of the tenants have been seeking waivers from their creditors so that if they don't pay
their leases, they're not in default of their credit. Do you know how many of your tenants have sought
those waivers out from their banks?

Executive VP & COO

Alex, this is Dave. We don't. We haven't really had that discussion with the retailers, and they haven't
brought it up to my attention.

Operator

Our next question will come from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Conor, I'm glad to hear you feeling better. I want to come back to -- to start off coming back to a question
Christy asked about maybe ability to defer expenses. I'm thinking back to how much CapEx you were able
to reduce during the GFC. But maybe, Conor, if you're thinking about fully loaded CapEx, both reoccurring
and then development and redevelopment CapEx, how much do you think you could reduce that from your
run rate in 2019?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Thanks for that. It's nice to be back in the saddle. That's for sure. Look, we look at our CapEx and our
OpEx really on a site-by-site basis. And we have multiyear CapEx and OpEx plans. And so what we do is
we go through that in detail to figure out what is required to be sure that the operating plan keeps the
shopping center as safe as possible, making sure that the required upgrades are done and that the more
-- the needs and the wants, I guess, are separated. So we obviously prioritize the needs and then we push
out the wants. And that's just on the capital plan for each and every asset.

On the offensive CapEx where we look at our development and redevelopment plan, we continue to think
that our asset base is ripe for redevelopment. And as I mentioned in my comments, we think we're really
only in the early innings of the entitlement plans that we've played these last few years. We've been
successful with gaining traction on the multifamily entitlement plan. We think that we're, again, probably
going to double the amount of entitlements in the next few years, mainly because of we see the path
ahead. Now the question is, is how much of that can we activate and how much would we put in that -- in
the active pipeline. In this environment, we're probably going to hit the pause button on taking on projects
ourselves, but we may look at ground leasing or doing some other projects that way that limit the amount
of capital that we would have to implement to the projects but look at the value creation over the long
term. And again, it's all about the long-term here. We know that we're in an unprecedented situation.

But typically, what we've seen in the past, at least when I was out west when we went through the last
crisis, we were very, very successful on the entitlement plans during the downturn. Many times, cities and
states are in desperate need of raising taxes and capital, and they loosen up their grip a little bit on the
entitlement plan. So we might be actually even more successful on our entitlements in a situation like this
than we even expected. And so the key for us is securing the entitlements. And then as we've talked about
before, it's that decision tree of where our cost of capital is and do we elect to sell the entitlement rights,
do we elect to ground these entitlement rights, do we elect to joint venture the entitlement rights or do we
elect to self-develop. And I think in this current situation, the likelihood of doing self-development is very
slim. But we do think that long-term value creation on entitlements is critical to our success and critical to
our shareholders.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. I think that's pretty helpful color. I wanted to talk about your negotiations with tenants, maybe not
just what you're hearing currently. But I think what a lot of -- what I'm certainly trying to understand and
what I think a lot of us are trying to understand is does the structural dynamic change over the medium
to long term. So I'm curious, are you hearing about any tenants wanting to stay in your properties but
maybe go to more of a percentage rent structure? Are any tenants asking for lower rents? I would think
that there was a fair amount of tenants that still are very viable and want to be involved but are maybe

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

needing a little bit more cushion than they did previously. So I'm curious, are you engaging any of those
discussions yet? Or is it still too early days?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. This is Dave. It's a great question. It is very much still the early days. I mean, when -- despite it
feeling like almost a decade that we've been through this, it's really only been about 6 weeks. So keeping
that in context, the way we've approached this is really wanting to take a very methodical and measured
approach, one month at a time, have those discussions as needed, as they arise. And then we continue to
get more visibility through the course of the summer and then into the fall to better understand exactly
what the outcome and the long-term implications will be. From the retailer side, they -- a lot of our
retailers, again, as I mentioned earlier, see this long term as an opportunity to continue to strengthen
their portfolio and will be wanting to expand. And they are starting to reopen their locations as markets
start to open as well. So for us, it's going to be a very measured approach. And as we get further along,
we'll have better visibility into the longer-term outcome.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes, one point just to add to that, I think it's important to know, and retailers are prioritizing this, is they
look at their opportunity set and they see their boxes. And the differentiator for Kimco is that we have
third parties validate that our market rents on our anchor boxes are 55% below market. And so when they
look at their fleet of stores, they recognize which stores they need to protect because they're not going
to be able to replace that type of economic deal. And so I think one thing you're probably going to see is
there's going to be a limited amount of landlords through this as well as on the other side of this that have
the capital to invest in some of the larger and the junior box type of deals that are out there. So I would
anticipate that you're going to see those anchor tenants, those junior anchors that are successful prioritize
the spaces that they have that are either on ground leases or significantly below market rents. And we
think that's a differentiator for Kimco.

Operator

Our next question will come from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

On the deferred rental agreements, when are you generally targeting for the payback of the deferred rent?
And are you getting any other control rights as you enter into these deferral agreements?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. This is Dave, Craig. It really is a case-by-case analysis. We treat each retailer on its own in those
discussions. And so they will vary based on needs and wants on both sides. And again, we've wanted to
take a very measured approach here, just addressing it one month at a time.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We do think, Craig, there are -- we have seen opportunities, Craig, to recapture control areas and things
like that, that would open up some redevelopment entitlement opportunities. But as Dave said, it really is
-- every individual tenant, every site, every lease is a little bit different, so you have to go one by one.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay, great. And then just turning to the Kimco's Curbside Pickup Program. I wondered, a, how you're
monitoring it; and does the national rollout seem to be imminent?

13

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes, yes. So this is -- so we first launched it in Texas. And Texas is going to be one of the first markets
to open and require curbside. So Grand Parkway is actually fully deployed at this point with stalls in
play. And as those retailers have started to open, we've seen both local and nationals utilize it. We
anticipated curbside to be a trend into the future at some point. It's been an ongoing dialogue for years
now at various events, in our conversations with our retail partners. COVID, what that did was really just
accelerate this trend that was imminent.

And so for us, we were able to get out in front of it very, very quickly because we were already working
on plans to deploy. And our system, being centralized, we're able to offer those retailers specific zones in
which they can utilize for their curbside pickup and then they communicate directly with their tenant -- or
their shoppers on what zones to go to, and then those shoppers call the retailer to identify exactly what
stall they're in. So thus far, it's early, right? We're about a week or 2 into our initial deployment in Texas,
but the response right now has been very favorable.

And as it relates to the balance of the national program, we've been already in process with that, and we'll
have again a very measured approach on that rollout. But the way the trend is going is that curbside will
just be one of those other tools that retailers and landlords will be working collectively to ensure that we
service the customer in the best way possible.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Craig, we think it's a way to get customers more comfortable coming back to the shopping center as
well. So one of the key challenges that we focused on is helping our small shop tenants as well as getting
the customer to a level of comfort so that they can go back to their daily needs and services when the
states are allowed to open back up. And we feel that because most of our grocery stores, our big-box
tenants and our home improvement centers have been open through this, that the customer is actually
comfortable with that program that they've been very successful. Our retailers have reported a 200%-plus
growth in curbside pickup. So we figured why not take the best practices of our largest national tenants
and share that with our small shop tenants so that they can hopefully rebound quickly and that we also
invite the customer back to the shopping center in a way that gives them the comfort level that I think is
going to be required to make sure that we rebound as quickly as possible.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes, it does seem like a good way to facilitate the -- towards the reopening.

Operator

Our next question will come from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.

Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So Conor, I guess, the question I had was on cotenancy risks. I mean how should we think about that,
I guess, in the portfolio, especially as it relates to some of the bigger -- the box or centers or the newer
developments that you had? I assume there are leases that are tied to some of these nonessentials, right,
the gyms, the theaters. I mean if they were to potentially restructure or even close doors, I mean how
does that trickle through, I guess, the rents of the other tenants there?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. Cotenancy risk for us is pretty minimal. When you think about the way that cotenancy has been
drafted in a lot of these leases, it does vary case by case. But predominantly across our portfolio, a
cotenancy clause has a number of tenants having to go dark in order for it to be triggered. And so if you

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

think about that typically a shopping center has maybe 3 to 5 anchors, typically, a cotenancy clause in
our portfolio needs at least 2 to 3 of those anchors to be dark in order for it to be triggered. And we do
come into this from a position of strength. If you think about the multiyear repositioning that we've gone
through, if you think about the balance sheet and how we position it to go long, and if you think about our
occupancy from an anchor perspective at over 98%, in a lot of ways, we've been preparing for this. Now
we knew that the cycle was going to end. We never would have guessed it was going to end this way. But
in a lot of ways, we've been preparing for this. And a lot of the deferral programs that we've been talking
to tenants as well are allowing us to sort of water down those cotenancy clauses or give us even a little bit
more strength on the other side of it. So hopefully, that helps.

Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And I guess my second one is on the grocers, right? I mean can you provide an update on maybe even
Albertsons here? What's the potential to even monetize that investment at this point? I mean clearly, the
grocery sector has been pretty solid even during the pandemic, and Albertsons has certainly reduced their
debt position here. So how should we think about that?

Raymond Edwards
Executive Vice President of Retailer Services

It's Ray Edwards. I hope you and your family are safe and healthy. For Albertsons, I think you might have
seen on Tuesday night, they refiled and updated their S-1 based on the fiscal year-end for them, which
was in February. And they really have performed extremely well. Their comp store sales were up in March
like 47% and I think, over the first 2 months, over 30%. And they've done a great job, as you mentioned,
on the balance sheet and improving their debt profile. So they feel very -- they feel they have a great
position potentially on an IPO, but markets are the markets. So we have to work with the underwriters,
see what the right thing is to do on that front, and we'll execute at the right time. But they're really
focused right now on running the business, and it's much more complicated today for them than it was
2 months ago. So we want to, as owners, make sure they execute correctly and make the company as
strong as it can be.

Operator

Our next question will come from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I know the game plan's for deferrals, but how are you thinking about the risks that with so many people
out of work that this could turn into cuts and permanent closures if sales are slow to come back?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. It's Dave again. So again, it's so early in the cycle to really make any real forecast on what the
longer-term outcome will be. So for us, with the deferment program, we've been wanting to take it one
month at a time, gain better visibility into the program, into how COVID is going to have these impacts
on the retailers and employment, et cetera, longer term and then, in which case, we'll be able to address
that. But our focus has always been on the tenant retention out of the gate as COVID started. And we're
exhausting all of our resources to ensure that they have the appropriate support to survive and thrive
through this long term.

Michael William Mueller
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Are you operating with a view, though, that this is worse than the GFC or better or just similar?

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

It's unprecedented in a lot of ways, and it's a very different outcome. This was a -- I think the Great
Recession was a financial crisis. This was a social crisis, initially, and now we're starting to see how it
evolves and how it plays, but it's still early days. So I'd hate to forecast exactly what the expectation
would be longer term here until we start to see a little bit more into the future.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

It's Glenn. I'll speak for a little bit more. To his point, again, this is a health crisis that is turning into a
financial crisis. A lot of these companies, like really, the strong retailers that -- many of them that are
closed today, they're not closed because their business was bad or they had bad inventory. They're closed
because of the pandemic that we're in. So it's very difficult to compare it to the great financial crisis.
I mean look at unemployment. Unemployment's at 14.7%. You have 30 million people that are out of
work temporarily or on furlough. But different than the great financial crisis, the government has been
incredibly positive about pumping liquidity, helping the consumer, giving them $600 checks on top of the
unemployment. So it is very different. Again -- the end, though, is it's too early to really tell where we're
going to come out. So we just take it a day at a time, a week at a time and a month at a time.

Operator

Our next question will come from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I wanted to go back to the Tenant Assistance Program real quickly. How can it become more substance
versus PR? And I say that respectfully, right? So how have you invested in tweaking the approach to filing
for the program so that more tenants actually see relief in round 2? And/or is it a buy-in issue with local
tenants? So bottom line, what can you do to generate a higher success rate going forward?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. This is Dave. And so yes, so with the program, to start, we had -- as Conor mentioned in his prepared
remarks, we have over 600 tenants already through the program itself or participating currently in the
program. To ensure that we bolster the effectiveness of it, too, we also aligned ourselves with local banks
that seem to have the greatest success early on in terms of getting the loans to the end customer, which
was our retailer. When we look at the program to date, I think it has been very effective. We have over
$20 million either approved and/or submitted for loans. So when you think about substance, I think
that's very substantive. And we continue to work through this. And if the program, as it relates to the
government in terms of government assistance, continues to expand we have the infrastructure in place
to continue to support that and to provide further assistance to those retailers as they navigate the PPP
process and the other submittal processes for assistance.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, great. And then just secondly, with respect to Albertsons, if an IPO is successful, could you just
remind us how your stake would be treated and/or taxed?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. It's Glenn. So if it gets -- if something was to get done, you have to step back and look at where
we are. We have a basis of about $140 million. A portion of the investment was previously held in the
REIT. And then there's another portion that was in our TRS, which has now been merged back into the
REIT. We know that based on the studies that we've done and where we stand that the max tax is roughly
$50 million in total on everything, irrespective of how big -- how much capital you would get from a
transaction. So what's going to happen is, if it was to go public, the investment that we have today,
which is on the cost method, would then turn into a marketable security, and you would mark-to-market

16

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

the unsold shares on your balance sheet. And then the cash you're getting is basically like a free equity
offering. You get all this cash with no impact to NOI because we're not generating any NOI from the
investment.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets.

Robert Jeremy Metz
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Conor, I was just hoping to get a little more color on the dividend here and the decision to suspend it
versus possibly cut it. You still have a decent amount of CapEx need even with the slight reduction you
outlined. AFFO coverage was pretty tight before this. So was there a thought at all to use this opportunity
to just better rightsize it now? And is that something maybe we should be looking at in the coming
quarters, and therefore, suspending it was just the right first step? Or how should we think about that?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Jeremy, it's a good question. Look, I think we're all very much in the early innings of this pandemic, and
we want to get more color on how May plays out, how June plays out and really see the amount of rent
we're collecting before we can really get an understanding of hopefully how the economy opens back up
and how our retailers respond. And so it's all about clarity. And I think the Board has discussed a number
of different scenarios of what may or may not happen. And the tricky part is, is nobody has a perfect
crystal ball of what we're dealing with today. And so the suspension is exactly that. And we did comment
that it will be reviewed monthly because we do want to keep the Board in constant communication to
understand all the ins and outs that we are seeing and the different scenarios that may play out and the
taxable income piece that's going to be critically important as well.

So there's a lot of different scenarios that may play out. We think suspending it was the right move today.
We think we're viewing it monthly is the right move going forward. In that way, we can move quickly if
and when we need to -- and we know we need to reinstate it. We made that comment before. We made it
in the press release. We made it in our remarks. And so it will be reinstated in 2020. And we just have to
understand what that level at the right point is going to be as things clear up a little bit more.

Robert Jeremy Metz
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes, that's helpful. And second one for me, in terms of the deferrals that were granted, the 14% that was
mentioned, does this cover some tenants that were into the paying camp for April? And if so, how much is
from that group that actually paid in April versus coming from that bucket that didn't?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Can you just, I guess, clarify the question? Just wanting to better understand what was asked.

Robert Jeremy Metz
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes. I think these deferrals get thought of as being granted towards the 40% (sic) [ 14% ] that didn't
pay you April when, in reality, I think some of the tenants that have paid did so to gain more favorable
standing. And so I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, of the deferrals that were granted, did some of
those come from that tenant base that paid in April versus the bucket that didn't?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Got it. Yes, it varies. It's really case by case. Those -- sometimes in the early discussions, as all this
started to unfold, some retailers tried to take a very hard position early on, and then that position evolved

17

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

and changed, acknowledging that they have financial obligations to meet, and so they paid April rent
with nothing tied to that. But it really is always a case by case. So it's hard to, I would say, contextualize
exactly it being one thing or another.

Robert Jeremy Metz
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So just, I guess -- so can we assume that there possibly were some tenants that paid April that might get
rent deferred for May or June? Is that -- I guess that's where I was going with it. Is -- are there potential
future expectations we need to be thinking about from tenants that paid that they're not just so clean and
this is a group that didn't get any and those are the only ones getting deferrals?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes, yes. I mean that could very much be part of the discussion as well as, as Conor mentioned earlier,
other considerations in terms of loosening restrictions within leases and providing more favorable terms to
ourselves and the landlord. That will enable us to do other things in the future. So it's -- all of those points
are discussions and negotiating points on the table.

Operator

Our next question will come from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors.

Vince Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Ross, could you provide a little more color on the conversations taking place in the transactions market
today? How are people thinking about stabilized NOI and cap rates in this environment?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Sure. I know it's early for you. That really is the challenge today is that the lack of clarity that the
retailers have in terms of the opening. It's very difficult for an acquisition to take place when the NOI is
so uncertain. So as I mentioned previously, there are opportunities or attempts to try and box in what
that risk may be. So you have seen some conversations related to trying to understand which tenants are
paying, which tenants are not paying, who you may want to try to box in an escrow agreement for or to
cover some rent for a period of time. But I would say right now, the vast majority of investors or owners
that have capital are really a bit on the sidelines right now just waiting to see how it unfolds. If there
becomes a period of more distress or dislocation, I think we and some others are ready to take advantage
of it. But right now, it's really been a situation where I heard a quote that I like that, "In the first quarter,
the planes that were in the air landed and not a lot of planes have taken off since." So we're waiting to see
when there's clearance to fly again.

Vince Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Makes sense. I mean, in your mind, what needs to change maybe to unfreeze the transaction market?
I mean is it just more a country reopening, rent collection levels getting back to normal-ish levels? Or
what's the biggest criteria in your mind to kind of get things moving again?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. First and foremost, there needs to be a comfort level in the country that it's safe to reemerge and
to start shopping again and for these retailers to open. Even in some of the states and the counties
where reopening plans have started to exist, not all the retailers have opened yet, even if they're capable
or allowed to legally. So we're still a little bit early in people getting comfortable, whether it be testing
capacity or ultimately a vaccine. So as soon as I think there's a return to normalcy and there's a better

understanding of which retailers and which categories of retail will open and what that looks like, are there
capacity issues, are F&B, theaters, fitness, going to be able to return back to 100% capacity, as soon
as we have more clarity in that scenario, I think both investors and lenders will become a little bit more
comfortable in loosening the purse strings and starting to invest again.

Vince Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

That makes sense. That's helpful color. One more, just a quick one for me, if I could. What is the pre-
leasing level at The Boulevard? Is that impacted at all in recent months due to the pandemic?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Right now, we were in -- we're close to 90% on the pre-leasing with The Boulevard, and nothing
has changed at this point. So we continue to do our fit-out work with all the retail tenants, as Conor
mentioned earlier, the -- it was deemed essential. We got the waiver. Shoprite is underway. We're going
through the inspections. And then for the balance of the shopping center, we continue to do our fit-out
work.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

A huge kudos to our team that went above and beyond to get those waivers because it was not easy, and
to get it expeditiously and get it back to having the construction workers on-site was not easy. So I thank
all the team that's been working on that because it's been pretty incredible to see how a site that was
closed down, in essence, from the shutdown to quickly ramp back up was pretty impressive.

Our next question will come from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Quick -- can you remind us, again, what your breakeven rent collection is to cover your ongoing
expenses?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Floris, it's Glenn. If you look at like run rate, total expenses, G&A, operating expenses at property level,
interest expense, all that kind of stuff, it runs about $150 million a quarter, so somewhere roughly in and
around $50 million a month.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

So -- and what percentage of the cash rents would you need to collect to get to that level?

It's probably around the 50% level. I have to do the math, specifically, but it's around that.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Another question maybe for you, Glenn, as well. Your straight-line receivables, it doesn't appear
like you've taken any write-downs on any of that. Could you walk us through how you think about some
of your riskier tenancies? And also maybe talk about that in terms of the bad debt, which was $4 million
relative to the $1.7 million last year. How much of -- has the COVID impacted your thinking about your
tenants?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Let me just talk generally about just AR reserves as it relates to us. We, as a practice, have always had
reserves against straight line. So the number that appears in our supplemental, that is net of reserves. So
we have reserves up and ready and pretty robust policies and procedures in how we analyze tenants as
we go forward. Now the pandemic makes us review those procedures and policies to make sure they're
sufficient for the current environment, but we have always had -- and we may be a little different than
others. We've always had reserves against straight line, good times and bad. So we -- you don't see
a whole lot of movement there because that actually is a netted number. So there is a sizable reserve
against straight line today.

On the AR, the billed AR, and what we call unbilled AR, which is our -- the CAM, the tax that you're
accruing as you go along, we have very significant reserves there as well and, again, very -- again, what
we believe are extremely very robust policies about how we look at it. And we go tenant by tenant, lease
by lease in making determinations about the appropriate level of reserves. Now do I think the reserves will
go up in the second quarter? I do. But I think as of 3/31, the reserves are very adequate and clear about
where things are. So I don't -- you'll see movement, but I'm not expecting drastic movement as it relates
to RAR.

The $4 million that you saw for the quarter, which is -- it's roughly 138 basis points. As you know, we
carry in our forecast and our budget around 100 basis points for a year. So that at 138 basis points, it's
roughly 35 basis points for the quarter. So even relative to our original plan, we still have 65 basis points
available to us. And I would also tell you that a portion of the reserve taken was really related to 1 tenant
that's still operating. So -- and that was really the Fairway grocer in Plainview for us. That was about $1
million of the reserve. They're still operating, so that may come back to us, too.

Our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes. I'm glad to hear everyone's doing well, especially you, Conor. So my first question is on the
nonessential rent on your COVID update slide. That bucket comprises just under half of your rent, 43%,
it looks like. And it looks like you collected 42% from that group in April and received deferral request for
another 21%. So I'm trying to get a sense of how we should understand that. What do you expect from
the 37% who have not requested deferrals? And then maybe you could share some thoughts on how you
see the probability of collections for this group overall versus, say, the essential, and if we could see a
narrowing of the gap between that and the 86% you collected in the essential bucket?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Sure. So I'll try to break this down a little bit and make sure I address all parts of your question. So for
those that have not requested any deferrals at this time, it could be for a variety of reasons. One, they're
continuing to operate or they're still paying or they can be closed and paying. It also means that they just
have been going through the loan process and wanting to wait to see -- gain more visibility into what type

20

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

of assistance they could secure to meet their financial obligations with us and our lease. Now we have
seen that actually happen a couple of times for those that had requested deferrals, had since called us
back and said that they're willing to pay rent because they just got the PPP loan. So they're able to meet
that obligation. So it really does vary.

In terms of collectibility on the back end, again, it is still too early to tell. We're only 6, 7 weeks into this.
So you're going to have to play that out a little bit further to understand exactly, as markets start to
reopen and these retailers start to get back in the swing, what that looks like. And I do apologize, but I
think you have one last part to your question.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I was just looking for some perspective on the 2 buckets, if we could see some narrowing. And I think you
somewhat addressed it, but the crux of my question was there's a big chunk here that hasn't either paid
or requested deferrals and was really trying to get some clarity on what the nature of conversations or
what you understood to be the current situation there.

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. I think what I just mentioned probably answers that best.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe a question for you, Glenn. I just want to clarify on the collection numbers
we're seeing here. It looks like it's based on ABR. In other words, total occupied -- total potential rent, not
necessarily based on an occupancy-based numbers in a sense that if you had lower occupancy, you would
benefit because you have less rent to collect. Just wanted to make sure because there's a lot of numbers
being thrown out there in the industry right now. Some are based on total potential ABR, assuming
100% occupancy. Some are based on current occupied ABR. Some are putting CAM in that figure. So it's
important. I just want to make sure we understand what's being reflected here.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

It's strictly based on billed AR. It's simple. It's not complicated. It's the billed AR for the month of April.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Haendel, I think if you're talking about what would it be, you included the CAM and the other recoveries,
it's comparable to what we collected.

Operator

Our next question will come from Chris Lucas with Capital One.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

I guess 2 quick ones for me. As it relates to the deferrals, do you guys have like a weighted average
duration by ABR that you could provide just in terms of how long the deferrals are across your -- the
14%?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Right now. I mean similar to how I think I addressed this earlier, it really is a case-by-case situation. And
as I also stated earlier, some of these deferments that were issued to some of these retailers have started

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

to get paid back just because they've secured the loan, so it is still very fluid. We'll have better visibility as
we progress through this over the next couple of months.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then, Glenn, earlier in your comments you mentioned something about a mortgage, I think,
you did. It looks like there was a JV mortgage that you pushed out 90 days. I guess I'm just curious as to
what you're seeing in the direct lending market in terms of how people are underwriting, or if they're not,
if they pull back, just maybe some commentary about what's going on in the mortgage market would be
really helpful.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So we have a property in the Bronx, Concourse Plaza, right near the Yankee Stadium that was really
a development project over time with our partner. We're 50-50 partners. So we had a loan that was
maturing in 2020, and we sourced a new loan for higher proceeds actually at $75 million and closed
on it in early April. So it's a new 7-year loan at 3.13%, so actually cost savings for the partnership and
extended the term out much longer. Look, the mortgage market is very, very specific as to the property
that you're looking to finance for a while, the CMBS market froze for a bit. Bank lending has its level of
challenges, I would say, more at the money -- big money center banks than it is at the regional banks.
I think the regional banks are still very active. The other thing I could give you just some visibility on is,
again, on the residential side, the Fannie and Freddie market is completely operating and functioning. And
for the right assets, you can still clearly get mortgages and financing for term at incredibly low rates.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

On the multifamily side, construction financing, have you guys looked at that in terms of what's available
and how that's being underwritten and priced?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

We really haven't. We don't have actually any construction financing. As a matter of fact, the one
construction loan that we did have, which was on Dania, which was $67 million, we paid off during the
first quarter. So we actually have no construction financing. We haven't been outsourcing it. I believe
if we wanted to -- quite candidly, if we wanted to get construction financing, I think with the banking
relationships that we have, we could obtain it, but it's not something that we are doing at the moment.

Operator

Our next question will come from Collin Mings with Raymond James.

Collin Philip Mings
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to go back to the transaction market, and you touched on Albertsons, specifically, a bit. But
if we just reflect on Kimco's history and the PLUS business, can you maybe just expand on your potential
appetite for any similar opportunistic investments as this cycle plays out? And how would you balance
these types of investments versus, obviously, the near-term focus on liquidity or potentially ramping back
up some redevelopment opportunities you've discussed?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Sure. I think when you look at the strategy of Kimco, we've always had the opportunity bucket where we
look at retailers that are real estate-rich, and that's how, close to 10 years ago, we wound up with the
Albertsons investment of owning close to 10% of that grocery chain. They still own and control close to

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

22

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

50% of their real estate. And the original thesis there was that the real estate alone was so valuable that
it would make sense long term. And clearly, the operations now have been a shining star in the grocery
sector.

We still believe that there's going to be opportunities for, what we call, the PLUS business going forward.
We have been focused on making sure that we try and harvest our existing PLUS business investments
before we go and start to make new investments just again so we can build on the wonderful track record
that we've had over the decades of investing in those types of opportunities. That being said, we think it's
a differentiator for Kimco. We think there's going to be opportunities ahead of us where the PLUS business
will be utilized and come in handy to really create opportunities because we do think there's going to be
a significant amount of dislocation. And if we're one of the few that have the capability to underwrite, the
capability to invest, we think it will reward our shareholders.

Collin Philip Mings
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay, okay. So it sounds like that does remain, again, more of an intermediate to longer-term priority.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We always have it as part of our differentiated strategy. We obviously have a very solid Tier 1 portfolio
where we are laser-focused on executing our 2020 vision strategy. If you think about over the past 2
years, how we've transformed the asset base, how we've gone long on the balance sheet, a lot of the
effort that we've made has really positioned ourselves to be ready for this type of environment so that the
mothership can continue to hopefully outperform. But the bucket that we have for the PLUS business is
always unique and opportunistic when those present -- when those opportunities present themselves. And
so we're ready, we think it's a differentiator for us and we think it will really reward our shareholders in the
long term.

Collin Philip Mings
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then, Dave, you spent some time discussing the curbside program, but to the extent social
distancing becomes more of a focus going forward, are there any other longer-term changes you've
already started to work on with tenants in terms of expanding outdoor seating for restaurants? Is there
anything else along that line as you just think about the actual physical location or the physical layout of
your properties?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Yes, great question. I mean you absolutely nailed it with your example, the outdoor seating is
something that we're already talking to our restaurant operators with. And we've actually been surveying
each of them to analyze those that already have outdoor seating, those that want to expand capacity,
areas in the shopping center that we can support that capacity, how do we -- do we manage it in
a centralized fashion with the appropriate social distancing measures, do we support the individual
restaurants in the outdoor seating that they need. So all of that is very much on the table and under
consideration. Between our development team, property management team, construction team and
leasing folks, everyone is really directly engaged in best understanding how we can best serve our tenant
base and the needs going forward.

Obviously, the situation will evolve, different municipalities and counties have different restrictions. And
that's what we've seen through the outset is you really have to take this case by case, but we take all 400
of our assets and have been doing very much a deep dive on how do we reformat both for the short term
and then what are more longer-term solutions that will be more permanent.

Operator

Our next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

23

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

So you have about 3.5% of rent expiring this year. You have about another 1% that's month-to-month.
What is the kind of current game plan to address those? And how will those negotiations go in this type of
environment?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Sure. Yes, this is Dave. So in terms of the current renewals and the discussions pre-COVID, those have
been ongoing. They are happening pre-COVID. And even as we're going through the first 6 weeks here,
those discussions continue. Again, the quality of our real estate has vastly improved over the years. And
so our 400 locations really service the community well and service the retailers extremely well. I think
what this has proven is that being close to your customer in these markets is really essential. And we've
been able to service that and the brick-and-mortar strategy. It will be critical long-term to service all these
different options to the customer, whether it be curbside, BOPIS, which has been an evolving trend. And
that looks to us will be in play for the long term here and has really been growing over the last couple of
years. So we feel good about that.

And then in terms of those that are month-to-month and how we address those, we are really looking at
it in a very measured way. We don't want to get too far out in front of it. Similar to what we did with the
Great Recession is we can do shorter-term renewals for the time being. Let's get more visibility to how this
looks long-term and then we can address the longer-term renewal on the back end there.

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

I guess what I was asking for about...

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Similar to what we've done in the past -- sorry, Ki Bin. Similar to what we've done in the past recession, in
the past Great Recession, is we adopted the phrase, Love the One You're With. And we recognize that the
existing tenant base is your best friend right about now, and so we're working with -- making sure that we
love the one you're with and bridge them to the other side of this.

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And does that translate into perhaps just shorter-term leases for now for the longer-term leases
that are better expiring?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Not necessarily. Again, it's case by case. It's hard to paint a broad brush on it because each situation is
different. And when you look at -- the majority of our retail shopping centers have essential components
to it with grocery. Over 77% of our ABR is associated with shopping centers that have a grocery
component to it. Those are the areas that people want to be in. I mean it's been proven that through this
pandemic that having the essential component is really key. And for those other retailers that can cotenant
across that or alongside it, they really do want to stay in those centers longer term. But it's really hard to
paint a broad brush over questions like that.

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I appreciate that. And Glenn, did you -- was there a change in the lease spread definition? If I look at
the supplemental, is there some language that suggested that?

why.

Our next question comes from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo.

Tamara Jane Fique
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Glad you're feeling well, Conor. Just following up on the commentary you made about loving the one
you're with. Certainly, there are a number of tenants that you may not love quite as much as others. I
guess is this also an opportunity to address lower credit tenancy where you may want to remerchandise
longer term? Or is occupancy preservation at such a critical level that maybe that's not a consideration at
this point?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

No, that's a good question. And I think you look at each and every situation and each and every site
individually to make the best business plan for the long term. And so we're always looking to upgrade
tenancy. We're always looking to improve the credit quality as well as the potentially -- I personally think
there's going to be a lot of opportunity to add a lot of grocers to our sites that don't currently have a
grocery anchor. And we're working on that right now. We're already close to 80% grocery-anchored. I
think we're going to be up over 80%. That's a challenge that we've laid out for ourselves. But that being
said, we recognize that a lot of retailers are going to have their expansion plans put on pause, except for
those that maybe have been operating through this pandemic. And so we do want to take it case by case.

And the small shops to me are critically important because I think they're the secret sauce in terms of
connecting with the community. Every shopping center has sort of a major national credit tenant that
people are used to shopping and love. But I think the real important part of the shopping center is that
secret sauce, the local mom-and-pop, because it's typically a generational owner or someone from the
community or someone that they really connect with. And I think that's where we really want to shine in
this type of environment is helping those folks get to the other side of it.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

Okay, got it. And then I guess some of your peers are looking to extend loans to their small shop tenants.
I'm curious if you've given any thoughts to doing that.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. It's actually something we've talked about when we were rolling out the TAP program and looked at
doing ourselves. But then we realized we should probably prioritize the government programs that are
in place because, in essence, they're there for a reason, and we figured let's make sure the tenants that
we have access those programs first and take advantage of those programs. And then as we watch the
PPP program closely and see how it's playing out, if we need to, we have the ability, obviously, with our
balance sheet to step in and help those in need. But right now, the priority is to focus on the PPP.

Tamara Jane Fique
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then if I could sneak one more. And I'm curious if you are seeing any differences in
collectibility based upon geography.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We really haven't seen much difference. It's -- right now, it's pretty consistent across the board.

Our next question will come from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.

Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Any sense of the breakdown in April rent collection for anchors versus the small shops?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

It's in the supplemental. Chris -- you'll find in the supplemental in our COVID business update, Linda.

Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. I think, by and large, the anchors were paid, and then it just varied a lot across the small shops,
right?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. 73% of our anchors paid and 44% of our nonanchors paid for April.

Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then when you look at the pipeline of retailers announcing restructurings, are there any strategies to
best mitigate the impact of upcoming increases? Maybe anything you can do to maintain occupancy on a
short or medium-term basis? And then do you think your scale helps you in this context?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Our scale and our diversity definitely helps. I mean when you look at the diversity of tenant base across
the portfolio, it's pretty incredible how diverse we are, especially when you take in the geographic diversity
on top of the tenant diversity. Clearly, we're watching the credit markets closely. Our tenants are some
of the -- our top 50, we have the highest investment-grade credits of our peer group. But we're watching

26

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

closely how that plays out. Clearly, there's been a lot of reorganizations, a lot of debt for equity swaps that
we've been watching in other sectors. But we're going to monitor that closely and continue to evaluate the
opportunities.

Operator

Our last question today comes from Christine McElroy with Citi Group.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

It's Michael Bilerman with Christy. Conor, it's great to hear you're doing better. I wanted to sort of ask
you -- and I think, obviously, you're doing a lot of stuff on the deferral and working with your tenants. I
assume you're paying a royalty fee to Steven Stills for Love the One You're With as well. But how do you
think about providing equity and stepping into retailers? It's obviously been a hallmark of Kimco for a long
time. Ray has been leading those initiatives. Do you view that as an opportunity today to invest into retail.
Put aside the deferrals and the loans, but try to make commitments and roll out a much more significant
program on that end?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Michael, thanks for those comments. Yes. No, we look at it the same way we've always looked at it. We
want to be opportunistic when those events create dislocation where retailers that are real estate-rich
need a partner to come in and unlock the value of that real estate. So we're very careful on who we invest
in and why. You can sort of look at our track record back to decades of all the investments we've made,
and it's a pretty consistent theme across the board. We like retailers that are real estate-rich. We typically
think we have the capacity to underwrite it. We have the capacity, if we need to, to take back the real
estate and help unlock the value there. And so that's what we've been focused on over the years. It's been
a good track record for us. We want to see the current PLUS investments pay off. We anticipate them to
continue to perform, and hopefully, there'll be some more dislocation in the near term that will create
opportunities for us so that we believe, as a differentiator, can really shine and create a lot of value for our
shareholders.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

I guess is that an initiative right now? You obviously have had relationships with private equity firms.
I'm just trying to get a sense of -- obviously, a lot of these retailers are struggling. Chapter 11 filings are
rising pretty dramatically. So I just don't know whether that's an active dialogue. And I respect that your...

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

It Is. It is. Yes. No, it is. It's part of our strategy. It's always been a Kimco differentiator. It always will be,
and we've been looking at that. It's lumpy, as you know. It's not the easiest thing to model, which I know
sometimes cause you a lot of angst, but we do think it's an opportunity for us at the right time. And we
haven't seen it happen yet, but we think the window is going to be opening here shortly for us to take
advantage of it.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

And then on the dividend, and so it was a suspension and you're going to review it monthly. What happens
when you do reinstate? Do you view that as a -- that you'll want to catch up and pay the -- whatever
dividends didn't get paid in the quarter? Is it just then when you reinstate it, it's just going to be on a go-
forward basis at whatever new rate you will feel comfortable with from a payout ratio perspective? How
should the market think about the suspension?

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 08, 2020

CEO & Director

Yes. It's a good question, Michael. It is very, very early. We're going to take it month-to-month. We use
that monthly review specifically because we do think we're going to have to have these updated calls
monthly with our Board to give them where we sit from May, from June, from July, and then reinstate
it where we think we'll have confidence, obviously, in covering it and have it be sustainable for the long
term. We know that the dividend is critically important to the investment thesis of Kimco shareholders,
and we want it to be tied to taxable income and to our cash flow. And as we get more information, as the
Board digests the information that's coming in daily, weekly, monthly, we'll be in a position to reinstate it
where we believe that for the long term, it will be in a good spot, not only for the existing but to grow over
time.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Right. So in this case, you may have a top-up dividend to meet taxable income and then a new run rate
quarterly dividend that you'll feel comfortable going into the future?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

It will really depend, obviously, on the situation that's transpiring in front of us. A lot of options are
available to us, a lot of levers that we can use, but that is part of the -- that is one of the optionality that
we have that we can look at when we get a little deeper into it.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

And you feel from paying it in stock, with having the ability to go 90% stock, that the idea of just
suspending was a better outcome than giving script to your shareholders.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We felt like suspension was the right approach at this point just because there's such a lack of clarity.
Obviously, with the change from 80% to 90% of a stock issuance of a dividend, that's an interesting
option as well. And again, we've -- it's a Board discussion that we've been having regularly. We'll continue
to monitor the situation. And I believe that as this gets a little bit deeper and we get the ability to see a
little bit more clarity, then we'll have more information at our hands to put it back in place at the right
level.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. And the last thing, with some of the states and municipalities that have reopened, do you have any
tenant sales from the stores the restaurants that have opened in your portfolio? Is there any anecdotes
that you can share about the pent-up demand that's going on in the economy when things do reopen?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We don't have any specific sales yet, obviously, since it's only been a couple of days. But we have seen
-- we do have conversations with store managers that we have relationships with. And obviously, the
curbside pickup program that we've launched, we have a lot of dialogue surrounding that. They've been
very pleasantly surprised with the curbside pickup and the accessibility and the use of it. They've been
happy so far. So we're continuing to monitor that closely, but we don't have any sales data yet.
