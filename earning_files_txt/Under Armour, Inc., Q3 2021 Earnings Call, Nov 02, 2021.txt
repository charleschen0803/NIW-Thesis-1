Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Thank you, Lance, and good morning. In the third quarter, higher-than-expected demand for the Under
Armour brand and outstanding execution from our global team allowed us to drive strong top and bottom
line results. Everything we do at Under Armour is based on driving sustainable long-term growth while at
the same time, ensuring we're setting a solid foundation to deliver near-term value to our shareholders.
This is the balance you should expect from us and is the commitment we work towards every day.

We strike this balance by leveraging our strategic playbook across key elements of our business, including
a consumer-centric strategy to drive deep, authentic and emotional connections with focused performers,
innovative products and experiences that advantage and inspire an athlete's journey, a constant focus on
operational excellence to ensure we manage the marketplace efficiently and steady financial discipline to
create meaningful levers to drive greater profitability.

These strengths were evident in our third quarter results with revenue up 8%, gross margin up 310 basis
points to a record 51% and solid adjusted EPS performance at $0.31. In this spirit, as we work to close
out 2021, I feel good about the progress we've made, the resiliency we've earned and the potential we
have to do even better in the future.

Demand for our product and consideration for our brand is growing. That gives me confidence that despite
potential impact from near-term headwinds, the long-term opportunities before us and our ability to
compete and win in an ever-changing global landscape are stronger than ever. Of course, it all starts with
brand, so with that, let's get into some third quarter highlights, starting with the incremental investments
we're making in marketing and how they're translating to improving brand affinity from our focus on
consumer awareness, attraction and consideration.

As part of our Holistic Journey to Compete strategy, which centers on goal setting, training and what
it takes to earn results, we use the team sports lens to focus on the importance of mental strength as

an unlock to realize one's full potential. Through uniquely Under Armour execution by our social media,
TV, retail and digital activations, the only way is through and train your mine train your game showed
up as one global brand and voice across categories, channels and our marketing funnel. Coming off
this effort, we've now shifted gears into fourth quarter activation, which is centered on cold weather
training. Knowing athletes sometimes see cold as their kryptonite, our human performance research lab is
helping equip them and reshape this type of training as an asset to take their performance to new levels.
Validated by the experiences of our most elite athletes, we're inspiring and educating focused performers
for the winter ahead with powerful storytelling, workout routines, product reviews and premium retail
capsules, our ecosystem is well set to inspire and capitalize on growing demand.

Turning to product. Given the third quarter bridge summer and fall, we realized success on both sides
of the temperature spectrum, including solid sell-through of our Iso-Chill apparel products, which cool
you; and fleece, which saw strength in men's and youth as athletes gear up for the cooler months ahead.
There's also continued momentum in men's unstoppable bottoms and women's leggings, including
Meridian and our No-Slip Waistband technology. And finally, the Project Rock collection and tops featuring
Rush also built on their year-to-date momentum, so consistency in some of our best sellers. In footwear,
our core running products, including Pursuit, Aurora and Assert saw strength in all regions globally.
Additionally, Project Rock footwear performed well, and we had success in our slides business. Regionally,
a few of the highlights included the Curry HOVR Splash and Mega Clone in APAC, HOVR Strt and Bandit
Trail in EMEA and Flow Velociti SE and cleated footwear in the Americas, driven by better-than-expected
back-to-school demand as team sports returned.

Let's turn next to our regions, starting with North America, where revenue was up 8% to $1 billion,
indicative of improving brand health in our largest market, we had stronger-than-expected back-to-
school and direct-to-consumer demand. In fact, North America drove the majority of the third quarter
overdelivery for the company, so encouraging to see continued progress here. Compared to 2019, North
American revenue was up 2% in the third quarter. It is important, however, to revisit some key differences
in these comparable periods, 2021 North America versus 2019, including a significant increase in our
direct-to-consumer business, substantially lower off-price sales, reduced promotional and markdown
activities, proactive supply constraints and undifferentiated wholesale exits. So all in, meaningfully higher
quality and more productive dollars going through our P&L now than just 2 years ago.

Turning to our international business. Revenue in our Asia Pacific region was up 19%, driven primarily by
wholesale growth. Given some of the recent market trends, particularly in China, where traffic continues
to struggle, our consumer insights data tells us that our brand health is holding steady in an otherwise
dynamic environment. We attribute this to the investments we're making into marketing, CRM and store
expansions, including opening our 1,000th store in the region.

Versus 2019, third quarter APAC revenue was up 37%, so solid progress on a 2-year stack. Next up
is EMEA, where revenue was up 15%, driven by wholesale, which saw continued momentum from our
distributor partnerships and a solid direct-to-consumer performance. In our 2 most prominent countries
in this region, the U.K. and Germany, we remain focused on brand development, building long-term
relationships with our key wholesale partners and strengthening our direct-to-consumer team and retail
capabilities. EMEA wholesale growth was balanced across our full price and distributor businesses. Versus
2019, third quarter revenue in EMEA was up 50%.

And finally, our Latin America region was up 27%, driven by strength in our full-price wholesale and
distributor businesses. Versus 2019, third quarter revenue in Latin America was up 8%. As previously
detailed, we are transitioning certain countries in this region to a strategic distributor model, of which
most of this change takes place in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect top line pressure in Latin
America as we finish out 2021.

Another highlight is the performance of our direct-to-consumer business, which was up 12%. And
although traffic trends were somewhat mixed in our own stores and mirrored various COVID restrictions
around the world, we continued to see improvements in average selling prices and productivity. Due to
higher-than-expected demand during the quarter, we further reduced promotions and realized higher price
sell-through, which, of course, you see in our gross margin results. Versus 2019, direct-to-consumer was

UNDER ARMOUR, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

up 31% for the third quarter. Overall, we're pleased that our strategies towards improved presentation and
experiences in our stores and online are driving better economics throughout this business.

So in summary, we're pleased with our third quarter performance and our ability to close up Under
Armour's and split adjusted EPS here in our history. In the near term, however, we remain both confident
and cautious with several fluid headwinds continuing to impact nearly every sector, it's important to
remember that Under Armour is battle-tested and mission proven. I am incredibly proud of our global
team and how we work to maintain balance and trajectory regardless of what has thrown our way. We
continue to get sharper, smarter and more efficient. Across our business, by channel, product or region,
there remains one constant: we obsess the intersection of -- Under Armour serving focused performers,
industry-leading innovations, premium experiences, heart-led but data-driven, we empower those who
strive for more. And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave.

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Patrik. With 3 quarters of the year behind us, our strong third quarter results demonstrate our
ability to execute quickly to meet the needs of our consumers and customers, all while driving toward
record revenue and earnings in 2021. So let's dive right into our results. Compared to the prior year,
revenue was up 8% to $1.5 billion. Versus our previous outlook, this overdrive was primarily due to higher
demand across our full-price wholesale and Factory House businesses in North America.

Patrik covered our regional performance earlier, so now let's click down into our channel results on a global
basis. Third quarter wholesale revenue was up 10%, driven by higher-than-expected demand in our full-
price business, particularly in North American wholesale, which was tempered by a reduction in sales to
the off-price channel as we continue to work to elevate our brand positioning. Our direct-to-consumer
business increased 12%, led by 21% growth in our owned and operated retail stores, partially offset by
a 4% decline in e-commerce, which faced a difficult comparison to last year's third quarter. But I would
also note that when compared to the third quarter of 2019, our e-commerce business was up over 50%.
And licensing revenue was up 24%, driven by improving strength within our North American partner
businesses. By product type, apparel revenue was up 14% with strength across all categories, particularly
in train and golf. Footwear was up 10%, driven primarily by strength in running. And our accessories
business was down 13% due to lower sales of our sports masks compared to last year's third quarter.

Relative to gross margin, our third quarter improved 310 basis points over last year, landing at 51%. This
expansion was driven by 400 basis points of pricing improvements due primarily to lower promotional
activity within our DTC channel, along with lower promotions and markdowns within our wholesale
business and 120 basis points of benefit due to channel mix, primarily related to lower mix of off-price
sales versus last year's third quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was about 100 basis points
of negative impact related to the absence of MyFitnessPal and 90 basis points of negative impacts from
higher freight and logistics costs due to COVID-related supply chain pressures. Versus our previous
expectation, our higher-than-expected Q3 gross margin improvement was primarily due to lower than-
planned promotional activity within our DTC business and more favorable pricing related to sales to our
off-price partners.

SG&A expenses were up 8% to $599 million due to increased marketing investments, incentive
compensation and nonsalaried workforce wages.

Relative to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded $17 million of charges in the third quarter. In this
morning's press release, we noted that we have reduced our plan expectations by $25 million. So we
now expect to recognize total planned charges ranging from $525 million to $575 million. Thus far, we've
realized $500 million of pretax restructuring and related charges. As a reminder, all remaining charges
are related to initiatives outlined in 2020, meaning nothing new has been added in 2021. We expect to
recognize any remaining charges related to this plan by the first calendar quarter of 2022.

Moving on. Our third quarter operating income was $172 million. Excluding restructuring and impairment
charges, adjusted operating income was $189 million. After tax, we realized a net income of $113
million or $0.24 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, loss

on extinguishment of $169 million in principal amount of senior convertible notes and the noncash
amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes. Our adjusted net income was $145 million,
or $0.31 of adjusted diluted earnings per share.

In this respect, we are excited to report that the $0.71 of adjusted diluted earnings per share that we've
realized year-to-date has surpassed our highest previous full year split adjusted earnings, thus solid
traction and excellent progress. Inventory was down 21% to $838 million, driven by improvements in our
operating model and inbound shipping delays due to COVID-related supply chain pressures. Our cash and
cash equivalents were $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we had no borrowings under our $1.1
billion revolving credit facility.

With respect to debt, during the third quarter, we entered into exchange agreements with certain
convertible bondholders for $169 million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes and
terminated certain related cap call transactions. We utilized net $168 million in cash, issued 7.7 million
shares of our Class C stock and recorded a related loss of approximately $24 million, which is captured in
other income and expenses.

Following this transaction and our actions in the second quarter, $81 million of convertible notes remain
outstanding. Now moving on to the balance of the year. As we noted earlier in this call, the current global
retail environment remains varied with some markets realizing a steadier return to growth like in the
Americas, albeit with continued weak traffic trends, somewhat mixed environments across different
regions in EMEA and conservative assumptions about APAC as it navigates ongoing phases of closures,
reopenings and restrictions. Factoring in the current supply chain challenges emanating from Southeast
Asia and logistics challenges being experienced worldwide, we're staying appropriately cautious in the near
term. However, it is important to note that today's revised outlook assumes no additional shutdowns of
manufacturing partners or further retail sector disruptions as we close out 2021.

Now turning to our updated 2021 outlook. Let's start with revenue, which we now expect to be up
approximately 25% for the full year. This reflects a high 20s percentage rate increase in North America
and a mid-30s increase in our international business. From a channel perspective, wholesale is expected to
be up at a mid-30s rate, and our DTC business up at a mid-20s rate with e-commerce up at a low single-
digit rate for the full year against 2020. Concerning our top line expectation for the fourth quarter, the
same significant headwinds from our last call remain in play. In addition to the developing COVID-related
supply chain issues currently facing the sector.

Turning to gross margin. On a GAAP basis, we expect the full year rate to be up approximately 130 basis
points against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and changes in
foreign currency being partially offset by higher expected freight expenses and the sale of MyFitnessPal,
which carried a high gross margin rate. The gross margin improvement relative to our previous outlook
is primarily due to pricing benefits, partially offset by increased freight expenses related to supply chain
challenges, which we continue to monitor. Versus 2020, we now expect that full year SG&A will be up 6%
to 7%.

As laid out previously, specific to 2021, we have taken advantage of our improved results and proactively
made incremental investments, particularly in marketing, to build even deeper connections with our
consumers. We also expect higher incentive compensation, which is up against 2020 when we had
significant reductions against target levels as well as higher nonsalaried wages. With that, we now expect
operating income to reach approximately $425 million this year or $475 million on an adjusted basis.
Translated to rate, we expect to deliver an operating margin of just under 8% or an adjusted operating
margin of approximately 8.5% in 2021.

All of this takes us to an expected diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.55 or adjusted diluted
earnings per share of approximately $0.74 in 2021, with an average weighted diluted share count of
approximately 468 million shares. And finally, from a balance sheet perspective, we expect to end the year
with inventory relatively flat against 2020's year-end, and we expect to close the year with approximately
$1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

UNDER ARMOUR, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Looking forward, a reminder that we are changing our fiscal reporting year in 2022. Mechanically, the first
calendar quarter will serve as a transition period until we begin our new fiscal year 2023 and on April 1.
Accordingly, we are not providing color for next year on today's call. That said, there are supply chain
pressures that are challenging the industry in the near term. And while we believe the impact to our P&L
in 2021 are expected to be relatively minimal, we are taking precautions to navigate some of the volatility
and anticipated business disruptions in the first half of 2022, including the work we began in the second
quarter of 2021 to adjust orders and shipping with our factory partners and logistics suppliers, working
with wholesale customers to narrow and edit our spring/summer 2022 order book and assessing various
mitigation offsets for inflationary pressures, including elevated logistics costs and higher wages. Given that
the situation is still fluid, it is difficult to estimate the full extent of potential effects on our business at this
point. However, on what we know -- based on what we know today, we are forecasting material impacts
to the first half of 2022. And therefore, with respect to the first calendar quarter, we expect revenue to
be up at a low single-digit rate. Concerning a longer-term view, as of this week, nearly all factories that
Under Armour does business with, including those in Vietnam are open. So definitely encouraging news. Of
course, full capacity will take some time to ramp back up, and this is only one part of the equation.

Over the next several quarters, we expect longer-than-usual transit times as backlogs and congestion
find balance. So this may create some variability in our results. That said, the proactive strategies we're
employing, greater operational agility and overall demand for the Under Armour brand give us confidence
in our ability to navigate effectively through the coming environment. With that, I'd like to close today's
call by returning to Patrik's opening thought and the balance we are committed to striking between driving
sustainable long-term growth while delivering near-term value to our shareholders. All global companies
operate in a constantly changing environment. And over the past few years, through our transformation
and the pandemic, Under Armour has demonstrated its ability to effectively manage our business under a
range of conditions.
Lastly, as we look to close out the strongest top and bottom line performance in our history, the work
we've done to rearchitect our strategy, operations and financial discipline sets us up well to leverage this
balance and thus create improved value for our shareholders over the long term. With that, we'll turn it
back to the operator for your questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler.

Erinn Elisabeth Murphy
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Great. And really nice to see the strong performance to date. Dave, I wanted to follow up with something
you were just talking about as it relates to the supply chain challenges. Can you share a little bit more
about your ability to get product to the North American and the European market here in the fourth
quarter as we think about holiday?

And then with your guidance or your preliminary look for the first calendar quarter, up low single digits,
is that, again, just ability to get product? Or have you really just seeing the impact of the curtailed
manufacturing as it relates to your ability to just even produce spring/summer?

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, Erinn. Relative to the supply chain impacts in Q4, as I had mentioned, almost all of our -- you know
the vaccination rates across Asia continue to trend up. And it's really kind of now pushing down the line
a little bit where the congestion and container availability at the origin ports have improved, but the local
ports of entry is where the bigger challenges are developing that we're monitoring.

To date, we've seen some timing changes in inbound product and how we can get that out to our partners,
but we haven't seen any cancellations. And so the forecast and the outlook that we've given for the rest
of the year in Q4, we feel good about. But it's definitely a very fluid situation. Relative to calendar Q1, this
really relates to the factories getting up and running, but not at full capacity and that creating a challenge
to be able to produce all the orders needed to meet our demand. So we've actually had to cancel some of
our purchase orders relative to Spring/Summer '22 product to be able to alleviate some of that pressure
on the factories. And based on that, and therefore, the change in inbound product to be able to go out,
that's where we're saying the impact is driving us towards what we see as of today as a low single-digit
growth rate for calendar Q1.

Erinn Elisabeth Murphy
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful. And then just if I can follow up. On the North American segment, it looks like
in the first 9 months of this year, you're up about 3% versus 2019, so squarely in line with your long-
range plan. Curious if you can talk a little bit more about how you think about the go-forward trajectory.
It seems like the fourth quarter has even guided nicely ahead of that. So I would love to hear about the
brand momentum that you're seeing currently in the North American market.

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Erinn, this is Dave. We are excited about the momentum. And again, I think the biggest thing that I
would point out is the health of that revenue. So not only are we growing again, but -- and even against
2019, but it is at a much healthier mix, a much smaller percentage of off-price sales to third-party, lot
less promotions and discounting. So just overall, a much healthier revenue stream at the same time that
we're returning to growth, which is, I think, the exciting part. And I think it's all about kind of who we
are doubling down with the bigger partners that really support our brand and really understand the focus
performer. And that's where we're driving most.

But we can't really give any details yet as far as next year on growth rates, but we are excited about the
momentum. Patrik, I don't know if you want to add anything there.

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Yes. I also want to just -- it's great, Dave. I just wanted to highlight also the fact that some of the demand
constraints are now fully in play for us as well in terms of exiting 3,000 doors or so in North America. And
of course, that's taking full effect into next year. So all of these things together really is giving us great
confidence in that we have now established a new platform or a new level, if you like, for the brand in
terms of driving it towards a more premium position again. So I feel very good about that.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.

Matthew Robert Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a really nice quarter.

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Matthew.

Matthew Robert Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Patrik, with nearly 2 years now at the helm, I guess, how would you characterize larger picture, maybe
the brand heat that you're seeing in men's and women's apparel today? And do you believe we've seen
the tipping point for footwear expansion? Just trying to think about maybe ranking opportunities on tap
from here.

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Thank you, Matthew. First of all, I am confident that we've now gone through what I would characterize
as the majority of our transformational work. We're now in the new operating model but not just the
operating model, we've also gone through at the same time, a reset for our product engines and our
marketing engine. So our go-to-market is really doing a great job of driving the brand to a more premium
position. What you see now in our numbers, there's a lot of balance here, right? You see a balance
between wholesale and DTC. You see also balance across the categories in terms of footwear and apparel.
We also now saw, specifically here in the third quarter, the back-to-school happening again in a more
normal fashion, I guess, you could say, in terms of team sports being played, and Under Armour really
coming into its own with the performance we saw now in things like cleated product and team product
as well. So across the board, whether it's team sports, train or run, men's or women's, we are able to
really drive our brand in all of those different categories and areas. And that's really what I feel really good
about is the holistic win for the brand right now in the marketplace. And we really feel like we have proven
that out now. And now for us, it's all about driving forward and continuing to fuel the brand, which we've
been able to do here in the back half as we've reinvested some of the -- some of the money here into
marketing and really been able to activate full funnel and you see the results.

Matthew Robert Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then maybe a follow-up for Dave. Can you speak to pricing power that you're seeing for the
brands, maybe both across apparel and footwear? And if we tie the AUR opportunity to gross margin, is
there any ceiling to think about as your gross margin exit this year, I think, around the 50% level?

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

10

UNDER ARMOUR, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Yes. I guess there's a couple of aspects there. We do continue to see pretty strong benefits that we're
able to drive by holding price higher, not doing much promotions or discounts. Sell-through has been good
with wholesale partners. So not having to discount or give as many markdown dollars. So that is definitely
contributing a lot to some of the pricing benefits we're seeing and some of the gross margin benefits.

And that all ties into our longer-term strategy of continuing to drive the brand to a more premium
position. So we're definitely excited about the momentum to be able to do that and the sell-through that
is allowing for that as well. We are also looking at ticket pricing also when you think about some of the
inflationary pressures, wage pressures, et cetera. So we have a team that's been looking at that, and
we're going to be very strategic and targeted in how we might do that, but we do think that there is some
MSRP opportunities for us as well based on our premium positioning and the quality of certain groups of
our products versus others. So we're going to keep driving on that front as well.

And our next question will come from the line of John Kernan with Cowen.

John David Kernan
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a really strong 9 months here.

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, John.

John David Kernan
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Patrik, you -- if we look at the first 9 months of this year, you're at a double-digit operating margin.
I know that was the long-term target. Can you give us any update in terms of the timing of reaching
those targets on a full year basis, certainly tremendous progress made towards those targets this
year regardless of what happens in the fourth quarter this year, and you've done in the face of a lot of
disruptions. Just curious if you maybe pull forward the timing of reaching those double -- that double-digit
operating margin target.

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

John, this is Dave. I'm actually going to jump in here because Patrik gets pretty excited about this topic.
Yes, we're obviously very pleased with the progress we're making on overall margins and being able to
leverage the cost structure better. And to your point, I think that our ability to drive the double-digit
operating margins is something we feel very, very good about and probably better about than even
previous based on the momentum that we're having. But at this point, we're not ready to be able to share
details for the upcoming years.

But we are excited about the progress. We do think there are continued opportunities on gross margin and
SG&A leverage, and you can be sure that we're going to be driving towards that.

John David Kernan
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Understood. Just one quick follow-up. DTC, obviously, it's had an outsized contribution to growth this year
off that pre-COVID days, you made some adjustments to wholesale distribution. Any comments on DTC
profitability and how that has changed as e-commerce has become a bigger portion of the mix? Just your
overall view of the direct-to-consumer channel and what we can anticipate for normalized growth in that
channel as we go into your new fiscal year and beyond.

Yes, John, this is Dave. Great question. As you know, we don't necessarily give channel profitability
publicly. But what I would say is that we have been focusing a lot on DTC. We've been making a lot of
investments there. And we're starting to see some of the benefits of that pay off. I think one of the areas
that we've also put a lot of work in is just to our retail full-price commercial concept. And so we are seeing
continued profitability improvements from that output, which is going to help overall DTC profitability as
well.

And then obviously, our Factory House business has been an extremely profitable business and e-com as
well. So we're pushing on all cylinders, but we're not disclosing the actual percentages, although we do
believe they are continuing to improve with the benefits we're driving.

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Yes. I'll just add a little bit more color. We are making great progress, but there's still a lot of work to do.
So we believe that as we go into future years here, we're going to have an opportunity to continue to get
better across both our own retail and our own e-com. So very excited about the progress we've made so
far, but there is more work to do, and we'll be updating you accordingly as we move into the future.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Terrific results, guys.

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Thanks, Jim.

James Vincent Duffy
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I'm hoping you can speak to your view on product costs into next year and pricing strategies. You
mentioned you're taking some pricing action that's helping the margins. Do you expect you can offset the
entirety of the inflation that you're seeing? Or is that yet to be determined?

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Dave, why don't you take that one?

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Jim, great question. The inflationary pressures are real, and we are tracking those. We are working
with our vendors, obviously. But I think there's a couple of parts there that we're going to be able to help
on the top line side of gross margin as well, which is continuing to stay more premium, continue with,
especially on the DTC front, being less promotional, less discounted, which will help offset some of that.
But then as we mentioned, we do have a team that's working in partnership with our product organization
and also with our commercial teams around opportunities to increase price for the brand.

I don't know that we would be able to affect too much of that for spring/summer. But when you think
more about fall/winter of next year, there's probably a bigger opportunity there based on life cycle and
time line. And we're excited about that. We think we're earning that in certain areas, and that's where
we're going to go after it. But it will be very strategic, very targeted. And in general, we are looking to
continue to improve our gross margin percentage as we go forward.

Got it. Dave, we've heard from some other companies a view on product cost environment into next year.
Is there anything you can share specific to your portfolio, a range of the type of inflation that you're seeing
on the product cost side?

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

To be frank, it's continuing to develop. And so at this point, I think we're going to be cautious in the level
of detail we give for that on next year. We do have another call or 2 that we can give more detail coming
up, but we're going to hold for that and continue to work with our supply chain and our partners to drive
through and get the best clarity on that before we give more comments.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies.

Randal J. Konik
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I just wanted to kind of follow up on, Dave, you said a comment earlier in the prepared remarks as it
related to the off-price channel. And you talked about favorable pricing to the off-price partners. Can you
elaborate on that a little bit more in terms of -- is that dynamic changing at all? And then maybe give us
either some qualitative or quantitative perspective on just how far are you taking that exposure down to
the off-price channel, which obviously helps your brand in the full-price channel of the distribution?

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Relative to the whole third-party off-price channel, we have embarked for the last couple of years
on continuing to kind of wean that down to really get into that 3% to 4% range of revenue. We're excited
that this year, we've been able to basically drive it down to a planned level of about 3% this year. And that
obviously creates a little bit of a tailwind on gross margin percentage with that mix of business coming
down.

And then outside of that, we've tightened up our supply chain process. We've employed some demand
constraints. All of those things are helping to keep the brand more premium, but they're also helping to
reduce the amount of excess that we create. So overall, just a tighter process based on our new operating
model. And therefore, we feel better about being able to move a lot of that excess through our own
factory house stores and more of a brand right way and also in a more profitable way.

I would say that the other piece of it is that as we have reduced the amount that we're selling to the third-
party off-price channel, the demand for the brand continues and is strong. And so those partners would
like more product. And when they want more, and we don't have as much to give, generally, that means
that they're going to pay a little bit more to us. And so we're seeing that benefit even on the smaller
amount that we are selling to them, we're getting better prices, which has helped the gross margins as
well. And we plan to continue as we go forward to manage it in that 3% to 4% mix of revenue globally. So
going forward, it really shouldn't be much of a revenue headwind or tailwind or a gross margin headwind
or tailwind in general going forward. It's just a small piece of our business that we maintain going forward.

Randal J. Konik
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That was very helpful. And then last question would be, can you give an update on the progress or the
initiative around SKU count reduction and improved productivity around that initiative? Give us some color
there on what you've done on both the apparel and footwear side.

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

UNDER ARMOUR, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Yes. I'm sure, Randy. This is Patrik. We did a lot of work around SKU management actually as far back
as starting in 2017 and 2018, and we got it down to a reduction of about 50% or so. We never have
expanded from that point. So in other words, we readjusted ourselves to a level that we felt would be able
to sustain the growth that we were planning. And we're still at that level. And the way we think about it
going forward is really in a balanced way. In other words, we will invest in SKUs where we see opportunity,
but we're also very diligent about taking things out through our life management cycle for our products,
ensuring that we're not getting on top of our SKUs in terms of the balance of this holistically across the
company.

The other interesting thing is also the fact that at that point in time in '17, '18 in our first round of
transformation, we also took down our trims and our materials, both by about 80%. And we've been
able to maintain those levels, too. So coming back a little bit to what Dave talked about previously here
in terms of our operating model and our efficiencies, because we now have a way to make sure that we
are holding ourselves accountable to what different products should be doing in our line to help grow
the brand and the business, the teams are doing an excellent job maintaining the discipline. And as a
consequence, we'll grow our SKUs a little bit as we grow as a brand going forward, but it's always going to
be in a controlled way where we're holding ourselves accountable.

And our next question will come from the line of Sam Poser with Williams Trading.

Samuel Marc Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

I want to follow up on some of the supply chain stuff. Can you give us some idea of -- it's going to hurt
you a bit in the March quarter and maybe a little beyond that. But can you give us some idea like sort
of where these problems are happening? What's your exposure to Southern Vietnam? I noticed that you
had lots of -- especially on the apparel side, a lot of a product sort of spread all over the place. So is this
an issue that's going to face footwear more than apparel? Can you give us some more -- a little color on
maybe your sourcing situation?

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Sure, Sam. This is Patrik. First of all, I think in terms of how we -- our position from a sourcing
perspective, we feel that we are balanced across the globe. In other words, we have about 50% of
everything that we make coming out of APAC and the rest of it is split between Middle East, Europe and
Latin America. We have a balanced portfolio in terms of how we think about sourcing, first of all. In terms
of what's happening right now, the factories have been closed, especially impacting the industry, I would
say, out of Vietnam because there is a mix of apparel and footwear that's coming out of there, especially
South Vietnam. All those factories are now -- at least our factories are open. However, it's going to take
the remainder of this year to really get them ramped up to full capacity and full speed.

So for us, in terms of how we think about what's really going to be affecting us going forward more so
because we've taken actions already to let's say, prune our order books for the beginning of next year to
make sure that we're able to deliver against the expectation of our partners and our own direct consumer.

What we're seeing now is more of a logistics and transportation challenge. And the majority, we believe in
the medium term here, in other words, from the end of this coming quarter going forward is going to be
inbound more so than outbound. And that has to do with just congestion at every step of the chain, right,
whether it's a container or a chassis or access to port or unloading a port and then the entire journey once
it lands in inbound. So we see the logistics and shipment being the biggest concern for us, let's say, in the
medium term here as we turn the corner into '22.

UNDER ARMOUR, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

And I guess Sam, just to give a little quarterly color, I guess. We see some minimal impacts for Q4 of this
year, which is already assumed in the outlook we gave, definitely incurring a fair amount more in inbound
freight costs to get things here and catch up a little bit. And that is an impact for Q4 on gross margin.
And then calendar Q1 and calendar Q2 is probably where we see a little bit of the bigger revenue impact
because of the canceled POs to be able to realistically get the factories back up and caught up and not
be missing POs to customers. So we've worked with our customers on those PO cancellations. So that's a
bigger impact on calendar Q1 and calendar Q2.

And then after that, it should start to dissipate, and we're continuing to work through it. So I think we
have really good partnerships with our suppliers. But some of the challenges down the pipeline that Patrik
mentioned on once the product actually gets to the inbound port are still a pretty big challenge.

Samuel Marc Poser
Williams Trading, LLC, Research Division

But then I know that -- Patrik, this is for you. I know that a lot of the problems facing you are good, but
are they ending up being good for the brand in the long term? Like you wish you didn't have them, but it
helps make your brand more premium and get more focused because of the supply chain delays?

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Well, that's a great question, Sam. And I think it's a good observation. I think when you -- any time when
you're faced with a constraint, right, it forces you to make choices. And I think we've had to make some
choices. To Dave's earlier point, especially as you think about the first quarter of next year, not so much
perhaps this year, but certainly going into next year, as we were very -- we have to be strategic, right, in
what we're actually delivering into the market based on the capacity that we're able to get through the
pipes.

So the question could probably be answered with a yes, somewhat, because I think it is helping us to
make the right prioritization of what's going to go where and ultimately help us continue to drive this
premiumization that we're driving right now with the brand. So I think it's a good observation, Sam, and I
probably -- there's probably some truth to that.

Patrik, just maybe just a follow-up on that. So obviously, the flip side, to Sam's point the flip side of
supply chain issues is just an industry-wide lid on discounts. Just curious, what's your view on industry
promotions for holiday? And then more thinking into next year, and maybe talk about what you think
happens when promotions ultimately do come back across the industry, just speaking to where you
believe you've elevated the brand and your ability to hold the line there?

And then, Dave, just you've made a bunch of really impressive strategic changes in your marketing

UNDER ARMOUR, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Yes. Simeon, this is Patrik. Yes. So I think in terms of how we're thinking about driving the brand going
forward, we're going to be continuing to follow our strategy, which is ultimately now a consumer-led
strategy, right? So in other words, we're laser focused on the consumer and understanding the consumer,
understanding how the consumer moves through his or her journey as they're on their way to do an
activity in sports. And really, this year, to pivot a little bit into your second question around marketing,
we've really activated against this concept of the journey to compete through the same campaign that we
started last year, the only way is through change your game and being on the offensive.

And I think for us, that marketing spend and the activation that we're able to do is being done much
better now. And it's being done better because we understand through our return on marketing
investment models that we're able to run, how to do it better. So we're more effective, we're more
efficient, and it's having a better effect on the consumer as we're activating against it. We're going to
continue to do that into the future and invest into marketing for the brand. And I don't know, Dave, if you
want to add a little bit more on that.

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I guess relative to the dollar investment, we've talked a lot about kind of heavying up our investment
this year based on our overdrive and being able to reinvest a fair amount of that back into the brand,
which has been really exciting to do and is definitely back half weighted this year, a lot of top-of-funnel
marketing around brand awareness, consideration, which we're super excited about what that could mean
for us as we go into next year with that kind of behind our backs.

But I would say that although we're going to run a higher percentage of revenue this year, we do expect
to be able to leverage marketing as a percentage of revenue as we go into next year and the following
year because we need to leverage every area of our cost structure going forward, and we feel confident
about being able to do that and still get more return and more bang for the buck based on what we've
been doing this year. And based on all the ROI work we've been doing from a marketing perspective and
changing the mix and how we spend through the restructuring activities as well.

So you will probably see some leverage in marketing as a percentage of revenue as we go into next year
and beyond. But I don't think you will see any decrease in the power of our marketing. If anything, you
should see an increase in the power.

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Yes, that's right. And I would just add a comment around -- your question around holiday and promotional
environment. I think that there currently is a perceived scarcity around product, in general, across
different sectors in the marketplace. And I think that's going to enable us to continue to drive a more
premium position for our brand. What is unclear is a little bit around traffic patterns. We're seeing some
things going on with the consumer around the world, which is not necessarily consistent. But in terms of
our offering and how we think about promotions, we're going to be less promotional than 2020 and 2019,
and we're going to continue to drive the brand to higher levels. That really is our approach going into
holiday this year.

Thanks, Brian.

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So a couple of questions. If you want to focus on just the supply chain, I'll merge the questions together.
But I mean, first off, you've laid out kind of the trajectory here through the holiday and then into early
next year. The question I have there, are there -- particularly as you look at -- look towards the first
quarter of next year. Are there levers you can pull, mainly like others have mentioned, airfreight and
bringing products in potentially at a higher cost. And would you pull that? And then the second question
I have is, as you look at the data now, you include this continued nice sales acceleration for your brand,
particularly in the United States. Do you believe that the ability of your company to manage supply chain
relatively well here is actually serving as a driver of incremental market share?

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Well, I feel -- thanks, Brian. I'll start off, and I'll pass it over to Dave. I think Dave, if you've got any
additional comments once I've commented on this. I think, in general, in terms of the operating ability
that we currently have, the agility that we have and the improvements we've made in our supply chain
and our vendor base over the last years have now put us in a position where we can go both ways. We've
talked a little bit here today about our ability to navigate through a pandemic where we had to scale our
orders back by 30% and then ramping it up again for '21 and kind of going through what is now a logistic
and transportation quagmire and navigating through that, adjusting again our order base a little bit for
first half of '22. All of those different things are not possible unless you run an efficient and effective
machine. And I think that's what you're really seeing from Under Armour at this point in time.

It's an ability to navigate anything that's thrown at us and do so in the most efficient way possible. Just
think about the last 2 quarters. I mean, our inventory position in the last quarter was down 26%. It's now
down 21%. And we're guiding to a flattish end to the year. I think that is a testament to how we're able
to navigate and understand demand much better and then throwing that over to supply chain to execute
more efficiently and better.

And I think also, going back to what Dave talked about earlier as it relates to our off-price or what we're
selling into that channel, being also able to manage that in combination with how we think about our
wholesale and our own direct-to-consumer. All of that coming together and being able to navigate the last
2 years, should give you an indication of the ability of this team's ability to execute. Dave, I don't know if
you want to add a bit to that.

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I guess, Brian, to add a little bit to that. You touched on airfreight. We are, I would say, employing
every lever possible to try and mitigate as best we can and keep the experience to our customers and our
consumers strong. So we have used a fair -- a lot of air freight this year, which we're not excited about,
but it's a necessary thing with the challenges that we're all being faced with.

And I think as we approach next year, we would expect the use of airfreight to be something that we
would still employ, probably not as much as we did in this year in 2021, but still more than pre-COVID
2020. And I would say that, that is probably going to be more front half calendar 2022-focused, which will
put a little bit of pressure on gross margin, but is helping us to mitigate some of those challenges from a
timing perspective and try and keep that impact from being not as significant. So it is a work in process.

There's a lot of pieces to that puzzle as we're driving through. But our supply chain has been excellent in
working with our partners, not just the factories but also our logistics providers to mitigate this as best
we can. And so we feel very good about how we can navigate through and we're trying to stay ahead of it
relative to the POs and the relationships that we have.

And our next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.

Robert Scott Drbul
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a couple of questions for me. The first one is you talked about the recent trends in China. I was
just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit with what you saw in the quarter and sort of what you're
seeing this quarter to date and how you have that planned into the fourth quarter? And then I think you
called out running as a category. I was just wondering if you could give us maybe a little more color on
basketball and even the kids business.

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Bob, this is Patrik. But I think China, we're still seeing COVID effects, if you like, in terms of how the
consumer is navigating the landscape. There are lots of ins and outs on a, I would say, weekly or monthly
basis in terms of localized closures as it relates to brick-and-mortar. And the traffic in terms of -- full-price
traffic really has not returned to pre-COVID levels yet. It's just the way it is. And I think we're also seeing
somewhat of a tempered traffic pattern in e-commerce. And I think that is -- a lot of that has to do with
the big platforms, right? Tmall and JD that are seeing also a diminished traffic pattern on their platform.
So the digital landscape in China is shifting. You're seeing resurgence of smaller platforms and commercial
ventures starting up around these bigger platforms.

The good news for us, I guess, is that we've made a lot of investments into our digital teams over there
over the last few years. And when we feel that we're able to navigate this new landscape, but it is a varied
landscape and it isn't necessarily 100% clear how this holiday period is going to pan out in China. So
there's a softness, I would say, in the traffic patterns in China right now.

Robert Scott Drbul
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And can you talk a little bit about maybe basketball and the kids business?

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Oh yes, basketball and the kids business, sorry about that, Paul (sic) [ Bob ] basketball. And basketball,
we're very excited about. And this comes back to a little bit what I talked about earlier. -- both basketball
and kids. As we've seen a more normalized back-to-school this year, it's absolutely the case that all of our
team sports are doing better and basketball is certainly a part of that. We're also very excited about our
latest release for women that just came into the market and our breakthrough basketball shoe that has
been doing great. Our Curry business is doing great.

And we just think that there is just a vitality, if you like, in the team sports business right now that we
haven't seen for a few years. So -- and that goes across kids and also basketball, but also the other team
sports, American football as well as baseball.

Curious, prior to your purchase cancellations that you mentioned, curious how you were thinking about
your unit buys for 2022? And how were you thinking about that differently in your direct-to-consumer
business versus the units that would be required to service your wholesale accounts?

And then post PO cancellations, how is that unit out? So at just what percentage did you have to cancel?

David E. Bergman

Paul, this is Dave. We haven't been giving real unit numbers as far as in our expectations. And I
appreciate the interest in next year's unit growth, but it's not something we're ready to give color on yet.
We'll be talking about that more on the upcoming call or the one following that, knowing that our fiscal
year change happens on April 1 as well. So we're kind of being careful relative to how much detail we give
on the go forward.

Paul Lawrence Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And just a follow-up on a couple of other questions that were asked. You mentioned, I think you
maybe saw some differences in geographies. From a consumer perspective, how would you characterize
the promotional environment, as you think about the different regions? Are you seeing big differences in
APAC versus EMEA compared to the more team promotional environment that we're seeing here in the
U.S.?

Patrik Frisk
CEO, President & Executive Director

Paul, this is Patrik. I'll give you my kind of high level around the globe, if you like. I think that you're
seeing more of a discounted environment in China right now in APAC and with softness in traffic patterns.
In Europe, we see a pretty interesting phenomenon where actually the consumer has gone back to brick-
and-mortar more strongly than we would have anticipated. Actually, creating a bit of softness in the e-
commerce digital channels, not just for us but also for the pure players in Europe. So the consumer really
is enjoying being back out and shopping in stores, and they're doing so at a, let's say, premium level. So
not really a very discounted level.

And in North America, I think the consumer has stayed in digital and have continued to go back at higher
rates in terms of traffic to the stores. At a more -- and less discounts at an elevated level for us. So I think
it's a mixed bag across the world. The 3 regions are behaving a little bit differently right now, which makes
it a little bit challenging perhaps to, let's say, understand exactly how they're going to navigate through
this next couple of months.

But at the end of the day, we feel confident that the forecast that we currently have given today is going
to be kind of where we're heading. But it is interesting. I don't think I've seen it like this before where
everybody is at different stages with COVID. Everybody is at different stages with retail and e-commerce.
But in general, in the Western world, there is definitely less discounting and more so in China, at least in
terms of how we think about our sector right now.

move more premium is underway. And when you think about the broader brand metrics, I know you track
a lot of them internally, could you share maybe a couple of insights, recent movement or improvement
you're seeing across some of those metrics?

UNDER ARMOUR, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

CEO, President & Executive Director

Yes, Jon. We are very excited about our running category. It's been a category that we have methodically
and strategically and tactically we really worked on in a meaningful way since '18 when we launched our
HOVR platform. This year, we came out with our Flow platform with the Velociti Wind and the Velociti SE
on the back of the Curry release last year in basketball. And I think what you're seeing now with Under
Armour is really an ability to execute on running head to toe, and we're doing that across the globe, which
I'm very excited about, in a premium way.

So really, what you've seen over the last 3 years is this running effort evolving into becoming a new
platform for Under Armour, across both men's and women's across apparel and footwear. And we're very
excited about the innovation that we continue to drive in this category and how we think about it going
forward into '22 and beyond. So more to come on this from Under Armour, but we're here, we're in it.
We're in it to win it, and we're going to stay in running and do a better job there as we go forward. So
very excited about that.

Okay. That's really helpful. And then, Dave, just one follow-up. I know you mentioned the sub quarter or
the March quarter could grow low single digits for revenue even with the headwinds that you mentioned.
So should we be thinking that overall that you're moving more towards sort of a -- sort of a mid- to high
single-digit growth rate given that Q1, you'll be still low single digits even with the constraints. Just trying
to get a sense of more of the underlying pace that you might be at.

David E. Bergman
Chief Financial Officer

So Jonathan, great question, and I'd love to give you more details on that. But we're not ready to give
that exact numbers or impacts yet for calendar Q1 or for the new fiscal '23 next year. So definitely
appreciate the question.

We wouldn't call out the impact of the supply chain cancellations if it was not material. So it is definitely a
pretty big impact. But kind of giving a normalized run rate growth isn't something that we're ready to give
at this point, but definitely appreciate the question.

Operator
Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Everyone, this also concludes our
webcast and conference call today. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.
Everybody, have a wonderful day.
