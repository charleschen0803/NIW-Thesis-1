Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 FY '22 KMX Earnings Release
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to Stacy Frole. Thank you. Please go ahead.

Stacy Frole
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Shelby. Good morning. Thank you for joining fiscal -- our fiscal '22 first quarter earnings
conference call. I'm here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Senior
Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Senior Vice President, CAF Operations.

Let me remind you, our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and
financial performance are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's
current knowledge and assumptions about future events that involve risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-
looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.

For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see the
company's Form 8-K issued this morning and its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
February 28, 2021, filed with the SEC. Should you have any follow-up questions after the call, please feel
free to contact our Investor Relations department at (804) 747-0422 extension 7865. Lastly, let me thank
you in advance for asking only one question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you read in our earnings
release this morning, we delivered exceptional performance in the first quarter, with record results across
all aspects of our business, retail, wholesale and auto finance, and a solid flow-through to EPS. Our
success reflects the continued progress we are making in our digital transformation and online experience,
along with solid execution, and our ongoing commitment to disciplined cost management. In addition, we
benefited from the backdrop of a strong demand environment, enhanced by the impact of the most recent
round of government stimulus payments.

For the first quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered sales of $7.7 billion, up 138%
compared with the first quarter of FY '21, and net earnings per diluted share of $2.63, up $2.60 from a
year ago. This also represents increases of 43% and 65%, respectively, from the previous record set in
the first quarter of FY '20.

Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 452,000 cars, up 128% versus the first
quarter last year and a 31% increase on a 2-year basis from the first quarter of FY '20. We also bought
236% more cars in the first quarter of this year versus last year and 77% more compared with 2 years
ago.

As many of you know, for the past several years, our priorities and investments have focused on building
an unmatched experience, with a leading e-commerce platform that integrates seamlessly with our best-
in-class in-store experience. The result has been a massive organizational transformation that includes
building a comprehensive set of digital and hybrid processes to accommodate our customers in whatever
way they want to interact with us. Our progress in executing this strategy has given us a very solid start
to FY '22, and we remain confident in our long-term targets announced at our recent analyst day of 2
million retail and wholesale combined units sold per year and $33 billion of revenue by FY '26.

CARMAX, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2021

In our retail business, total unit sales in the first quarter were up 101%, and used unit comps were
up 99% versus the first quarter last year. Compared with the first quarter of FY '20, total retail unit
sales were up 21%, and same-store comps were up 16%. In addition to strong unit sales, we reported
$2,205 of retail gross profit per used unit for the quarter, up $268 versus a year ago and in line with the
first quarter of FY '20. Given the strong demand environment for used autos and inventory constraints
throughout the automotive industry, we pulled back on the expanded pricing test we introduced in the
fourth quarter. We'll continue to monitor macro factors and pricing elasticity, and we'll adjust our pricing
accordingly to maximize unit sales and profitability.

For wholesale, our units sold were up 187% compared with last year's first quarter and were up 50%
when compared with the first quarter of FY '20. Wholesale gross profit per unit increased to $1,025
compared with $978 for the same period last year and was in line with the first quarter of FY '20. -- The
strength in wholesale was primarily driven by the introduction of our instant online appraisal offering,
which we rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on Edmunds.com last year. We
also benefited from significant appreciation of used autos in the broader market.

CarMax Auto Finance, or CAF, continued to deliver solid results, with income of $242 million. In addition,
CAF and our partner lenders delivered strong conversion in all credit tiers. Jon will give you some more
details on that coming up here shortly.

Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance, but we know there are opportunities to be even
better. For example, on the operational front, inventory available for sale was below targeted levels
throughout the entire first quarter. These lower levels are the result of recent demand and the temporary
COVID and weather-impacted production slowdown we experienced in the fourth quarter. Remember, the
fourth quarter is the time when we are ramping production ahead of the peak demand tax refund season.
Our teams have done an amazing job producing inventory in the first quarter, and we expect inventory to
continue to increase as we add additional production capacity at existing locations.

Now I'll turn the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our first quarter financial
performance, and then Jon will share additional detail around customer financing. So Enrique?

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Together with the strong gross profit growth in retail and
wholesale Bill just discussed, other gross profit increased to $142 million, up $111 million from last year's
first quarter. This increase was driven by: EPP growth of $61 million or 83%, driven primarily by retail
sales growth and a stable penetration rate above 60%; service growth of $42 million or 125%, driven
by labor leverage due to our strong sales performance and prior year company support pay; and an
improvement in third-party finance fees of $6 million or 57% due to our renegotiated fee structure and
changes in tier penetration, partially offset by increased sales.

Relative to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, other gross profit grew $22 million or 18%. This was
primarily due to volume-related growth in EPP and the benefit from our renegotiated third-party finance
fees partially offset by service deleverage.

On the SG&A front, expenses for the first quarter increased to $554 million, up 71% from our COVID-
impacted quarter a year ago. Robust sales in the first quarter, along with disciplined cost management,
delivered strong leverage, with SG&A as a percent of gross profit of 59.9%, down from 91.7% in the
prior year's first quarter. The increase in SG&A dollars over the last year was primarily driven by a $108
million increase in compensation and benefits, which was primarily the result of comping over COVID-
related payroll reductions last year, along with an increase in variable costs due to higher volume and in
headcount as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives.

Compensation leveraged by 25.8 percentage points versus last year, a $38 million increase in advertising
expense, driven by our previously communicated investment in advertising spend to amplify the CarMax
brand, build awareness of our omnichannel offerings and drive customer acquisition. This year's increase
was also impacted by reductions in last year's spend due to the pandemic, marketing leverage by 1.9

CARMAX, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2021

percentage points versus last year and a $79 million increase in other overhead due to comparing against
the $40 million Takata settlement benefit recognized in last year's quarter, our continued investments to
advance our technology platforms and strategic initiatives and comping over pandemic-related reductions
last year. SG&A as a percent of gross profit was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.

We remain committed to ensuring we are efficient in our spend, and we expect that targeted areas
of focus will continue to deliver improvements over time. For example, our CECs are a significant
differentiator for us and an area of opportunity. In the first quarter, our CECs continued their year-over-
year gains in efficiency and effectiveness through automation, data-driven algorithms and smart routing
that ensures customers get the right support.

We are very bullish about our future, given the strength and trajectory of our current business and the
opportunities to expand into the broader used auto ecosystem. We recognize that we have an opportunity
to capitalize on our leadership position to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value.

Our approach to capital allocation is aligned with this belief and is supported by the significant amount
of cash our diversified business model generates. First, we continue to focus on our core business by
aggressively investing in the digital capabilities required to enhance our omnichannel experience, vehicle
and customer acquisition, and the strategic expansion of our store footprint. Of particular note this quarter
was the very strong ROI we are experiencing in vehicle acquisition primarily through our instant online
appraisal offerings.

Second, we will deploy capital to pursue new growth opportunities through investments, partnerships and
acquisitions. On June 1, we completed our acquisition of Edmunds. We are confident this transaction will
create significant shareholder value over time.

Additionally, of note on the P&L this quarter, other income increased $29 million when compared with the
same period last year, primarily due to a $22 million unrealized gain on an investment. As we've noted in
the past, we have a portfolio of relatively modest investments across the used auto ecosystem.

Finally, we will continue to return excess capital back to our shareholders. During the quarter, we
repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $125 million. We have $1.21 billion remaining in current
authorizations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.

Jon G. Daniels
Senior Vice President of CarMax Auto Finance

Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. Once again, the finance business has delivered
outstanding results. For the first quarter, CAF's penetration net of 3-day payoffs was 43.7% compared with
36.1% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 22.8% of used unit sales compared with 28.5% last year. Tier 3
accounted for 10% compared with 14.5% a year ago.

You will recall in the first quarter of FY '21, at the beginning of the pandemic, we leveraged our long-term
relationships and routed a portion of CAF's Tier 1 volume and all of the allocated Tier 3 volume to our Tier
2 and Tier 3 partners, which explains much of this year-over-year shift in tier mix. Note, this was done
as a temporary measure, which limited CAF's origination volume while preserving the high quality of the
portfolio. By the end of the second quarter last year, we've returned to our normal routing procedures.

During this first quarter, CAF's net loans originated was $2.5 billion, marking the largest single origination
quarter in CAF's history and the first quarter above $2 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged
to new customers was 9%, up from 8.4% a year ago and 8.5% in the fourth quarter. Similar to the fourth
quarter, this year-over-year difference in APR is a result of the credit mix of customers rather than an
increase in the rate charged.

Regarding the portfolio, the overall interest margin increased to 6.9% versus 5.9% in the same period last
year as the strength of our ABS program continues to yield significant benefits in the form of lower funding
costs. CAF income for the quarter was $242 million, up from $51 million a year ago. This significant year-
over-year increase comes as a result of a substantial improvement in the required provision for loan
losses, stronger net interest margin and higher receivables.

CARMAX, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2021

Total interest margin in the quarter increased by $47 million or 24% driven by the growth in originations
and lower cost of funds. With respect to our provision for loan losses, in the first quarter, we experienced
$7.2 million in net credit loss or 21 basis points of average managed receivables. As a percentage of the
portfolio, this is the lowest reported loss we have experienced in over 20 years.

The resulting favorability versus our expectations, coupled with the corresponding adjustment in our
outlook for future losses, resulted in $24 million of income related to the provision in the first quarter.
This is compared to a $122 million provision expense in the same period last year. This release of
reserves resulted in an ending reserve balance of $380 million for the first quarter or 2.62% of managed
receivables, which is a decrease from the 2.97% and at the end of the fourth quarter.

Our reserve as a percentage of managed receivables has continued to trend downward towards more
historical levels as our customers remain persistent in their willingness and ability to make their auto
payment despite the uncertain environment. We believe this current adjustment effectively captures
the positive loss performance we have seen over the past 4 quarters and is appropriate for the current
macroeconomic environment.

Finally, as previously mentioned, CAF increased as a percent of Tier 3 volume to 10% by the end of the
first quarter. This adjustment had a minimal impact on the reserve within the quarter. But as the higher
volume continues to flow into the portfolio over subsequent quarters, we expect income and the provision
to increase accordingly.

With regard to where CAF will participate in the credit spectrum in the future, as always, we will continue
to evaluate the lending environment and will consider future adjustments if and when we believe those
changes are sustainable and in the best interest of our long-term business goals. Now I'll turn the call
back over to Bill.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Jon and Enrique. As I said at our analyst day in May, we are proud of the work our
teams have done to put CarMax in the excellent position we're in today, and we are really excited about
the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Our multiyear investment in omnichannel experience has
further enhanced our offering, which is the most customer-centric experience within the used auto
industry. We are agnostic about how our customers shop and buy because we are positioned to give every
customer a world-class buying experience regardless of how they shop with us. In turn, this gives us
access to the largest addressable market within the states.

In the first quarter, approximately 8% of our retail unit sales were online. As a reminder, when a customer
completes all 4 of the major transactional activities remotely, so that's: reserving the vehicle; financing
the vehicle, if that's needed; trading in or opting out of a trade-in; and creating a sales order, we consider
this an online retail sale. Because all our wholesale auctions were made virtual this quarter, 100% of
wholesale sales, which represents 18% of total revenue, are considered online transactions. As a result,
total revenue coming from online transactions was 24% in the first quarter.

Omni sales represented approximately 56% of retail unit sales, up from 51% last quarter. As a reminder,
omni sales are retail sales where customers complete at least one of those major transactional activities
remotely. While all of our customers can buy a car online with assistance, we have been focused on
providing a 100% self-service experience. Today, 40% of our retail customers can independently complete
an online sale, up from 25% at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect to have this capability available to
most customers by the end of the second quarter.

We continue to leverage digital innovations to drive growth with our online instant appraisal offerings
where customers can receive an online offer on their car in less than 2 minutes and have payment in
hand the same day. In the first quarter, we bought approximately 163,000 vehicles through these online
offerings, which represents 48% of our total buys from consumers. And since rolling out nationwide
at the end of last quarter, we believe we have become the largest online buyer of used autos from the
consumers in the U.S. This is a significant competitive advantage that allows us to efficiently source

vehicles, especially during periods of high demand, enabling us to remain competitively priced while
producing attractive GPUs.

On the retail side, we're making our online experience faster by improving our finance approval and flow
process. We're making it easier by enabling customers to request card transfers and then manage and
track them all online. And we're empowering our customers by providing them with financing information
across our entire inventory as the first step in their shopping journey. This gives our customers greater
confidence they can afford the vehicle they select.

As we expand access and further enhance digital aspects of our experience, we need to reinforce
awareness of CarMax' new capabilities and their values to customers. Since launching our new brand
campaign and Love Your Car Guarantee offerings at the end of last year, we've seen strong growth in the
awareness of our omnichannel experience, with both web traffic and Google search volumes continuing to
increase.

As digital adoption by consumers and dealers continues to grow, we'll keep building on our investments in
omni, our proprietary technology stack and our strong brand reputation to maximize growth in our core
businesses. We're also pursuing additional growth opportunities in the broader trillion-dollar-plus used
auto ecosystem that leverage our capabilities and strengths in the industry.

As Enrique mentioned, we recently completed the acquisition of Edmunds, one of the most well-
established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized leader in digital car
shopping innovations. Edmunds brings us closer to a broader set of consumers and brings us closer to
dealers. Our teams are super excited and are continuing to collaborate on new products that will support
Edmunds dealers, partners and consumers. We see tremendous opportunity and will provide updates as
we launch new offerings more broadly.
In summary, this was truly an exceptional quarter, and we are absolutely excited for the future. Our
results reflect strong and disciplined execution across our diversified business model and further validate
our strategies to enable sustainable growth and meaningful long-term shareholder value creation. We
remain focused on enhancing our online capabilities to deliver the most customer-centric offering in
the market. We will continue to accelerate our growth and market share gains while also laying the
groundwork for future initiatives and growth opportunities. Now we'll be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Craig Kennison of Baird.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations on the wholesale momentum. My question goes to the GPU. You mentioned that you
pulled back on the GPU experiment in the hot market. Will you go back to experimentation once the
market normalizes?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Great question. So yes, we did suspend it. And if you remember last quarter, in the fourth quarter, I
talked about we're going to continue, but we'd be monitoring those macro factors. And as we monitored
the macro factors, especially like the inventory constraints and the elasticity, it didn't make sense to
continue to do that. As I said in my opening remarks, we will continue to monitor those macro factors, and
we're very open to continuing to do some different things with pricing. I would tell you like right now, I
probably would say we wouldn't do it, but we'll reserve the right just as the quarter progresses. But either
way, we'll be able to provide great GPUs above $2,000.

Operator

Your next question is from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about what your customer sourcing ratio was in terms of the
retail business for the quarter? And then as you're looking at the online purchases, which obviously have
ramped really quickly, how are those -- how is the GPU on the online appraisals kind of comparing to the
in-person appraisals? Are you seeing those kind of be relatively similar? Or is there a variance that can
narrow over time?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Great question. So when I think about the total buys that we bought from consumers, it's about a 50-50
split between retail and wholesale. And that's both as you think about traditionally customers coming into
the store and doing the appraisal, but that also is very similar to the online purchases.

As far as the productivity of the online purchase versus the traditional in-store appraisals, they're both
great. They're very similar so -- which, again, is a huge benefit as we think about inventory sourcing and
being able to manage GPUs, pricing, that kind of thing.

Operator

Your next question is from John Murphy of Bank of America.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just maybe a follow-up actually on the question of supply, Bill. I mean you bought 341,000 vehicles from
consumers in the quarter. I mean that's as much -- I think you had one quarter in history of 345,000 in
total vehicles. So I mean you bought almost as many vehicles as you ever peaked out on selling. So I'm
just curious, what's going on there on your ability to buy directly from the consumer?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

CARMAX, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2021

And then also, if you think on the supply side, both from the consumer and then even at auctions, when
do you think supply more naturally eases up? I mean there's crazy things going on like Avis and Hertz
buying cars in auctions and traditionally, they're sources and sellers, right? So I mean there's some wacky
stuff going on in the supply side. I mean how much wood can you chop on buying from consumers? How
important is that going to be going forward? And then when does supply, which is totally wacky at the
moment, normalize on the flow and supply?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So John, obviously, the buying directly from consumers has been a big focus. I've talked about us
putting investments in that area. And I think what you're seeing is it really coming to fruition. I mean you
think about it, more than 340,000 cars that we bought from consumers, it's up 236%. It's up 77% versus
FY '20. It's just truly -- it's truly remarkable. A big piece of that, obviously, is just having easier access
for consumers with our online offering. But we're also encouraged just by the traditional, with customers
coming in the store and doing appraisals that way. So we feel good about both of those.

The supply piece is interesting. There's some abnormal things that you mentioned there. But I'll go back
to what I said in the fourth quarter, supply has not been an issue for us. While our saleable inventory is
certainly lower than where we want it to be right now, the supply, if you look at total inventory, we're very
much in line with where we were in FY '20. It's really more a matter of production. And I think with the
online offering, in addition to the traditional appraisal lane, that also just diminishes our need for external
supply, going through those other sources.

And more general to your question of how long -- absolutely, there's some supply constraints out there
because you've got some different folks doing different things. You also have the demand for maybe some
new car customers moving into used cars. I think it will -- time will tell. I think the new car isn't going
to work itself out in the next quarter or 2. I think we're probably looking more towards the latter part of
the year. So I don't see a lot changing in supply over the next couple of quarters. But again, the supply
is not an issue. There's still a lot of cars that are changing hands out there. You may -- if you're buying
off-site, you have to work a little bit harder. But we feel great about where we are from a total inventory
standpoint.

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And John, what I would say is the 163,000 cars that we bought through our instant online offers
really exceeded our expectations. That has been extremely well received by customers. And I think it's
a really good example of the investments we've been making in innovation to make sure we're at the
forefront of the consumer's mind. And again, that's 163,000 cars through our online offer. And really, we
just stood up that product a quarter ago. So we're really, really pleased with that performance.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can that ever significantly drive the consumer-sourced vehicles way above 50%? I mean is that the
direction you're heading? I'm just curious what that target might be.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Look, we want to drive that target as high as possible. We've historically -- the last several years,
we've been in this range of 35% to 45%. We're already above that range for this quarter. We're between
45% and 50% for this quarter. And I think, again, our goal is to drive that as high as possible. And what
we're seeing, we're very, very encouraged by that.

CARMAX, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2021

Michael David Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I wanted to ask about any thoughts you all may have on the pricing environment, both in terms of the
wholesale side as well as the retail side, and what you might be seeing recently in our discussions with
Manheim. It sounds like they might have just seen an inflection point where the pricing is at least starting
to moderate. So I'd just love to get some incremental thoughts that you all may have. And then secondly,
what does that mean for the business? If we do see some moderation, what does that mean for retail and
wholesale?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Yes, it's a great question. You've been following us long enough to know that this pricing environment
has really -- it's really unprecedented. If you think about from January until now, the $5,000 to $6,000
worth of appreciation that we've seen, it's truly remarkable. Our average selling prices were up a couple of
thousand dollars. From an acquisition standpoint, they're actually up a little bit more than that, but it was
a little bit offset based off of mix and age.

I do think we're reaching an inflection point. If you look at the consumer price index and the difference
between new cars and late-model used cars, that gap has definitely narrowed. While new cars are going
up, they have not gone up at the pace of used cars. And that's fairly self-correcting. You get to a point
where, okay, it's -- late-model used cars is bumping up against the new car. And I think we are getting
close to that inflection point. And I think that's great because obviously, when the gap narrows, it's a
headwind for used car purchases. When the gap widens, the gap between used and new, that's a great
thing for used car sales. So I think that's a positive thing.

Your next question is from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Nice quarter, congratulations. So my question is very much a follow-up to that prior question, just with
regard to pricing, Bill. So we've all talked -- we've all heard and read about this unprecedented, if you will,
price environment in used cars. So I guess the question I have, as we look at these results in the various
facets across the business, was the pricing environment a tailwind or headwind for CarMax? And then
again -- this is again a follow-up. And how should we think about this going forward as we look towards
the balance of the year?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Normally, that pricing environment would be a headwind to just the used car industry in general. I
think the difference this quarter was that because there was a lack of new car availability, I think it pushed
customers down into the used car market, which helped to raise the price of used cars. So it's really -- it's
hard to kind of pull that apart. It's -- there's a lot of different factors going on there because you got not
only new customers coming in there. You have the stimulus that's out there that's driving up demand. So I
think the normal -- what you would normally see from really high price increases on used cars, it's hard --
I don't think it was the same -- it had the same elasticity effect that you would normally see.

Now I think going forward, not having some of that stimulus out there, I think the normal elasticity in
pricing, I think, will start to return. And I think back to Michael's point, if we've seen this inflection point
starts to go down, I think that's a good thing.

CARMAX, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2021

Yes. I think the other thing as well is that the diversity of our business model really allows us to perform in
any kind of environment. So while pricing may be a headwind in some sense, it's a tailwind to other parts
of our business. And you see that in our results, and you see that kind of from quarter-to-quarter in our
results, just that diversity that is unparalleled in the industry.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And I think the other thing at play here is, look, we've been doing this long enough that whether
you see rapid appreciation or rapid depreciation, I think the way that we manage our inventory, how we
buy the data that we leverage and the technology that we leverage, I think it's certainly a competitive
advantage.

Your next question is from Rick Nelson of Stephens.

Nels Richard Nelson
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So we saw the reserve reversal this quarter. Allowance now sits at 2.62% of receivables. Historically, I
believe that number has been more in the 2% to 2.5% range for Tier 1. I guess how should we think
about that allowance account and potential for more reserve reversals?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Appreciate the question, Rick. Yes, right on the mark, 2.62% is our reserve as a percentage of
receivables right now. And yes, correct, historically, we have stated that 2% to 2.5% is our targeted
range for our Tier 1 portfolio. Now bear in mind that 2.62% incorporates both Tier 1 and Tier 3 included
in there. So if you were to back that out, you can see that we really are in the operating range that we've
previously stated. And we've trended downward nicely since that. I think it's a pretty substantial move
we've made since the end of Q4 to now. And obviously, that's a reflection of the great performance that
we saw in the quarter. So going forward, we think 2.62% is a really solid number for us across both the
Tier 1 and Tier 3 portfolio, and we'll see how the customer performs in the future.

Your next question is from John Healy of Northcoast.

John Michael Healy
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

I wanted to ask a little bit about the SG&A levels. I know you've talked about variety of investments.
And clearly, those are paying off right now. But I wanted to get your view on kind of these traditional ad
campaigns that you've launched. I know you've done the things with the NBA and some new television
and, I think, radio ads. How do you feel about that spend? Is it still as effective as it once was? Are you
happy with it right now? And do you see that continuing to be a big part of the SG&A as we go into next
year? Or maybe should we expect some recalibration on that front?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes, John. So let me talk first just about the productivity of the ad spend. First of all, we're thrilled with
it. If you look at the advertising spend for the quarter, it's actually below the guidance we've kind of given
for this year. And I would just think about that as that's just a timing. We're committed to continuing to
advertise in a thoughtful ROI way.

I would tell you, looking at what we've been doing, we had a record hit. Our average number of hits to our
website for this quarter was 34.5 million, which is up significantly from any prior record. We're seeing web
visits up roughly 60% year-over-year, 40% if you compare back to FY '20. Google searches are up double

digits. So we feel very, very good about the new programs that we're doing and how we're really kind of
going out there and spreading the omnichannel experience to consumers.

But I'll tell you, this isn't -- it's not a one quarter thing. We need to continue to be at this, and we're
committed to continuing to spend. And Enrique, I don't know if you have any other thoughts as it relates
to the SG&A.

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Absolutely. If you take a look at advertising, we communicated last quarter and in our analyst day
that we intend on spending more. And what we said was we're going to spend this year on a per unit
basis, pretty much what we spent in the back half of last year, which was a ramp-up in expense.

And so if you take a look at that and you compare it to 2 years ago, in FY '20, certainly a more normalized
year, we're looking at an increase of over 40% on a per unit basis in our advertising costs, which is
consistent with what we've communicated. But just to give you some context and perspective on how
we think of the importance and more importantly, of the returns that we're getting from our advertising
spend.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Rajat Gupta of JPMorgan.

Rajat Gupta
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on the strong trend. I just had a question on -- you mentioned earlier about how the pricing is
reaching a level where it's probably starting to maybe impact demand to some extent. Could you give us
some color on like how the progression was through the quarter, like this March, April, May, on the pound
versus 2019 level. And if you could give us any color on how the first 3 or 4 weeks of June have trended
there, that would be helpful.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Rajat. So we're pleased with the whole entire quarter. I mean when we talk about looking back to
FY '20, don't forget the first quarter in FY '20 was a 9.5% comp, and we're comping 16% on top of that.
And we saw strong growth in every month of the quarter. And I've talked about it on the last call, how
March was a new record month for us. April was also a record month as it relates to April. May was also a
record month as it relates to May. So we're very pleased with the strong performance throughout there.
And we're very pleased with the performance as we enter into the new quarter.

I'll tell you, I'll be excited to get to the second quarter because if you remember last year, we had a
positive comp in the second quarter. And I'm going to knock on wood that we don't have to keep talking
back to FY '20 because it's a lot of numbers to remember. But we'll certainly at the end of the second
quarter talk more about that quarter, but we feel great how the quarter started.

Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Scot Ciccarelli. So given the dynamics that we're seeing in the used vehicle market, obviously, the
category is very hot and your more aggressive posture in vehicle purchasing activity, can you shorten your
reconditioning process further to improve throughput or maybe add more bay capacity? Because, Bill,
when I'm listening to you, it sounds like your own production capabilities may have limited some of your
inventory offerings and, thus, your sales performance.

CARMAX, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2021

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, Scot, you're absolutely right. I mean our inventory level right now, if I think -- obviously, we're
below target the whole quarter. We're probably 40% lower than where we would like to be. And in a
normal environment, if you have that much less inventory, it certainly is a headwind. I think it was a
headwind. I don't think it was to the normal elasticity that you would see just given what was going on in
the rest of the marketplace.

But it really is about production. And we normally build ahead of time to get ready. We weren't able to do
that. Our operations team is doing a phenomenal job. We're adding additional capacity in those existing
facilities. So I would expect that to continue to go up.

One of the areas I've talked about from an efficiency standpoint in the past, as we look to take waste out
of the system, one of the areas that we've been focused on is our flow production. And we've actually now
finished rolling out kind of the next version of that. And we would expect to get more throughput through
existing facilities and resources. So we're excited about that, and that will continue to help us. And then,
of course, to meet our long-term goals, we'll be adding additional capacity as we go forward.

But yes, I think it's absolutely fair to say that the inventory was a headwind for us. And it's not the supply
side, it's more of the production side. And again, I can't give enough shout-outs to our operations team
because not only have they been meeting that demand, but they're drilling on it. If you've watched our
inventory recently, you've seen that we're starting to ramp it back up.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So how long does it take to recondition, let's call it, an average car today? And where could that
potentially go? Like can you knock off a significant amount of time? Or are you kind of -- you're pretty
close to where you're optimized.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

No. I think we can optimize more and -- to save a traditional car. Remember, it also depends on the mix of
vehicles. Your older vehicles take a little bit longer than your newer vehicles. I think we're probably -- if I
think about the whole -- what you're really asking about is cycle time. Cycle time, and keep in mind, that's
the time that the car is ready to be worked on. You got to wait for parts and all that kind of stuff. You think
about that cycle time, it's probably -- it's somewhere in between the 5 and 10 days, and that depends on
the vehicle.

Now certainly, some vehicles take a lot less than that. And we have obviously phases in our production
that are -- we measure by minutes. But I do think this is an area of opportunity. I think this is one that
we're already -- with our new flow production system, I think we're already starting to realize more
throughput, which is great.

Your next question is from Chris Bottiglieri of Exane BNP Paribas.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Strong quarter. I had a quick question on the GPU. So it sounds like you pulled back on the price
investments. The customer sourcing mix is as high as I've ever seen it. It sounds like used pricing was a
tailwind to GPUs. I don't know if that's true or not, if you can confirm that. But were there any offsets?
Like is it just costing work to recondition cars in this environment? Or like anything that would mitigate
some of these tailwinds on GPU that you could speak to?

CARMAX, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Well, first of all, for us, the used car pricing isn't necessarily a tailwind to GPU. We don't manage our
margin according to how expensive a vehicle is. We have a lot of other factors. So that's not necessarily a
tailwind for us like it might be some of the other folks.

I think as we look forward, having -- driving a higher self-sufficiency is certainly going to be a tailwind for
us. And I've always said that we've -- our prices are very competitive. And I'd tell you, I think our prices
are as competitive as ever right now.

So I feel great about the direction we're going. I feel great about our prices. I feel great about the
flexibility that we have to not only provide world-class GPU per car -- per retail car, but also be able to do
it in a way that our prices are very, very competitive.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Seth Basham of Wedbush.

Seth Mckain Basham
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

My question is on the mix of sales that were purchased online, 8% this quarter versus 5% last quarter.
Is that solely due to the increased eligibility of customers being able to buy entirely online? Or are there
other factors? And as you get to 100% rollout of eligibility, would you expect that metric to move up closer
to 20%?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the 5% to 8% was driven by geographic expansion and some additional capabilities. I would
expect that number to continue to go up. As I said, we made some good progress. And actually, I'm sorry,
you're asking about the total online, not just the self-serve. So self-serve -- I mean, online went from
25% to 40%. And I would expect that number to continue to go up as we add additional capabilities as we
go forward.

And the areas that we're focused on, I think primarily, what's going to continue to drive the adoption
will be, again, adding some of the self-service features. And so when I think about that, the areas we're
focused on is to make it a little bit more simple and seamless on transfers as well as trade-ins.

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

And we certainly expect that percent of sales and percent of revenues from online to go up. But at the
same time, the beauty of our business model is that it's really up to the consumer and of omni, right?
So to the degree the consumer wants to buy online, they can do that to -- and more and more so. To
the degree they want to come into the store and shop that way, they can do that as well. But we expect
the numbers to go up. But again, it's really going to be driven by the consumers and how they want to
interact with us, whether it's in-store or online.

Seth Mckain Basham
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. And the all-in gross profit per unit -- per vehicle purchased entirely online versus through the
stores, how is that comparing these days?

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

They're about similar. They're about similar.

Your final question is from David Whiston of Morningstar.

David Whiston
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I wanted to go back to the Edmunds acquisition because honestly, I'm still not totally clear on the rationale
for it. I get there's vertical integration benefits, I think, procuring and retailing. But at the same time,
there are CarMax competitors that are paying them for their lead generation. So how are you ensuring
that they still get a fair shake because otherwise, they're not going to want to do business with Edmunds if
CarMax is getting all the preferences. Can you just connect some dots for me?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So again, we're thrilled to complete the acquisition as are the teams on both sides. As a reminder,
they are that premium brand for automotive research. We're going to continue to operate them as a
separate brand and a separate company. And we're excited to work with them to continue to drive more
of the services for their consumers and their dealers and their OEM partners. We're going to invest in their
brand.

But we're also excited about the teams continuing to collaborate and progress on programs that help both
companies. And a great example of that is the instant offers. We developed that with them, initially rolled
it out on Edmunds, and then we have it on carmax.com. And we think there's a lot of opportunity there
still, and we think there's a lot of opportunity on content.

So I think it's very important that we keep the company separate and we keep making sure that they're
continuing to add value to their individual customers. And I think we can do both. And then as we continue
to develop things jointly together that benefit both companies, we'll continue to highlight those in the
future.

David Whiston
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And can you disclose what the equity investment was that you had the gain on?

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

No. We don't really talk about it. We have -- as I mentioned, we have a portfolio of relatively modest
investments across the used auto ecosystem, primarily strategic, to make sure that we understand and
we know what's going on in that space. And so we just had an outsized gain this quarter on one of those
investments, but we don't really disclose which companies we're investing in.

Operator

And there are no other questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Bill for any closing remarks.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Shelby. Well, hopefully, you guys can tell from our comments that we're extremely
pleased with the first quarter results and that we are very excited about the future. And it's not just about
the opportunities that come with having this largest total addressable market in the used auto retail, but
it's also the opportunities that exist in our other core businesses. So if you think wholesale, if you think
CAF, and then even going beyond that into this larger auto ecosystem. And all of it is supported by the
tremendous transformation, whether it's our omnichannel experiences, whether it's our proprietary tech
stack, it's data or some of the other offerings that we highlighted on today's call.
