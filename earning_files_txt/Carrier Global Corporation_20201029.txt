CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at
ir.carrier.com.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Samuel Joel Pearlstein
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
With me here today are David Gitlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim McLevish, Chief
Financial Officer.

Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding
restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often
referred to by management as other significant items.

The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-
looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings,
including Carrier's registration statement on Form 10 and the reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, provide
details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in
the forward-looking statements.

This morning, we'll review our financial results for the third quarter of 2020, discuss the full year 2020
outlook, and we'll leave time for questions at the end. [Operator Instructions]

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Gitlin.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone.

Before we get going, let me first comment on the upcoming CFO transition that we announced last week.
Patrick Goris, currently the CFO of Rockwell Automation, will be joining us as our CFO in a couple of
weeks. At that point, Tim will take on the role of senior adviser, helping us with a smooth transition to
Patrick and taking on specific key projects until his retirement in mid-February.

For context, when we hired Tim, he was very clear with us that his role would be to help effectively stand
us up as a public company, including building the finance team and function, strengthening the balance
sheet, helping us establish our strategic priorities, working with the rating agencies and investment
community and charting the course for his successor. Doing all that and more, Tim has been the perfect
CFO at the perfect time. I can't thank him enough for everything he has done for me personally and for
Carrier.

After a thorough search, I could not be happier to have Patrick joining us. I suspect most of you know him
well. During his time at Rockwell, Patrick transformed the finance function, helped drive industry-leading
top and bottom line performance and a shift toward a recurring revenue model, and he was instrumental
in guiding strategic capital allocation and portfolio optimization. We look forward to welcoming Patrick to
the Carrier team.

With that, please turn to Slide 2, where I'll discuss our Q3 highlights. In short, Q3 was a very encouraging
quarter. Sales of $5 billion were up 4% year-over-year and substantially exceeded our expectations.
Adjusted operating profit was up 6% year-over-year. We had strong incrementals in the quarter, putting

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

our reported year-to-date decrementals at 30%, but operationally at 26%, factoring in the $53 million
of additional public company costs. Our performance was driven by continued strength in North America
residential HVAC, which was up 46% in the quarter, and by continued traction on our cost and growth
initiatives.

In resi, this was our highest quarter ever for both sales and operating profit. We are pleased with our free
cash flow generation in the quarter, which was $880 million, primarily driven by higher net income and
better working capital performance, and we realized $300 million of cash before taxes from our sale of 9
million shares in Beijer.

We continue to aggressively reduce costs via a strategic disciplined approach, including reducing G&A and
simplifying the back office. As a result, we are now raising Carrier 600 to Carrier 700, which calls for $700
million of recurring cost takeout by the end of 2022. This will allow us to fund investments in growth while
driving margin expansion. We remain on track to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives
this year.

Based on our Q3 strength, we are again raising our 2020 full year outlook on sales, adjusted operating
profit and free cash flow. Given that we had $3.8 billion of cash at the end of the quarter, we plan to pay
down $1.5 billion of debt in the fourth quarter. Next year, we expect to do more while supporting our
dividend and preserving flexibility for M&A opportunities.

Pivoting now to Slide 3 on our progress on our overall priorities. We've put in place a playbook that is
gaining traction. Adoption of the Carrier Way has created a profound cultural transformation, which is
resulting in an agile, innovative, aggressive, winning-focused organization, all of which is helping fuel our
growth agenda.

It starts with ensuring a performance culture, putting our customers first, and through a rigorous
deployment of Carrier Excellence in our supplier excellence program, our on-time delivery has increased to
96%, and our quality and performance has improved 30% year-to-date.

We continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We have added an incremental 450 sales and sales
support personnel this year, and have introduced a number of innovative offerings, including the first fully
autonomous, all-electric, engineless refrigerated trailer system in Europe; and a new multipurpose cloud-
connected commercial fire detector that combines smoke detection with advanced sensing capabilities.
And in terms of services, aftermarket and digital initiatives, our commercial HVAC business closed the
quarter at a 27% attachment rate globally, on track to achieve 30% by the end of this year.

We have signed over 300 BlueEdge contracts since the program launched in June.

We are also continuing to drive connected offerings across the network. For example, in the commercial
refrigeration business, we completed a very successful pilot on our condition-based maintenance program,
improving uptime by about 33%, and improving technician productivity by over 20%.

In Fire & Security, our Kidde Fire Systems business shipped its first orders for IntelliSite, a remote health
monitoring service for industrial fire alarm and suppression system control units. At a Carrier enterprise
level, we are truly leaning into the emerging trends around healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold
chain solutions, which you'll see on Slide 4.

Starting with healthy, safe and sustainable buildings. Our strategy here is to be the leading one-stop
shop provider, which is driving strong customer interest and new product introductions that continue to
gain traction. We obtained independent validation through a rigorous testing process that our Infinity air
purifier's capture and kill (sic) [ Captures & Kills ] technology inactivates 99% of coronavirus trapped on
the filter, the first of its kind. Orders for those filtration systems were up 140% year-over-year in the third
quarter. We also have orders for nearly 15,000 OptiClean units, and we are working an active pipeline for
thousands more.

Through our relationship with Cushman & Wakefield, we were able to upgrade a Denver area office
campus with air purification systems with needlepoint bipolar ionization technology for every rooftop unit
on its campus, along with service by Carrier's BlueEdge platform. And we just signed a strategic HVAC

deal at the 50-floor One Court Square Tower in Long Island City, which we estimate will save up to 20% in
energy cost annually and deliver improved comfort and air quality.

For the healthy building space overall, we now have an active pipeline of potential order activity of $150
million, and we're still in the early stages of putting the comprehensive strategy in place to maximize our
offerings and capture the opportunity ahead of us.

Similarly, we recently launched our Healthy, Safe and Sustainable Cold Chain Program. I am thrilled with
our new relationship with Amazon Web Services, with whom we are partnering to develop a robust and
powerful data ecosystem for cold chain operations. We also introduced Carrier Pods monitored by our
Sensitech business to support added mobile cold chain capacity and cargo insights. With key partners,
we're working to connect the dots to provide a one-stop shop approach for cold chain solutions for both
food and pharma distribution.

So we've made progress on our financial results, our performance culture, strategic growth initiatives and
capital allocation.

Before I turn it over to Tim, let me give you some color on current order trends. Slide 5 outlines our 3
segments, which we have broken into 2 key business lines each. We also provide color by geographic
region. Starting with HVAC. You see here that our residential and light commercial orders were up 60%
year-over-year in the quarter, driven by resi. Movement from distribution to dealers was strong and
distribution inventory levels are now in balance. For commercial HVAC, orders improved from down about
15% in Q2 to almost flat in Q3.

In our Refrigeration segment's transport business, order trends indicate that Q2 was the bottom for our
truck trailer business. Unit order rates more than doubled from June to September. Container orders were
down in Q3, but these tend to be lumpy, and we have seen solid October orders. Commercial refrigeration
orders were also down in the quarter but improved sequentially from Q2.

For Fire & Security products, orders improved from down 20% in Q2 to down about 10%. We saw
improvement in commercial and residential fire, China and the controls business, while the small- and
medium-sized business, oil and gas and hospitality markets were weak. The F&S field business orders
improved from down almost 30% in Q2 to down around 5% in Q3. Installation and nonrecurring service
orders were down around 10%, given the discretionary nature of that work, while recurring service and
monitoring orders were flat.

Our business has reflected the bifurcated macro economy, where residential, health care, education, data
centers and warehouses have remained strong, while the oil and gas, small and medium businesses and
hospitality verticals remain challenged. Fortunately, the latter verticals are a much smaller part of our
portfolio. We see the same bifurcation geographically, where the U.S. and China remains strong, Europe is
recovering and Asia, excluding China, is very challenged. While we're encouraged by Q3 order trends, we
recognize the continued global uncertainty, and we remain prepared to adapt.

With that, I'll turn it over to Tim and then come back to summarize before Q&A. Tim?

Timothy R. McLevish
Special Advisor to the CEO

Thanks, Dave. Good morning.

Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave just mentioned, the quarter surpassed what we had expected as we saw
very strong demand in residential HVAC and continued recovery in the broader markets in which we
participate. Recall that last quarter, we said that we believe the Q2 year-on-year sales decline would be
the low point for the year. That proved to be the case as Q3 sales of $5 billion did not decline, but in fact,
were up almost 4% over the prior year and 3% organically. This was driven primarily by residential HVAC.
While we saw sequential improvement across the company since the second quarter, we still had modest
year-over-year sales declines in the majority of our businesses in Q3.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, and that includes a $252 million gain on the sale of about 9 million
shares in Beijer. Adjusted operating profit of $867 million was up 6% from last year. Our incremental
margin was 27%, and this number would be materially higher absent the incremental public company and
TSA costs. Accelerated productivity and continued cost control drove the strong performance on margins.

Our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.84, and adjusted EPS was $0.67. Since we were not a public company last year,
the year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful.

Our free cash flow was strong, considerably higher than we had expected. The biggest driver was higher
net income, but we also saw working capital improvement and a favorable timing impact from interest and
tax payments. All things considered, a very strong third quarter for Carrier in a very difficult environment.

Let's now look at how the segments performed. Please turn to Slide 7, and note that the year-over-year
numbers to which I will refer are organic comparisons.

The HVAC segment sales were up 11% from last year. Within the segment, residential was up 46%. We
are very proud of how well the team executed on unprecedented levels of demand that enabled us to gain
share. Recall that we ended Q2 with field inventory levels down about 25%. At the end of Q3, we saw field
inventories back to prior year levels and expect a more normalized Q4 in that business. COVID created
very atypical seasonality for residential as Q2 was down materially, and Q3 was unusually strong, and we
expect the full year 2020 will likely end up as a fairly normal year in total.

In North America light commercial, we saw a sales decline of 13%. We did see sequential improvement
during the Q3 as reopenings continued, but we expect light commercial to continue to lag this year.
Commercial HVAC sales were down 7%, with modest declines in most of its business lines. We saw a low
single-digit decline in applied and a high single-digit decline in the services businesses. Applied sales were
down less than the overall commercial HVAC, as we entered this slowdown with a healthy backlog in this
longer cycle business. All of these year-over-year declines improved from those in the second quarter.

From a regional perspective for commercial HVAC, China sales were up about 10% in the quarter, but
Asia, excluding China, was weak, especially India, as it remains heavily impacted by disruptions related to
COVID. We are confident we gained share in China and North America in applied.

Now over to Refrigeration, where segment sales were down 6%. North America truck/trailer was down
about 30%, but that reflects almost a 50% improvement from the trough we saw in Q2. Europe truck
trailer was down close to 10%, and container was up mid-single digits. We saw improving order trends for
both North America and Europe truck/trailer, and believe we have turned the corner on the down cycle in
both businesses. Commercial refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter, as a modest decline in EMEA was
offset by mid-single-digit growth in Asia.

Moving over to Fire & Security segment, which was down 7%. The products business was down consistent
with the segment. Declines in the Americas and Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in
China. Within the Americas, our residential fire products business grew low single digits, which was offset
by declines at some of our security businesses that are more impacted by the slowdown in the small
business and hospitality markets. The field business is also down in line with the segment, as restricted
building access and lagging commercial construction activity drove mid to high single-digit declines on
install and repair jobs. That effect was partially offset by low single-digit growth in the recurring service
piece of the business.

Bottom line, we saw continued encouraging trends across the company, with the pace of recovery differing
in some areas. While we have observed more normalizing market conditions, we continue to focus on
controlling the controllables and an aggressive cost management that will help us fund investments to
position us for future growth.

Please turn to Slide 8. I will provide an update on our cost programs. And each quarter this year, we have
accelerated our in-year savings plan for Carrier 600. With that success, we are now confident in increasing
the 3-year target to $700 million, and renaming the program, Carrier 700.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

On the slide, you'll see that the $250 million target for 2020 for Carrier 700, and the planned investment
of $100 million remain unchanged. We had previously discussed spending about $300 million over 3 years
for investments in R&D, digital and sales, and we still expect to do so. You'll notice that our savings from
cost containment actions is now $250 million, down from $300 million that we discussed last quarter.
Because the business has been executing at a much higher level, in the fourth quarter, we are restoring
some of the temporary people-related cost actions taken earlier this year.

Also updated from last quarter is the headwind from productivity and absorption issues related to the
pandemic. Better-than-expected volumes as well as strong execution has resulted in the absorption
headwinds not being quite as bad as we had anticipated. If you recall, our original model for Carrier 600
was that the savings we generated would fully fund our growth in investments, and the remainder would
drop through. With about $100 million in year-over-year headwind expected for 2021 from the reversal of
onetime cost containment measures, it will require a larger portion of our Carrier 700 benefits. This means
less of the savings should drop to the bottom line and could impact our incremental margins next year.

Continuing on Slide 9. As we've said, a key priority during the pandemic has been to maintain ample
liquidity. And as you see on this slide, our strong focus on cash has enabled very good free cash flow,
which was driven by better-than-expected earnings and tightly managed working capital. We exited the
quarter with $3.8 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which was helped by the partial sale of our shares
in Beijer. As conditions in the market have improved, we now plan to pay down $1.5 billion in debt before
the end of the year, a big step towards our debt repayment plans.

With a healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to emerge from the pandemic on a stronger footing
and capitalize on the opportunities as we return to a more normalized environment. As a result, we expect
to be in a position to communicate more details on our capital allocation priorities early next year.

Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll review our outlook. On our Q2 call, we gave you guidance ranges that
reflected the broader uncertainty associated with the economic climate we were experiencing. Now with 2
months to go in the year, we can provide a more precise and improved outlook from what we gave you in
July. We now expect sales to be about $17.3 billion, higher than the high end of our prior guidance range.
This is based on the significant strength we saw in residential HVAC in Q3 and the broader economic
improvement. We expect adjusted operating profit of approximately $2.2 billion, which is also above the
high end of our prior range. This reflects the drop-through from the higher sales outlook.

On free cash flow, we now expect to generate about $1.5 billion in 2020, a significant improvement from
our prior outlook of at least $1.1 billion. The biggest driver of the cash flow is higher net income, along
with continued tight working capital management and a few timing items.

With that, I'll hand it back to Dave to wrap things up before Q&A.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Tim. Our results demonstrate that we are successfully navigating through this unprecedented
environment. We continue to focus on aggressive cost actions while driving our key strategic growth
initiatives. We remain confident in our 3- to 5-year medium-term outlook of mid-single-digit sales growth,
high single-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow. Given the lower base from the COVID-driven disruption
in 2020, recent order trends and the execution of our strategy, we anticipate pulling those medium-term
growth rates into next year.
With that, we'll open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So I just want to understand the -- just the full year guidance a little bit better. So clearly, 3Q turned out
to be just a lot stronger than we anticipated. And as I think about the 4Q sequential, is it the way to think
about it that sequentially, 4Q is going to be lower this year just because 3Q turned out to be a lot stronger
than expected driven by resi? I'm just trying to understand the implied 4Q guide.

Timothy R. McLevish
Special Advisor to the CEO

Yes, Joe, this is Tim. Well, in 4Q, we have some -- I mean, yes, resi was particularly strong in Q3, and that
drove a lot of our Q3 favorability. We're expecting a bit more normalized Q4 as they are transitioning kind
of from splits of air conditioners into furnaces, so it will be a bit more normalized than we saw in Q3. But
also in Q4, we are anticipating -- remember, we have about $25 million of quarterly impact from year-
on-year effect from our public company costs. And we do anticipate that we're going to spend about $75
million of the $100 million that we've set aside for investments.

You might ask the question, why so back-end loaded? But the reality of it is, this year, we started out with
an expectation we're going to invest $150 million. Before the COVID hit, we scaled that back considerably,
and now we reinstated as things are looking better. But it takes a little bit of time to ramp down and ramp
back up. So we have baked in there about $75 million of our investment to hit. And there's about $20
million of other kind of transition-related things from UTC as we stand-alone as a public company. So
adjusting for those things, you would see that it's much more normalized fourth quarter.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the color there, Tim.

I guess my follow-on question is, as you think about 2021, obviously, really encouraging to see Carrier
600 step up to Carrier 700, and also the nonrecurring cost containment action stepping down this year.
As we kind of think about the puts and takes, especially on the margins for next year, I guess, is the way
to think about this release that there's probably going to be more goodness then from the cost reduction
savings from Carrier 700? And then less of a headwind also from the temporary cost actions that you took
this year?

Timothy R. McLevish
Special Advisor to the CEO

Joe, this is Tim. I mean, on balance, I mean, if you look at the cost containment measures, and we
stepped that down to $350 million, we probably will still get some carryover, probably travel will not snap
back fully. But also, we identified that our -- the impact from productivity related to the COVID is stepped
down a little bit. On balance across that, we probably have $100 million of headwind, net headwind from
those actions. And it probably is going to take a little bit more of the Carrier 700 than typically we would
experience. I mean, we haven't set up -- think about the average remaining of $450 million on the Carrier
700 versus the $250 million we've experienced already, and then subtract out the investments, and then
probably we'll use a little bit of the Carrier 700 remaining to cover some of that year-on-year decrement.

And our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

It appears that your share is improving pretty broadly. So I guess, I just wanted to touch on that. Maybe
you could talk about areas where you think you've done best in share relative to the market? And Dave, I
think you said the sales force was up like 450 people or something. Is that process kind of done now? Or
is there anything else that these guys are doing? Any change in incentive compensation? Just kind of how
are you managing the sales force and driving those share gains?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Let me hit the first one first. On resi share gains, yes. I mean, look, we grew 46% in the quarter.
We were really 2x the overall market. So clearly, we picked up share in the third quarter. But it's really
not, I think, fair for us to look at it just 1 quarter at a time. If you look at it over a 12-month period, we
picked up about 100 basis points of share, which is, I think, a better indicator. But look, we've said that
we were going to really lean into growth and focus on really winning out in the marketplace. And I think
our team, Chris Nelson, Justin Keppy and the team have done a really nice job of that, partnering with our
distributors.

So we've seen it really across the U.S., and it's not just splits. We've seen it on the furnace side as well. I
think part of it was the fact that, operationally, we were able to perform and provide units to the dealers.
There's been some dealer conversion.

And I think the other factor is that we came into the quarter with somewhat depressed inventory levels
with our distribution channels. Inventory levels coming into 3Q were down about 25% year-over-year,
and then you kind of look at the sudden spike we saw in orders in June that carried forward into July and
August, we really had to turn up the heat to make sure that we could support our customers. And frankly,
it was a challenge. Our customers have done a great job working with us. But we did -- it was quite a
ramp to support them. But on balance, we've been very pleased with the share gains. The key is that we
sustain that going forward.

I think in terms of the salespeople, the 450 we referred to is that's really mostly outside of resi, where
we've been looking at that in both the applied space on the OE side as well as in services and aftermarket.
And that's very much a global phenomenon. We've been adding those mostly in China and North
America, a little bit in Europe, which has been a bit more challenge to add them there. But -- and I don't
think that's the end of it. We had come into this year saying that we had a deficit versus some of our
competitors. We said we'd add 500, we've added 450, and I think we'll end up adding more as we go into
next year.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just quickly, anything to call out relative to the resi trends in October so far?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

So far, so good. I mean, the orders that we've seen in October have been strong. So we'll have to see how
things play out. We're trying to work with our distributors to give them the product they need when they
need it. So orders have remained strong, and we're working with them to work on managing that delivery
schedule. Normally, at this time of the year, we'd be ramping down, and we're not doing that. We're
continuing to support our customers through the off-season as we kind of gear up for 1Q and beyond.

Operator

And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Maybe -- and I want to say, Tim, thanks for all the help since the spin.

But maybe a follow-up question on the savings versus investments. So as you said, there's sort of $450
million of savings left after this year. And you implied maybe around $200 million of extra investment, just
wanted to check that?

And any thoughts around the split of that $450 million and $200 million between next year and the year
after? And is there any sort of baseline operating leverage number we should dial in? I think you talked
about 28% to 30% previously. Is there any kind of minimum level that you calibrate around?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Julian. Let me start at a high level and then ask Tim to add on.

I think as we think about '21 and going forward, we do think ourselves -- let me start even on the sales
side, is that we had said that we would grow on the top line mid-single digits. What I would have told you
a couple of months ago is that we were kind of at the high end of mid-single digits. But we've been a bit
surprised by the resi strength that we've seen over the last couple of months. So it's probably still mid-
single digits, but more at the low end of that. And we've been consistent that incrementals would be in
that 30% range, give or take various moving parts in the system.

And then you have all of these costs, puts and takes between our increase on Carrier 700, so we have
$450 million to go, you could probably consider $225 million a year, next year and the year after that. We
have the $100 million of sort of onetime headwinds going into next year because of the onetime -- $100
million of onetime savings that we incurred this year. And then we have incremental investments. So I
think what you're really looking at is the sales growing mid-single digits, probably at the lower end, and
then the drop-through on those sales.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's helpful, Dave. And then maybe my second question would be around the sort of portfolio. And you
started, I think, some cleanup actions with that partial Beijer stake sale a few weeks back. Do you think
that the macro environment is now conducive to a sort of steady pace of maybe some of that portfolio
rationalization? And how quickly do you want to try and take that process to help with the balance sheet
delevering?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We've remained consistent that the single best thing we can do to create shareholder value is
execute on our long-range plan. You actually just reviewed it with our Board. We've done a very detailed
assessment by business unit. We've done our strat reviews, we've done our LRPs. And the way we run
the business is that for all of our strategic initiatives, we track those with significant clarity and focus. And
we are very confident that we can create significant shareholder value by making sure that we have a
performance culture, that we're laser-focused on the cost side, but also on our growth initiatives, which is
really using some new muscles within Carrier, but it's getting great traction.

And then we've said that we would take a very clinical look at our portfolio, including the 58 JVs, and
you saw some actions that we did take in 2Q. We continue to look at every JV to make sure that they
really are the best use of our capital. And we'll look at some bolt-on M&A and perhaps some divestitures
over time. But in terms of sort of the bigger transformative transactions, our biggest focus right now is
executing on our LRP.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Dave, I just want to dig into the commercial side of the house. Orders, flat. Pretty spectacular there.
Anything more that you can tell us on the order front? I know it's not really a channel, especially on
applied, where there's inventory. But anything from a replenishment standpoint or a comp that we should
keep in mind? Because, I guess, just given the mix of business there and what we're seeing in nonres
construction, there should at least be a little bit of headwind. So that surprises me as being particularly
strong.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Look, I think that it's quite bifurcated. There's some real strength in applied. When you look at things
like data centers and health care and warehouses, we're seeing continued strength globally, especially in
China and the U.S. Education has picked up quite well, not only K-12, but universities.

Commercial building is a bit of a watch item. We know there are some real headwinds, things like retail
hospitality, restaurants that has a more acute impact on our light commercial business.

So when we look at it, one encouraging metric that we did see pop up a bit was ABI, the architectural
billing index, which is a good forward-looking indicator. It's been hovering around 40, we saw it go up to
47. We would like to see that north of 50. Dodge Construction year-to-date is down about 20%, but only
about 15% of our business ties to that metric.

So I think when you put that all together, it's a watch item. There are some encouraging areas, and where
it's strong, I think we've really leaned into and seen some share gains. China has been particularly strong,
and I'm quite proud of the team there, and North America has been continuing to recover. So I look at it, I
think we're going to exit this year with our applied business backlog up around 5% or 10% going into next
year. But it's clearly a watch item, and we'll have to keep monitoring it.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And then, I think this whole kind of industry group has turned into the
collection basin for IAQ and discussion around building energy efficiency, and it sounds like Carrier
is clearly part of that with some of your opening remarks. Anything that you can talk about in terms
of seeing this actually show up with customer sizing an opportunity? You mentioned some rooftop
opportunity there. I think most people would consider this kind of applied first, unitary second. I know
there's kind of a lot to unpack in that question. But maybe just kind of level set us on what you're seeing
out there and how that would fall into kind of the various slices of Carrier's exposure?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Josh, I would tell you that we are very encouraged by not only the trends we're seeing in IAQ but the
opportunity. It starts with the premise that people spend 90% of their time indoors. So if you're 50 years
old, you've spent 45 years on this Earth indoors. And you look at the amount of indoor square footage,
that's going to double over the next 40 years. So when you look at something like COVID, it's really
shined the light on the criticality of making sure that people have healthy, safe and sustainable indoor air
environment.

So the way we've approached it is really twofold. One is introduce new products, things like OptiClean, the
certification of our electrostatic filters for the home. We're working on air purifiers. We're working on new
types of filtration, whether it's UV or bipolar ionization and really round out the portfolio and get those to
market, and there's been significant pull.

On top of that, we've been working on more customized solutions that look at more broader ventilation
solutions about airflow and air changes per hour that are more holistic changes. And then the broader
solution is ultimately going to be something that gets into independent assessments about the healthy

and safe indoor air quality. We'll work on a digital solution so tenants have visibility to whether or not the
indoor air environment is up to standard. And then we'll be rolling that out in a more holistic way.

When we look at the market size, we get this question a lot, and here's what I'd say. If you look at the
products that we sell into, our HVAC systems, our Fire & Security systems, that total market is about $90
billion to $100 billion. And we think that the additional opportunity created through IAQ is about 10%. So
call it, $9 billion to $10 billion, and one thing I can tell you is that I'm extremely confident that we'll get
more than our fair share of that piece. Now it takes some time to build up. I talked about a pipeline of
$150 million. We continue to see real traction, real customers making orders. So it's going to take some
time to build up to that number, but we do think it's certainly within our sights over time.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's great color. And I feel like I've had 45 years just in 2020, so I can certainly speak for myself there.

And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Tim, thanks for the help and good luck next chapter.

Timothy R. McLevish
Special Advisor to the CEO

Thanks, Nigel.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

I'm guessing there won't be too many troubling questions today, Tim. So -- I'm just guessing there.

But going back to the resi performance, and I understand there's obviously benefits from channel fill
there. But I'm just curious, do you have any intelligence on your sell-through of the Carrier brands
through your channels? Because obviously, the market looks like it's up high teens, but I'm just curious
how your sell-through compared when we back out that impact from the channel fill?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Look we closely track the movement from our distributors to our dealers, and it's been consistent
with what we would have thought. I think the encouraging thing is the inventory levels at our distributors
ending 3Q is about what we would have seen at those inventory levels last year. So when you look at the
very unusual swings that you saw Q3 down something like 13% -- excuse me, Q2; Q3 up 46%. When we
get into next year, there's going to be unbelievably unprecedented compares as we're trying to explain
what happened in 2Q and 2Q -- in 3Q of next year. But when you look at it more holistically for the year,
the whole market is going to be up mid-single digits. We'll be up high single digits this year. So not an
incredibly unusual year, just unusual phasing within the year.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Yes, that's for sure. And then speaking of compares. I think last year, you had a really tough compare on
furnaces with the kind of the pre-builds that happened through the spring and summer. So I'm expecting
you to do quite well relative to the market in 4Q, just given that dynamic, is that fair?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think that our 4Q should be strong on resi. Clearly, not 46%, but I would guess in the 15% to 20%
range.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's great color. And then maybe just one more question. Can we just touch on the refrigeration
margins? They were a little bit weaker than what we expected. So just wondering what we saw there in
terms of mix and maybe some volume deleverage?

And then as we kind of come into 2021, I'm expecting strong trends from truck/trailer. Would you expect
the sort of margins to be north of the 30% range for that segment?

Timothy R. McLevish
Special Advisor to the CEO

Yes. Nigel, I'll take it. First, I will say, when you look at decrementals for that segment of the business,
in Refrigeration, first of all, you get kind of what I call the law of small numbers. There was a $46 million
decline in sales, and the operating profit decline was a small piece of that. But within it, you had a mix
between CCR, our commercial refrigeration business and transport. Commercial was top line, pretty flat
and modestly down on the bottom line. Transport, obviously, our high-margin business was down about
10% on balance across that business, and down, say, $15 million to $20 million on the bottom line.

There were a couple of other small charges in there. So that really explains the very high decremental
for the business. But it -- I would say, to your last question, when we see that turnaround, and we
expect that we're kind of at the bottom or have seen the bottom of that cycle, you will see very strong
incrementals on the way back up. It's -- the transport is a nice, very attractive margin business, and you
will see strong incrementals as we see that recover.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Okay. When you're kind of looking at how the -- how you kind of moved down from the increase in
guidance to cash, I think you said some timing items. What were those timing items? And do you think --
I assume you can grow cash next year, but maybe a little bit less than revenues -- less than net income
because of those timing items?

Timothy R. McLevish
Special Advisor to the CEO

Yes. Most of the timing we would expect actually to play out in the fourth quarter. If you kind of use a
subtractive method of where we are year-to-date in cash flow and where we -- where our guidance is
for the year, you'll see that the fourth quarter is not what is -- what we typically would see in the fourth
quarter of this year. Some of that is the strength we had in resi and the relatively short receivable terms
and our long payable terms. So you're seeing a lot of the purchases we had for that as positive cash flow
in Q3, that interchange between them. We'll pay those mostly back in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit
will bleed into the first quarter of next year.

And then also, somewhat COVID-related and somewhat start-up related, we have some tax deferrals,
for practical purposes. So for instance, there's $50 million, $60 million of tax on the sale of Beijer. We
obviously recognize the gain in the third quarter. We will pay the tax for it in the fourth quarter. And then,
there was some estimates is probably another $30 million, $40 million, $50 million of tax timing. So it's
really some working capital items, some tax impact.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I see. The timing in the fourth quarter, right? I got it.

And then just lastly, Dave, what's kind of your call on the resi market next year? Lennox has said mid-
singles. I think Trane said up a bit. What's kind of your view on the high level on the resi market trend
here?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think it feels in that sort of low, perhaps it gets up into the mid single-digit range. I think when
you look at some of the underlying factors, I do think there is more demand for IAQ. We are seeing more
demand for that. We'll have to obviously -- we'll see about weather. But you look at the -- a lot of the
underlying fundamentals that have driven the strength that we've seen now, they'll continue into next
year.

New construction should continue to be strong, up mid this year, probably up mid next year. And we have
good position with resi new construction. We do see that the whole stay-at-home phenomenon of people
putting additions on their house for their studies or people really prioritizing spend on resi -- residential
air conditioning because their families are spending more time at home, I think that will certainly continue
into next year. So there's going to be some compare issues, but it certainly would feel low and it may get
up into the mid-range, all-in.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I want to -- Tim, thanks for all the help, and congrats to both of you on pretty good start to -- in a very
tough environment coming out as a public company, for sure. So kudos to you guys on the execution.

And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc.

Jeffrey David Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just a couple of questions on commercial service. I think you said it was down high-single digits. Still a
little surprised that that's not starting to get more resilient here. So what's the outlook as you look at
service going forward? And then just on the attachment rate comment, you seem encouraged. You're
adding feet on the street. What do you think entitlement is for attachment rates a couple of years out?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Look, we originally thought this year was going to be 25%, and we tasked ourselves to get to 30%.
We're at 27% attachment rate, and we'll exit this year at 30%. So we're getting really, really strong
traction there. And our AssuranceONE program is helping that -- the playbook is clear. We know what we
have to do. The feet on the street, as you mentioned, will help.

Look, I see that number getting up to 50% over the next few years. We just got to keep chipping away
at it. I will say that a couple of our peers had a bit of a jump-start on us with their focus on things like
modernizations and attachment rates. So in all candor, we're playing a little bit of catch-up, but we know
what to do. We know the playbook, we have confidence in it. If you look at our overall service backlog,
it's actually up about 30% because some of the orders that we've had have been pushing out to the right
when you look at some customers pushing out modernizations and some other task. So as we get into
next year, we think that we'll see some real growth on the service side.

Jeffrey David Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just on the applied backlog, it was encouraging to hear backlog up kind of mid singles
exiting the year. What is the mix within that? And just kind of within the order rates this quarter that kind
of normalized to get more resilient, what are the key end markets or verticals that are kind of helping you
there?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I was mentioning a little bit around things that are helping us, it's really -- it's by location and it's by
vertical. It's kind of like when you fish, you go where the fish are. Right now you go where the customers
are. And they happen to be in places like data centers, health care, warehousing. Education has shown
some positive trends. So those have been quite positive.

Our light commercial business is down 10% to 15%. But that's very much a replacement business. 80/20
is replacement. So eventually, as those start to come back, we would expect that to recover as we get into
'21. But we have seen -- I'm really, really proud of the China team. They've continued to pick up share
and do a very nice job. And in North America, we've seen some real traction here and some recent wins
even over the last few weeks. So I feel confident that coming even in a very challenged environment,
we're continuing to get some key wins here in North America.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Maybe 2 questions. One, first a little bit in the weeds on data center, if we could. I see ALC struck an
agreement with data center information management company, Nlyte, not too long ago. Maybe just a little
color on what incrementally you're doing in data centers on top of kind of the core kind of cooling play that
we're all kind of thinking?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. You look at -- data centers has been a big focus area for us. We've actually had a number of key
wins. And when we look at data centers, it kind of plays into the Carrier story overall, which is that we
have a group that sells across Carrier. It covers every one of our verticals. So it will include ALC and
complete digital solutions. It will include, of course, our HVAC systems, chillers and others. But it can
include everything from our Marriott business that provides a very kind of purpose-fit suppression system
for things like data centers. The rest of Jurgen's portfolio in Fire & Security, many aspects of that play well
for data center.

So when we look at our building systems group that we have that sells into verticals, we have a holistic
data center solution. We do the same for things like hospitals, where we had a significant win with Emory
University that we're now talking to other hospitals across the country on. So that group can really look at
holistic offerings.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Interesting. And then just a follow-up on some of these kind of variance items. Just to be clear, on the
investment spend, that's $100 million incremental this year. Are we at run rate? Or you're suggesting
that goes up to a higher level in 2021? And I also just kind of similar question on CapEx, what kind of the
variance might be into 2021 on that?

Timothy R. McLevish
Special Advisor to the CEO

Yes. So let me start on that. So if you recall back at Investor Day, we kind of dimensionalized the
investment back into the business to position it for growth was $150 million, $100 million and then $50
million. And as COVID hit, it kind of changed that pacing. So we're $100 million this year. Again, I said
earlier, we've spent $25 million to date. Most in the third quarter. We're anticipating $75 million in the
fourth quarter. That will be the $100 million. In 2021, we expect another $100 million. And then in 2022,
we would expect to finish out that program at $100 million. And we'll have to see from there what further
investment may make sense. So that's kind of that, and that's all baked into what we said earlier.

From a CapEx standpoint, we do expect considerable, still $125 million, $150 million, of capital spend in
the fourth quarter of this year that also contributes to the -- what you might consider a weaker cash flow
in the fourth quarter. So there is considerable capital spend there.

You also may recall back at Investor Day, we said we would spend $350 million to $400 million as kind of
foundational capital expenditure in 2020. That was scaled back considerably because of the COVID. But we
do expect that, that will push out into 2021. So you would see that level in 2021. So there will be some
cash headwind there.

Obviously, when you talked about commercial earlier, you called out U.S. and China. Curious about what

big opportunity? Or is that an opportunity you see going forward?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

It sure is. We just introduced our 32 air-cooled scroll chiller that we've seen initial early traction. But you
know that the GWP focus is probably globally, most acute in Europe. We think we have some very strong
technology on the sustainability side. We continue to invest with new products coming out next year. So
I think a real differentiator in Europe is going to be the focus on low GWP offerings, and we continue to
lean into that. That does present an opportunity. And look, we were a little bit critical of ourselves, of our
Europe performance 2Q. We've seen some nice order trends recently. We'll have to see how things play
out with what's happening with COVID in Europe. But I do think the team is starting to gain some traction
over the last couple of months.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

But it sounds like you feel like you have the right product and the right position within the market to
participate in that?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

We do. We feel well positioned. I will tell you that we have more products on the come. We have a mag
bearing offering that's coming out next year or so. We continue to invest in the technology and the
portfolio. We like the products we have. But certainly, innovation is going to be key as we get into next
year and the year afterwards.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just a separate question here. As we think about into next year and you gave
that kind of bridge on the investments a couple of times. I still get asked the question why $300 million is
kind of the right number for the investments. Obviously, that's probably a much larger discussion than an
earnings call. But it seems like you're taking up your savings, and so all else equal, we have an extra $100
million of drop-through relative to what we were thinking before. Is that right? Or could you actually, over
time, take up that investment number to kind of offset it?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Look, we'll have to assess the investment levels over the time. We have an LRP. We've factored in what
does it take to consistently grow in that mid-single-digit range, and that's where we've come up with that
investment level. And we've also consistently said that we would expect to improve ROS 50 bps a year. So
we keep all that in balance in our algorithm.

But I could tell you something that is very -- a little bit new, but very thematic at Carrier is that we are
going to grow. We are going to invest in growth, and we're going to be consistent. We're not going to do
a lot of fits and starts. We're going to make commitments on growth areas, and we're going to stick to
them.

I would just want to follow-up on the indoor air quality theme. And I appreciate that you all are the first

should group that as part of your -- the bucket of the assessment for the healthy buildings and so forth.
How does that split between equipment sales and then the recurring side of this, the BlueDiamond piece?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. The $150 million, that was the pipeline. We are in active -- they're not all firm orders yet. We've
actually -- we have a number of firm orders, like I mentioned, with the OptiClean and others. And we
actually have -- we -- this is something, obviously, we review often. And I was looking at our top 20
projects where we've been pulled into the project that I mentioned in Colorado, where, through Cushman
& Wakefield, we would have had a typical chiller sale, which would have been significant. But we added a
number of UV lights and other kind of bipolar ionization, other kind of filtration add-ons to an otherwise
typical order. That was really quite significant.

We've seen it with a university in Southeast Asia, where we had a very significant dedicated IAQ sale,
where they were very focused on as they were welcoming students back.

So look, some are firm orders. Some are, I think, soon to be converted into firm orders. And it really has
been primarily on the HVAC side. But Jurgen and his team have some really creative offerings. The Blue
Diamond piece is going to be part of our overall digital solution because that's the piece that can have that
customer intimacy where you can look at your smartphone and you can use that to see how are the actual
indicators for IAQ, whether it's your CO2 levels or your -- the amount of ventilation that you're seeing or
other things that you may be measuring. We were looking at about 7 attributes that we'll be looking at.
And BlueDiamond will be a great source for us to kind of monitor those 7 attributes and also give the end
customer insight into those attributes.

BlueDiamond also gives you capabilities around contact tracing. We have the announcement that Jurgen
and team drove with FLIR around thermal scanning. So there's a number of things in his portfolio that are
attractive but become a lot more attractive when they're part of the Carrier solution.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Terrific. And look, I know we're at the top of the hour, but I did just want to squeeze in one last question.
Your HVAC peers all are -- stand favorable within the ESG community in terms of holdings. You all are
new -- as a new public company, you really haven't cracked the top 10 yet. Would be interested in how do
you expect to position Carrier for this ESG demand that we expect is -- will be interested in the stock. But
what has to happen before you'll start seeing the ESG and sustainability investors considering Carrier?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Deane, I'm glad you ended on that question because we're very energized about ESG. And we just
reviewed with our Board our specific targets that we will be committing ourselves to and we'll be releasing
publicly.

Obviously, it's going to be a big focus on sustainability, and I think folks will be quite pleased by how we're
stepping up around our sustainability targets. But it includes everything from D&I, where I really believe
that we've leaned into the moment around diversity and inclusion And that's just the profound impact
that, that's had on us this year that's going to be sustainable. And all other aspects of D&I, how we deal
with our suppliers in various elements, in our own operations.

So I think this will be very, very thematic for Carrier. It's thematic for our space, but we're really looking to
differentiate ourselves and I think you would expect us to be within the top quartile on an ESG basis.
