Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Garmin Limited Third Quarter 2020
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being
recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Teri Seck, with Investor Relations. Please
go ahead, ma'am.

Teri Seck
Manager of Investor Relations

Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Limited's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations
site on the Internet at www.garmin.com/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript will also
be available on our website.

This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Limited and
its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross margins,
operating margins, future dividends, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products
and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual
results could differ materially as a result of risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these
risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K and third quarter 2020 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This means that results could change at any time and any statement about the impact of COVID-19 on
the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of
today's date.

Presenting on behalf of Garmin Limited this morning are: Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. At this time, I would like to turn the call
over to Cliff Pemble.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, Garmin reported record third quarter
operating results. Consolidated revenue exceeded $1.1 billion, as strong demand for active lifestyle
products fueled growth of 19% over the prior year. Gross margin was 60.2%. Operating income increased
21% year-over-year to $317 million and operating margin expanded to 28.6%. This resulted in GAAP EPS
of $1.63 and pro forma EPS of $1.58 for the quarter, up 24% over the prior year.

We are pleased with our performance so far in 2020, especially considering the unprecedented challenges
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends in the business are stabilizing, which gives us confidence
to provide fiscal 2020 guidance, which I will cover shortly. First, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the
performance of each of our business segments.

Starting with marine. Revenue increased 54%, as we experienced growth in multiple product categories,
led by strong demand for chartplotters. Gross and operating margins were 61% and 31%, respectively,
resulting in operating income growth of over 150%. There are 2 key factors driving these results. First, the
market is expanding as new customers embrace boating and fishing. Second, our strong lineup of products
and game-changing technologies are driving market share gains.

GARMIN LTD. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

We continue to be recognized for our innovation and achievements in the marine industry. For the sixth
consecutive year, the National Marine Electronics Association named Garmin Manufacturer of the Year and
we received 4 Product of Excellence awards. We were also recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative
marine companies by Soundings Trade Only, a B2B news and information provider for the recreational
boating industry.

Looking forward, we anticipate that interest in boating and fishing will remain strong. We plan to capitalize
on these trends by offering a compelling lineup of products with innovative features and disruptive
technologies.

Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 35%, driven by strong demand for advanced
wearables and cycling products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 27%, respectively, resulting
in operating income growth of 75% over the prior year. The pandemic continues to highlight the
importance of living a healthy life, and our fitness segment benefited from this trend.

During the quarter, we launched the new Forerunner 745, expanding the features offered in our mid-
tier multisport product range. We also launched Clipboard, an app that facilitates team training and
performance monitoring using Garmin devices.

In the advanced wellness category, we launched the Venu Sq, an entry-level smart watch that combines
daily wear style with industry-leading activity tracking and health monitoring features.

Looking forward, we expect a broader trends in fitness and wellness to continue. We plan to leverage
our recent acquisition of Firstbeat to offer products with unique health, wellness and fitness features. In
addition, we intend to capitalize on the indoor cycling opportunity with our Tacx product line.

Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 30% with strength in all major categories, led
by strong demand for adventure watches. Gross and operating margins were 67% and 44%, respectively,
resulting in 40% operating income growth. The segment benefited from increased consumer interest in
outdoor activities.

inReach is an important technology that provides critical emergency and communication services in places
where cell phones simply don't work. We recently added inReach to our popular Montana series, and
we announced that inReach has facilitated over 5,000 SOS incidents since its launch in 2011. This is a
significant milestone, reflecting the important role inReach technology can play in changing outcomes.

Looking forward, we expect the broader trends in outdoor to continue. We plan to leverage this
opportunity by offering unique products that maximize the enjoyment of outdoor activity and adventure.

Turning next to the auto segment. Revenue decreased 6% as the decline in consumer P&D was partially
offset by growth in specialty categories and revenue from new OEM programs. Gross and operating
margins were 45% and 3%, respectively. The Auto segment continues to transform as we launch new
specialty products, like the Garmin Catalyst, an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize
track racing performance. New OEM projects are also making contributions and will further diversify the
revenue mix in the segment.

During the quarter, we began production shipments of the MGU 2020 computing module, marking the
beginning of our relationship with BMW automobiles as a Tier 1 supplier. In addition, we began shipments
of the complete infotainment solution for the Daimler Vito van.

Looking forward, we will continue to pursue growth opportunities in specialty product categories. In
addition, we will be making major investments to complete OEM projects we have won in recent years,
and we will continue to pursue new opportunities as a Tier 1 supplier of innovative electronic solutions for
a broad range of vehicles.

Looking finally at the aviation segment, revenue decreased 19% due to lower revenue from OEM product
categories and the expected decline of the ADS-B market. Gross and operating margins were 71% and
19%, respectively. While the OEM market has experienced some headwinds, we see positive signs in the
smaller aircraft segment, especially in owner flown aircraft. In addition, when adjusting for the impact of

GARMIN LTD. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

ADS-B, we see encouraging sign lines in the retrofit market as aircraft owners take advantage of the latest
cockpit technologies.

During the quarter, Autoland achieved FAA certification on the Cirrus Vision Jet, which is the first jet
aircraft to incorporate Autoland technology. This latest certification brings the Autoland equipped aircraft
to 3 models, including the previously certified Piper M600 and the Daher TBM 940.

Autoland is receiving notable recognition as an important new safety technology for general aviation. And
Aviation Week Network recently selected Autoland as the Grand Laureate Winner for its achievement in the
category of business aviation.

Looking forward, we believe that the general aviation market will stabilize as impacts from the pandemic,
the associated economic fallout, and the ADS-B mandate began to fade. We will continue to invest in
compelling new products and technology in anticipation of the next chapter of growth for the general
aviation market.

In summary, I'm very proud of what Garmin associates have accomplished so far in 2020, while facing
circumstances that no one could have anticipated just 1 year ago. Considering our growing confidence
and business trends, we are issuing full year 2020 guidance. We now project revenue of approximately
$4 billion as growth in marine, fitness and outdoor more than offset the expected declines in aviation
and auto. We anticipate gross margin of approximately 59% and operating margin of approximately
24%, assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 10%, pro forma earnings per share are expected to be
approximately $4.70.

Looking at full year 2020 revenue guidance by segment. We expect the marine segment to grow 25%, the
fitness segment to grow 20% and the outdoor segment to grow 15%. We expect the aviation segment to
decline 17% and the auto segment to decline 20%.

So that concludes my remarks this morning. Next, Doug will discuss additional details on our financial
results. Doug?

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Treasurer

Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, move
comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted record revenue over $1.1
billion for the third quarter, representing 19% growth year-over-year. Gross margin was 60.2%, a 15 basis
point decrease from the prior year.

Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 31.6%, 110 basis point decrease from the prior year.

Operating income was $317 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 28.6%, 60
basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1.63 and pro forma EPS was $1.58, a 24%
increase from the prior year period.

Next, we look at our third quarter revenue by segment. We achieved revenue of over $1.1 billion with 3 of
our 5 segments posting growth of 30% or more, led by the marine segment with robust revenue growth of
54%. By geography, we achieved 19% growth in Americas, EMEA and APAC.

Looking at our year-to-date revenue for the first 3 quarters of 2020. Our consolidated revenue is up 7%
with the prior year with 3 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth, led by the fitness segment, a
25% growth, followed closely by marine segment with 24% growth.

Looking next, operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $45 million or
15%. Research and development increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in
engineering resources. Our advertising expense increased by approximately $1 million due to higher spend
in our outdoor segment. SG&A increased $17 million compared to prior year quarter, primarily due to
increases in information technology costs and personnel-related expenses.

GARMIN LTD. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Let me highlight on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash
and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable increased
sequentially to $658 million, an increase year-over-year in line with third quarter sales. Inventory balance
increased on both a sequential yearly basis compared for the seasonally strong fourth quarter, split on
increasingly diversified product lines.

During the third quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $236 million, a $78 million increase from
the prior year quarter. For full year 2020, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $750 million,
approximately $175 million of capital expenditures. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $170
million.

During third quarter 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 6.9% compared to the effective tax
rate of 11.6% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to intellectual property migration
transaction. We expect our full year 2020 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 10%.
This concludes our formal remarks. So Al, could you please open the line for Q&A?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Chung with JPMorgan.

Paul Chung
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. So just on fitness, on Tacx, you've had this asset for more than a year now.
Can you give us a sense of how much incremental growth you have driven by kind of leveraging your
distribution network? And then assume that pandemic has accelerated sales in that business, if you could
confirm any sense for the outperformance there? And then I have a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Paul, I think Tacx has been a wonderful acquisition for us, definitely leveraging the Garmin network
is helping us. Tacx did not have a strong presence in the North American market. So we're able to expand
that now. And of course, Asia is another opportunity. They were mostly strong in Europe before we bought
them.

Paul Chung
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then on Firstbeat, how do we size up this business, assuming the margins are quite high given
the license model. Is it a meaningful contributor? Or is it kind of more of an added feature you'll roll across
more of your smart watches?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's a contributor. And as you say, it's high margins because it's licensing business. But for us, we
look at it as an important technology provider for our products. And being able to support the existing
wellness and fitness features as well as developing new advanced metrics that we can have in our smart
watch and cycling products.

Paul Chung
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then lastly, it's not very common for you to have kind of uniform year-on-year growth across all
the regions. But any trends across the regions that stand out during the quarter, what you're seeing early
in Q4?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would make a couple of notes there. I think that it is kind of interesting to see 19% across the
board. In the Americas, that growth would have been even stronger if you adjust for the impact of the
ADS-B surge last year. So Americas is even stronger than what we're showing there in terms of the other
consumer products.

And in Asia, I would say that they have been slower to come back from the COVID-19 impact, but we do
see signs of stabilization, and each country is different, but we do see positive signs in some of the major
countries as they emerge out of crisis mode.

Our next question comes from Charlie Anderson with Colliers Securities.

GARMIN LTD. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Charles Lowell Anderson
Colliers Securities LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a really strong quarter. It was great to hear, Cliff, that there's some stabilizing trends in
aviation. So I wonder if you could maybe expand on that a little bit. I know you serve many portions of
that market in terms of size and platforms. I'm also sort of curious, looking within the various categories
in aviation, where do you see stabilization versus what's still impacted in a large way by the pandemic?
And then I've got a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, as I mentioned in the remarks, the OEM categories reflecting owner flown aircraft are doing
reasonably well in this environment, and we've seen encouraging signs there. On the retrofit side of
things, as I mentioned, if we eliminate the impact from ADS-B, we see positive signs in retrofit, it's
particularly driven around new display systems and autopilot systems for existing aircraft on the market.
So I think the technologies are super. The safety technologies that come in the retrofit market with our
autopilot system and our display systems is something that people recognize as great value. And we see a
lot of strength there.

Charles Lowell Anderson
Colliers Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then for my follow-up, I'm curious on automotive, we're going to now go through this
transition where OEM essentially becomes a larger portion of the revenue now that BMW has begun. I
wonder if you could speak to the margin profile of that segment from a go-forward basis? It looks like
we're not going to make much money in that segment this year, but I'm sort of curious, as that layers in,
how that impacts margins going forward?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Definitely, the margin on the OEM categories is lower than the trends on the consumer side,
especially as we see the consumer side transition to more specialty products, which are also higher
margins. So we'll see that mix of revenues impact the OEM segment. And as I mentioned in my remarks,
we're still investing heavily to bring these programs to market.

We've brought the BMW -- the first BMW program to fruition, which we're a build-to-print supplier,
second source basically for that module, which is designed by another party. On the other program that
we've won, we're the lead design partner with BMW on that and others are build-to-print for us. And so
consequently, we're investing heavily in bringing that technology to market.

Operator

And our next question comes from Will Power with Baird.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I guess a couple of questions. Maybe just to kind of follow-up on the previous auto question. Just trying
to, I guess, wondering if you could help us think about the cadence of additional OEM projects behind
BMW and what that could mean in terms of turning the quarter on, getting that to breakeven and maybe
positive growth. And what's kind of the outlook or timing of that transition and improving the growth
outlook there?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

We do have additional projects that are underway, which we can't really talk about the specifics, the one
that's -- the major one, of course, is the BMW project that we announced about a year ago. In terms of

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

GARMIN LTD. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

revenue performance in this environment as we bring new projects online, definitely, we've said before
that 2020 and into 2021 is going to be an inflection point for revenue growth as these new programs start
to contribute.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Maybe just to switch gears to outdoors, continues to be strong performance. Any further color there
as to the key drivers? I suspect the fenix line continues to be probably the lead driver there. But any color
on other key contributors there in the quarter?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would say that fenix and Instinct are both very strong product lines for us. We launched new
versions of those products with solar charging technology, which is a unique differentiator for Garmin.
And those products were very popular in the quarter as we sold into the channel, and they're starting
to sell-through now. But we do see strength across other categories, basically everything that involves
adventure and outdoor activity, especially golf. Golf is very strong as well. And we felt very good about the
performance of our categories in the quarter.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Actually, maybe if I could sneak in one for Doug, just on thinking about taxes and the potential
change in administrations next week. Any early thoughts as to how a potential change can impact tax
strategy and how you look at your plans on that front?

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Treasurer

Yes. We do not provide any extra or any additional guidance beside the current year for any effective tax
rates. There's a lot of moving parts that go into that tax rate. Obviously, the statutory rates, the income
by jurisdiction reduction set. So we'll kind of wait to see how it all plays out.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

Cliff, could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a product availability perspective across
categories? It seems like some may have been short in the quarter. Could you talk to maybe fitness or
marine or outdoor, if you're seeing any tightness in delivering products? And then if you're seeing any raw
material shortages associated with those builds? And then I have a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So product availability has been fairly tight. The demand has been strong, and we did make
adjustments coming out of the significant drop in activity associated with Q2 when all of the lockdowns
took place. And since that time, we've been working hard to ramp back up to the levels needed to fill
demand. I think we're doing okay. But the backlogs are very strong for us right now. So we're working
hard to fill those.

In terms of raw materials, we've mostly been okay. I would say there's a few shortages here and there.
And especially as our forecast change to the upside, we have to deal with that situation within lead times
from our suppliers that we've had very good cooperation. We've been able to mostly get everything that
we need. We rely on our safety stock, of course, in our business. So we do have inventories of things that

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

GARMIN LTD. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

we can continue to build products. And our vertical integration model is something that allows us to be
flexible in what we build and when.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. And then the other question is, as it relates to your partners, it seemed like early on with COVID,
a lot of the retailers did the same thing. They drew down working capital and inventory. And now they're
trying to replenish going into the holidays. Do you have any thoughts on where finished goods inventory is
with partners and how do you think that could be playing into your overall visibility as you look forward?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Many partners are experiencing the same things that we are, so the increased demand and, even though
they're taking more products, they also are selling out very quickly as well. So we believe the channel
inventory on most of the consumer categories is not high. In fact, it's very lean. And in a lot of cases, we
find customers looking for our products. So again, we're working hard with our partners to fill the demand
and to help customers find what they want.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

I just wanted to look at the implied fourth quarter guidance. I think the implications for sales is to be up
sequentially. But I think if I look at the implied EPS for the [ fourth ] quarter, that's down more than 15%
quarter-over-quarter. I know typically you have a sequential decline in fitness margins in the [ fourth ]
quarter due to promotions, which is okay. But I guess the sequential decline, it seems a little bit on the
EPS side, it's a little bit more than usual. I guess, can you talk about any additional puts and takes?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

I think Q4 is different than Q3 as we look at the promotions that are going to go on over the holiday
season as well as the product mix and the segment mix. So there's a lot of different factors that go into
play there. We'll also be doing more advertising sequentially. So these are all factors that come into play
there with our guide.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay, Cliff. And then on the aviation segment, I think you spoke about signs of stabilization, which is
encouraging. At the same time, I think if I look at the guidance for 17% decline for the year, I think that
implies an acceleration in year-over-year declines, where the comp from a year-over-year perspective was
-- is easier from last year. I just wonder if there is anything in particular that affects the December quarter
order?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that has a very simple explanation. Q4 of 2019 was a huge quarter with ADS-B in the surge and
equipage that was going on. And so that's a headwind that will quickly fade as we move past Q4.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. And last question for me. I just want to make sure, the major investments that you talked about
in OEM, there's nothing new incremental there, it's just that you guys are -- have to keep up with the

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.

11

GARMIN LTD. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

ramp-up. I don't know, is there any way you can size up the -- how much of net investments you guys are
putting into those programs?

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Treasurer

Yes. So yes, basically, as Cliff mentioned, we are continuing to invest in our OEM businesses, primarily
the R&D investments as we get closer to production. Also in the CapEx, we have increased year-over-year
CapEx relating to manufacturing facility we have in Europe there.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. Just a quick follow-up. On Tacx, I think -- I believe you guys were expecting new capacity to come
online here in the second half of this year. I just wonder if you can give us an update on that if it's ready
to go and you guys are going to be able to supply product into the December quarter?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The new Tacx facility is operating. We're starting to do some production functions there as well as
distribution of the products out of that facility. And now in Q4, we should be ramping up our physical
production lines on the various products to be able to manufacture them in the new facility. So we're very
pleased with that, and we believe that's going to be a big incremental adder to filling the Tacx backlog that
we have.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on another great quarter. And congratulations on this cadence of new products that you've
been able to continue during this difficult time. So now in April, on your Q1 call, you had said that you
were seeing strong demand for marine and no better way to social distance than be in the middle of a lake
on a boat. And it seems you have brought out a lot of new products that provide ancillary participation
in marine, including fishing and diving. Did you have these products like already in the pipeline? Or were
you able to kind of pivot toward meeting that demand and that ability to do that has driven your great
success? So your adaptability, did you have these new products planned? Or did you kind of develop them
as you saw this need growing earlier this year?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think really, we focus on long-term road maps and the products that we introduced yesterday,
for instance, in the marine market were products that we've been planning throughout the COVID cycle
since before it was a known thing. We didn't waver from the investment we were making in our product
road maps. I think that's the key thing, and we were able to maintain our product release schedules,
even in the face of significant challenges that we've had like every company with working from home
and distancing in the workplace. So I'm super proud of what our team has accomplished. I'm actually
amazed sometimes at what they've been able to do. And I think our products are a testament to their
determination to be successful in the face of this pandemic.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Absolutely. And then the pandemic, this whole stay at home, at home, play at home and gaming has
been a huge thing since the pandemic and then you brilliantly come out with an e-sports watch. So I
like the way that you are taking advantage of or adapting to the environment. You mentioned the indoor

cycling. What is your plan there to expand your presence in the super hot indoor cycling and indoor fitness
market?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, our response from the customers on Tacx has been very strong. We have a lot of backlog for those
products, and we're working hard to fill those, especially as we look towards the winter season as people
are going to be in more. So the Tacx facility, the new production facility, is a big part of our plan to take
advantage of that and expanding our distribution, especially in the Americas and Asia for those products.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Then what other areas, you say, more specialty auto products like the Catalyst, what other types of
products do you have kind of in vision coming out?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, we have other categories in the works. I can't share details on those, but we have a creative team
that are active participants in lifestyles. And so I anticipate we're going to see more new categories in the
future in auto targeting the specialty categories.

Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the fantastic results. I just want to get your kind of high-level thoughts here. And just how
do you think about your end markets now from the perspective of, are we seeing TAM expansion? Are we
seeing a pull forward of demand from potentially 2021 into the summer months? And just based on your
answer there, kind of what gives you the confidence in your answer?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think each market probably has a different story. As we mentioned in marine, we're seeing what
you would probably call TAM expansion as new customers come into the market. In fitness and outdoor,
it's a strong demand for people that want to be healthier and to engage in fitness and outdoor activities.
So again, those could possibly be described as TAM expansion. There's also market share gains that are
factors in those things as well.

We don't see anything that's happening right now as we pull forward into '21. The demand is strong
throughout the back end of this year, and we anticipate through the discussions with our partners that
2021 will also have similar trends based on the behavior of people during the pandemic.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Awesome. And then I guess, how can I -- how should we think about the strength in the consumer, the
fitness and outdoor segments, in terms of ASP versus unit-driven or maybe, asked a different way, did
you -- maybe can you comment on the mix shift that you're seeing either to higher-priced devices versus
lower-priced devices?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think there's a combination of things going on there. There's definitely ASP increases as we launch
new products like the fenix solar line and the Instinct Solar line. But there's also unit growth as well as we

look at our advanced wellness products in fitness, for example. So it's a combination of things. And the
customer base that we're targeting, I think, are those that appreciate the value and the capability of the
products that we offer.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That's super helpful. And then I just wonder if I could just squeeze it in here. I realize your marine
business has been remarkably steady basically throughout all 4 seasons. I looked -- I count one down
quarter in the last 30 quarters. But can you just help us kind of understand from a high level, how do the
drivers of the marine business change during, for example, the winter months versus the summer months,
if at all?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Marine is historically very seasonal. So in normal times, we would expect that the market would slow
down in Q3, late Q3 especially and into Q4 and then ramp up again when the New Year arrives. This is
anything but an ordinary year, and so we saw boating activity continuing to take place throughout Q3 and
demand for our products was very strong. Not just in the sell-in sense, but also in the sell-through sense
at our retailers.

So it's an extraordinary year as people take advantage of time on the water. And as we look at Q4, the
retailer enthusiasm around marine products and the plans that they have for promotions are very strong.
And so we should also see a very strong Q4 for marine, unlike we've seen in past years as well.

Manager of Investor Relations

disconnect.
