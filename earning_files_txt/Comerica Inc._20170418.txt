Turning to Slide 5, mortgage banker loans decreased $102 million due to weather slowdown in home sales and lower refi volumes
Our loan – our portfolio volume was approximately 77% purchased versus refi compared to the industry average of 39%
As expected, mortgage banker balances began to rebound this quarter and are expected to continue to grow for the spring summer home buying season
We had a reduction of $289 million in Energy loans
As anticipated, balances have continued to decrease as customers deleverage through asset sales and capital raises
We expect the pace of reduction in loan balances to slow up as energy prices have stabilized and the rig count has increased
Also, we started seeing a few excellent relationship opportunities with E&P companies that have performed well for the downturn and have been conservatively underwritten
Our auto Dealer Floor Plan portfolio increased $144 million as dealers continue to build inventory in preparation for the pickup in spring sales
Growth for the total loan book began to return in late February
And average loans for March were better
This resulted in period-end loans above the average for the quarter
As of March 31, commitments decreased to $51.3 billion, and average line utilization was stable at 51%
We've had a broad-based increase in our loan pipeline, and our commitments to commit grew 44% to $1.2 billion
Overall, customer sentiment is positive, reflective of the improving economy and anticipated changes coming out of Washington
Yet, we remain cautious
Our loan yield increased 21 basis points, primarily due to a 22 basis point increase in average 30- day LIBOR
Reflecting typical seasonality, deposits declined $1.9 billion relative to the fourth quarter, including a $1.6 billion decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits, as you can see on Slide 3. Period-end deposits of $58.9 billion were well above the average, indicating a positive trend
Also, deposits have grown over $1 billion relative to the first quarter last year, with noninterest bearing increasing $2.4 billion
Noninterest-bearing deposits now represent 53% of our mix
Our relationship-oriented deposit base had helped us keep our deposit costs low at 14 basis points
We continue to prudently manage pricing and have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the recent increases in short-term rates
We are closely monitoring our deposit base, as well as the market, and believe we are well positioned
We continue to maintain the size of our securities book, as shown on Slide 7. The total yield on the portfolio increased one basis point as we actively manage the portfolio
Recently, we have been able to invest prepays at a slightly higher rate than they are running on
For example, we have seen MBS yields in the 2.40s, with only modestly longer duration and extension risk than the portfolio average
The recent rise in mortgage rates has not had a significant impact on the pace of prepayments, and the estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3.5 years
And the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to four years
Finally, the portfolio is in a relatively small unrealized net loss position of $43 million
Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income increased $15 million, while the net interest margin increased 21 basis points
Our loan portfolio added $9 billion and 17 basis points to the margin
The increase in interest rates provided a $23 million benefit, which was partially offset by two less days in the quarter and lower loan balances
In addition, we've had a lease residual adjustment of $2 million in the fourth quarter that was not repeated
Balances at the Fed contributed $3 million and three basis points to the margin
The increase in the Fed funds rate added $4 million and was partly offset by the $1 billion decrease in average balances
Wholesale funding costs decreased $2 million as the increase in 6-month LIBOR was more than offset by the benefit from sub-debt that was repaid in mid-November
Finally, deposit costs declined $1 million due to the reduction in CD balances
Our overall credit picture remains strong, as outlined on Slide 9. Total criticized loans declined over $200 million and are now about 5.5% of total loans at quarter-end
This includes a $61 million decrease in nonaccrual loans, which now represent only 1.1% of our total loans
Net charge-offs were $23 million or 28 basis points, which is below our normal historical range
Reflecting the continued strong credit quality and improving energy credit metrics, our allowance for credit losses declined by $17 million, while the allowance-to-loan ratio remained relatively stable at 1.47%
Of note, our assessments of the recent Shared National Credit exam is reflected in this quarter's metrics
Energy loans at quarter-end were about $2 billion and now represent 4% of our total loans
E&P loans make up about 70% of our portfolio
Spring redeterminations are approximately 12% complete and have resulted in modest increases in borrowing basis
Many of our customers have increased reserves through acquisitions, improved production and new drilling at all slightly higher prices
As criticized and nonaccrual Energy loans continue to decline and charge-offs remain manageable, the reserve currently allocated for Energy loans is now about 7% of energy outstandings
Slide 10 outlines non-interest income, which increased $4 million or 2%, and was up 11% to the first quarter of last year
We had strong treasury management deposit service charges, driven by the early success of our GEAR Up initiatives, as well as receipt of annual fees
In addition, stronger market conditions resulted in increases in investment banking and fiduciary income
This was partially offset by a decline in card fees, primarily due to the seasonally lower volume and timing of pay periods for our government card programs
Changes in non-paid categories essentially offset each other
Expenses declined $4 million, as shown on Slide 11. Salaries and benefits increased $14 million, primarily due to annual stock compensation and higher payroll taxes
In addition, the gain on the early termination of certain leveraged lease transactions that we realized in the fourth quarter was not repeated
This was more than offset by declines in most other expense categories, including a $9 million decrease in restructuring charges and a favorable litigation-related settlement of $2 million
We also had a typical seasonal decline in advertising cost
Overall, expenses remain well controlled and the realization of our GEAR Up initiatives continue to be evident
Moving to Slide 12. In line with our 2016 capital plan, we again increased our stock buyback with $105 million of repurchases in the first quarter under our equity repurchase program
Through the buyback, together with the dividend, we returned $147 million to the shareholders
As a result of our higher stock price, there was significant exercise activity at stock options and warrants
This activity, combined with the first quarter employee stock awards, added 4.1 million shares during the quarter
Also, these issuances, and along with a higher stock price, resulted in our average and our period-end diluted share count increasing to 180 million shares
We submitted our CCAR plan for the 2017-2018 cycle earlier this month and expect to receive the results in mid-June
With our strong capital ratios and increased profitability, we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way
Turning to Slide 13. Our asset-sensitive balance sheet positions us well to continue to benefit from increases in rates
Over 90% of our loans are floating rate
Therefore, as rates move, our loan portfolio reprices quickly
In our outlook for 2017, we previously indicated that we had expected the December rate rise would contribute $70 million, assuming a 25% beta
Given that we have been able to manage our deposit pricing, we are updating this outlook and now expect $85 million in additional net interest income over a 12-month period
And with the further 25 basis point increase in rates last month and assuming our deposit rates has moved with the 25% beta, which has yet to materialize, we should gain about $70 million more in net interest income over a 12-month period or over $50 million for 2017. We currently estimate that the next 25 basis point increase could provide an additional $40 million to $85 million in annualized net interest income
The outcome depends on a variety of factors, including deposit betas, balance sheet movements such as deposits declining as companies use the cash in their businesses
Additional scenarios, other key variables and a list of assumptions are in the appendix
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph
That’s been question that is often posed
Remember, we’re really in uncharted water here
We’ve been in these very low rates for a very long period of time
There is substantial liquidity in the system
Once that liquidity begins to be utilized through economic expansion, then I suspect, at that point, we’ll begin to see those betas begin to actually move
As I said numerous times, we’ll continue to say we’re not looking to be the leader in repricing
We’ll certainly be competitive
We’ve always been competitive
And quite frankly, that’s just the way we’re going to follow it
I’m certainly not aware of competition pulling that away from a pricing perspective
We do typically see declines in the first quarter
I think it is important to note that this quarter actually was a $1 billion improvement over where it was a year ago
Now remember, a year ago, we actually intentionally encouraged some deposits to exit because of the lack of capability, if you will, in terms of how they’re treated under the LCR calculations
We did not have that repeat here this particular quarter
Yes, that could have temporarily park some very substantial balances at the end of the year and they tell us in advance, but those will be with us for a week, 2 weeks and they’re going to move them out, and that’s very typical of what we see in December
And then in early January, those ones move up
Thank you
Quite frankly, I hope that loan growth isn’t that stronger than deposit growth
We are sitting on, as you well know, a considerable amount of excess liquidity
Deposits are so difficult to predict because, again, we tend to see large movements with some of these very large corporate customers
But on balance, I assume as the economy continues to grow, you’re going to begin to see in the industry an amount of that excess liquidity begin to be deployed into the businesses
I think it’s reasonable to assume, Dave, that if the economy continues to grow, if – and those funds do get deployed, that, yes, you could see some drop in those deposit levels
Hopefully, in our case, we see that also move into loan growth as well
But obviously, time will tell
But I think it’s reasonable to assume that, at some point, we’re going to start to see those deposit levels begin to decline
We haven’t disclosed our specific percentage, but let me simply say, I’m not concerned about that at this time
As Ralph just said, if you didn’t hear him, if you see on one of the slides there, we indicate our loan-to-deposit ratio is at 82% here a moment
We have a variety of options depending on the need and what we see in terms of loan growth, what type of loan growth, et cetera, will drive how we make that determination
I think that’s reasonable
Thank you
Good morning, Ken
I wouldn’t disagree with that
We’re trying to provide a conservative outlook
Thank you
Good morning, Bob
You might want to comment just overall your feeling of how strong the portfolio is today
I don't have that number in front of me at this time
Actually, you're seeing things even on the criticized side and non-accrual side that are acting very favorably for the future
Brett, the challenge there is, to be quite frank, we can't really predict stock option exercises
The best thing, that typically occurs in the first quarter, so we wouldn't expect anything through the balance of the year in terms of vesting of awards
It would strictly be a result of option activity, which is totally driven by stock price and employee or formal employees, retirees desire to process a few transactions
Well, first of all, I'm highly confident that we will complete the remainder of that CCAR plan, that remaining $139 million at this point
Share count, obviously, that buyback absolutely will be impacted somewhat by the stock price
And then, again, in terms of actual shares outstanding, it's hard to predict how activity could impact that
It's fully baked into the dilutive number today, although, again, that's impacted by share price
Thanks
