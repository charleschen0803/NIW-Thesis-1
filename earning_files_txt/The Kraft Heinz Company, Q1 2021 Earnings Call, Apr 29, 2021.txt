THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to The Kraft Heinz Company first quarter
results conference call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor
Relations for The Kraft Heinz Company. Please go ahead, sir.

Christopher M. Jakubik
Head of Global Investor Relations

Thank you and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations at Kraft Heinz
Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our first quarter 2021 business update.

As you know, during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on
how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed
in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures
today during the call, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for
and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations
within our earnings release.

Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for a few quick opening remarks.
Miguel?

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

Well, thank you, Chris. I just wanted to start our discussion today with a few overall thoughts. First,
that we have had a very, very encouraging start of the year, both top line and bottom line, with our
strongest growth in priority platforms and markets, especially in underdeveloped countries with a very
strong result. We had -- we were able to hold household penetration gains even as markets begin to open
and effectively managing inflation and supply constraints. We are also very encouraged by our progress
with initiatives to accelerate our advantage in different areas, like in marketing, being more agile and
more creative in retail and foodservice joint business plans, in unlocking capacity in Grow and Energize
platforms; and also on bringing efficiencies, gross efficiency gains, that we continue tracking to be about
$400 million in the year.

That said, we feel that it's still too early to change our outlook for the full year. We still expect 2021
financials to be ahead of our strategic plan. And we are expecting mid-single-digit growth in Q2 2021
versus the same period in '19. At the same time, we should see stronger but manageable inflation
beginning in Q2. Finally, we are pleased with additional financial flexibility that we are building. We will
continue to aggressively reduce debt, and our divestitures are on track to further increase flexibility.
I will now hand it back to the operator, and we can start the Q&A.

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Miguel, I know that organic sales growth guidance in -- for 2Q is a bit better than what consensus was
expecting. But it does represent a notable sequential deceleration versus 2019. And I'm trying to get
a sense of, is this -- I assume this is primarily just, a, 1Q was quite a bit stronger than you probably
thought. And maybe you're also trying to be thinking through and being prudent about what further sort
of reopening and mobility means for sales trends going forward. And then I was hoping maybe Rafa could
comment even briefly on just how he sees the durability of the emerging market strength that we saw in
the quarter.

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

Andrew, thank you for the question. Now keep in mind that in the second quarter, we are going to have
a different mix. Foodservice will be stronger. And for sure, with opening of the market because of COVID
fading, the mix will change. And so that is one of the reasons.

The second reason, also let's remember McCafé that was in the numbers of '19 and that is not in the
numbers of '21, and that has a strong impact. I don't know if, Paulo, you want to complement that
question before passing to Rafael.

Paulo Luiz Araujo Basilio
Global Chief Financial Officer

Miguel, I think you highlight the right point. And we are calling down versus prior year a low single-
digit growth. And the impact of McCafé is always 1.1 percentage points. So it's not that dramatic of a
deceleration. Although, as you're saying, that we are seeing the reopening of the developed markets and
there is some mix impacts that we're going to feel in the quarter. But that said, yes, first quarter was a
very strong quarter, as you mentioned, in terms of net sales when compared with '19. Rafael, please?

Rafael de Oliveira
Zone President of International

Yes. Andrew, thanks for the question. I mean for us, emerging markets consumption has held up relatively
well during the pandemic. And I would say 2 key reasons. One is availability in our customer servicing
across international has been quite consistent during and -- during the whole pandemic.

But also like the focus, right? The second is the focus. We remain very focused on our emerging market
strategy, I mean, centered around Taste Elevation platform, right, and combined with localized, the proven
go-to-market expansion model. And this has been performing quite well.

There are 2 factors that -- these 2 factors helped us during the pandemic, right? And you can see on the
results, it added 1 point of share. We've been gaining share also during the last 3 quarters in a row. So we
do expect this momentum to continue as we move throughout the year and based on the strong initiatives
that we discussed during CAGNY.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

I was wondering if you look at your U.S. retail mix as maybe more exposed than some of your peers
to kids going back to school. You have Mac & Cheese there, you have Kraft Singles, Oscar Mayer lunch
meats. And that's a lot of, I guess, parents making lunches for their kids when they're at home. When
they're going back to full-time schooling, do you think that these brands will face more-than-normal
headwinds? Or does it somehow kind of -- is it -- does it make up for itself somewhere along the way?

Carlos A. Abrams-Rivera
U.S. Zone President

Well, first of all, thank you for the question. Listen, we feel good about controlling the controllables. I
mean -- and if you think about the gains we have made in household penetration, those are coming
from younger, more diverse families. And we're seeing that those families are actually increasing the
consumption across different dayparts. And that's happening, whether it's Mac & Cheese, whether that's
Oscar Mayer hotdogs, very consistent.

Plus, even if you think about brands that typically -- case use is school, like lunchables, we're actually
also seeing gains on those even over the last 6 months. So what I will say is our focus on continuing to
retain those new households regardless of their circumstances is working, and it will be the things that
we'll continue to do moving forward.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Securities, Research Division

I've got 2 questions related to inflation. The first one, I think the guidance is for mid-single-digit cost
inflation. And I just wanted to get an understanding there of -- is that gross inflation? Or is that net of
cost savings? And if not, just if you can give us the -- a breakdown between the gross inflation versus net
inflation.

Paulo Luiz Araujo Basilio
Global Chief Financial Officer

Bryan, thanks for the question. So the guidance that we provided in mid-single-digit is gross. So it's a
percentage of our total COGS as gross inflation, okay? Actually, we are seeing that we would be in our --
currently more in the low end of the mid-single-digit range. And that's our view.

And what -- when we see this happening today, as we mentioned before, we also saw, as many peers, the
escalation of this inflation since our last call. But when we add, as you mentioned, our cost efficiencies
that we highlighted around, that we're still seeing like $400 million in efficiencies in the -- our supply
chain. And all the levers that we have for revenue management, we believe that the final number will be
manageable for the company.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then if I could follow up, Rafa, just in -- for you, just in terms of inflation, could you just give
us a little bit of perspective on what tools you have available, especially in developing markets, but also
in Europe in terms of managing inflation? So is it different, I guess, in terms of the way that you'll work
through inflation in your markets than what we'll see in North America?

Rafael de Oliveira
Zone President of International

Yes. Bryan, yes, look, so let me break down the 2. In emerging markets, I mean, in general, acceptance
of pricing is better, right, because inflations are more normal on the local economies. In developed
markets, I mean, what I can tell you is we've already successfully closed negotiations with all our key

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

retail partners, and especially in key countries like France, Germany. And we managed to achieve the
pricing and premiumization behind the brands that we needed. So we feel quite confident about that.

I mean in terms of comparison, you said comparing to the U.S., I mean, there are similar and differences,
right? Like similar to North America, the costs have moved against us in ingredients, in packaging, but
different than North America overall. Logistics is not a major contribution to inflation internationally. So in
terms of numbers, this is what -- in line with what Paulo said, comparable to mid-single-digit range for the
total.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Miguel, I just had a general question kind of around your innovation plans, marketing plans kind of vis-à-
vis SKU rationalization, right? So as we've heard for over a year, right, there's been a lot of optimization
to the retailers to kind of focus on those core SKUs, right, and to just essentially maximize the benefits of
velocity and scale, which you also speak to all the time. So I'm just curious, as you kind of look forward
kind of around that creative development of the innovation, are there sizable pieces of the portfolio that
you kind of foresee rationalizing such that those tails come off, new innovation comes in, but still focused
on the core on those high-velocity items?

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

Let me answer your question and ask Carlos to complement my thoughts. We see this as a great -- we
have seen and we -- this is a great opportunity for us to -- exactly to focus on SKUs with higher rotation
and, also from a supply standpoint, to improve efficiencies in our factories and also on cost. So we see
this move as very positive. Carlos, do you want to comment more precisely in terms of numbers of what's
going on in the U.S.?

Carlos A. Abrams-Rivera
U.S. Zone President

Sure, Miguel. What I would say is a lot of -- we have done [indiscernible]. So if you go -- as we go into
this year, we have reduced probably 20% of our SKUs versus what we had in '19. And I think this has
been done [ through cooperation ] with our retail partners. So we're building together a kind of level
of trust and transparency to make sure that we impact focus on our core that drive better velocity and
actually allows us to have -- to better service with our customers. So overall, I feel good about where we
are and the progress we have made in this area.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Can you hear me okay?

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Perfect. So I wanted to ask about the promotional path from here. You talked, I think, in the prepared
remarks about pulling back on promotions in January and February during Q1. Does that mean that we're

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

likely to see a more elevated level of promotion year-on-year given the pullback that happened last year?
And what does that mean for net pricing over the next couple of quarters? And I'll pass it on.

Carlos A. Abrams-Rivera
U.S. Zone President

I can start. Let me at least give you a perspective too, first of all, about the overall view of how we're
thinking about our pricing and how that fits in terms of our promotions. All I can tell you is I feel good
about our ability to pass through our cost inflation and -- as we see it and when we need to do it.

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

We lost Carlos.

Christopher M. Jakubik
Head of Global Investor Relations

Yes. Yes. Well, so let me just pick up on that. I think Carlos froze out a little bit, Alexia, so -- [ but we're ]
going to come back. But I think where Carlos was going is in terms of the -- what we're seeing going on in
the marketplace and what we see unfolding is in Q1, we were able to sort of build further on 20 -- sorry,
Carlos, why don't you go ahead? You just froze out at the start there.

Carlos A. Abrams-Rivera
U.S. Zone President

Sorry. My apologies. Hopefully, you can hear me okay now.

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Sounds great.

Carlos A. Abrams-Rivera
U.S. Zone President

Okay. Listen, this is the new world that we're still working through, so I appreciate the people's patience.

What I was getting at [ is ] within the countries of our pricing that we're looking at, do know that in the --
if you think about our quarters, 7 of the last 8 quarters, we actually were able to actually drive pricing as
a positive contribution to our net sales. So we are seeing that our iconic brands are actually showing the
pricing power.

Now when you look at going forward, we will return to supporting key promotional windows. And if you
think about coming up Memorial Day, we're also going to be making sure that we show up in those
moments. At the same time, we will implement the revenue management initiatives to drive share growth
and improve their returns.

And if I step back and I try to summarize kind of how we're thinking through this, the way I think of it is a
3-pronged approach: one, making sure we continue to renovate our portfolio to drive better value for our
consumers; that we improve the creative content of our marketing; and that we strengthen and diversify
our media impressions.

So all said, I feel good about our ability to deal with the inflation that we have and making sure we do this
in a way that it's positive for the company.

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

To put a finer point on Alexia's question, do you expect pricing net of everything to be positive in the U.S.
in the back half of the year?

Paulo Luiz Araujo Basilio
Global Chief Financial Officer

Jason, listen, as a matter of practice, we do not forecast pricing. But as we -- and again, we are seeing
that we're going to have -- we're going to be up in the second half against some unusual comparisons in
the back half. But as Carlos mentioned, we see a lot of levers for us to manage inflation through revenue
management, through savings. So -- and that's -- we're feeling very good about where we -- how to
manage our profitability that's coming from this inflation impact.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe to help us get a little more comfort on that, let's flip to the cost side. I know you said sort of low
end to mid-singles, plus $400 million of cost saves. I mean that's a -- like a 2% sort of net inflation, I
think. You tell me if I'm wrong on that. But what does the cadence look like as we go through the year?
Because I'm guessing given the move of some of these costs, your exit rate in the back half of this year is
going to be substantially above that. And if I'm off base on that, please correct me.

Paulo Luiz Araujo Basilio
Global Chief Financial Officer

Listen, we have a ramp-up of gross inflation as the year progresses, but we also have a ramp-up of
our sales initiatives going on as the year progresses. And on top of that, we would have our -- also our
revenue management initiatives. So again, I'm not going to give exactly quarterly number levels here, but
that's how you should think about the progression of our base -- our cost base.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'm going to start beating on the debt inflation horse here. I know we're talking about it a lot, but I just
wanted to get a sense of how locked in you are on your raw materials for the rest of the year. I guess
putting another -- putting it another way, is it fair to assume, unless there's some big spikes in items that
are harder to buy ahead, mid-single-digit inflation is fairly safe to build in? I'm just trying to think, if items
like cheese and meat and coffee rise a bit higher, these are items that historically Kraft has locked in many
months in advance at times. So I just wanted to get a sense of the risk, either up or down, to that -- the
guidance of mid-single-digit inflation.

Paulo Luiz Araujo Basilio
Global Chief Financial Officer

Ken, this varies. And again, we have -- specifically in our big 4 -- our key big 4 commodities for the full
year, we are seeing just slight inflation, okay? We are going to have our heaviest comp in Q2 that we're
going to be lapping a very low price in cheese last year and a high price of pork bellies this year. But
overall, in terms of the big 4, we are seeing a slight inflation.

In terms of how we manage and hedge this, it varies by type of areas. So there are some commodities
that we go longer, beyond 6 months, 9 months. There are others that are shorter, but this varies a lot. But
what I can tell is overall, when we see the scenarios, of course, there is a lot of volatility in this market.

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

But overall, when we see where the commodities are today, the range of mid-single digit is what we're
seeing. And again, as I said, we are seeing us overall, as a percent of COGS, in the low end of this range.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Very quick follow-up. What are your experts telling you about how valid some of these prices we're seeing
for corn and soybeans and meat are given supply and demand? I guess I'm asking, is there a little bit of
froth created by traders in the market right now?

Paulo Luiz Araujo Basilio
Global Chief Financial Officer

I wouldn't like to enter in this type of forecast. We had more focus on to be sure that we manage our
cost for different levels of pricing if we provide to our business the specific hedging profile that allow the
[ bids ] to plan itself.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.

Laurent Daniel Grandet
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So 2 questions. One on Canada. So Canada is definitely improving. So could you please give us a bit more
color about what's going on there and how sustainable the growth and the rebound is it -- it is for the next
few months and quarters?

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

Well, let me answer that question. I think you're absolutely right. Canada is definitely improving, had a
very good quarter. I think that we did a much better job in terms of promotional calendar for Canada that
last year, we started with big promotions and that the ROI was not exactly great. And we are being much
more disciplined on our promotions, and that's what it reflects. So there was a big increase in margin from
16% last year to about 22% this year.

But it's not only on margin that Canada is improving. I'm very satisfied with the way that we are evolving
on innovation pipeline, with marketing and creativity and digital marketing. I think we are having a very
different Canada than we had just 1.5 years ago.

Laurent Daniel Grandet
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And maybe a broader question on your strategic plan. So compared to your strategic plan you laid out
last year, and now we are 6, 8 months within the implementation of that plan. So could you maybe tell us
what you think? You've been very successful in implementing and you are ahead of what you expected.
And maybe some space or some strategic initiatives where you think you are still behind and why.

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

I would say that overall, we are very excited with our transformation plan. And it's deep and it's in all
areas. We're all evolving. And after 1 year, I would say that we are going in a much more accelerated
rate than we could imagine, and especially in a year that we are doing all this through Zoom meetings,
working from home. So it surprised us, the velocity, the agility that we are having in all areas, from supply
to marketing, to finance, to all areas of the company.

But this is a journey. Using an analogy of baseball, I would say that we finished the first inning. We are
now going to the second inning, but there's still a big game ahead of us to play. But we are excited about
the possibility to the evolution.

The next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And maybe to build on that last question a bit. I think it's been a little while since we spoke in detail about
employee engagement and morale at Kraft Heinz, and to some extent, also about retailer engagement.
Although, Miguel, you did speak to helping improve customer satisfaction in the prepared remarks. I guess
as you step back and think about the journey over the past year and the progress made since 2019, can
you update us on how you perceive your current standing against those teams today and how that feeds
into your outlook as you go forward into '21 and beyond?

Miguel Patricio
Chief Executive Officer

Sure. I will comment on our employee engagement. I will ask Carlos to talk about customer satisfaction
engagement, specifically in the U.S. We have great progress on that part as well.

I would say that, among everything, all things that we have been doing, the employee engagement is the
-- is where we have the biggest shift with our people much more engaged. And when I say this, this is, of
course, through quantitative research, but also qualitatively. So our team is much more engaged, working
in a much more cooperative way.

We've been eliminating silos that we had in the company. And this year of pandemic was -- we were
already organized in a different way, and we had to be much, much faster in that way.

So I would say that the morale is much higher. We have a much more engaged team. They understand
the strategy we have had, and they are excited about the journey that they are leaving. That being said,
again, we still have room for improvement, and we'll continue working in that sense. Carlos, maybe you
can comment on the customer side.

Carlos A. Abrams-Rivera
U.S. Zone President

Sure, Miguel. Thank you. And I can testify to what Miguel is saying, that we are seeing that across the
entire company, the level of engagement, the way that the teams are working with an agile mindset in all
that we do.

Related to our customers, what I can tell you is we are now in a much different place than we were a
year ago. We have now been able to build trust with our key retailers. We are working in a [ partnership ]
that includes a level of transparency that we hadn't seen in the past. And in fact, our retailers are also
-- partners are recognizing that. So I think that now when we hear from them directly that it feels like a
new Kraft Heinz, we take that with pride because it's -- because of the work that we have now and the
collaborations we now are doing with them in a way that we hadn't done in the past. So something for us
to continue to build on, but thanks for the question.

Operator

And at this time, I would currently like to turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Jakubik.

Larkin and myself will be available to take them. And for the media, Michael Mullen will be available for
