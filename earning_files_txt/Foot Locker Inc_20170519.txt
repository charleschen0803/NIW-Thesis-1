Thank you, John and good morning, to all of you
Thank you for joining this morning
Let me start by saying we’re certainly not satisfied with our results this quarter, even though it was still a highly profitable quarter, one of our company’s best ever
Despite the unprecedented challenges we experienced early in the quarter
Our goal is to continually raise the earnings bar higher and we did not quite succeed in achieving that in the first quarter
Lauren and I will get into the details of the pluses and minuses in the period but I do want to emphasize that we remain confident in our strong position in the athletic retail industry
We have been diligently executing our strategic initiatives which I’ll remind you are, to drive performance in our core business, to expand our leading position in Kids, pursue European expansion opportunities, to improve our apparel business, build a more powerful digital business, to deliver exceptional growth in women's, and to build on our industry leading team
We’ve have made significant progress on each of these initiatives and I want to thank our outstanding team of associates who have made that progress possible
In fact, it is because of the exceptional efforts of what I believe is the best team in retail that our banners are positioned at the center of a very vibrant sneaker culture
That said, our customers are moving faster than ever before, thanks primarily to the fact that young people today are digital native
They change their shopping and buying habits quickly, they adopt and discard social media platforms in a heartbeat
The people who influence their preferences can change rapidly
And as a result of all of this, they see and adapt new athletic footwear and apparel styles more quickly than ever
We believe that the progress we have made in our initiatives and the tremendous opportunities still ahead of us to seize have enabled us to weather the recent slowdown in the business and staying at the center of sneaker culture
We will drive improvements in our results as the year progresses
In a moment I’ll give you an overview of why we believe that, but first let me level set the first quarter and our outlook for the coming quarters in 2017. John mentioned that our comparable sales finished Q1 up 0.5%
It was a bit of a roller coaster ride, as we noted in our pre-announcement last month comparable sales in February historically one of the biggest months of the year for us were down low teens
March rebounded to be up high single digits
April also lined up with a very high single digit increase
Although we have been expecting April to finish up low double digits, the last couple of weeks of the quarter were strong, but not quite as strong as we anticipated
This caused us to produce earnings of a $1.36 per share at the low-end of our revised outlook
Sales have been trending a bit lower than we had planned over the last few weeks
We are now forecasting the second quarter comparable sales will be up low single-digits with earnings relatively flat compared to a year ago
While we remain optimistic that we can accelerate our momentum over the second half of 2017 to reach mid-single digit comparable sales gains, we are developing a plan B so to speak, if these recent sales trends continue
That Plan B is primarily focused on controlling the expenses and inventory so we can deliver the mid single-digit EPS increase for the full year excluding the 53rd week that we mentioned in our pre-announcement, even if top-line growth is more modest than we originally planned
Let me now give you just a few examples of the opportunities we have for each of the initiatives I outlined in the beginning of my remarks
Together these give us the optimism that our momentum will accelerate over the rest of the year
First, our core mail banners, Foot Locker North America and Australia, Champs Sports and Action continued to operate at a very high level of productivity
We are maintaining our efforts to further elevate our customers engagement with these banners with investments in our physical stores including the addition of high profile stores this year in Toronto, Chicago, Los Angeles, Sydney and Melbourne
We will also continue our successful remodel programs in each of these standards
On the technology side, we will roll out a next generation point-of-sale system later this year which will improve the customer experience in all of our stores, that’s just our pinnacle properties
While U.S
store traffic was down in the quarter, the drop was entirely driven by February which we believe was heavily influenced by the delayed tax refunds
Traffic in the remainder of the quarter improved and we expect traffic which has been positive most of last year to normalize over the balance of the year
In terms of our second initiative, we have a strong leadership position and the market for our aesthetically [ph] inspired footwear and apparel for kids
Remember these kids are moving faster than ever and the first quarter was especially challenging for children, in part because the vendors don’t make some of today’s most popular styles in kid sizes
In any case, we did not have sufficient quantities of some of the hot lifestyle run-in products that our adult customers have been snapping up
That issue paired with a still soft signature basketball business which has been a relative important component of our Kids sales in the recent years meant that the Kids business faced an uphill battle in the first quarter
Fortunately, as we move to the rest of the year the Kids exposure to signature basketball will lessen and we expect lifestyle product quantities to improve
We have targeted our buyers over the remainder of the year at the best available styles from Audi, Nike and Puma
We also continue to see opportunities to expand the footprint of Kids Foot Locker across all of our markets
We have 33 new stores slated for this year with 20 in North America and 13 in overseas markets which will enable us to build out our already strong position in Kids
European expansion is our next growth pillar while comparable sales of our Foot Locker stores in Europe were down low single digits in the quarter, total store sales were up slightly given the addition of 26 net new locations compared to a year ago
Given recent macro events in Europe, traffic there was uneven cross our major markets and down in the quarter overall
We consistently find that our customers in Europe are quite resilient and so we believe the traffic there will gradually rebound
Just as in North America, we are continuing to invest in elevating our customer experience in Europe with pinnacle new stores coming to Rome and Turkey [ph] later this year
While we are also planning close to 100 other new stores in remodel projects
Comparable store sales were down mid single-digits at Runners Point and Sidestep store, certainly not acceptable, but an improvement from their previous run-rate
We believe we have cycled through them most difficult prefix and the segmentation strategy that we’ve started a couple of years ago
With new leadership in place there and with ongoing investments to improve our understanding of the customers and most importantly stronger product offerings, we believe that Runners Point and Sidestep in return to top growth as we progress through the year
Meanwhile our Internet business in Europe continues to grow rapidly
Digital sales were up strong double-digits for Foot Locker and Runners Point in the quarter and even higher for the Sidestep, off a smaller base
In fact, Foot Locker Europe did comp positive overall when combining digital and store results
We expect the momentum in Europe's digital business to continue throughout 2017. Apparel, our next growth initiative had a solid quarter, whereas in 2016 we made progress on profitability, but still lost penetration relative to footwear this quarter we saw faster growth in the apparel than footwear
At the same time, profit margins increased again
Champs Sports, which had the highest apparel penetration continued to perform well
In addition to a strong brand of business Champs has really led the way in demonstrating that we can design the latest trends into our private label products, so, at or close to price and enhance our overall apparel margin
Couple of other balance made notable progress too, one example is Kids Foot Locker, where apparel sales posted a high single-digit comp gain with improved margins
In fact, each banner has apparel strategies to enhance our vendor partnerships, improve speed to market and share best practices
We are also continuing to enhance the use of our own team addition apparel printing capabilities which helps get popular new designs into our stores more quickly and optimize our private label opportunity
We intend to use all of these building blocks to improve apparel results even further over the rest of the year
In terms of building our digital business, we are making progress on the number of fronts
A key investment we have been making is in the new e-commerce platform in order management system which I'm pleased to report has now gone live to one of our smallest online banners
We are monitoring performance while continuing testing and development for our other larger banners with a thoughtful rollout scheduled over the rest of this year and into 2018. This new platform is expected to significantly enhance our online conversions by increasing page load speed, improving product displays and suggested add-on purchases, optimizing video content and connecting ever more seamlessly with our other customer [indiscernible]
Although, we’ve had Boss and Moore's technology for some time now, we are still fine tuning how to best leverage our inventory to enhance our customers experience, while we will always want to satisfied a customer by being able to ship them the product they want from wherever in our system it resides, an even better scenario for us is to have them come to a store to pick up their merchandize, where we can then engage with them, augment their experience with our brands and potentially add to their original purchase
Overall having the latest systems capabilities will facilitate our more fundamental evolution into an organization which truly does not think in terms of separate channels
As we know full well that our customers naturally think of our brands as inclusive of all channels
This enhanced stability to focus on all elements of our brands will align better with the perspective of our customers and we believe drives stronger financial performance over the coming quarters and year
Finally, our women's business had another strong quarter with the SIX:02 being only store banner that's posted double digit comparable sales gain
With the two relatively new non-comp flagship stores in New York city, total sales at SIX:02 were actually up more than 50%
We're planning to open another flagship location in Los Angeles is Q4 also within a key Foot Locker store
SIX:02's biggest stores is actually our digital site, six02.com
We intend to focus the brands development the rest of this year by leading with digital
We plan to bring even stronger merchandizing to the site and build a sustainable and more diversified bash in creditability for SIX:02. Meanwhile, our women's business and our other banners continues to provide steady growth aided by we believe by the enhanced focus we have on the female muses of each of our core banners
She has an ever-broader array of influences on her fashion choices than our male counterparts and our banners are important destinations for her athletically inspired footwear choices
On top of all of these initiatives is her most critical element of our success compelling product stories and assortments from our vendor partners like Nike, Adidas and Puma in particular are producing exciting innovation with coveted new products still selling out quickly
Although there are as always also some styles that are on or approaching the download side of their lifecycle
Compared to the first quarter, we believe that products flow will strengthen in the second quarter even more so as we get into back to school
VaporMax is a perfect example of really great innovative new program from Nike
After a small introduction in Q1, the number of SKUs in units we'll have available will increase significantly during the current quarter and in the back half of the year
Similarly, we'll have some of the Audi product with boost [ph] material notably Nomads and Ultraboost, more reiteration and in better [indiscernible] the combination of all of these great products and strategic initiatives that gives us confidence that we can drive gradually improving topline and less bottom-line performance over the balance of the year
Let me now turn the call over to Lauren to give you the usual details of the quarter after which we’ll be happy to answer your questions
We stop giving the quarter to date information a few quarters ago
And clearly, we’ve given what we believe will happen in the second quarter and its all built into our forecast and we’ve talked about in terms of low single-digits
Let me be clear, it was not brands that are on the end of their lifecycle it was specific styles that are on their end of their lifecycle
If you go back a year Erinn, every -- assuming every teenage female potentially in the world needed to have a pair of Adidas Superstar or Stan Smiths, while we’re still selling a lot of Superstars and Stan Smiths that basic trend has changed a little bit, or that request -- require footwear for that teenage girl has shifted
So, we managed through style changes all of the time, but it's one of those things that, there was such a rabid sense of, got to have that product last year, it hasn’t quite been replace with something that’s got that same sort of velocity, but we managed few of those up cycles and down cycles all the time
So to be clear, it's not brands, it was referenced to specific styles
I think it’s a -- the cycle being slowing down certainly, right and the Superstars and Stan Smiths have been around a long time and they have the ways that they come through and that’s a great example that certainly they are available at places, but our consumer, our core consumer moves very quickly and we still are selling a lot of Superstars and Stan Smiths, it's not just basic black and white or white and black --
So, when we expect the tax sequence and to say the same going forward, right depending on what happens with any sort of tax reform, I don’t imagine that the path is going to change and the reasons that they slowed down are the reasons to try to fight broad [ph], et cetera
The All-Star game continues to be a relevant moment in our customers journey each year, next year the All-Star game is in Los Angeles, which again we have a lot investment that we’re making in LA
So what we have built with our great vendor partners, February and to be the hottest month even as I noted its one of our largest, biggest retail months and we’ve been fortunate in the past to have sort of the perfect storm with tax miss, the All-Star game, great silhouettes being available, Valentine’s Day, all sort of coming together
So we’ll certainly have to adjust our thinking as we look at Q1 making sure that we get the flow right because that perfect storm of things coming together is not likely to replicate itself
But it doesn’t necessarily mean that any of our strategies are wrong as it relates to the first quarter, we just have to think through the timing
There is a lot of -- thanks Tom for the question
There is a lot of great stuff coming on from Adidas you know and certainly Superstars and Stan Smiths are in one part of the lifecycle, but when you look at things like Tubular Shadow and Nomads and EQT, you know lot of Ultraboost products, lot of Pureboost, we’ve got AlphaBounce we’ve got [indiscernible] and you know there is a lot of things coming from Adidas as well
So the fact that Superstars and Stan Smiths are part of their downward part of the lifecycle potentially
All of these other things are continuing to fuel the great brand heat that Adidas has done
Even some excitement around the James Hardin basketball shoes, so again there is a lot of good things on that side of the equation
Certainly, VaporMax from Nike is an exciting new innovation
We expect it to continue to resonate of our consumer and obviously it launched in Q1, but we expect more SKUs and styles and quantities available as we go forward
There is some of the old standby’s that are still bringing heat as well
we’ve got the Huarache, we’ve got the Special Forces that is AirForace One, the Paul George basketball shoe, Kyrie Irving's basketball shoe are all doing great
We see upside with the LeBron shoe just based on a little bit of shift in timing from last year
To Narrow which is a Foot Locker exclusive with Nike is resonating not just in Europe or in Australia were its sort of been a foundational part of their business, but its starting to get some traction back in the U.S
So a lot of great heat from both of those brands
Matt, I remain firmly a believer of that it's not a cycle, right
We are living in a world that is capsulized, sneakers are a part, a very important part of our consumers wardrobe, they accessorize with it, sometimes they are the statement effort
So, again I think we have some shifts in Q1, obviously the tax shift being one that certainly impacts our customer in their desire to purchase sneakers when they've got that cash
I know there has been some proof that people don’t necessarily believe that
But, there is a direct correlation to tax checks hitting and sneaker sale
The shift of Easter, the later shift of Easter, which again we saw traffic increases in March and April combined as we looked at the Easter shift, but that shift is still impacting us
You know the Assentation Day holiday in Europe is next week and there is a whole bunch of school breaks which are generally good for sales for us as well
So again, it’s not really -- there is not comp to comp sort of comparison
We’ve talked about a little bit about the signature basketball, especially in Kids and you know I’m not as focused on categories
You know it’s about the coolest sneakers and then right now a lot of the sneakers heat happens to be coming out of running silhouettes
But we’re also seeing some heat from some companies like Vans, they're old school and skate highs
So our consumer is migration to what they see as the coolest shoe and they do that fairly effectively and our buyers are moving with them and trying to stay half a step ahead of them as we pivot through the product assortment
Our position Michael has not changed, right
We’re selling premium sneakers, the consumers are coming into to our stores, looking for premium sneakers that they can’t find elsewhere
So we marked down product as appropriate to manage the lifecycle of products
But you know I feel like we leave business on the table every single day, but I think we maximize the amount of business that we take off the table
So where there is always a customer that we didn’t get to, there is always a size that we didn’t have and they didn’t want to wait
I don’t, our promotional cadence is set by our managing our inventory, our appealing to our customers desires and I think the way that we see it, we’re going to remain that premium destination
And I don’t expect that our guys in the operating divisions are going to go start chasing discounters in the mall, because that’s not who our customers are frankly
We’ll continue to use the online business as a way to expose more of our product to more eyeballs
So, again the comment that Lauren made was, its been a bit more promotional in the first quarter to ensure that our inventories stay fresh and we’ll continue to use that as an offensive weapon to do that
That’s a great question, Rob
I mean, I think when you look at some of the people that are feeling various pressures, I expect some of the apparel side of the business continues to be growing promotional
I expect less promotional -- a less promotional cadence in our specific category and our specific area of expertise
Premium sneakers are not going to be highly discounted, I don’t believe and our apparel teams are very conscious of what those on in the marketplace
But again our apparel is premium apparel, when you think about technically some of the things that motivate our customers
So, our customer is not coming to us looking for discounts
And while we promote as appropriate, we certainly don’t see ourselves being more promotional in the back to school season
Well, the boost product is not being taken down to kids in most silhouettes
So, the answer would be, it will not be
But there are other great silhouettes in running that are going to become more readily available in the Kids, in the back to school season
We talked about the signature basketball specifically in Kids, the pressure lessening in that product going into the back half of the year
So, if there are still going to be pressure on, but we certainly have less exposure in the back half, as we think about signature basketball in Kids
It’s just a little bit of a lag Paul and I mean the product that I talked about earlier in my -- to somebody’s question
We see an increased flow of product, both from an innovation point of view
But more importantly for us, from a style and desk point of view, right
VaporMax was the example that I used
Certainly a great launch, initial launch in Q1, but nobody does it better than Nike in terms of controlling the quantities in the marketplace and making sure they’ve got production capabilities, et cetera to support it
So we see the style and units in several key programs going up in the back half and obviously the consumer, we believe will respond to that
So we remain very confident and it’s, the consumer hasn’t gone elsewhere and this segment continues to be very hot
If you look at the people that are influencing things in this category
Kanye West with his Easy product
We expect that to continue to be incredibly hot going into the back half and we expect our quantities to go up
So again it’s about the pipeline that we see not just from renovation, but from depth across those innovative and really high demands styles that we see
So it’s the sauce that we get to make and our buyers have done a great job of pivoting to the right places and now giving the quantities behind them in the end of Q2 and going into Q3 and Q4 is critical and we believe we’re well positioned to do that
I think Lauren was pretty clear, the expense initiatives are in place and it will continue to be exercised to ensure that we can get towards that double-digit earnings growth that we talked about in the pre-announcement in earlier today
I mean we understand that it’s always easier when the top line is flowing more rapidly
But I also believe that our organization is talented enough and we understand all of the levers that can be pulled that we’re confident that we’ll be able to control expenses even if sales continue to be a bit softer
Thanks Paul
