Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated
This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter
The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release
As Mike mentioned, overall we were very pleased with our fiscal first quarter performance
Revenue, operating margin, EPS and CFFO all came in above our expectations
As noted on our last quarter's earnings call, we faced a very difficult compare in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the renewal of a large transaction with a system integrator in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This was particularly evident in all of our bookings-related metrics, including new sales, in the quarter
Renewal portfolio size and duration heavily influence booking metrics, given the opportunity renewals provide to generate new product sales
Q1 total new sales were down in the mid-20s, and organic new sales were down in the mid-30s
Excluding the impact of the large SI, total new sales were up approximately 10%, and organic new sales were down in the high-single digits
Total organic new sales, excluding the large SI, were impacted by the lighter renewal portfolio compared to the year-ago period and commensurate lower mainframe capacity
The total renewal portfolio was down in the high-50s compared to the year-ago period
As we have stated on our prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions
As Mike mentioned, even excluding the large SI, the size of the renewal portfolio was lower by approximately 30% as reported and high-20s in constant currency
Our renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-90s percent range
Organic new sales declined year-over-year across all regions due to the lighter renewal portfolio in the quarter, compounded by the large SI renewal in the year-ago period
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales were down in the mid-50s
Mainframe new sales were negatively impacted by the size of the renewal portfolio and related capacity sales in the period
Nevertheless, we are very pleased with the ongoing strength of our organically-developed mainframe products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence, both of which contributed to Mainframe new product sales in the quarter
Enterprise Solutions new sales were down in the low-single digits and organically were down in the low-20s
Excluding the impact from the large SI, organic Enterprise Solutions new sales were up slightly in the quarter, in spite of the lighter renewal portfolio
We believe this dynamic demonstrates the recent improvements we've made, both from a product and go-to-market perspective, are beginning to materialize
As Mike mentioned, the recent acquisitions of Automic and Veracode performed very well in the quarter and exceeded our expectations
We are very pleased by the rate and pace of both product and operational integrations, and are enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for both acquisitions
Total revenue for the first quarter was $1.025 billion, up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency
Acquisitions contributed approximately 6 points to total revenue growth in the quarter
From a segment perspective, Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 12%, both as reported and in constant currency
Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency, in line with our longer-term expectation for the overall mainframe market
Services revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency
As our solutions have become easier to install, deploy and manage, by design, our service revenue has been impacted
That said, we believe the rate of decline in services revenue will begin to abate in the second half of the year
Total revenue backlog was up 2%, while current revenue backlog improved 6%, both as reported and in constant currency
Around 4% of the current backlog increase can be attributed to the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode
The remaining 2% was driven by organic factors, including the size of the renewal portfolio coming due in the next 12 months
As we've said on prior earnings calls, we expect that current revenue backlog will grow with more consistency after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth, while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield
Q1 GAAP operating margin was 26% and non-GAAP operating margin was 37%
Segment operating margin in the quarter was 65% for Mainframe Solutions, 8% for Enterprise Solutions, and 1% for services
In the quarter, Enterprise Solutions margins were impacted by acquisition-related factors
Mainframe margins came in above our longer-term target
This reflects company-wide efforts to decrease corporate-level expenses that result in generally improved margins across all segments, as well as the revenue mix shift and associated expenses to the Enterprise Solutions segment
Our Q1 GAAP tax rate was 25% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 28%
Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42, down 11% as reported and down 4% in constant currency
Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61, down 5% as reported and down 3% in constant currency
Our Q1 CFFO was $298 million, up 54% as reported and up 52% in constant currency
The improvement in CFFO is primarily attributable to single-installment cash payments, which were $194 million in the quarter and up meaningfully over the prior year
We ended the quarter with approximately $44 million in net cash
We paid $107 million in dividends in the quarter
We did not execute any share repurchases in the quarter
As such, we have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization
We continue to expect that we will, at least, offset dilution with our share repurchase program
With regard to ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard that we intend to adopt in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, you will see in our 10-Q filing tomorrow that we currently plan to use the modified retrospective transition method
Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, we are simultaneously considering ways in which to improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business
Now, turning to guidance
Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2017. No additional material acquisitions are assumed in our guidance
Given the continued momentum and outperformance of most key metrics relative to our expectations in the first quarter, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the full year
For the full year, we now expect total revenue to increase by approximately 4%, both as reported and in constant currency
This translates to reported revenue of $4.20 billion to $4.23 billion, and compares to our previous guidance of up 2% to 3% as reported, and up 3% to 4% in constant currency
In terms of revenue linearity throughout the year, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in constant currency will be between 3% and 4% in the first half of the fiscal year, with the second half of the year averaging constant currency between 4% and 5%
We expect our full-year GAAP operating margin to be between 26% and 27%, and our non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36% and 37%
We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%
We expect our GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease 8% to 5%, both as reported and in constant currency
This translates to GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.76, and compares to our previous guidance of down 10% to 7% as reported and down 8% to 6% in constant currency
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be down 2% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency
This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.48, and compares to our previous guidance of down 5% to 3% as reported and down 4% to 2% in constant currency
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares
Cash flow from operations is expected to be up 1% to 5% as reported, and flat to up 4% in constant currency
This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion, and compares to our previous guidance of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency
With that, we'll open it up for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Hey, Michael
So, overall, just to recap for you, our total revenue actually had a contribution of 6 points from the acquisitions, revenue in aggregate
ES revenue actually had 14 points of growth from the acquisitions
Our revenue backlog was up 6 points, of which 4 points of that was actually attributable to the acquisitions
And our billing backlog â€“ or bookings, rather, total actually had 2 points of contribution from the acquisitions as well
Yes, that's right
Current
