Great, thanks
And thanks for your patience, taking all the questions
We've talked a lot about different fund share classes and advisory business, but we haven't really talked too much about the SMA business, which is clearly in a lot of your U.S
distribution outlets a sizeable and growing business
So, and maybe some of your strategies like Global Bond and Franklin Income don't translate as well
But can you talk a little bit about your presence in the SMA business, and do you feel that you have the right product suite there? Is that a place you're putting more emphasis on incremental growth? Just trying to get a better feel for your positioning there
And, I mean, just within your franchise, I mean is that a $20 billion asset business, $30 billion, $10 billion? I'm just trying to get a sense of how meaningful it is a contributor to kind of your sales and flows
And
Thanks
And maybe just as a follow-up
I'm just curious for your perspective, I mean one of your peers or competitors has filed for kind of, I won't call it a new pricing scheme, fulcrum fees has been around
But, clearly, have taken a view that something has to change with mutual fund pricing dynamics
So, just kind of interested in your â€“ just in general your thoughts around some of those initiatives you've seen a competitor take and if you think there's much merit to it or just kind of your perspective?
All right
Great
I appreciate the color
