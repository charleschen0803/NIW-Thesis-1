ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second Quarter 2021
Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Bill Abler, Vice President, Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.

William Abler
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We will begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman
and CEO, Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh, our CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate
everyone who has questions, we request that each person ask no more than 1 question and 1 follow-up.

In today's call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ
materially from these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, which are set forth in our
earnings release, our slide presentation and our SEC filings. Entergy does not assume any obligation to
update these forward-looking statements.

Management will also discuss non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP
measures are included in today's press release and slide presentation, both of which can be found on the
Investor Relations section of our website. And now I will turn the call over to Leo.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report another solid quarter. Our adjusted
earnings were $1.34 per share, including a negative impact from milder-than-normal weather. The
underlying utility performance was strong, and our team successfully executed on multiple deliverables
across the business.

Our execution not only this year but over the last several years has resulted in strong growth and lower
risk. This, in turn, has provided us more financial flexibility, which was most recently recognized by
Moody's.

The result is enhanced ability to manage risk and lower equity needs to fund our growth. The bottom line
is, we are on track to deliver on our commitments, including our financial results. We have a clear line of
sight to achieving our 2021 guidance as well as our longer-term financial outlooks and with added financial
flexibility from our lower business risk profile, we expect to be in the top half of those ranges.

Our 3-year $12 billion capital plan is the foundation. It is designed to deliver important benefits to our
customers and will result in 5% to 7% adjusted EPS and dividend growth. Our capital investments will
improve customer outcomes along several dimensions including reliability, resiliency, affordability and
sustainability. Our plan also supports our expectation of at least 5,000 megawatts of renewables by 2030
delivering on our environmental stewardship commitments.

There is a great deal of certainty around the execution of our plan as more than 90% of our investments
today are tied to enhancing technology across our system to improve reliability and resiliency. 90% of our
investments will be recovered through efficient and timely regulatory mechanisms such as FRPs and riders
and 90% of these investments are ready for execution from a regulatory standpoint.

Additionally, we were able to manage our costs to provide certainty to our stakeholders through both our
flex spending program and continuous improvement. These initiatives allow us to manage our customers'

bills and keep them affordable while also providing steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends
for our owners.

We have consistently maintained rates among the lowest in the country, and we have achieved 7%
compound annual growth in adjusted EPS for 2016 to 2020. Our accomplishments so far this year keep us
firmly on the path to meet our objectives. One important objective is increasing our renewable and clean
energy resources. To that end, Entergy Texas began the process to seek approval to construct the Orange
County Advanced Power Station, a large-scale hydrogen capable facility that represents a significant
milestone in our strategy to provide clean energy that also supports reliability.

We received approval from the Arkansas Commission for the Walnut Bend Solar project. We will own this
100-megawatt facility, which is expected to be placed in service in 2022. It will provide clean energy
for our customers in Arkansas and possibly provide capacity under a green tariff. We recently filed
our proposed green promise tariff in Arkansas to allow for the sale of designated renewable energy to
interested customers.

Many customers have expressed interest in such an offer. And in fact, customers had input into the
development of the proposal. We have received signed nonbinding letters of interest from 20 customers,
including Walmart, a global technology company, a major retail pharmacy company, nearly a dozen
hospitals or hospital networks and Arkansas University and a number of large manufacturing customers.

Our customers are telling us what they want, and we're listening. We're working to bring them offerings
such as green promise to help them achieve their sustainability goals. We also continue to make progress
on our annual FRPs, which provide for timely recovery of investments that benefit customers. Entergy
Mississippi's FRP was approved and the full rates are in effect. And we submitted our annual filings in 3
jurisdictions: Arkansas, Louisiana and New Orleans. Many of you are interested in our strong recovery
filing, they remain on track. Legislation to support off-balance sheet securitization past in Louisiana and
Texas, and we expect to receive proceeds by mid 2022. In fact, Entergy Louisiana filed its request for
securitization this past Friday.

As I've mentioned before, building greater resiliency into our system is an ongoing focus. Some of
our resiliency improvements have been occurring as normal course of business as we replace aging
transmission and distribution infrastructure with assets designed, the latest standards and able to handle
higher wind loading or flood levels.

At times, these resiliency improvements are accelerated likely we build back better after a major storm.
However, we won't wait for another storm to continue to strengthen our system. We're conducting a
review of our critical infrastructure, and we are developing long-term plans to continue this progress on
the path to greater resiliency.

Customer affordability continues to be a cornerstone of our plan. We're starting at a great place and
looking ahead, even after accounting for storm recovery, we will still expect our rates to be well below the
national average. And the annual growth rate for average bills from 2021 to 2024 is slightly above 2%.

Bottom line, so we have a solid plan with significant certainty and a strong growth outlook. We
consistently execute on our key deliverables that underlie our commitments. We have a proven track
record of delivering on those commitments.

We're confident that we will be successful, but we're not stopping there. We aspire to do even better. Over
the last several years, we've been highlighting the opportunity we see in customer solutions. We've begun
to commercialize some of those solutions such as power through, our backup generator solution and shore
power, the electrification of ships while imports.

We're also developing other products to further electrification of industrial processes to accelerate the
development of EV infrastructure. We're expanding our product and service offerings to help our C&I
customers meet their sustainability objectives.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

We are actively working to reduce our carbon emissions, and that will help all of our customers reduce
their Scope 2 emissions. To further support our customers' aggressive decarbonization goals, we will
leverage green tariffs to provide carbon-free resources to further reduce their Scope 2 emissions.

As you all know, Entergy has a large industrial base with about 40% of our demand coming from industrial
customers. Some have viewed this as a risk, but we disagree. We see continued opportunity in this sector
and here's why. Our industrial customers are efficient, diverse producers with infrastructure and labor
competitive advantages. Our Gulf Coast refineries produce a wide variety of feedstocks and finished
products highly integrated into the value chain.

This is not going away. Even as products like cars evolve toward more sustainable options, the
components of these products will still be needed. For example, cars and trucks will still have tires, frames
and dashboards, all things created from feedstocks produced by Entergy's industrial customers.

Additionally, in a carbon-constrained world, we see opportunity for additional growth in demand from our
industrial customers. We talked about green tariffs as 1 way to help them meet sustainability goals, but
that only addresses Scope 2 emissions that come from their power purchases. The lion's share of our
industrial carbon emissions come from Scope 1 emissions from fossil fuels that they use on site.

Again, we're developing ways to help customers reduce their Scope 1 emissions through electrification,
including electrification with green options. Substantial opportunity exists for us to help them electrify
processes such as compression for LNG or product pipelines. Cogeneration, replacing a fossil fuel process
with an electric alternative and processed to convert on-site boilers to electric heating.

And as our customers adopt carbon capture utilization and storage, we can provide green energy to
maximize the benefit of that technology. As we've discussed, Entergy's geographic positioning in the heart
of hydrogen producers, pipeline, storage and consumers represents another unique opportunity. We have
the ability to help our hydrogen customers, both producers and consumers convert to carbon-friendly
hydrogen alternatives. The bottom line is that we believe our large industrial base gives Entergy a unique
advantage and growth opportunity in a rapidly decarbonizing world.

Turning our efforts -- to our efforts around hydrogen which we see as a clinical part of a clean energy
future. We are working with Mitsubishi Power to advance technologies and expertise in hydrogen for the
benefit of our customers. Part of our collaboration involves the hydrogen capable Orange County Advanced
Power Station, which I mentioned earlier.

We're also continuing our work on Montgomery County Innovation Center, a 25-megawatt electrolysis
facility to demonstrate green and clean hydrogen production capabilities.

Finally, we recently participated in the DOE's Hydrogen Energy Earthshots initiative. Our goal is to
secure federal funding to help jump-start hydrogen demonstration projects in our region in a matter that
mitigates impacts on our customers' bills. We expect to see a request for proposal notice from the DOE
later this year or early next year.

At Entergy, we have a solid strategy to achieve our objectives. We are an industry leader in sustainability.
We have one of the cleanest large-scale generation fleets in the countries and we're working to make it
even cleaner.

We have a robust capital plan to meet our customers' evolving needs. Our low rates position us well. We're
committed to continuous improvement for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have a clear line of sight
to 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth, and we have a unique advantage with our customer base to
provide sustainability solutions that could result in sales growth.

Even with our excellent positioning today, our goal is to do more. These are exciting times, and we're
working to create a very bright future for our company. I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will
review our financial results for the quarter as well as our outlook.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting results for another solid quarter. As you
can see on Slide 5, we have experienced robust sales as we recovered from the impact of COVID-19. We
continue to execute on our key deliverables. We're well on our way to achieving our goals for the year,
and we are affirming our strong guidance and longer-term outlooks while pointing to the upper end of the
range for each.

Turning to Slide 6. You'll see the primary drivers for earnings in the quarter were straightforward. We
continue to see the effects of our investments to improve customer outcomes, including rate changes to
recover those investments. We also saw effects of the COVID-19 recovery. Sales were higher than last
year despite negative weather in the quarter.

Our industrial sales improved 7.1% year-over-year, driven by economic recovery and growth. Our
industrial customers are now running at levels exceeding 2019. Commercial sales also are continuing to
recover as businesses reopen and residential sales are beginning to taper as workers go back to their
offices.

On Slide 7, you'll see a little more detail on key sector indicators for our industrial customers. These 4
sectors collectively represent nearly half of our industrial sales. As you can see, the economic indicators
are healthy and at or near multiyear high points. Inventories are back in alignment, commodity spreads
have improved and volumes and margins are doing better across the board.

Overall, our industrial base has rebounded nicely from the challenges of 2020. We are fortunate to have a
resilient and competitively advantaged industrial base. Turning back to the earnings drivers. Our spending
increased as we return to more normal business conditions. This increase is expected as we significantly
reduced costs last year to offset the effects of COVID-19.

The spending includes increased scope of work at our generating plants, including outages deferred from
the past year. We also have incremental spending for new plants in service and in our focus areas of
reliability and improving the customer experience.

Our O&M expectation for the full year remains $2.7 billion, and we will continue to utilize our flexible
spending tools to achieve steady predictable results.

Moving to EWC on Slide 8, you'll see the results were lower than the prior year. The key driver was the
sale of Indian Point to Holtec. The sale resulted in a pretax charge of $340 million, driven primarily by the
nuclear decommissioning trust exceeding the decommissioning liability.

The sale of Indian Point is a significant accomplishment and an important milestone in our exit of EWC and
1 which further improves our business risk profile, the impact of which I will address shortly.

Operating cash flow for the quarter is shown on Slide 9. The quarter's result is slightly higher than last
year's operating cash flow returns to more normal levels. This change is due primarily to improved
collections from customers, which are offset by a few items.

Fuel prices increased compared to last year, and we saw a negative cash flow impact from the timing of
fuel and purchase power cost recovery. Severance and retention payments were higher at EWC relating to
the closure and sale of Indian Point. And we also had some remaining payments for noncapital 2020 storm
costs.

Our current credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our parent debt to total debt is 22.4% and our FFO to
debt is 8.3%. Our FFO to debt remained suppressed in large part due to the financial impacts from storms.
As we mentioned in the past few quarters, we expect the metric to return to targeted levels in 2022 after
we receive securitization proceeds and pay down the incremental debt.

We've made our storm recovery filings in Louisiana, Texas and New Orleans. As Leo noted, both Louisiana
and Texas passed legislation to support off-balance sheet treatment for securitization. And last week,
Entergy Louisiana made a securitization filing. Recovering storm costs through securitized debt is the best
alternative for customers and help strengthen our balance sheet.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

As we communicated, we have several options to meet our equity needs. In this past quarter, we utilized
the at-the-market equity program. As of the end of June, we had sold approximately $73 million of
common stock, of which approximately 2/3 were forward sales, which could settle as late as next fall.

Finally, I'd like to discuss the Moody's advisory that was issued this past week. Though affirming SIRI's
investment-grade ratings, Moody's did play a theory on negative outlook signing the currently pending
cases filed against SIRI at FERC by Retail Utility Commissions. Moody's indicated that these cases have the
potential to erode SIRI's earnings power and cost recovery. While we are, of course, disappointed by this
change, we recognize that the level of claims brought against SIRI approached the value of Grand Gulf.
And the regulatory environment in which SIRI is operating is far from constructive.

In the same advisory, Moody's affirmed the parent investment-grade rating and outlook recognizing
that Entergy's larger size and diversity could withstand adverse outcomes at SIRI. In addition, Moody's
recognized our improved business risk profile, which is a result of our successful multiyear strategy to
wind down the EWC merchant business and grow our utility business.

To do this, they reduced the cash flow from operations minus working capital to debt threshold. That's a
bit of a mouthful for Entergy Corporation from 15% to 14%. We are pleased with the recognition of the
derisking that we've accomplished in our business and combined with S&P's simpler recognition last fall.
We are excited about the enhanced financial flexibility that our work is unlocked.

Moving to Slide 11. The recent recognition of our derisking efforts and incremental balance sheet capacity,
we are early in the process of determining its full impact on our plans and outlooks. That said, there are
some early takeaways. First, the incremental capacity significantly increases our confidence in our ability
to execute the current business plan.

Second, we will not need as much equity to fund our utility growth. While we are affirming our 2021
adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.80 to $6.10 as well as our longer-term outlook for 5% to 7% adjusted
earnings per share growth. The combination of the improved confidence and lower equity needs places us
in the top half of our guidance and outlook ranges.

We have a clear line of sight on our capital plans to benefit customers and a robust balance sheet to
support that investment, both underpinned by a strong continuous improvement program and disciplined
flexible spending plans. We plan to invest for the benefit of our customers and projects designed to
improve reliability, sustainability, resiliency and customer experience.

These investments and programs further support community economic development and employee
development, all while keeping our focus on low rates. Finally, the incremental balance sheet capacity
resulting from our derisking efforts will enhance our ability to unlock the significant investment
opportunities that will flow from working alongside our commercial and industrial customers that Leo
described to help them lower their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

Today, we are executing on our key deliverables, and we are firmly on track to meet or exceed our
financial objectives. We are investing in customer solutions to enhance our customers' experience and our
investments in renewables and hydrogen technology will continue to support our sustainability efforts and
those of our customers to provide new opportunities in the future.
We are very excited about the growth opportunities ahead. And now the Entergy team is available to
answer questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's actually Rich on for Jeremy. Maybe just starting with the equity message first. I realize you laid out
some of the drivers behind this, but just wanted to drill down more specifically on the share count aspects
for '21 as well as just the overall evaluation. Can you speak a little bit more just to the timing of updating
for the new Moody's outlook and what other considerations around business mix and where the plan
stands now could factor into the lower equity needs?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So I'll talk about the timing. This is Drew. I'll talk about the timing first. We have been working on
this a long time, but we just got the recognition from Moody's in the past week or so, as I mentioned. And
so we are still early in the assessment of what the overall impact means I pointed to a couple of the early
elements associated with it.

We expect to complete that this fall. It could be sooner. I would say probably no later than EEI, but it
could be sooner than that. And as it relates to something like the share count or specifics around size,
I don't have those kinds of details available to give you today. Other than to say, we believe it would
be meaningful. It will be a meaningful change. In terms of the evaluation, which is I think part of the
question that you had in there, we still want to make sure that we are hitting our earnings and credit
expectations. We will still need to issue a little bit of equity to do that. But the opportunity is much more
robust in front of us now. We think it's been significantly derisked. We have a lot more confidence, as I
said, in our ability to execute. And -- but we don't have specifics that we can give you today.

A couple of other sizing or, I should say, valuation perspectives. One is that, as Leo talked about
extensively, we have a significant growth opportunity ahead of us, and we want to make sure that we
have the capacity to invest into that opportunity as it materializes. And then Moody's specifically also
talked about SIRI and our ability to manage that risk as it's presented right now, specifically around the
uncertain tax position case.

And their perspective was that we should be able to manage that risk and still meet the expectations
around earnings and credit. And so we want to make sure that we have that capacity built in as well.
And of course, we still believe that we're going to be successful in SIRI. I know that wasn't really your
question, but if that doesn't materialize, that would be incremental opportunity for us to invest in the
business.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe just switching gears to the CCGT in Texas. What is the time line for regulatory
approval? And do you expect the hydrogen aspect to impact approvals process at all?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

It's Rod. From a procedural standpoint, the process will begin at the commission right around the Labor
Day -- right around the Labor Day time frame, we're zeroing in on that. And then the procedural schedule
will be set by the PUCT. And that process could run 6 to 12 months if we are efficient in the way that we're
pursuing it. But again, that's up to the PUCT in Texas. And you asked a question around the hydrogen
component. I want to make sure I heard the question correctly.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Sure. Just curious, given the novel nature of the hydrogen component, if you expect that to impact the
approvals process at all?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

No. The hydrogen component as it's currently configured, represents approximately 5% of the overall
cost. And we believe we have a compelling case for why having that flexibility benefits our customers
and certainly would support the CCN. So it's novel, of course, and we're prepared to to explain why it's
beneficial, but more importantly, bringing our customer benefits along when we think about the industrial
opportunity that we're -- that both Leo and Drew referenced. We think that also adds to the viability of
hydrogen being part of the CCN process at this stage.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Jeremy, I'll just add to what Rod said. There's 2 advantageous components to the hydrogen piece of this.
One is certainly in the environmental space that hydrogen is a cleaner fuel. The other is that what we
are going to end up with at the end of the day is a dual fuel unit. It will be able to run on natural gas or
hydrogen or any combination in between. And so if you think about resiliency, that optionality provides
not only environmental benefits, but it added level of resiliency, which we've all seen is something that we
need as we start to deal with weather events.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congratulations on some of these updates. Really well done. If I can try to rehash a little bit, I know it's
early in the process, but maybe the other way to ask this is what are the big puts and takes as you think
about the outlook now relative to new targets, et cetera? I just want to make sure that as you think about
it, what are the building blocks that you're -- shall we say, assessing here early in the process?

And then related to that, if you can just sneak this in there, where are you just in the financing plan year-
to-date? I know this is all fluid and dynamic, but what have you done thus far this year relative to the full
year plan and expectations here if you can around that?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

So Julien, this is Drew. In terms of the big puts and takes, I mean, I think the first thing is just sort of the
back of the envelope math in terms of what the -- how much put and take is out there. And when you go
from 15% to 14%, given the size of our cash flow, it's somewhere in the $1.7 billion to $2 billion range,
and it's sort of growing over time. So it's a lot of extra capacity. The -- and what we are considering in
terms of the building blocks, I think, as I mentioned, I think there's probably 3 big ones, right? One is,
okay, so how much incremental equity we really need right now. That will take up some of that capacity.

One is how much opportunity is really out there for growth in the commercial and industrial space as we
ramp up our ability to work alongside our customers to manage their Scope 1 and Scope 2 positions.
Those are probably the 2 big ones.

Then Moody's specifically talked about our ability to manage identifiable risks that are out there. And
they pointed to SIRI specifically. And if you take the ALJ's recommendation around uncertain tax position.
That's in the ballpark of a little over $500 million. That could be a piece of capacity as well. Certainly,
we're very comfortable in the way that we are positioned in that case, and we can go through that, and

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

we have in the past, as you know. So I mean I think it's -- that is additional something that we're thinking
about as well, make sure that we have the capacity to manage a risk like that, and that Moody's was
pointing at that. So I mean, those are the 3 things.

We certainly had a forecast before this ruling last week that said we were going to hit our earnings
expectations. We were going to hit our targets on credit, though there still the case. Now we have extra
capacity to do that and manage through these new opportunities and these risks. So it's incrementally
better for us because it really derisks our ability to execute.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Right. And the press, is that still in the currency? I just want to understand on the specific financing.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Certainly something that's on the table for us still. But we are looking
at -- we're sort of stepping back and thinking about, okay, so what's the best way for us to perceive
given that we have this extra capacity. And so we want to think through it a little bit before we proceed
with any specific financings. And once we get finished with that, then we will start moving forward and
communicate with you all about what our plan is.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

And sorry to rehash slightly your comments on the upper half. I just want to be extra clear about this that
is strictly tied to dilution in equity needs and is not reflective of any changes in your cost-cutting efforts
and/or perhaps more quickly load trends and especially industrial load trends there and et cetera.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we were very comfortable in our guidance and our outlooks before, just to be clear. And this --
the fact that we don't need to issue as much equity starts to move the earnings per share up. So that is
a driver for helping us move to the upper half of the range. And that and the additional confidence that
we have because we now have additional flexibility to achieve these earnings outcomes and the financial
flexibility that we have available to us now. So it's a combination, I would say, of those 2 things, that
allows us to say we think we're going to be in the top half of the range with some work to do to refine that
for you all going forward.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Right. But these other factors presumably are still independent.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

That's correct.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just a quick 1 again on financing. Given the lower need, does that make you sort of more likely to look at
something which might put this whole need to bad quicker as opposed to sort of doing it through the plan.
Any thoughts on that at this early stage?

Yes. Jonathan, that's a good question. Certainly, that is a possibility now. Yes, we haven't excluded our
assessment, but that is something that we would consider if we could do it. We're mindful of the so-called
equity overhang. We understand that. And so we are thinking about that. That is definitely a consideration
as we're doing our assessment.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And could I just level set, I want to make sure I'm clear on what the prior plan was. I think it was
up to $2.5 billion, but that was out through 2024. Is that correct?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

That's correct.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then just finally, obviously, from the Analyst Day, you also had a 24% range out there, which
you've not been including in the last couple of slide decks. I'm just -- any reason why we wouldn't kind
of continue to use that and why your comments about the upper end wouldn't also sort of fold into that
longer-term outlook that you gave whenever it was.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I mean I can't go out right now because we haven't got that information available. But our
expectation is to drive steady, predictable earnings and dividend growth. And to the extent that we want
to be steady and predictable that might imply what you're looking for.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

A couple of things. Just on those 3 considerations, you mentioned, Drew, that one of them was the growth
opportunity. I assume this is on -- as you talked about on the industrial as they look to cleanup and
electrify more. Just when you talk about that as a growth opportunity, are you referring you to more as a
kind of rate base CapEx or as a sales and cash flow?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

So Steve, that's a good question. There's a couple of growth opportunities that we're assessing right now.
One, as I mentioned in my script, which doesn't have to do with environmental benefits necessarily, but
is part of it is the assessment we're doing resiliency across the system, which could lead to more T&D
investment going forward.

So that's an area that I did want to point out, the assessment of that in conjunction with what's going
on with infrastructure in Washington could be a combination of rate base assets -- some costs that are
actually picked up by the states and the federal government through potentially the infrastructure build,
depending on how that all works out.

The big opportunity to -- and we've been talking about this for a while, obviously, is the size of the
emissions footprint of our industrial base. And if you just go on the Internet, look at who our industrial
customers are and look at their websites, they all have sustainability objectives that many of which are

public. And so there's a couple of ways for us to help them out. One, what we already do when they buy
electricity from us, it's some of the cleanest electricity in the country. So their Scope 2 emissions are
lower. To drive those even lower, we've been discussing things like green tariffs with those customers. And
that really makes the deployment of our renewables more efficient.

And so for example, we got the solar facility that we got approval for in Arkansas filing a green tariff in
Arkansas. We already have customers like Walmart who are in to talk to us about taking a slice of those
facilities to make the deployment of those more efficient in a way that could accelerate our investment in
renewables, if there's a large uptake of that, particularly if that spreads over into our industrial customers,
which we're already having discussions with them on that.

Then the big opportunity is exactly what you said, is to attack their Scope 1 emissions and that really is
again, outside of just merely adding generation to the system for technological improvement, now we
would be adding toward load growth. And so you can think about it as it's new load with new sales for new
processes that today are not electrified, that would provide us the opportunity to deploy assets to help
them meet those objectives. And primarily, that could not only accelerate, but increase the size of our
renewable footprint going forward.

We're in the early stage of the size and timing of that. So we'll be laying out more as we go, but it would
be rate base additions to meet regulated utility sales for things like they're using natural gas compression
on a pipeline today, electrifying that and we're using fossil fuels to further pricing in LNG process that can
be electrified. If they're cogenerating with highly inefficient and high emitting generation on site today,
that could be electrified by us or utilizing green tariffs or to the extent that we develop hydrogen over
time, but that can be a part of the mix as well. So it's a pretty significant opportunity that we're in the
early stages of investigating. We're having a lot of discussions with our customers about what their needs
are.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. And just 1 other question on just the change in the equity plan. So obviously, it's great
that you're targeting -- seeing things now in the upper half. But actually, the amount of equity, just that
difference to get you in the upper half by in these years is actually -- it's only, I don't know, maybe $300
million less equity, and you talked to potentially $1.7 billion, $2 billion of more capacity. So could you just
try to kind of tie that together in terms of how to think about that? Is there -- how should I just think
about that?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Well, this is Drew. I think that we are early in our assessment, is probably the best way to think about
that. So we got the news that we got the recognition last week. And so we hadn't completed our
assessment about what this might mean for us going forward. And I think what we wanted to get you
the early out there that we at least see ourselves in the top half of the range. We have more work to do
around that. We have a couple of things that need to factor into the analysis. Like you just discussed
with Leo around the growth potential that's out there. There are a couple of risk items out there that we
want to make sure that we have had to manage. And if we can manage through them without using that
capacity, that's incremental capacity that's available for us. But I think you're looking at the right thing.
There is a good opportunity for us out there going forward.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. So it sounds like you both obviously got update balance sheet, but also almost really a full refresh of
the capital plan to for some of these things that Leo just mentioned.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

That's right. There's that opportunity out there that we're still framing it out.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Congratulations. I guess my first question is, should we assume that the longer-term FFO to debt target
now is going to be 14%?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I'll answer that. No, not right after that because we still have some expectation of having some
capacity to manage risks that are out there. But I do fully expect us to utilize some of the capacity for sort
of the capital formation changes that we were just talking about and for some of the growth opportunity
that we're talking about. So I wouldn't say it goes all the way down to 14% unless some of those risks
were to materialize, but that's not -- that's not what we're trying to do right now. The idea would be to
get past some of those risks, then maybe we'd reassess whether we go down to 14%. But I don't think it
would go all the way to 14% right now.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So at some point, you'll provide sort of an amended FFO to debt target?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

I think I'll add 1 more thing. From an Entergy perspective, I don't know that we're going to change
Entergy's perspective. I mean, I think we're talking about going from 15% to 14%. The Entergy -- our
Entergy view is going to be well above the 15%. I think we may still actually stay above 15%, even if
Moody's dressed down closer between 15% and 14%. But and we may not actually amend the Entergy
target. We're still working through that.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then do you need clarity on SIRI in order to sort of determine what your ultimate equity needs
are going to look like? And when would you anticipate a final SIRI order?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I mean talk about the SIRI order first. Yes, I could -- the first part of that uncertain tax position
and the sale leaseback, we expect possibly by the end of the year, but more likely into next year, yes, it
could be in the first quarter could leak into the spring. So we're getting closer on that. But I don't think we
need that to start thinking about what we might do differently. We might be mindful of that as an ability to
continue to hit our marks. But I don't know that we necessarily need that to get started on our changes in
our capitalization plan.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So it's more likely that you'll have a better feel for the equity around the end of the year around the EEI,
right?

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Yes. No, what I said earlier was that I would think EEI at the latest, hopefully sooner.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our last question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with
Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So just -- I think I got everything. So around EEI, we're going to be getting an update, it sounds like on all
these opportunities. Is that how we should think about the -- you guys are in early assessments right now,
but we'll get more of a picture as to sort of what these opportunities and how it falls into the capital plan,
everything? Is that the time frame we're looking at?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Certainly, we'll have an update on what the opportunities set looks like, what we're thinking and how
it's evolved by then. The good news about the opportunity that we were just talking about is that it's
a pretty long runway opportunity. It's a significant opportunity that's got a long path. As you imagine,
our customer base is going to be reducing their emissions over time. Some of them have, for example,
their own net 0 objectives. Some of those might be as early as 2035. Some of those go out to 2050, that
sort of thing. So it's a significant opportunity that's got a long runway. So we'll get you the early parts
of it as it develops. But it's kind of thing we'll continue to update. And as I said in the answer to Steve's
question, it's really a low growth question. And then the resource mix that we require to meet that load,
which, again, the objective is clean energy. So it will probably have implications for what you see in the
generation mix.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And just to sort of clarify this, this is basically because of the -- just to make sure I understand
the customer footprint that you guys have, their ambitions and their decarbonization ambitions and the
potential to help. Is there any cost advantage that you think these customers might get? Is it just purely
decarbonization? Or is there anything else that would be driving this? Is it just basically look we're the
utility, they want to do this, that would mean electrification and we're in a pretty good position to do that?
Or is this the deployment of new technology or anything that we should think about that, that would be
supercharging and if you follow me?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Well, it's -- obviously, cost is going to be a factor on low rates factor into it. And we certainly need to
continue to help our customers be competitive as they go forward. It's going to depend on the process.
For example, Shore Power is the exact same opportunity where you've got a ship pulls into dock, it's
burning diesel fuel to keep the lights on while they do maintenance on the ship before they go back out
into the Gulf of Mexico, for example, to help with the oil services out there. When we electrify that ship,
we not only reduce our emissions, which was the original discussion around it, but it does lower their
cost because the trade from our electricity to diesel fuel is a positive one. So it does 2 things for them. It
lowers their cost and it improves their emissions, both of which make them more competitive as they bid
for offshore work. So it's going to be a combination of all of those things.

Operator

And I'm showing no further questions. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Abler
