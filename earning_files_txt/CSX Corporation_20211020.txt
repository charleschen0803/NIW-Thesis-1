CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to the Q3 2021 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.

Bill Slater
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and
Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk,
Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Acting Chief Financial Officer. On Slide 2 is our
forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.

With that, it's my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thanks, Bill, and thank you to all who are joining us today for the call. I want to begin by thanking
all of CSX' employees for their extraordinary efforts to help our customers navigate the strained global
supply chain. Across virtually every industry, there are challenges presented by extended lead times, port
congestion, shortages of labor and key materials and lack of storage capacity.

While the current operating environment is challenging, we are not sitting idle. We are designing new
solutions to help reduce congestion, adding container yards and drayage to keep intermodal terminals
fluid, and we are investing in both people and network capacity to ensure CSX is able to reliably meet
customer needs today and for years to come. In a few minutes, Kevin will go through the revenue
numbers and discuss some of the steps we are taking to provide new service offerings to our customers to
help them overcome these challenges. And Jamie will provide an update of our hiring initiatives as well as
actions we are taking to keep our network fluid.

So let's first turn to the presentation and begin on Slide 4 with an overview of our third quarter results.
Operating income increased 26% to $1.44 billion. Earnings per share increased 34% to $0.43. And
the operating ratio improved by 50 basis points to 56.4%. These figures include the results of Quality
Carriers, which did not have a significant income -- impact on operating income but increased third
quarter operating ratio by approximately 250 basis points, excluding transaction and integration expenses.

I'll now kick it over to Kevin.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. Third quarter revenue increased 24% year-over-year, with growth
across all major lines of business. The inclusion of Quality Carriers revenue represented roughly 8
percentage points of the total increase. Supply chain challenges, including a lack of labor and equipment,
continue to impact almost every market we serve, driving volatility and freight flows and uneven volumes.

Merchandise revenue increased 6% on 2% lower volumes as higher revenue across all other markets was
offset by declines in auto, driven by the ongoing semiconductor shortages. The industrial and construction-
related markets such as metals and equipment, forest products and minerals all showed strong year-over-
year volume growth. In addition, our core chemicals business grew but was partially offset by declines in
crude oil and other energy-related markets.

Intermodal revenue increased 14% on 4% higher volumes due to increased international shipments as a
result of strong demand, inventory replenishments and growth in rail volumes from East Coast ports. The

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

domestic side was more challenged as multiple supply-side constraints, including container and chassis
shortages, have resulted in inability to meet the strong demand.

Coal revenue increased 39% on 16% higher volumes with growth across all end markets. Domestic
coal benefited from higher utility and industrial demand, and export coal revenue increased from the
combination of higher demand and higher export and smart prices. Other revenue increased primarily due
to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage due to the broader supply chain disruptions from truck
driver shortages, chassis availability and the lack of warehouse capacity.

Turning to Slide 6. This is an extraordinary time as customers and global supply chain face challenges
we have never experienced before. On trucks to chassis, supports to containers, lack of truck drivers,
the labor challenges at the warehouse and production facilities, we are seeing shortages everywhere.
The entire CSX team has been highly focused on delivering new innovative solutions and partnering with
customers to address the supply chain challenges by driving more volume to the railroad.

Across the network, we have accelerated investments to create new capacity. To address the truck driver
shortages, we have added 13 new overflow container yards, implemented new steel wheel options for
West Coast cargo and added TRANSFLO sites that offer customers additional options to move their freight
at a lower cost. To address the port congestion and container shortages, we have added new solutions
to accelerate repositioning of containers and utilized port-to-port lanes to alleviate marine terminal
congestion.

We are working closely with partners, including GPA, to utilize additional inland rail yards to help reduce
congestion at the port. We have also been aggressively expanding our customer solutions team to further
supplement the significant investments we are making in customer-facing technology. Our team is working
diligently to create new solutions and options for shippers, with supply chain disruptions unlikely to
improve in the near term.

Finally, we are starting to see early signs of customers making long-term investment decisions to reinvest
in onshore production and supply chain solutions. To address these customer needs, we continue to
develop and invest in new CSX select sites that offer a shovel-ready, CSX-served solution to meet
customer requirements.

With that, I will hand it over to Jamie to discuss operations.

Jamie J. Boychuk
Executive Vice President of Operations

Thank you, Kevin. As noted, our teams are working closely together to find new ways to overcome the
supply chain disruptions and provide new solutions for our customers. In addition to the ongoing supply
challenges, this past quarter was further impacted by a rise in COVID mark-offs due to the Delta variant.
At peak, we had several hundred employees marked off, including regional concentrations that required us
to adjust our network plan in real time to get customers their freight.

Despite these challenges, we were able to maintain network performance compared to the prior quarter,
and we expect the initiatives we have underway to drive improved fluidity going forward. Kevin touched on
many of the things we're doing to help reduce congestion at the ports and keep containers moving, and
I want to thank my intermodal team for the exceptional work they are doing to accomplish these goals.
These efforts are highlighted by the nearly 90% intermodal trip plan compliance they continue to deliver in
a challenging environment.

We entered the year focused on hiring the people required to respond to the rising demand, and I'm
proud of how our team has been able to think creatively and act decisively to overcome the challenges
presented by the tight labor market. Over the course of the year, we have redesigned our recruiting
process to eliminate unnecessary steps and significantly shorten the time from application to offer. We
have also implemented new recruiting tools and referral programs that are improving our application
through different conversation rates and better identifying highly qualified candidates. These efforts have
successfully increased the size and frequency of our conductor classes and provided strong ongoing hire
visibility by expanding our new hire pipeline almost 300% since July.

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

We are also increasing intermodal head count and supplemental labor to keep the terminals fluid and
allow us to continue moving containers for our customers. While these hiring initiatives are underway,
we're taking steps to increase the availability of our existing T&E workforce. We have implemented new
attendance-based initiative programs, which allow us to better utilize our existing head count to move
more freight for our customers.

We are also making upgrades to our network to increase throughput and create additional capacity. We're
installing more automated equipment at our hump yards. We are converting intermodal terminals to
grounded facilities in order to increase capacity, and we are expanding our investment in autonomous
cranes to increase intermodal terminal throughput.

While we still have sufficient line of road capacity, we are strategically investing in growth by extending
sidings in select locations across the network. These siding investments will allow us to continue to refine
our train plan and provide growth capacity for years to come.

Every action we take is focused on network reliability. That begins and ends with running a balanced train
plan to minimize delay and maximize network performance. Running a scheduled network ensures assets
are in the right place at the right time. We will continue to maintain network balance and the principles of
scheduled railroading as we add resources to meet current demand. These principles have allowed us to
keep the intermodal network open and running well this year, and we are focused on continuing the strong
performance as we enter into peak season.

Turning to Slide 8. Maintaining a safe operation is the foundation to the success of any other operating
goal we want to pursue, and we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the third quarter,
personal injury rate improved sequentially, and ongoing safety initiatives also drove a decrease in injury
severity. While train accident rate increased slightly from last quarter's record result, accidents rates have
improved year-over-year.

Focus for the remainder of the year will be critical rule compliance and reducing human-factor accidents.
We are leveraging the approximate 9,000 tablets distributed to field employees to more productively
deliver these messages. Not only do the tablets allow real-time communication of key safety information,
but we are also able to more effectively combine electronic and in-person communications to increase
the impact of our training programs and drive lasting changes in the behavior that will better protect our
employees.

I'll now turn the call over to Sean for the financials.

Sean R. Pelkey
VP & Acting CFO

Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Looking at the income statement on Slide 9. Operating income
grew nearly $300 million or 26%. Revenue was up 24%, reflecting gains across all major markets, higher
fuel prices and the impact of Quality Carriers. The operating ratio of 56.4% is a third quarter record for
CSX as we focus on operating efficiently and growing the business. As a reminder, this includes an impact
of approximately 250 basis points from the ongoing operations of Quality.

Looking below the line. Interest and other expense was $16 million favorable to last year due to a lower
weighted average coupon and lower average debt balances as well as favorable pension impacts, and
income tax expense was up on higher pretax earnings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%.

Looking at expenses in more detail on the next slide. Total costs increased $349 million or 23% in the
quarter. Including transaction-related expenses, approximately $200 million of the increase was driven
by Quality Carriers. Higher locomotive fuel prices were also a significant factor, up about $90 million
versus last year. Partially offsetting these items, real estate gains were $56 million higher. Nonfuel inflation
remained steady versus last quarter at around 3%. As I mentioned last time, we have some lagging
contracts that may drive higher inflation going into next year.

As Jamie discussed, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining train and engine employees. While head
count was roughly flat sequentially, excluding the addition of Quality Carriers, the conductor count was up

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

and was offset by reductions in other areas of the business. As a result, we experienced $16 million more
in hiring and retention costs versus last year.

You'll note that we have renamed the prior MS&O line to purchase services and other. The base expenses
are identical to the prior MS&O category, but the new description better reflects the costs in this line post
acquisition. Increased costs on this line reflected the addition of Quality as well as higher intermodal
terminal and locomotive expense. Depreciation was up on a higher asset base that also includes the
acquisition impact.

Finally, we are proud to report another all-time record for fuel efficiency in the quarter. This reflects
continued focus and investment by CSX, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and the ongoing
environmental advantage of rail.

Looking into the fourth quarter. We typically see a seasonal increase in operating expense due to weather,
lower capitalized labor as well as holidays and vacations. That trend should continue this year, in addition
to expected headwinds from higher incentive compensation and lower sequential gains on property sales
in the fourth quarter. Peak season expenses are also likely to be higher than normal as a result of ongoing
supply chain disruptions.

Now turning to cash flow on Slide 11. With operating income up 34% on a year-to-date basis, free cash
flow before dividends this year is $2.9 billion, up nearly 50%. Free cash flow conversion on net income
is exceeding 100% year-to-date, and we expect it to remain near this level on a full year basis. The
company's cash balance of $2.2 billion is beginning to normalize. The lower balance reflects the acquisition
in the quarter and a step-up in distributions to shareholders. We expect cash to continue to normalize over
time.

After fully funding capital investments in our core infrastructure, year-to-date shareholder returns have
exceeded $2.9 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion in buybacks and over $600 million in dividends.
We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach, and we remain committed to
returning excess cash to our shareholders.

With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Sean. Concluding with Slide 12. We are maintaining our full year outlook for double-
digit revenue growth before the impact from Quality Carriers. We expect capital expenditures to be at
the top end of our initial $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion range due to materials cost inflation, the capacity
investments we just reviewed and the inclusion of Quality Carriers capital spending.

I'll conclude my remarks the same way I began: we are committed to helping our customers overcome
the current supply chain challenges. And as you heard today, our entire team is aligned around this goal,
and we will continue to act. We have a strong hiring pipeline, and we will hire until we have staffed the
network to match demand. We expect to hire above attrition throughout the rest of this year and into next
year.

Economic demand remains strong, and CSX will help customers capture that demand. Everything we do
begins with a commitment to providing customers a high-quality service. We will build on the positive
momentum from actions taken to date. We will continue putting resources in place to drive growth, and
we will provide customers with creative new offerings that make CSX a more meaningful part of the
customer supply chain. Back to you, Bill.

Bill Slater
Head of Investor Relations
Thank you, Jim. [Operator Instructions] With that, we will now take questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congrats on some really solid results in a tough environment. Great to see. Maybe just a follow-up, either
Jim or Sean, just talking about your thoughts on pricing. I know you were kind of running through some
of the categories there. Maybe how much you can still address and some of the opportunities to catch this
rising market, and obviously, coal up 20%. It seems like you're touching some of that maybe even faster
than thought or there's different kind of moves. Maybe just delve into the pricing outlook.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Ken, I'll take a shot at that. This is Kevin. I think it's clear that cost inflation over the last year,
expectations have risen and are arising in the next year. And this is not surprising to our customers.
They're facing the same cost inflation pressures that we see. And what we strive to do is be transparent
around that in our conversations with customers.

Fourth quarter and first quarter are heavy renewal periods for us, so we'll be having those discussions.
But the exciting part, though, as we get into a higher inflation environment is really the value proposition
we offer when a customer is looking to offset some of that cost inflation, rail is such a great alternative to
shift more of their volumes over to rail. And then you add on top of that, the persistent driver shortages
that we're likely to see well into next year and probably the years ahead, the value proposition is there.

And then on top of that, the environmental discussions that we're having increasingly with customers is
really resonating with those. So it's no surprise, cost inflation is higher than what we saw last year. It will
be a higher cost inflation environment than what we've probably seen in the last number of years, and
we've got to have conversations with our customers around that.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess just any -- just a follow-up. Any detailed thoughts on kind of the trend of pure pricing pace of
acceleration or any level of that detail?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Well, we get to touch, as I mentioned, contracts into the fourth and first quarter. That's a heavy renewal
period. And we'll continue to have those discussions. I think I'll probably leave it at that.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Kevin, can you just update us on the Quality Carriers acquisition, the status of the revenue opportunity
you're seeing, converting some of those into chemical carloads and just when we may see kind of a more
meaningful uplift? Obviously, that's a great offset to intermodal carloads, which are growing. Just seems
like it's a great idiosyncratic opportunity. If you can just give us a little bit of update there. And then just
any initial thoughts on margins or performance next year? Obviously, you've got a big pricing cycle ahead

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

of you. Just any willingness to opine about what the opportunity is from an OR perspective next year
would be highly appreciated.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Maybe I'll let Sean take the OR question, but I don't think we're giving guidance today on next year.
But on the Quality Carriers, as you'll remember, that really is focused on our chemical franchise, and
the customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive. In a market where supply is constrained, our
customers are looking for more options to move their freight. And so Randy and his team, combined with
our TRANSFLO team, have found a number of options and we're moving freight today now that we're
doing it in a way where it's thoughtful and calculated and that the customer is seeing a good service on
that product, and we'll continue to build momentum in the market. But I think everything that we thought
before we made the acquisition is coming true.

The only thing I will say is from an equipment standpoint, obviously, with things tight right now, the
equipment backlog is going to take a little bit longer in the next year to really ramp that up when we think
about some of the ISO tank solutions that we're contemplating out there.

So other than that, everything is full speed ahead. I would say there's customers that we believe would be
longer -- it would take a lot longer to adopt that have been first to adopt, which is exciting for us, market
leaders in the industry. And their adoption, I think, is going to really set the tone for this to really take off
into the market.

So the other thing that I think is positive, it shows other partners that we have that we're capable of doing
this, using the TRANSFLO solution in unique ways. And we don't always have to do it ourselves. We would
love partners to continue to bring freight and through all of our different capabilities that we have. So I
think that momentum is starting to be seen in the market as well.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Do you want to -- Sean, do you want to talk about the OR? I mean maybe you can't offer guidance,
but maybe another way to ask it is, there's obviously a lag on this coal revenue ARPU opportunity. Just
wondering, are we going to see more uplift in coal yields in the fourth quarter as you -- as some of that
lag gets caught up. Just talk to us maybe about the cadence if you don't want to answer the OR question
next year.

Sean R. Pelkey
VP & Acting CFO

Yes. On the -- clearly, on the export coal side, you've seen some favorability in the prices there. And
as we've mentioned before, our price is tied to the benchmarks. And you will see some favorability
sequentially in the fourth quarter versus third quarter.

It's a strong market. We continue to see favorability in the next year. How long it holds up at these levels,
they probably won't hold here, but these are extremely elevated levels that will probably carry into next
year and hopefully create some favorability there. But it's -- everybody is trying to produce more coal, and
we're trying to move more of it today.

And at the mine, there's been some struggles here in the third quarter, as you could see with some of the
production hiccups that some of the producers have had. So we're working through that as diligently as
we can and really ramping up our ability to serve those customers.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz.

Thomas Richard Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

I think this is probably for you, Kevin, but maybe for others also. How do you think about the impact of
capacity constraints on volumes? You think intermodal would have been meaningfully stronger? Do you --
how much optimism do you have as you look forward that -- maybe into '22, that capacity constraints get
alleviated quickly? And how does that kind of inform your perspective on growth looking to next year? Is
it reasonable to expect easing of constraints and a pretty good acceleration? I guess it's primarily around
intermodal, but you may have capacity constraints in other areas as well.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Tom, it's Jim. Let me take a shot. I would say, yes, we're clearly constrained. There was more business out
there this quarter. There has been more business out there throughout this year that we could not handle.
And the primary reason for that is our inability, like everyone else in the world right now, to ramp up our
workforce coming out of the steep declines in the early phases of the pandemic.

And as Jamie talked about, we are now starting to see the fruits of all of our hard work for the last 9
months or more and are beginning to bring on more people and actually deploy those people into the
field. So we're able to operate a little bit better. And we fully expect that, that trend will continue as we
go forward unless some other crazy curveball gets thrown at us, and be in a much, much better position
as we exit this year and move into next year and hopefully be able to take advantage of what seems to
be a continuation of strong demand for transportation services into 2022, and now some people are even
saying 2023.

Thomas Richard Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Do you think a lot of that is in your control? Or is it hard to have visibility given the warehouse labor,
drayage labor, other pieces?

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

My first -- the #1 priority is getting enough to CSX employees in the training, principally conductors on
the train, so we can operate more fluidly and get back to some of the performance metrics that we were
putting up prepandemic, in the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020.

The fluidity, the dwell, the on-time performance, the customer service metrics that we put out there, the
trip plan compliance numbers, those numbers are all down. And it's principally a result of our having an
extremely difficult time getting people to come to work for us. And it's taken a complete, I would say,
reengineering of hiring process, a complete review of everything that we do when we onboard employees
for us to get to this point. This has been extremely difficult. We're no different than every business -- at
least in the United States, every business, I think, every business, every hospital, every school, everybody
is struggling with the same phenomena of trying to get people to come to work.

I am confident that we have done everything we can do right now and are seeing that numbers are
increasing in terms of the number of employees that we can put into our training programs and begin to
qualify them to go to work. And like I said, unless something else comes along that disrupts that process,
I hope we're going to be in a lot better shape at the end of this year, the beginning of next year than we
have been over the last 9 months.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Sean, I think you called out a few sequential headwinds to OpEx in the fourth quarter. I believe it was
incentive comps, lower gains on sale and then some peak season expense. Any way you can put a finer
point around those 3 items to just help us understand the order of magnitude here in the next quarter?

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Sean R. Pelkey
VP & Acting CFO

Yes. Thanks, Justin. So you got the items right: higher incentive comp, lower gains on property sales and
then just some additional costs related to the supply chain. If you put all those together, you're probably
looking about a couple of pennies over and above what we would normally see from the third quarter to
the fourth quarter.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Very helpful. And then any thoughts on other revenue as well? I know it was pretty elevated and
took a decent step up here sequentially ex Quality, but thoughts on that into the fourth quarter and maybe
into next year?

Sean R. Pelkey
VP & Acting CFO

So if you look just at the pure other revenue line, not considering the trucking revenue line, which should
-- trucking revenue should be pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter, really, the big driver, as Kevin said
there, is the intermodal storage and premise-use charges as well as demurrage. And that's a direct result
of what's going on in the supply chain that we've been talking about here. So as things start to improve,
that line -- the other revenue line will come down. But here we sit in October, we're probably in about the
same place as we were in Q3, and we'll see where it goes from here.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just back on head count. If you can get all the people that you'd like to get, I guess, two thoughts.
One, how much -- it sounds like you want to be above attrition directionally. Like what kind of percentage
increases in head count are you thinking about? And is there a way to think about if you add back 5% to
head count, what do you think that means to volume growth and things like that? Do you still think you
can grow volume in excess of head count? I'm just trying to understand the spreads there.

Sean R. Pelkey
VP & Acting CFO

Yes, Scott. So what we're looking on a sequential basis is modest increases in head count, right? We're
bringing on, trying to fill classes of 40 every week and then getting those folks trained up and out into the
field, right? So you're not going to see dramatic increases in head count. I think it's also fair to assume
that we've got capacity still on our existing trains and capacity on the network. So we are hiring for
growth, but it's not -- it doesn't need to be one for one.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. So I didn't -- I probably didn't ask that so well. But do you think next year is a year where you could
grow volume in excess of head count?

Sean R. Pelkey
VP & Acting CFO

I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be the target.

Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Brandon. I just want to ask a quick one about the fourth quarter cost commentary. I guess -- I
don't know if there's [indiscernible] to be asked, but does that mean it's going to be hard to show OR
improvement in the near term? And then I guess longer term, if I can sneak a two-part question. Kevin,
what are some of the structural things that you think you can leverage with the head count, kind of
building off of Scott's question there?

Sean R. Pelkey
VP & Acting CFO

Yes. So just on the OR question, we're not going to give OR guidance. But I think it's fair to assume
sequentially given some of the cost pressures as well as just the normal seasonality, we'll probably see an
OR that's a little bit higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Brandon, I guess the question was what can we do with more head count?

Brandon Robert Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes, like strategically.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Strategically, we're going to move a lot more freight. When we talk to customers right now, they're looking
for capacity. And they're trying to offset a lot of cost inflation, too. The environment couldn't be any better
for us to go out and sell the product we have. So we're going to move more freight, and we're going to get
more wallet share with the customer. It's a perfect environment for us.

Operator

Your next line comes from the -- your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck.

Brian Patrick Ossenbeck
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So, Jim, I just wanted to ask a bigger-picture question about just capacity and interplay with the
regulators in D.C. And we'll see what your peers put out there later this week and next week, but it looks
like you have some -- obviously a lot of capacity solutions here that you're ramping up on your own.
Do you think you need additional help on that for some of your supply chain partners? Maybe just some
perspective on what you can do on your own versus what you sort of need help with.

And then just contrasting that with obviously the big other revenue you just mentioned. Clearly,
demurrage is a cost for everybody at this point. But there have been some fairly pointed comments out of
the STB about growing and focusing maybe less on OR than on growth. So maybe you can address all that
in terms of adding capacity if you need help and what the regulators do you think will take away from all
this.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

I think Kevin did a very good job of outlining all of the activities that we've been undertaking here over the
last 6 months or so to do on our own without any plotting to improve and increase capacity. We were way
ahead of the curve in Chicago, the biggest terminal for us in terms of intermodal capacity, expanding our
59th Street facility that -- we bought that property 2 years ago. We had it -- we had another yard right
down the street, which was ready to go, cranes available.

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

So we've always tried to be somewhat visionary in trying to determine where the growth would be and
make sure that we were properly positioned. Some of these new initiatives, like Kevin talked about
moving traffic inland from Savannah into a facility in Atlanta. We had a yard available there. It wasn't
an intermodal yard. We created an intermodal yard. And so we're taking the steps that we think are
appropriate and necessary in order to make sure that our railroad continues to operate the more fluid and
provide better service all the time. And it actually has always been the case. That will always be the case
and it's -- whether that's mainline track that moves merchandise business or whatever it is, we're always
being thoughtful in our planning process to make sure that we have the capacity available to handle the
traffic growth as it comes on.

The lucky fact is that we, over the last 4 years, by changing the methodologies we used to run the
railroad, have created up an enormous amount of capacity across the rail network just simply by running
the trains in a more reliable and efficient manner. And so we don't need to make big, big, big investments
in the railroad in order to handle future growth. We've got locomotives in storage. So we're ready to go.

Have thought, I believe, it was on the year-end conference call in January, where I called out the fact that
we were going to be hiring. I fully believed inasmuch as at that point in time, we had about 300 of our
train and engine service employees off on COVID, that we would just simply do what we've always done.
We hired 500 employees. The 300 employees would come back from off sick, and we'd be rocking and
rolling and we'll be moving freight. No one ever gave me a heads-up that says, "Oh, by the way, when
you want to hire somebody, nobody is going to want to work for you." Plus all the people that you had
furloughed as the railroad had -- the traffic had declined so dramatically. It was so many more than was
usual, when we called them back and said, "Do you want to come back to work?" They said, "No, I've
decided to go do something else. I've changed my lifestyle. I'm going to go enjoy the scenery on the
Jersey Coast," or whatever it might be.

This is not a phenomena that is unique to CSX. This is a phenomena that nobody saw coming. And it is
a phenomena that everybody in the supply chain, whether you're a trucker, whether you're a steamship
company, whether you're a port, whether you're a warehouse operator, whatever you do, this is a
phenomena that is impacting everyone, and everyone is trying to deal with this said, what is now the new
norm. So we've got to change everything the way we think about it. And that's -- but have done that. As
we always do, we adapted. We recognized the situation and we adapted and we made changes, and that's
why we're reasonably confident that we'll be in better shape as we move forward this year and in pretty
good shape as we move into next year. I don't need any help from the government in order to figure out
what I'm supposed to do. I just don't want to make sure the government does something that screws it up
worse.

Brian Patrick Ossenbeck
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. If I could sneak one, a quick one in the -- all the stuff on Page 6. Do you think that would be
permanent going into the future of these things you had pulled forward from prior plans? Or do you think
this is more of a case of reacting to kind of what we see here?

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think what we're doing is we're responding to the situation, as simple as that. We can think, we can
plan, we can do all kinds of things. Unfortunately, I think we've had more black swan events in the last 2
years than most people would experience in a lifetime. So as I said, what's the next thing?

So I am -- I started off my remarks telling -- saying how proud I was of our employees. All of this going
on, all of these challenges, all of these changes, all of these domains, all of these people saying -- first of
all, the entire supply chain issue was as a result of the railroad. Oh, my god, the railroads, it's screwed
this thing up. Well, then as time went on, everybody figured out it's probably due to the railroads. We
don't own the warehouses where this stuff goes. We don't have the trucks that bring it there. If I need to
buy a truck and bring it there, I'll bring it there, and I'll put the box in the warehouse parking lot. That's
going to be somebody else's problem.

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

But most of the issues associated with everything that was talked about, the railroads are doing an
extremely good job. Their employees have been critical workers throughout the entire pandemic, have
been out there working and not been home in the basement and then complying with all the requirements
and making sure that the economy keeps going. And so the railroad guys, not just CSX, but the entire
railroad industry has done a phenomenal job under unbelievably difficult circumstances.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Jim, I think you mentioned on the call that the Quality impact was more than 200 basis points on the
operating ratio. And so I guess it sort of struck me that you guys are running sort of the core rail business
at an operating ratio I really haven't seen before. And I guess in the context -- and I understand the
pricing environment, particularly on the accessorial side, is certainly elevated, and that probably has some
impact on how we should be thinking about operating ratio.

But maybe big picture, as we think forward, you are growing volume, arguably better than your peers.
Pricing is going to be a cycle here for a period of time. And you're talking about bringing some folks back,
but service is good. Can we talk a little bit about maybe we need to think about a new way to think about
OR over the long run? I guess I just want to make sure I understand what this business is capable of in
terms of incremental margins and the ability to take on some of these new freight and new opportunities,
what seems to be very, very good margins going forward.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Yes, you did the math. And yes, that was excluding some of the transaction costs and some other things,
too. So it's pretty simple math. Yes, the railroad is running efficiently.

When we stretch, as we've all said, that's a million, million times, it's not about OR. This is not about
how low can we go, how many heads can we take out. When we run the railroad good, when we stretch
like we're doing right now, and the reason we're stretching is because we're trying every single hour of
every single day to move our customers' freight. And when you do that and you focus on getting it there
as quickly as you can and as efficiently as you can, it resulted in -- unfortunately, not a perfect service
product but a very good service product in difficult times. You do it efficiently.

And as a result of that, the score adds up that says, you got a low operating ratio. That's not the goal.
That's just a result. And so yes, we run up a pretty good number. I would have preferred to do a lot more
business. As we said, we could have and we try to do every single day. We try to move more freight. Kevin
is out there right now, constantly trying to figure out how he can provide solutions to our customers. Our
goal here is to move more freight. That's what we do: we move freight. And the more freight we move,
the more revenue deploying the type, the more efficiently you operate it, as simple as that. It's just math.

So it's -- think about what -- think about -- you want to worry about what the operating ratio was? Think
about what the operating ratio could be for the railroad industry if they were able to grow more than
they've historically grown. And you can start talking about what the operating ratios might be. Stop
thinking about how much cost you can take out.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors.

Bascome Majors
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Jim, as you alluded to earlier, you've been talking about hiring to support growth since January. Certainly
doubled down that -- on that in July, and it's been a big topic today. But at this point, it doesn't feel like

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

our U.S. competitors are talking as much about labor and some of the challenges there that they're having
as you are today. And maybe while that's a messaging difference rather than a fundamental difference,
you got a letter from the STB on Monday about CSX service specifically. So can you help us understand, is
there something different with your situation with labor versus your other public peers in the U.S.? Is it a
messaging difference? Just anything to help us unscramble this would be helpful.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, I'm trying to unscramble it for myself. And yes, I've said from the very beginning of this year
that we had a challenge in terms of hiring. We needed to hire. I thought we would be able to hire like we
always had. We weren't able to hire like we always did and said that now for 3 quarters.

Yet my metrics, as I reported to the STB in terms of all of the railroads, whether it be velocity, whether
it be dwell, my service metrics are continuing to lead in those areas. So the railroad here is still running
better than most.

During that period of time, where we were finding out that a lot of people wanted to make career choices
and leave the company that we hadn't expected, we were having the difficulties that everybody else was
having during that period of time. We were the epicenter of the world in terms of the pandemic here in
Jacksonville. So I think we got probably hit during that period of time a little more severely. The states of
Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi have had a little more rough time, and I'm
not calling out any reasons why that might be. That's just the facts.

And so while we have been saying publicly, we are hiring as fast, aggressively anyone right now that will
want to come and work here during the midst of the worst of the pandemic in the world ongoing in our
service territory. And yes, guess what, I got a letter. Well, the STB takes in complaints from customers,
and they relay them to me. So we'll respond. They're just doing their job. We'll respond. I found it a little
unfortunate, but under the circumstances of everything we're doing based upon what our overall service
metrics show our performance to be, based upon how the STB measures us in terms of how we operate,
that we got the letter. But I'm a big boy. I've been around. We'll deal with it. We'll respond. We'll work with
the regulator and our customers to try and address any customer issues.

The letter is posted, if you can figure out who the customer is that's having a problem from the letter, I
don't know why they just don't call me to tell every customer I need. I give them my business card. I gave
him my cell phone number. I said, "You got an issue, give me a call." And Jamie Boychuk's the same way.
So I wish they'd just call me if there's a challenge.

Operator

Your next call comes from the line of Jon Chappell.

Jonathan B. Chappell
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Kevin, the theme of the earnings season has been pricing power. And obviously, there's things like
accessorials that are helping intermodal, but your whole core business has been kind of reset a bit higher
on the revenue per carload front. So the question is, what's the stickiness of some of these pricing
increases that have gone in? And where does the total portfolio sit on a contractual basis as we think
about maybe the ability to continue to push pricing higher this quarter or two?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. Look, I've gotten a couple of pricing questions already, and I'm going to stick to the script for the
most part. It's a discussion we're having with our customers. We're being transparent around the cost
pressures that we face and that we expect to cover those costs. But we also want to talk about volume
growth with our customers, wallet share and all those other things.

CSX CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

We do have parts of our business that you're well aware of, coal, which moves with the benchmark prices.
So we have seen some favorability there. We participate when our customers are participating in a good
market. And obviously, when those markets come down, we participate on the other side as well.

Intermodal businesses, some other parts of our business are tied directly to inflation. Metrics and those
have moved up. And so we'll see some favorability in those parts of our business that are tied to those
indices. And those will continue to probably flow through into the fourth quarter and into next year. So
we'll have some momentum there.

And then obviously, this is probably -- our expectations for inflation in the next year are higher than the
previous year, last year. And so we'll have those discussions and price accordingly. I'll probably leave it at
that.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Gentlemen, congratulations on that impressive OR. I wanted to drill down a little bit on a comment
you made about some onshoring production due to sort of supply chain issues. Is that sort of a one-off
customer? Is this a trend you're seeing? And then also, are you having customers coming to you telling
you that they might change sort of how they run their inventories in the future?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Absolutely. There's -- I can think of multiple industries right now, and you've seen some announcements
from some large producers out there that are making incremental investments in U.S. production. I think
they're looking at the volatility and how much -- how costly it is to get freight from overseas. Labor is less
of a component in some of these production facilities than it's ever been. So that labor differential moving
in here to U.S., this doesn't matter as much. It's more about having availability to the inventory. And the
onshore phenomenon, I hope, has legs here. We're seeing the early signs of that. You've seen some big
announcements. I hope we'll see some further announcements coming forward.

And we talked about this with the energy renaissance here a number of years ago when we had cheap
energy, with gas and oil and the fracking. That never materialized. I think this time, in my opinion, could
be different. I think all the things are starting to align for our customers and others to reconsider where
they want to have production and more balanced so they don't run into the same issues that they're
having currently.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And in terms of total inventories carried, are you seeing a change there as well?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

I certainly think there's more -- customers are reevaluating forward positioning inventory levels. We're
having those discussions around our TRANSFLO products. So they don't need next-day shipping or
things like that, but they're forward positioning those things so they can make sure that their production
facilities remain up and running. That's very, very important. So all these factors are, I think, playing into
investments that we'll see customers make over the next couple of years.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I guess I wanted to -- we talked a lot about labor and some of the issues that are impacting there. But
just thinking about maybe the opportunity to actually get a little bit more volume through. And specifically,
we've talked about coal, but curious what your customers are talking about with respect to sort of further
ramp up there?

And also on the intermodal side, we've seen the steamships diverting cargoes away from Savannah, for
instance, to get into Jacksonville or other places on the East Coast, trying to fit more volume through the
system. But I guess the question is, how capable are you of accommodating some of those things?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Well, look, you've seen the East Coast ports outgrow the West Coast ports for the last number of years.
That's going to continue to -- ongoing. Savannah's making significant investments. All the ports that we
operate into are making investments to be able to handle that. So we're well positioned. Whether it's
Savannah, Charleston, Jacksonville, Tampa, all those locations are areas where we have the ability to
serve. So we're ready to take on that volume. We've made some investments. Our intermodal network
continues to be the best network in the East operationally. There's no question around that. You just look
at the service metrics, look at the growth, we've been able to handle that better than anybody else. And
we'll continue to leverage that product into the market.

Benjamin Joel Nolan
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Sure. So there's not a -- there's no near-term [ inhibitant ] to being able to put more volume through
some of the network, I guess, is the question?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

We talked about all the capacity.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Yes, clearly, we have the rail capacity. We're well positioned with all of the ports. And again, it's not
just international steamship companies that are coming. It's plastics, imports, exports, there's a lot of
merchandise business -- both business that we move through these ports as well. And so yes, we're
working with them through the transload facilities, either our own facilities or partnering with people who
are building a big, big, big transload facilities along the coast to be able to handle the capacity. And we
clearly, as I said earlier, 30% room on the railroad to handle the traffic without making any more big
investments.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman.

Congratulations. Just some questions for Kevin. I'm trying to get used to my model with Quality Carriers in

attributable to the inclusion of Quality?
