With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Powell Brown, President and Chief Executive
Officer. You may begin.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Cecilia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021
earnings call. Q3 was another very good quarter for Brown & Brown. This was a result of our nearly
12,000 teammates delivering creative risk management solutions for our customers. We delivered
strong top line growth driven by a combination -- by the combination of robust new business, good
retention, rate increases and some expansion of exposure units. At the same time, our team continued
to drive profitable growth, resulting in impressive margin improvement and adjusted earnings per share
expansion. We're also very proud that last week, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of 10.8%
in our quarterly dividend. Of note, we've now increased our dividend for the 28th year in a row.

Now let's transition to the results for the quarter, I'm on Slide 3. We delivered $770 million of revenue,
growing 14.3% in total and 8.5% organically. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the
performance of our segments. Our EBITDAC margin grew by 280 basis points to 35.6% versus the third
quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the third quarter was $0.52 on an as-reported basis and
$0.58, excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. During the quarter, we completed
another 7 acquisitions and would like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined
during the quarter.

In summary, we're really pleased with our strong performance for the third quarter and the first 9 months
as the year-to-date results are the best in our history, 10.8% internal growth year-to-date. Later in the
presentation, Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail.

I'm now on Slide 4. We have customers that have done well throughout the pandemic and others that
are struggling to fully reopen, mainly due to the inability to hire employees. We are seeing this challenge

in a number of industries and geographies. And as a consequence, restricting how fast companies can
become fully operational. In addition to shortages of workers, supply chain issues and inflation are putting
pressure on costs. From a placement standpoint, the themes are pretty consistent. Customers with
good loss experience are getting the best rates and coverage while those with tough loss experience are
seeing material rate increases or reductions in available limits or both. As a result, customers continue
to consider program modifications to manage their premium increases. Rate increases remain relatively
consistent with prior quarters. Admitted market rates continue to be up 3% to 8% across most lines. The
outliers are workers' compensation rates, which are down 1% to 3% and commercial auto rates, which are
up 5% to 10%.

From an E & S perspective, most rates were up 10% to 20% with some outliers. Coastal property, both
wind and quake, are up 10% to 30% with this being a slightly broader range than we saw in the previous
quarter. Professional liability for most accounts remain very challenging with rates up 10% to 15-plus
percent. Cyber rates, in some instances, could increase dramatically depending on the security in place
with the customer. Security protocols that were viewed as nice to have in the past are now viewed as
a minimum expectations to obtain coverage. Also, excess umbrella coverage remains very difficult to
place. For professional liability, cyber and umbrella, we're seeing carriers reduce limits while seeking
significant rate increases. Florida and California placements in E & S for personal lines remain the most
challenging due to losses or aggregate concentrations. We expect the appetite for personal lines and cat
areas to continue to be constrained in 2022, which will likely put pressure on state-sponsored programs
and the cost of insurance for the consumer. From an M&A perspective, we were successful in closing 7
transactions during the quarter with annual revenues of approximately $21 million. We've closed a total
of 11 deals year-to-date with annual revenues of $65 million, and I've already announced a couple of
additional acquisitions in October. Our pipeline remains full, and we feel good about our level of activity
and engagement with prospective sellers.

On Slide #5. let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered great results with organic
revenue growth of 8.3% for the third quarter. The performance was driven by growth from all lines of
business through a combination of strong new business, good retention, rate increases and exposure
unit expansion. We're leveraging our broad capabilities to benefit our customers and prospects. National
Programs delivered another outstanding quarter, growing 13.2% organically. Our growth was driven by
the strong performance from most programs due to new business, good retention and rate increases.
The Wholesale Brokerage Segment delivered a 5.1% organic growth with commercial brokerage and
binding performing well, driven by new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage.
Personal lines and coastal states continues to be a headwind, as I mentioned earlier. The Services
Segment delivered organic revenue growth of 0.5%. The performance for the quarter was driven by claims
processing revenue associated with recent weather events, which was substantially offset by external
factors continuing to impact our advocacy businesses. Overall, it was a great quarter across the board.

Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on Slide #6. Like previous quarters, we'll
discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the third quarter, we delivered
total revenue growth of $96.3 million or 14.3% and organic revenue growth of 8.5%. Income before
income taxes and EBITDAC both increased by approximately 24%. EBITDAC margins expanded 280 basis
points driven by strong organic revenue growth and managing our expenses. Net income increased by
$12.4 million or 9.3%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 10.6% to $0.52. The effective
tax rate increased to 25.5% for the third quarter of this year as compared to 15.5% in the third quarter
of last year. The tax rate for the current quarter is in line with previous guidance while the prior year was
driven by the tax benefit associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards. We continue to anticipate
our full year effective tax rate for 2021 will be in the 23% to 24% range. Our weighted average number of
shares increased slightly compared to the prior year, and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 and
or 9.4% compared to the third quarter 2020.

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

We're over on Slide #7. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition
earn-out payables for both years, which we believe presents a more meaningful year-over-year
comparison. The change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a charge of $23.1 million in
the third quarter of this year compared to $15.3 million for the same period last year. Excluding these
noncash items, income before income taxes on an adjusted basis increased by 26.4%. Our net income
on an adjusted basis increased by $16.7 million or 11.4%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share
was $0.58, increasing 11.5%. The lower growth of earnings per share and net income for the quarter as
compared to the growth of income before income taxes was driven by the change in the effective tax rate.
Overall, it was a very strong quarter on the top and bottom line.

I'm going to move over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance.
For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 14.6%, and our contingent commissions and
GSCs increased by 27.1% as we qualify for certain additional contingents and GSCs this year. Organic
revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates increased
by 8.5%.

Over to Slide #9. The Retail Segment delivered total revenue growth of 17.8%, driven by acquisition
activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 8.3% with solid growth across all lines
of business. EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 180 basis points and EBITDAC grew 24.6%
due to higher organic revenue growth, increased contingent commissions and GSCs and managing our
expenses even with slightly higher variable cost. The growth in income before income tax as compared to
EBITDAC for all segments is impacted by changes in intercompany interest, amortization, depreciation and
estimated acquisition earn-out payables.

Over to Slide #10. Our National Programs Segment increased total revenue by 13.7% and organic
revenue by 13.2%. In conjunction with the onboarding of a new customer, we recognized approximately
$5 million of incremental revenue this quarter that represents timing. We expect the incremental revenue
from this customer to more than likely be recognized within the first half of 2022. EBITDAC increased
by $18.7 million or 28.5% with the margin improving 510 basis points as a result of strong organic
revenue growth, managing our expenses and the positive impact of the nonrecurring write-off of certain
receivables that occurred in the third quarter of last year.

Over to Slide #11. The Wholesale Brokerage Segment delivered total revenue growth of 11.2% driven by
acquisitions in the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 5.1%. EBITDAC grew 4.7%, but the
growth was impacted by incremental broker compensation driven by higher levels of performance, slightly
higher variable cost and certain nonrecurring intercompany IT charges.

On Slide 12. Our Services Segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 0.5% with EBITDAC
growing 6.8%, driven by continued management of our expenses.

Few comments regarding cash conversion and liquidity. We experienced another strong quarter of cash
flow generation and have delivered $628 million of cash flow from operations through the first 9 months of
this year, growing $88 million or 16% as compared to the first 9 months of last year. Our ratio of cash flow
from operations as a percentage of total revenue remained strong at 27% for the first 9 months of this
year. With the combination of our cash generation and capital availability, we are well positioned to fund
continued investments in our business.

With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Andy, for a great report. We've had an outstanding first 9 months of the year and believe we
are well positioned to continue profitable growth. As we look towards the remainder of the year and
into '22, we expect business confidence to improve and exposure units to expand. The main influencers
of increased confidence and business expansion will be: One, the availability of employees across
all industries; two, the resolution of supply chain constraints; three, inflation. Is it transitory, or is it
sustained? And four, the continued management of COVID. How and when these play out over the coming

quarters will influence the trajectory of the economy. From an underwriting perspective, we anticipate
premium increases will continue to moderate for many lines with the exception of cyber, professional
excess and automobile. The M&A market will continue to be very active and valuations will remain at
a heightened levels as a result of many buyers with a lot of available capital. We feel that we're well
positioned with a good pipeline to attract great companies to join the Brown & Brown team. We will
continue with our disciplined approach of focusing on culture and financial alignment as these have been
key to our long-term success of delivering shareholder value. From an innovation standpoint, our focus is
to constantly and consistently deliver creative solutions for the benefit of our customers, prospects and
teammates. We're making good progress and are continuing to align on common operating platforms for
each division, enhancing our customer-facing applications to make it easier to do business with Brown &
Brown and leveraging our data to the benefit of our customers.

In summary, the results were outstanding for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, and we
are uniquely positioned to succeed in this ever-changing marketplace.
With that, let me turn it back over to Cecilia for the Q&A session.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Greg Peters from Raymond James.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on your quarter. I guess Powell and Andy, you talked about the outlook for -- you talked
the economy, principally and obviously, that in pricing, which will lead to how the organic sits out over the
course of the next year or two. And I guess the biggest -- one of the bigger issues that we get questions
about is just what should we be thinking about organic next year? And I know you don't project or
comment on organic. So when you talk about the supply chain constraints and then at the same time, you
talked about improved business confidence, it's kind of seems like they're moving in opposite direction. So
any other guideposts you can give us for organic as we think out next year would be helpful.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Greg, first of all, thanks for the comments. As you know, we don't give organic guidance. And it is
interesting because you -- what you're referencing is true. There's a little bit of kind of differences of
opinions and things that are occurring out there in the economy where you can have -- let's just take
construction is off the hook in many parts of the country. And yet in those same parts of the country, we
have customers that are in the restaurant business that can't hire enough servers. And so I'm sorry, we're
not going to be able to give you an answer to your question specifically. But I can tell you, it is interesting
because most of the people we talk to have a pretty positive outlook on the future. It's just that their
cost of goods sold or services sold or whatever, is going up, and they don't know to how much. So it's
conceivable they will sell more of their product, whatever that is, but have a slightly lower margin next
year.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Right. That, I guess, is effects of inflation. I guess -- in conjunction with your strong organic revenue
results, I guess, one of the other areas, it would be for you, compensation. If you look at the margin
improvement, substantial margin improvement and there's a lot to unpack there, whether it's T&E or
lower comp. But the -- it seems like you might have some pressure as we look forward just because of the
organic revenue results that you're producing and the possibility of higher T&E. So maybe you can cover
that as well.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So let's talk about -- first of all, we are in a very competitive environment for talent, and we have
been. So this is not new, that's number one. Number two, as you know, we're a pay-for-performance
company, and we think we have great teammates, and we want to do everything to retain the teammates
that are currently on the team, and then we want to optimistically and opportunistically acquire new talent
to enhance growth opportunities in segments of our business. And so I would say that we will constantly
and consistently, whether it's now or 3 years ago or 3 years from now, are evaluating how we compensate
our teammates, how we reward people, what that means in terms of long-term alignment with what we're
trying to build. And I think the other thing that people sometimes confused the issue is, it is not linear
hiring necessarily. And so it's not like you can say, well, we're going to hire 3 people and 1 person retire.
We're going to hire 3 people. It's not like that. It's one of these things where we want the best athletes on
the field. So it's conceivable that next year, we hire a lot more people in certain segments of our business,
either to service our customers or to produce new business or some combination thereof. So I look at it
as our investment in salary and related is not just increasing cost on existing teammates. It's actually

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

building in and compensating for new hires that are not in our current budget that are so talented that we
can't afford not to hire them.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Andy here. Just a couple of things, I think, on the question about T&E. You're at least thinking about in the
right direction. I think we try to be really consistent on this topic, which is, we don't know exactly where
the new levels of spend will end up for T&E. They will realistically go up over time. I don't know if they'll
get all the way back to where they were probably pre-COVID potentially, we'll see what that looks like.
But we -- as you saw that what we did last year and what we've done this year is we're trying to focus
the best we can on how do we deliver profitable growth. That will move up and down over time based
upon how our costs move back and forth inside of the organization. But we probably at least manage
everybody's expectation. We've had a great 2021 already. The likelihood of that level of further expansion
next year could be challenging with some of the items that you mentioned.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Great. Just a point of clarification around hiring because I know one of your competitors was out talking
and promoting all the new hiring success they've had. Powell, can you talk about your recruiting program
and maybe a stat -- give us a status update on your retention versus new hires?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So one of the things that I'm always interested in is I think the big print give us and the small print
take it away. And so when somebody comes out and says we've hired X many people, I don't know if they
countered that by saying how many people retired or did they have any turnover affiliated with that, I
don't know. But what I would say relative to us is, as you know, we're actively recruiting in all cycles of
the business. And our retention today is at our historic levels. That does not mean that we don't have
people trying to call our people and trying to spirit them away. But our retention levels are at historic
levels. That's number one. And number two, our hiring, I think, is good. We're not going to give you a
number like that other firm because that's not the way we operate. I would just tell you that we feel
really good about how we bring people into the organization, how we continue to train and enhance our
capabilities to deliver for our customers, and how we launch people to taking on more responsibility,
whether it be in a leadership role in an existing office or in a different office. So I think of this as it is a
busy time in terms of talent any -- for any business, anybody, and we're no different. But I feel really good
about where we are in the recruiting process, the development process and the retention process.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Mike Zaremski from Wolfe Research.

Michael David Zaremski
Wolfe Research, LLC

Maybe piggybacking off some of the color about what has been just excellent margin improvements and
obviously organic growth. So if I hear the commentary correctly from Andy, it sounds like if not to expect
-- you kind of alluding to tougher comps, but it sounds like you're saying you can maybe maintain the
current margin base when you said kind of not to expect this level of improvement next year. So I just
want to make sure I'm kind of directionally thinking about it correctly, and there weren't some kind of --
maybe some onetime items we should be or just tougher comps we should be thinking about that could
move the margins around a little bit within our models?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So Mike, remember, first of all, we don't give organic growth guidance and we don't give margin
guidance. We said over and over and over that we think we're a mid- to single-digit organic growth

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

business in a steady-state economy. And our margin profile is 30% to 35%. And having said that, we are
going to -- I'm going to reiterate what Andy said, which is we're going to invest in the business as we
see fit to grow and service our existing customer base and to write a lot of new business going forward.
So having said that, we don't believe 1 quarter is a trend. That's important to note. We had a very good
quarter, and we feel really good about our year-to-date organic growth and our margin. But again -- once
again, it's -- there's -- we're not going to be able to say anything to anybody here today that's going to
be able to get you to lock in on a number for your margin profile next year because we can't tell you, nor
would we, but we can't tell you how many people we're going to hire, and how many opportunities we're
going to have to build out capabilities or enhance current capabilities on our team. So I'm not trying to
be frustrating to you, Mike, but the answer is we're kind of consistent. I know that's boring, but we're
consistent. And we continue to do what we say and say what we do.

Michael David Zaremski
Wolfe Research, LLC

Not at all boring. It's good in this business a lot of times. But I guess just as a follow-up to that question,
a couple of peers, I guess, as the pandemic has played out, have kind of laid out some specific kind
of efficiency measures that they think will persist beyond the pandemic that kind of lead to greater
efficiencies. Is Brown undergoing any of those kind of exercises that could be kind of permitting down and
helping out the income statement?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So let me address that. We're not doing something that says we're going to eliminate 40% or 30%
of our real estate footprint and all that, we're not doing that. You got to understand that we were very
efficient before. So I said earlier, we're kind of boring, we're kind of consistent. Well, we are boring
and consistent. The answer is we will continue to evaluate real estate in the manner that we've always
evaluated it based upon the needs of specific offices. And in doing so, is there a potential scenario where
there could be some reduction in some cases and expansion in other places? The answer is absolutely. But
we believe that the work or return to the office environment is going to continue to modify in the future.
That doesn't mean that we can't have work from anywhere, which I think we're a work from anywhere
company. But I don't want to give you -- there's nothing that I'm aware of, and I'm looking at Andy now
to see that there's -- I'm not aware of any permanent changes. The only thing that -- and we don't have
visibility into it as how T&E responds back.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Michael, I guess, I think if you go back to our comments last year, and there were a lot of questions
everybody had of us of why we weren't putting mandates in place in order to drive all the cost out. And we
said at that stage because we've got complete confidence in all of our leaders that they will know how to
navigate through the process. That's part of the reason why we have industry-leading margins that we've
had for decades as an organization. So we run a very profitable business. We're very proud of that. So we
don't have a lot of just excess costs just sitting around that we just cut out one day just because we think
we're constantly looking at where we invest in our business, where we need to put our chips, where we
need to pull them back, et cetera, in order to make sure that we invest for the long term, but also deliver
good shareholder value.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

I think also, Mike, it's important, and I know you know this, that the industry-leading margins also go
hand-in-hand with industry-leading cash conversion. So that's real in terms of our ability to invest dollars
that we earn back into our business. That's equally as important and very -- we're really proud of that.

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

That's helpful. If I could sneak 1 last one in real quick. I noticed the press release about unifying the -- in
the retail segment, the brand name Brown & Brown, among all the, I think, the branches. Any significance
to that? Or any -- to the thought process behind that decision?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Again, no. It's -- we've had the opportunity to acquire a number of really talented business teams and
businesses over the last 5 to 10 years. And unifying goes to -- in terms of going to market, it eliminates
any potential confusion that a competitor could try to spin on us when we're talking to them about our
large account, medium account, small account capabilities. So don't read too much into it. We're really
pleased, and we're all Brown & Brown anyway. But we're just calling everybody in retail Brown & Brown
going forward. So don't read too much into it.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question on retail. You guys have some strong growth throughout this year. Obviously, spot a little
bit in the third quarter, but I think a bunch of that was just because the benefits business is very half year
on heavy and that performed really well. Can you give us a sense of the components of retail benefits
versus your traditional brokerage business, and what you saw within organic growth in the third quarter
relative to the first half of the year?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Okay. So let me just unpack that, Elyse. So number one, we were pleased with the 8.3% organic growth
in retail, which we call out. We don't give growth by line of business, as you know. And as it relates to
benefits, what we have said is our benefits are about 1/3 of our retail business. So I think that answered
what you said, but did I hit what you wanted?

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. I was just curious if like -- which just sounds like you're not going to provide this detail, which makes
sense, but just how benefits did and the rest of the business in the third quarter relative to the growth
that you saw at the start of the year, but it sounds that you're just not going to break out that left.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And you know my answer, Elyse, it's good. It was good in the first half, and it's good now. So we're
pleased, but we're not going to disclose that -- like I said, that's part of the deal.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Elyse, just go back to our prepared comments, one of the things we said in there is that all lines of
business grew during the quarter, and we're pleased with the performance all the way across.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then in terms of wholesale, you guys saw a slowdown in growth in that business. But you did point to
personal lines being a headwind. So is that really what drove the slowdown within wholesale? Can you just
give us a sense of without giving us numbers within the businesses, but just the core trends, and what's
going on to the wholesale business?

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

So let me make 1 observation that I think is important. As I said earlier, we don't believe 1 quarter
makes a trend. So remember, the business year-to-date is growing 8%, and we're very pleased with how
wholesale is doing year-to-date, number one. Number two, and I know you know this, but remember, our
business is slightly more binding authority than brokerage. And some of the other firms that you would
have transparency into are usually the reverse. So there are more brokerage than binding. And then on
top of that, as I said, we have a component of that binding authority business, which is personal lines,
which is being dramatically impacted in California and Florida. In California, as you can tell, it's not just
losses, but it's actually people trying to get off of policies and the insurance commission are not letting
them in certain areas. And in Florida, it's a people being non-renewed in some instances, by standard
markets and having to flow into Citizens. So what you've got is you've got 2 environments, where it's -- I
don't even know if I'd say transitory because that's not the right term, it's a -- there are 2 personal lines
markets that are huge that are influx. And so that has created a headwind for us. And so that's what I can
tell you about it. But that is what I would pretty much put that on.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then 1 last one. Andy, you guys had spoken with the noncash stock-based comp. I
think the expectations was flat for the year. That trended up this quarter, probably reflective of the strong
growth that you guys have seen this year. So I'm assuming we'll probably end up seeing that up for the
year, just given that there's 1 quarter last year. Any kind of new commentary there about the noncash
stock-based comp?

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. No, that's correct. We're up about $3 million year-to-date versus the prior year, and that is all based
upon incremental performance that we've been seeing on both top line as well as on earnings per share.
So we'd expect that to probably continue into the back end of the year, Elyse.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Mark Hughes from Truist.

Mark Douglas Hughes

You're saying -- your comment about margins. I think you said...

J. Powell Brown

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes, yes.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Can you hear me now?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes, go ahead.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Very good. Andy, you -- in talking about margins, just to clarify, I think you said you don't expect
the magnitude of the margin improvement that you've seen this year to happen next year. That doesn't
mean you won't get margin improvement or there isn't the potential for margin improvement next year. Is
that a fair reading?

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, there is, I guess, probably just as much likelihood that we would have some upside as we would have
some downside next year. In the business just based upon we're investing. We're just trying to manage
everybody's expectations.

Mark Douglas Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Exactly. Okay. Then when we think about inflation, is there a reason not to think that, that will be a
tailwind if you've got customers with higher revenue, higher asset values, if carriers are seeing maybe
some loss inflation, wouldn't that be a net benefit for you, maybe offset by some of your customers,
seeing some impact from -- on their businesses from inflation. Should we think about it as a net positive?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think it depends on the industry, and that's -- I'm speculating when I say that a little bit because,
as you know, inflation is a function of 2 things. It's a function of money supply, which there's a lot of
money in the consumer's hands. And number two, velocity of that money, and there are consumers that
are spending a lot of that money in certain areas. So -- and at many customers' cases, if we just stay with
our customers for a moment, their revenues may go up, but their cost of goods sold or cost of services
sold may go up more quickly. So it could have a potential positive impact in the short term, but then there
are other businesses that could be negatively impacted. So I think my position right now is more of a
neutral. Andy, how would you respond to that?

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I think, Mark, the other piece to that is, if you look at it in isolation, that's probably a very fair
comment. The one thing that is a variable that happens is how does the buyer of insurance modify how
they think about their total cost of insurance? Because if their costs are going up, et cetera, and they're
trying to manage their way through they may evaluate their deductibles, their aggregates, et cetera,
inside of this. So there's just -- there's always a lot of moving factors just to kind of keep in mind. There's
just not 1 that's kind of linear that drives the organic?

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then a final question. Andy, you mentioned National Programs, you got $5 million in
incremental revenue from timing. And then I think you had suggested there would be more incremental
revenue from that program in the first half. Can you say anything about 4Q? And can you say anything
about the magnitude of the incremental revenue in the first half?

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

So we pull that apart a little bit. So in the case of the $5 million, that was a new customer that we
onboarded, just we onboarded it quicker than anticipated. We would have thought it would have kind of
been over the third and fourth quarter. And what normally happens on some of those accounts is you're
going to end up there's kind of a lag when you transition from a previous provider out there that's what
represents the $5 million that will show up over the first half of next year. And then we haven't changed
any of our commentary on the fourth quarter versus what we said last quarter. And if you recall, we said
there would be potentially $4 million to $6 million of revenue moving from the third quarter to the fourth
quarter. We still stand behind that comment.

Operator

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

If I can just tag on to Mark's question. Is that $4 million to $6 million moving to the fourth quarter? Is that
also onetime that will correct next year? Or is that now in the fourth quarter, now it's new home?

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. That will be the new home for it, Meyer. So almost similar to the $5 million, that's kind of when,
again, we onboard accounts we'll see that we'll pick up incremental revenue and then when it comes
around to renewal cycle ends up in the appropriate period. [Technical Difficulty] Now, you keep on the $4
million to $6 million -- just keep in mind on that one, the way that we were suggesting to everybody is,
once you had your estimate for the third and fourth quarter, then you probably wanted to move $4 million
to $6 million. What you don't want to do now is now take $4 million to $6 million out of the third quarter
and move it to the fourth. So that would be incorrect.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Right. I'm sorry, moved out of the third quarter, if I understand correctly.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Exactly. So most of you guys all have those in your models anyway. So don't do it again, you'll double
count.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it, okay. Can you give us an update in terms of when the advocacy businesses within services should
normalize?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

We wish we could tell you that, but if you could give us some insight about what's going on in Washington,
we could answer that, and I'm not trying to be flipping, Meyer. I'm just saying that the processing of that

type of business is greatly impacted, as you know, by the government working at full steam or whatever
you want to call that, and that hasn't really been going on for a while. So you have backlog, and we don't
have an answer. It's not like we can say, 6 months from now, we don't know yet. So it's going to kind of
plot along.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I mean the other thing we know on those, Meyer, is it does work itself out over time. If you just go
back historically and look at that business, it goes through these cycles. We just don't know how long this
cycle is going to last.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's perfectly fair. Final question, if I can. Are you guys seeing any increase in compensation
expenses for non-client-facing folks?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

We're seeing -- as I said earlier, it's a competitive environment all the time. So in our business, we think of
that as all teammates. So we wouldn't isolate it to 1 group of teammates. It's to all teammates.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, to Powell's comment earlier, because we're in a competitive environment, salaries went up in 2019
versus 2018, they went up in [ 20% ]. So we see that in the marketplace all the time.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Right. I guess the question was more because we hear more rumblings of, I don't want to call it the great
resignation or things that seem unusual relative to past years instead of maybe the normal upward drift in
compensation?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

So let's answer that. That is absolutely happening across lots of businesses. But what I've said is that
our retention ratio is in line with what it has been historically. So I think that the magnitude of the last
18 months, has created lots of changes in many people's minds. And some people are deciding to leave
industries they've been in for long periods of time or make work life balance changes and things like that.
And so having said that, we see that affecting our customers all over the place. So it's real. We're here to
tell you it's real.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley.

Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Powell, in your opening comments, you talked about cost pressures for clients and went through a whole
host of reasons why these pressures there, one of which obviously is insurance. I don't know the extent to
which clients pay attention to profitability levels of insurance companies or not, I have no idea, but maybe
they do. I guess to what extent is that conversation coming into play more than ever before and maybe
impacting kind of how much they're willing to accept rate levels from carriers?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

Right. So generally speaking, clients are not focused on profitability of insurance companies. So that's
the first thing. The second thing that is important is depending on the conversation, there are sometimes
discussions around loss cost increases where your losses are going up 5%, 6%, 7%, meaning the cost of
the same loss year-over-year would be higher by, let's say, 7%. And what's happening now, if you listen
to the carriers, as they're talking about these very significant verdicts sometimes that would seem that
would be outside the normal. I don't like the term, but it's a nuclear verdict or something like that. And
you start to see some of these where the settlement might be X and then all of a sudden, it's 15x, you'd
expect. And so the short answer to the question is the customer is not generally focused on or dialed into
the performance of the insurance company. What she or he is focused on is, one, controlling their cost;
two, making sure they have the best cut, not in this order, coverage is the best coverage they can get;
and three, to the extent possible flexibility and options. Flexibility and options might be program designed.
So when you put all those together, that's kind of the course of the conversation. And in certain segments
of the marketplace, as you may know, there are limited options, and so therefore, there might be more
pricing pressure there than it would be on something that every insurance company really wants to write.
So therein lies the conundrum when we talk with our customers, but the key to that is making sure there's
-- to the extent possible, there's no real surprises. So talking to our customers early and often about what
we see in the marketplace, and how we come up with ideas to manage the process and their costs and
coverage going forward.

Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful, Powell. Just totally separate question. Another quarter of pretty severe weather
again and again and again, and this time includes lots of flood losses, which are even occurring today. So I
guess in your Services Segment, are you seeing any change in I guess, the competitive environment there
for others that want to kind of do what you do in that space given the kind of on slide and continuation of
frequency of flooding?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

The answer to the question is, there are lots of people that are trying different things in the flood space.
As a broad statement, I'm not aware of anything that is so new and different that it's earth shattering.
However, you're starting to hear more and more, Michael, about the interest of people to write more
private flood. And that's great, but the private flood, they don't want to really write in the worst flood
zones. So it's sort of like writing wind on a AAA construction building, where you have a low probability
of loss, lots of carriers would like that, but sometimes they aren't willing to price it that way. What we're
seeing is we're not seeing -- we're not -- I'm not aware of a program that can model flood with any great
statistical relevance and therein lies the challenge. So you know that we're going to risk rating 2.0 with
NFIP. You have discussions around looking at flood maps and are they appropriate. You have all kinds of
things going on, and there's a lot of discussion around, hey, this is a growth opportunity. And yet, the
private flood market is not writing an enormous amount of the segments that NFIP serves. So long-winded
answer, but I'm not aware of anything that's dramatically impacting the industry, but we're always trying
to; one, be creative and; two, plugged in to what's going on in Washington as it impacts our business and
our ability to service a broader customer base.

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

And Mike, keep in mind in our Services division, we do substantially no adjudication of flood claims. If you
recall, we sold that business a number of years ago. We still work with that business that's out there. But
if we're going to see claim activity, it's normally going to show up in our National Programs division.

We will now take our next question from Greg Peters from Raymond James.

BROWN & BROWN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

In your comments, and I know you've talked about the M&A market. Can you give us an update on the
multiples being paid and your appetite for expanding the bottom ground footprint beyond North America
into Europe and other areas?

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So Greg, I would tell you I think that it's always an interesting comment on a multiple of what?
Because people -- our definition of EBITDA or EBITDAC is different than other people. And so what we
might believe is a recurring expense they might try to take out. And so I would just -- I've kind of changed
the way I refer to it, which basically says valuations continue to be high as I said in the remarks, which
is, it continues to be at the very high end of the range. And I don't see that changing in the near to
intermediate term, that's number one. Number two, as we've talked about before, we bought a business
in January, as you know, of 2020, called Special Risk. It's in Vancouver, British Columbia, and we do
business across Canada. It's a wholesale operation with a bunch of great teammates, and we're very
pleased about that. And then we also bought in the beginning of this year, O'Leary Insurances in Ireland,
based in Cork, which we're equally as pleased about. And so if you think about those 2 areas, and our
business in London, those are areas where there's a rule of law. There is something that we typically do
business or have done and can do business there currently. And we're always looking for opportunities
that fit culturally and make sense financially. So lots of -- not you, Greg, but lots of investment people
think that sounds sexy. And I don't think that international expansion is sexy, I think it is -- I don't sleep
on airplanes, and it's not about me, but it's hard to do that when I fly to London, and I've got 3 hours
of sleep, I'm going to a meeting. So I say all that, trying to be a little tongue and cheek, but we look to
partner with people that we think fit culturally and make sense financially, and we're really -- we think that
there are some opportunities, but the question ultimately will be, can we make those work financially as
well.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And the other area I just was looking for some additional comments on would be the free cash flow
conversion. I know, Andy, you commented about that in your previous prepared remarks. It seems like
the free cash flow conversion rate is running at a slightly elevated rate relative to, say, the last 5 years,
is there any reason why we should expect that conversion rate to come down? Or are we in a new normal
type of environment in terms of what you -- looks like you're going to get this year?

R. Andrew Watts
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Thanks for the question, Greg. The -- we've talked about this in the past. We manage our working
capital very closely and have for years. That's part of what drives our high conversion ratio. The other is
the margins that we deliver as an organization, those 2 in combination. And if you look back to how our
margins have moved over the last few years, that's what pulls up in kind of that at least 27% on a year-
to-date range. It will probably maybe move by a few points back-and-forth, up and down a little bit, but
I wouldn't anticipate anything going down in the low 20s or anything of that nature. We are very, very
focused on making sure that we can grow our revenues into cash so that ultimately, we can take that cash
and invest it back into our business.

J. Powell Brown
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And obviously, we encourage you to evaluate that in other firms because if you have an expense
that's incurred that impacts cash. And so as I like to say, if you look at the cash that you earn it's not
really adjusted other than noncash items like change in acquisition earn-out payables. And you look at
that as a comparator to those that you have access to, it might be enlightening.

So we will take 1 more question. We're going to wrap up at the top of the hour, and I had a couple -- do
we have any other questions?
