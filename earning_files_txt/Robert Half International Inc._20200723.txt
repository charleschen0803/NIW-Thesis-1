ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to the Robert Half Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Our host for today's call are
Mr. Keith Waddell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Robert Half; and Mr. Michael Buckley, Chief
Financial Officer.

Mr. Waddell, you may begin.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone. We appreciate your time today.

Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-
looking statements, including predictions and estimates about future performance. These statements
represent our current judgment of what the future holds. However, they are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q
filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures and reference these
figures as "as adjusted." Reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a
supplemental schedule to our earnings press release.

For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our
website at roberthalf.com.

I'd like to begin by acknowledging that these past few months have been unlike anything most of us have
experienced in our lifetimes, with both the global economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
and the social unrest over racial injustice.

I'm so proud of how Robert Half has responded to these circumstances. Our employees and tenured
management teams have worked together to effectively manage our cost and aggressively pursue revenue
generation opportunities. We remain committed to serving our clients, candidates and partners. Since the
start of the pandemic, we have prioritized the health and safety of our employees. And virtually all our
global staffing and Protiviti employees have been working remotely. We have successfully maintained full
operations, even where our physical locations have remained closed.

Robert Half's second quarter results were clearly affected by the economic crisis resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic, most acutely in our staffing business. Protiviti had an outstanding quarter and
continues to benefit from strong solutions offerings and pipeline. We're encouraged by recent signs
of week-on-week sequential growth in our staffing operations. And although significant uncertainty
continues, we approach the third quarter with optimism.

Now let's take a look at Robert Half's second quarter 2020 financial results. Company-wide revenues were
$1.1 billion, down 27% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and down 26% on an as-
adjusted basis. Net income per share in the second quarter was $0.41 compared to $0.98 in the second
quarter 1 year ago.

As announced in our last earnings call, we've implemented actions to reduce our overall cost structure by
approximately 30% as compared to Q1 2020. The timing of those actions, which occurred over the course
of the quarter, as well as certain employee compensation-related items such as severance and salary
continuation reduced the savings actually reported in the second quarter to 24%.

Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $301 million, and capital expenditures were $8 million.
In June, we distributed a $0.34 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash

outlay of $38 million. There were no repurchases during the second quarter. We anticipate repurchase
activity to commence again in Q3 and at a reduced rate.

Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley.

Michael C. Buckley
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Keith, and hello, everyone. Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were
$1.108 billion in the second quarter. This is a decrease of 27% from the second quarter 1 year ago on a
reported basis and a decrease of 26% on an as-adjusted basis.

On an as-adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were down 33% year-over-year. U.S. staffing
revenues were $640 million, down 34% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $184 million,
down 31% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 88
locations in 17 countries outside the United States.

In the second quarter, there were 63.4 billing days, unchanged from the same quarter 1 year ago. The
current third quarter has 64.3 billing days compared to 64.1 billing days in the third quarter 1 year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the second quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-
over-year staffing revenues by $8 million. This decreased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue
growth rate by 0.6 percentage points.

Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the second quarter were $284
million. $225 million of that is from business within the United States and $59 million is from operations
outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global second quarter Protiviti revenues were up 4%
versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 6%. Non-U.S. revenues were down 2% on an
as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenue by $1
million and decreasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.5 percentage points. Protiviti and its
independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.

Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, second quarter
gross margin was 37.1% of applicable revenues compared to 38.2% of applicable revenues in the
second quarter 1 year ago. The year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage is primarily due to
lower conversion revenues. Our permanent placement revenues in the second quarter were 8.6% of
consolidated staffing revenues versus 11.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year
ago. When combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin decreased
260 basis points compared to the year ago second quarter to 42.5%.

For Protiviti, gross margin was $73 million in the second quarter or 25.7% of Protiviti revenues. 1 year
ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $76 million or 27.9% of Protiviti revenues.

Company-wide selling, general and administrative costs were 32.9% of global revenues in the second
quarter compared to 31.5% in the second quarter 1 year ago. Staffing SG&A costs were 39.1% of staffing
revenues in the second quarter versus 34.6% in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in staffing SG&A
as a percentage of revenue was significantly impacted by negative leverage as revenues decreased. In
addition, as Keith noted earlier, the timing of our cost reduction actions, including compensation-related
costs associated with employee terminations, impacted total SG&A expense for the quarter.

Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 15.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.3% of revenues
in the year ago period.

Company-wide operating income was $58 million in the second quarter. Operating margin was 5.3%.
Second quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $28 million and an -- with an operating
margin of 3.4%. Operating income for Protiviti in the second quarter was $30 million with an operating
margin of 10.6%.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Our second quarter tax rate was 20% compared to 28% a year ago. The relatively low second quarter tax
rate is a consequence of a lower anticipated full year tax rate compared to our full year estimate in the
first quarter. Our 6-month year-to-date rate of 28% is in line with what we expect for the full year.

Accounts receivable. At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable was $665 million. And implied
days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 54 days.

Before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the
second quarter and so far in July, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant
staffing divisions exited the quarter with June revenues down 33.7% versus the prior year compared to a
31.2% decrease for the full quarter. Revenues for the first 2 weeks of July were down 33% compared to
the same period 1 year ago. On a sequential week-over-week basis, we saw revenue growth for the last 3
weeks of June, and this has continued into July.

Permanent placement revenues in June were 46.1% versus June of 2019. This compares to a 49.1%
decrease for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of July, permanent placement revenues were down 35%
compared to the same period in 2019.

We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the second
quarter and into July. But as you know, these are very brief periods of time and we caution reading too
much into them.

With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenue, $1.09 to $1.20 billion; income
per share, $0.49 to $0.68. The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue decline of
26% on an as-adjusted basis, inclusive of Protiviti. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we
provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Mike. Only a few short months ago, we discussed our operations in an unprecedented
candidate-constrained labor market. In one quarter's time, we're now operating in a labor market with
unprecedented unemployment levels.

The experience of our tenured management team has driven a swift shift in strategic focus to embrace
this new operating environment. Our employees have found innovative ways to maintain connections with
candidates, clients and each other in a remote environment. We've seen opportunities for new success
with virtual client visits and by connecting clients to deep expertise from Protiviti on a virtual basis. We've
seen new opportunities arise across all of our lines of business in supporting a wide range of companies
and entities, financial institutions, state and local governments, large school districts, just to name a few.

The widespread global stay-at-home orders have accelerated trends in remote work, with many companies
indicating a permanent shift in their staffing strategies. We see increased demand as companies upgrade
their talent pools without regard to physical location of the candidate. Likewise, as remote work takes
a more prominent position, we see new demand for changing skill sets. Larger companies that have
temporarily furloughed employees are also seeking opportunities to upgrade or refine remote talent from
lower cost areas. And we see demand when furloughed employees are not able or ready to return to work.

We've managed through this crisis and have a solid foundation for thriving in the new normal. I'm proud of
the resilience our employees demonstrated in arguably the most unique period in the company's history.
We aggressively cut costs in the quarter, achieving our targeted reductions. These reductions, coupled with
a talent and driven team that is backed by industry-leading technology, position us to fully participate in
any economic recovery.
Now Mike and I'll be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up
as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations on the excellent cost management that you executed during the quarter. I'm wondering if
you can talk -- I have one short-term question about the trends in terms of what you're seeing and then
one longer-term question. In terms of the short-term question, can you just describe the percentage of
revenue that you're getting from different verticals across the U.S.? And to what extent are you impacted
by some of the areas that are going to be more permanently impacted, whether it's hospitality or retail?
And then what are you seeing from a geographic perspective as it relates to -- as the virus has moved
around the country, is the Northeast coming back and the Sun Belt being impacted? Or how should we
think about that? That's the short term.

And then the long-term is if you could describe a little bit more about how you think the ability to source
talent virtually will end up impacting the recovery when it eventually comes? To what extent could we
end up seeing an even faster snapback than what we normally see as you're able to leverage your huge
network across the country?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. So mix of revenues from an industry perspective, if you look at those industries where we're over-
indexed, I would call out professional services and financial services, and I'm talking relative to their
contribution to GDP. And the industries where we're under-indexed would be real estate, government and
hospitality. And so from the standpoint of impact of hospitality particularly, we don't have much exposure
to that. And financial services is actually a good place to be relative to COVID impacts.

As far as geographies -- and so we track this week-by-week, office-by-office, state-by-state, et cetera,
and there's not as much correlation as you would think. If you look at Florida, Texas, Arizona, California,
the last 6 weeks, by and large, they've consistently grown sequentially week-on-week just as our other
operations have. Now we're talking small single-digit percentage, but they're not significantly out of
line with what we're seeing otherwise. Interestingly, if you look at, for example, the entire quarter, our
revenue performance in New York and our revenue performance in California from a percentage standpoint
was very similar, even though, clearly, the impact of COVID was quite different.

So on your long-term question about ability to tap a larger pool by going outside local geographies, I'd
say, clearly, it will help short and long term. A, it'll give us the ability to get even more pinpointed skills
relative to what clients want and need. And two, it'll allow us to tap into lower cost areas, which will be for
the financial benefit of our clients as well, which should also help demand. So we see this shift to remote
work, at least on a hybrid basis, as a positive for us and for the industry, frankly.

Operator

Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Keith, I know the guide includes Protiviti, the 26%. So my question is, what's your assumption around
Protiviti in the third quarter? And could you also -- my second question is, could you just give us some
difference of thinking at the low end of the revenue range versus the high end of the revenue range,
because it's a reasonably broad range?

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. And so let me talk about the guide generally, and then I'll come back more specifically. And so at
the midpoint of our guide, not the low, not the high, at the midpoint, on the staffing side, it assumes that
we have small single-digit sequential growth from June levels, which is what we've seen, by the way,
for the last 6 weeks consecutively. On the Protiviti, we're talking low to mid-single-digit growth where
solution -- their solutions offerings, primarily technology, consulting and risk and compliance, regulatory
for financial institutions are leading the way. On the gross margin, we're talking about down 50 to 70 basis
points sequentially, primarily with lower conversions. Protiviti, down 1.5 to 1.75 percentage points on
slightly lower utilization in the internal audit practice.

From an SG&A standpoint, staffing, we get the full impact of the 30% savings less some modest increases
to tech spending that we plan. Plus the smaller, more experienced internal staff is going to be more bonus-
eligible as revenues rise. So you'll give back some of, a modest amount, not a large amount, of the 30%
in the quarter.

Protiviti third quarter SG&A, that's their big quarter to bring on-campus hires. So they have training costs
associated with that. Further, they're making -- they're aggressively hiring laterally at higher skill sets that
they need. So at Protiviti, they should be a consistent percent of revenue. Staffing should be 36%, 36.5%
as a percent of revenue. Which means from an operating income standpoint, you've got staffing, all of this
is at midpoint, staffing, 5% to 6% operating income; Protiviti, 11% to 14%; overall, 6% to 9%; tax rate,
28%; shares, 113 million.

Now more specific to your question, the low point of our guide -- I mean, frankly, Andrew, what we did
was we spent most of our time on midpoint. Then at the top, we said plus or minus 5%, 5% on the
bottom side, 5% on the top. And then we built up the P&Ls based on those 5% lower, 5% higher revenue
levels.

Operator

Your next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Wanted to focus on the perm side first. I'm just wondering, the rate of new assignments, how that's
been tracking, how it tracked in the quarter? And I know it's early in this quarter. And also from a deal
closing perspective, are you seeing any delays, because some of your clients want to meet the candidates
physically before they close the deal?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

So on perm, we've been pretty pleased with the new job order front as well as the deals closed front.
I'd say, pre-COVID, video interviewing was pretty broadly accepted, and that has continued and grown
from there such that we pretty routinely close perm deals where clients interact primarily via video with a
candidate.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And I know you have a sizable exposure to the small- and mid-sized business world. I'm just
wondering if you can talk about what's going on from a trend perspective. Did you see some clients close
up, but didn't come back? Any color would be great.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

So our SMB practice, which is 80% of our total, while clearly we saw hesitancy, we saw some pullback in
what their resource requirements were, we didn't see a lot of closings per se. As we've talked before, our

typical clients, between 50 and 100 employees, it's not sub-10. And so particularly with the PPP loans that
most of them got, it certainly sustained their existence for the quarter. NFIB publishes quite a bit. It claims
that most of the PPP money has been spent by the recipients. And frankly, all that remains there now at
the moment is for them to apply for the total forgiveness.

Operator

Your next question is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I guess I just -- any color you can provide on the commentary around the last 6 weeks, seeing some
week-to-week improvement in staffing revenue, is -- what's driving that? Are there pockets within that,
that are stronger and weaker? And I guess, how do you think about the sustainability of that trend from
here?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, clearly, as more and more states open and at different degrees, that has an impact -- a positive
impact on our revenue trends. The sequential improvements we've talked about are pretty broad. In fact,
almost universal across the U.S., even in the hotspots that we talked about earlier. That said -- and our
guidance is pretty conservative, because we do think there are going to be new flare-ups, they're going to
be rollbacks, there will be uncertainty created by that. And I think that's the new normal and at least until
there are therapeutics or a vaccine. Go ahead.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And the follow-up then, just on the trends internationally versus the U.S., I know your business is different
than the commercial staffing companies. But we've seen from some others and even from some of the
market data stronger performance or improvement moderation of declines, if you will, in a lot of the
European markets than maybe we've seen in the U.S. Are you seeing any major differences? The growth
rates for the quarter weren't dramatically different. So anything you'd call out?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

They aren't dramatically different. If you kind of look at the countries, I would say that France was harder
hit probably than any other country. You had Belgium, Germany, Australia that were a little less hit than
the average. And then you had U.K. kind of in the middle. But overall, I thought it was remarkable how
similar the impacts were to us between international countries and the U.S. I mean they were only a
couple of 3 percentage points different.

Operator

Your next question is from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust.

Jasper James Bibb
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

This is Jasper Bibb calling in for Tobey. I was wondering about any demand impacts you might be seeing
from furloughed workers with customers maybe first looking and burning back their own staff before hiring
temps?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Furloughs are an interesting and complicated situation. So let me just ramble for a little bit. And so I'd
say, first of all, furloughs are more prevalent at mid-cap and large-cap companies than they are at SMBs,

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

not that they don't exist at SMBs. I'd say further, the tax subsidy, which is this 50% retention credit you
get for the cost of furloughed employees, which for many companies they've continued the benefits,
including medical for those they furloughed, such that those people are eligible for unemployment, plus
they're still getting their medical costs covered by their employer.

But I believe that's highly motivated or significantly motivated by the fact that half the cost is paid for by
these retention credits. Net-net, we believe more of those furloughs will be terminations than is generally
thought to be the case by some. As to reasons why the furloughs won't be the first back, to some degree,
there are new skill requirements because of COVID, particularly to support remote work. Some companies
will look to upgrade skills, which is a friendlier labor market than when they hired some of the people they
furloughed. Further, they'll be looking to lower cost communities such they get a lower price point with
those new employees rather than bring back their furloughs.

And then further, from the standpoint of a furloughed employee, some may not want to come back. First
of all, they've got concerns about COVID and health risk. Second of all, with their children out of school
who need child care, they can't come back, because they have to provide that care. A lot of discussion
about the high level of unemployment benefits, the $600 federal supplement, I guess, the news is today
that's going to go down to $175 to $200. Further, the longer people are on furlough, the more likely they'll
look back to opportunities -- for other opportunities.

I guess, the point being we're not sure that the overhang that many perceive the furloughs to be on
staffing demand will, in fact, play out to the degree that it's assumed both from the standpoint of the
companies going first to them as they have new requirements; and secondly, from the willingness of
the furloughed employees to come back right now, not just because of the higher unemployment, but
importantly, because of the child care needs and the health care risk or the health risk. And everybody has
got a different risk profile in that way. So I said I was going to ramble and I did.

Jasper James Bibb
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

That all makes sense. And then as a follow-up, I was hoping you could just broadly speak to how you
expect cash flow to trend over the balance of the year. And if you saw any impact in the quarter from
payroll tax deferrals?

Michael C. Buckley
Executive VP & CFO

Well, cash flow was unbelievable in the quarter. We had $301 million of operating cash flow. $190 million
of that was receivables. We did defer about $38 million of FICA that was a piece of that $300 million. But
the good news is our receivables held up very well. While at face value, it looks like we lost 3 days in our
DSO; if you just look at our temp business, we lost 0 days. If you look at our perm business, because it
was more back-ended in the second quarter than the first, you've had less time to collect those. So that's
pure timing. And further, because Protiviti did so well, there's a mixed shift to Protiviti. Their collection
period, because they deal with bigger companies, is longer. So that had an impact. But net-net, our
receivables performed beautifully, and they were the lion's share of that $190 million receivable reduction
that went straight into cash.

So projection for the rest of the year, I mean, to the extent revenues level off and continue to head up a
little bit, you would see some of that receivable reduction reverse, but that would be a good thing. We'll
continue to have the FICA deferrals through the end of the year, which will help a little bit. But from a
balance sheet standpoint, from a cash flow standpoint, from a liquidity standpoint, we are rock solid.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Just if you think about the quarter, I know, obviously, it's really hard to think about kind of trends and
forecast. But when we spoke last, you had kind of talked about some level of optimism that the declines
exiting the first quarter, there was a bottom there. And you talked specifically about having some benefit
from helping out with the PPP loans. So I'm just curious, was there a onetime type revenue that really
started to fall out after the last earnings call? Or is there anything more specific to the trends that
deteriorated throughout the quarter?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we got some lift from helping clients submit their PPP loan application. We did not get much lift by
clients using the proceeds of their PPP loans to use our staff and have that qualify as payroll, which was
necessary to get forgiveness. I won't bore you with all the legalities, but there were different legal points
of view as to whether temporary payroll accounted as payroll for purposes of loan forgiveness. But we did
see some traction in helping prepare applications. And we do expect to see some traction in helping clients
fill out the forgiveness documentation as well, which is far from straightforward.

Ryan C. Leonard
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. And then on Protiviti, obviously, another great quarter and executed kind of above
what your expectations were. Is there still ongoing demand for, obviously, the cross-selling with the
staffing services? I guess how is the pipeline there, especially as people maybe start to reexamine
budgets, thinking that this is lasting longer than maybe initially anticipated?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. The joint solution offerings by Protiviti and staffing are doing great. They continue to grow nicely
during the quarter. Across Protiviti solutions I talked earlier, FSI, regulatory, technology, cyber privacy,
cloud, all that went great. As we talked about last time, internal audit was modestly impacted, kind of
down 9%, 10%. They had some exposure to energy, transportation, hospitality that were hit. Some of
internal audit is driven by discretionary spending, which was reduced a bit. But overall, Protiviti had a
wonderful quarter. We couldn't be more pleased.

In fact, it's even better than what you see, because the reported revenue grew by 4%. Their fees actually
grew by 8%. And the difference is the reimbursable expenses, because they didn't travel as much, didn't
get reported as revenue, because those expenses were incurred. But I would argue, on a real basis, they
grew 8%, not 4%. Pipeline is still strong. Protiviti is great as well as the cross-sell Protiviti using staffing
engagements, where it's applicable, and they continue to go to market together. A lot of the government
services work that we're doing, Protiviti has the GSA schedules. So -- but for Protiviti, staffing wouldn't
even participate in those engagements, but because of Protiviti, staffing and Protiviti together can go to
cities, states and service the demand that's there.

Your next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Crédit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wonder if you could give us a sense, as you talk about kind of sourcing candidates from different areas
kind of geographically. And then ultimately, how do you think about that within the context of pricing?
And then just the ability to work remotely more structural, did that impact one part of the business more
than other? Obviously, Protiviti, there's probably a lot more flexibility on that as opposed to other areas. I
guess, any thoughts on kind of those 2 puts and takes, if you could?

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Well, first of all, let me say that because we have a single global instance of sales force, any office can
access our candidate pool globally. And in fact, with our new AI, we automatically provide to our internal
staff a short list of candidates that -- where the geography was opened up nationally without there even
having to do anything. So from a technology support standpoint, we're in a very strong position to identify
remote candidates for clients.

As to pricing, to the extent they ultimately choose candidates that are in lower cost areas, that's okay.
We'll apply our margin to that. We're quite happy to do that. It's a win-win for everybody. We still get our
normal margins, and the client gets a lower total price point.

As far as is remote more applicable to some of our lines of businesses than others, clearly, Protiviti would
-- it would be the most prevalent, but Management Resources, Robert Half Technology, it's very prevalent.
Accountemps prevalent, not as prevalent as OfficeTeam, but certainly, things like customer support are
certainly candidates for remote work as well.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just real quick, on the margin side, any sense of where the conversion fee
settlement? Can you just remind us of kind of when you think about gross profit, just the range across
the different segments, how much is kind of gross margin? If you don't want to get specific, like just what
would the range be for Accountemps versus OfficeTeam? Anything like that would help us directionally.

Michael C. Buckley
Executive VP & CFO

Well, our gross margins for staffing temporary have been better than certainly what we experienced in the
last downturn. Last downturn, peak-to-trough, we were down 300 basis points. We're not even halfway
there so far. So that's a positive. Conversions are always significantly impacted. I think we're at 2.7% or
2.8% of revenue currently for conversion. That's versus 3.5% last quarter. They settled out in the last
downturn, just under 2%. So we're not that far from the bottom. But overall, I would argue our staffing
gross margins, our temporary staffing gross margins have held up better this time than given the revenue
impacts that I would have predicted, and that's a good thing.

As far as the difference by segment, the Management Resources has always had the highest gross
margins, Accountemps is kind of midpoint, OfficeTeam a little lower and Technology in the middle as well.
So there's not a huge, huge difference by line of business. I mean, clearly, the bill rates are different, so
the dollar gross margin is different. But if you're just looking at the gross margin percentage, there aren't
orders of magnitude differences by line of business.

Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Could you just give us a quick update on the bill pay spread
and give us a sense for how that trended throughout the quarter? And I don't know if you're able to give
us an update of what that looks like so far in this quarter. And then just -- you guys also mentioned that
as companies are looking for talent in lower cost communities, just wanted to see -- does that impact the
bill pay spread and your top line with potentially lower wages being paid for candidates?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

So first of all, on the pricing front, because there was such a disparity between how Management
Resources and Technology did versus Accountemps, OfficeTeam, if we mix adjust to pricing, our bill rates
were up 4.8% for the quarter, and that compares to 6.1% last quarter. And on this business around lower
cost communities, while the absolute dollar amount of our billings would be impacted, the percentage

gross margins shouldn't be significantly impacted if we have a higher mix of people coming from lower
cost communities. We would argue that with that lower price point, our clients can afford more.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just kind of looking at recruiters, and -- have you started adding recruiters yet as
employment picks up? Or is hiring paused completely right now? And just could you give us a sense for
the timing that you guys typically have with ramping recruiters as you see employment start to come
back? Is it by a quarter? Is it by a month? Just kind of how far and when do you start to ramp your own
recruiter and sales force in preparation for future demand?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we believe there is significant unused capacity with our existing recruiter base. So while we'll clearly
backfill turn over, and we'll look first to furloughs to do that, we don't see, for the near term, the need
to add recruiters or salespeople internally, because there's significant upside. And frankly, the success
we've had with the new technology tools over the last 24 months give us even more optimism that they
have significant unused capacity. And we won't needing to be adding to them on a net basis anytime soon,
certainly not in the next quarter.

Your next question is from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.

Emily Gretchen McLaughlin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

This is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth. My question is on Protiviti. You've talked about the strong pipeline.
Wondering how much visibility you have in this business and if you can provide any color on the pace of
new wins or projects and the ability to backfill work that's rolling off.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Protiviti's pipeline looks good. They do have visibility, unlike staffing. When we talk to them each quarter
about the coming quarter, they have a very high percentage of their forecasted revenues already staffed
by client. And so I would argue, at least for 1 quarter out, to have a lot of visibility. 2 quarters out, they
have some visibility. As far as pace of new wins, because the sales cycle is pretty long, they had many
things in the hopper pre-COVID, and they successfully concluded some of those new engagements during
COVID, where they did their orals via video, and they had some extremely impressive new wins. But they
were first started -- the sales process first started pre-COVID.

And so clearly, it's harder to start a brand new relationship via video. That's not impossible, but because
the duration of their engagements is as long as it is, they've got some runway here before that becomes a
major concern. Internal audit, by and large, is renewed annually. And while there are some discretionary
spend around the total, by and large, it gets renewed annually.

Emily Gretchen McLaughlin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Revenue in Robert Half Technology is a little softer than we were
expecting. Wondering if this was different than how you're thinking about it internally. Just any more
color on the areas of weakness and how you expect it to perform relative to the others over the near and
medium term?

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Well, from our perspective, Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources did much
better than was the case with Accountemps and OfficeTeam. So we weren't disappointed. We weren't
surprised. Generally speaking, small businesses have been harder hit than mid-cap and large-cap
companies, and that's where we're positioned. And so we weren't surprised nor were we disappointed,
given the circumstances with down 15% in Technology, which was about what we did in Management
Resources as well.

Your final question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So temp staffing revenue in June and July were down 33% to 34% year-over-year, which worsened from
down 31% for the full quarter. At the same time, you noted that you're seeing low single-digit week-over-
week growth in June and July. Can you elaborate on whether those sequential trends are strengthening or
weakening, given the decelerating growth exiting the quarter?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, George, the 33% versus 31%, those are already pretty close. But quite frankly, they're more about
the year ago month or year ago quarter than anything. And I would argue if there was ever a period of
time when what we did a year ago wasn't particularly relevant, I would argue it's this time.

As far as if you look at the last 6 weeks, is there any demonstrative trend there in these week-on-
week improvements, as I said earlier, they're all low single digit. So there's not a lot of variation when
you're talking low single digit. But we are encouraged that at the end of last quarter, we were talking
how the pace of declines was slowing. And now at the end of this quarter, we're talking how we've now
got sequential week-on-week improvements. So it's a heck of a lot better to talk about week-on-week
improvements that the pace of your declines is slowing.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. And then as a follow-up, your third quarter guidance assumes, would you say a
continuation of July trends? Or does it assume some degree of improvement?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

It assumes early July trends continue. Again, we said sequential growth, low single digits. So a little
bit of growth. And again, that's premised on, there are going to be flare-ups, there are going to be
rollbacks, there's going to be uncertainty around that. And given that overall environment, plus there's
some uncertainty about the amount -- the type of the stimulus that's being discussed. So given all that
uncertainty, it seemed prudent to us to kind of be conservative and dial in a little bit of sequential growth,
but not a significant amount. We hope we're surprised on the upside. We have 5% upside at our high
level.

Okay. I think that's all we have for today. Thank you very much for joining us.
