Thank you, Jim
Let me also add my appreciation for the great execution that our associates around the world delivered during this quarter
This drove another quarter of strong financial results that were above our guidance
For the third quarter, we delivered a powerful combination of year-over-year growth of 22% for revenue, 25% for non-GAAP operating income and 18% for operating cash flow
This quarter was also consistent with our strong year-to-date results of 20% total revenue growth, 26% non-GAAP operating income, and 21% operating cash flow growth
Let me provide you with some additional financial highlights of our third quarter performance
In general, currency rate volatility was fairly stable year-over-year in Q3. The major foreign currencies that we transact business in have modestly weakened from the outlook we provided on the September earnings call, but the overall impact was minimal to our results
So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on reported USD results and where appropriate, add constant currency details
In addition, you will find a table of constant currency results in our press release
Also, for a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our press release
Let me start with the income statement
We delivered $748 million of revenue, which was above the high-end of our guidance and represented growth of 22% in USD or 20% in constant currency
We exceeded the high-end of our guidance by $11 million which include a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $2 million due to a weakening of some rates against the dollar
The remaining upside was mainly due to stronger performance and execution by our global sales team and additional services demand for our emerging technologies
Subscription revenue constituted 88% of total revenue in Q3. We also experienced continued high growth across our product portfolio
Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $495 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year
Subscription revenue for our application development-related and other emerging technology offerings was $162 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year
This past quarter marked the fourth straight quarter of 40% or higher growth in this part of our subscription revenue as demand remains strong for our container, cloud management, middleware and private cloud technologies
Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue represented approximately 22% of total revenue, up 340 basis points from the year ago quarter
And lastly, our services revenue of $91 million grew 27% year-over-year
As we have seen since Q4 last year, the growth of services continued to be faster than we expected due to additional demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $179 million grew 25% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin came in at 23.9%
This quarterly result was 20 basis points higher than the operating margin guidance that I provided on our last call and 40 basis points higher than Q3 last year due primarily to the higher revenue results
As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations
Using our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26.5% after the impact of certain discrete tax items and debt discount expense, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.73, which is $0.03 higher than our September guidance and up 20% year-over-year due to the stronger performance in the quarter
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.3 billion, while returning $100 million to our shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 800,000 shares of stock
Our total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.1 billion, an increase of $390 million or 23% over the same quarter a year ago
Our operating cash flow results were also strong
Operating cash flow of $160 million for the quarter was up from $136 million in Q3 last year
This result was driven by higher profitability as well as stronger billings and collections
The FX adjusted days sales outstanding was 60 days, a 2 day improvement from last year
On a rolling four quarters basis, the billings proxy was $776 million, up 22% year-over-year
As a reminder, the four quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last four quarters
I will now review the bookings metrics related to our business momentum, top renewals, and the million dollar deals in the quarter
We drove solid bookings growth across our major geographies
This quarter, 57% of bookings came from the Americas, 28% from EMEA and 15% from Asia-Pacific, which is relatively consistent with the third quarter last year
The third quarter route-to-market mix was 67% from the channel and 33% from our direct sales force, compared to the third quarter prior year’s split of 72% and 28%
Our proxy for booking duration was nearly 24 months, the same that we reported in Q3 last year
This was however higher than we anticipated due to strong growth of multiyear deals being booked in the quarter
Looking at the fourth quarter, we continue to expect our bookings duration metric will be lower than last year’s record 25 months
Looking at our top deals, 25 out of 25 of our largest deals that were up for renewal all renewed and did so in aggregate at greater than 120% of their previous value
Our large deal growth in the quarter was strong, with a total of 94 deals over $1 million, up approximately 30% year-over-year
Within these deals, 17 were greater than $5 million which is a record for any quarter
Included in the 17 deals were 4 greater than $10 million with one of those over $20 million
Cross-selling was strong, with over 60% of the top deals greater than $1 million including one or more components from our group of application development-related and emerging technologies offerings
Our top industry verticals within these deals greater than $1 million were financial services, tech and media and other mainstream sectors such as retail, energy and transportation
Now I would like to turn to guidance
Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange rates, which generally weakened against the dollar since our September guidance
For example, our higher outlook for Q4 revenue also includes a $4 million headwind from the foreign exchange rates we used from our previous outlook
For our full year, we are raising our total revenue guidance to $2.906 billion to $2.911 billion, up approximately 21% in USD and 20% in constant currency at the high-end of the range
Given the strong performance so far this year along with our outlook for additional growth and investment, we are modestly raising our non-GAAP operating margin by 10 basis points to 23.9% for the full year
We are also raising our full year non-GAAP earnings per share outlook to be approximately $2.88 per share, assuming approximately $2 million per quarter forecast for net other income, an annual effective tax rate of 27% and approximately 181 million diluted shares
This guidance also includes a one-time gain on a strategic investment of approximately $0.05 for both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share
On a GAAP basis, we expect GAAP EPS to be approximately $2.02 with an estimated annual stock compensation expense of approximately $195 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $30 million
GAAP fully diluted EPS guidance includes non-cash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount of approximately $20 million
And finally, we are also raising our full year operating cash flow outlook to be in the range from $900 million to $910 million
For Q4 specifically, we offer the following outlook
We expect revenue to be in the range of $758 million to $763 million, which is up approximately 21% in USD at the high-end of the range and 18% in constant currency
We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.81 with 182 million diluted shares
GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.54 with 186 million diluted shares
Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share will include the approximately $0.05 gain I mentioned a moment ago
Although one can derive a quarterly cash flow range based on my annual guidance, we will continue our practice of not providing quarterly cash flow guidance
In Q3, we delivered strong results that reflect the continued adoption of the technologies that address the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing
This momentum will enable us to finish the year with high growth across revenue, non-GAAP operating income and cash flow
We are also optimistic that the execution this year will position us well for the future growth
At this point in time, I would like to turn the call back to Elise for the first question
Question-and-Answer Session
So actually Siti, I think we can probably perhaps maybe answer both of those questions together, because I mean as I had mentioned in the prepared remarks over 60% of our larger deals, Red Hat cross selling in them, it had multiple elements of the technologies
So, certainly, RHEL is in there, but we are seeing good cross-selling of the emerging technologies, certainly OpenShift and Ansible and OpenStack
And as we look at the services activities and I’ve mentioned this before is services is really for us is both a leading and a lagging indicator of a lot of these projects
So we are seeing a fair amount of proof-of-concepts, which are certainly leading to bigger deals, but then we are also seeing, we will sell a subscription and it will include it’s a OpenShift or some of the other emerging technologies in there and then the customers will then engage us to get some support and services around it or training
So, it’s really right now I mean we are kind of looking at the growth then I would tell you a lot of what we are seeing is early proof-of-concept projects on the services side, which is helping driving it, but at the same time too we are also seeing a pickup of actually the deployment of some of the emerging technology too
So, Walter, it’s a couple of things
I mean, obviously as we have shown lot of strength in services each quarter, I mean, that’s a contributor we have and as we have been articulating externally that we have been doing a lot of focus around business linearity and we are in fact closing business earlier in the quarter
We have had more on-time renewals than ever which obviously that kind of translates to in-quarter revenue
So, we are seeing improved linearity and again as I mentioned last quarter this quarter as well as certainly Q4 being our biggest volume quarters are really going to test a lot of the management cadence and process improvements that we have made
So before we really kind of say that we are 100% confident that all of the linearity improvements that we have made will be sustainable
We have really got to get through Q4 and see how that shakes out, but we are very optimistic, we saw a nice linearity improvement this year over last year and like I said the services and certainly the CCSP program continues to grow and we’re pleased with the performance of that as well all of that really resulting in a lot more in quarter revenue
And Brian, I think the other thing we’d say as we talk to customers and we certainly customers are really putting their hybrid cloud strategies in play for next year and that’s something that plays right into the strategy of how we’ve aligned the products
So I think that’s one of things that gives us a lot of excitement about next year and it’s certainly years beyond, because some of these are going to be certainly multiyear transformations that our customers and industries are going through
No, no cost push-outs
I mean, we have a strategic investment, which is being dispositioned that’s contributing to $0.05, but there is no cost push-outs
We have time for one final question
Happy holidays
