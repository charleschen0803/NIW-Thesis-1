Lastly, I would note that management is scheduled to participate in upcoming virtual investor conferences
in June hosted by Baird, Bank of America and Stifel.

And now I will turn the call over to Ron.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. First and foremost, we hope that you're all staying safe
and well, and our thoughts are with everyone affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The world has faced
unprecedented challenges over the past several months, and I would like to thank all of our employees for
their continued dedication and commitment to Keysight, our customers and our partners.

Our execution and results this quarter underscore the power of our balance sheet, business model and our
Keysight leadership model, which drives our unique high-performance culture and guides our company to
continuously delivering greater value to customers, shareholders and employees.

I'll focus my formal comments today on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, the health and safety of our
employees is our top priority. After acting quickly to temporarily close most of our global locations in mid-
March and implementing risk mitigation measures in response to the pandemic, we are now reopening
sites and our production capacity is ramping rapidly.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

Second, despite the mandatory government shutdown of our production facilities and resulting supply
disruption impact on our Q2 revenue, Keysight delivered steady orders, strong operating margin and
record free cash flow. Our results demonstrated the exceptional resilience of our business and the
durability of our financial operating model.

And third, despite the near-term uncertainty, we are confident in our differentiated market leadership
position, the strength of our operating model and the long-term secular growth trends across our diverse
set of end markets.

Turning to the dynamics that impacted second quarter results. Demand was steady across markets in
February. As the impact of the pandemic expanded beyond China in early March, we responded quickly to
limit the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate the risk to employees, customers and suppliers, while also
responding to local government directives.

On March 18, we issued a press release to announce the temporary closure of most locations around
the world, including our production and order fulfillment facilities, which were fully closed for 2 weeks
in March and had limited activity in April. We also took the necessary steps to deliver on our customer
commitments, particularly those that provide essential services and support the communities in which we
operate around the world.

Working with local governments and health officials to implement health and safety measures at all of our
locations, we are pleased to announce that we are reopening sites worldwide. Despite ongoing broader
industry supply chain challenges, we are ramping our Keysight production and services operation and
expect to be back to 100% capacity by the end of the third quarter.

Now let's take a deeper look into our financial results. Order growth was positive through March followed
by a decline in April to finish the quarter down only 3% compared to last year's record second quarter.
While we don't typically comment on calendar quarter performance, given the dynamic nature of the
situation, it's worth noting that Keysight's orders and revenues both grew mid-single digits in the January
through March time frame.

Despite lower-than-expected revenue as a result of supply chain disruptions, the resilience of Keysight's
business model was exceptional and our flexible cost structure performed as expected. As a result of our
immediate actions to reduce costs and preserve liquidity, we delivered operating margin of 19%, record
free cash flow of $275 million and a record cash balance of $1.8 billion.

Our second quarter revenue declined 18% year-over-year as both segments of the business were
impacted by the limited manufacturing capacity. However, we continue to see steady demand across
several end markets with ongoing investment in next-generation technologies such as 5G, 400-gig and
advanced semiconductor node processes. Other markets such as general electronics and automotive are
expected to be more challenged in the near term.

In commercial communications, our ongoing 5G order momentum resulted in a new record. Our end-to-
end solutions portfolio continues to gain strong global customer adoption and is enabling the commercial
5G launches underway. We are further solidifying our global leadership position across both the wireless
and wired 5G ecosystem through close collaborations with market leaders -- leadership and standards and
first-to-market 5G design and test solutions.

This quarter, we introduced Keysight's new 5G Core Network Test Solution called LoadCore. The 5G Core
testing software simulates complex real-world subscriber models. This enables mobile operators and
network equipment manufacturers to qualify performance and reliability of voice and data transferred over
5G networks. This solution leverages from the Ixia and PRISMA acquisitions to deliver testing capability
needed by our customers.

We also announced the collaboration with Rakuten, an operator in Japan to enable their 5G deployments
using our solutions for test, validation and optimization of devices and networks. Keysight comprehensive
solutions portfolio span the entire ecosystem is a key differentiator in the market.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

In Aerospace, Defense and Government, order growth was driven by strong demand in the U.S., which
was partially offset by lower international investment. Our solutions for electromagnetic spectrum
operations, radar, space and satellite continue to benefit from a favorable U.S. spending environment and
ongoing investments in technology modernization.

Despite the substantial challenges in the automotive sector, next-generation electric and autonomous
vehicle technology is a strategic priority for our customers. Keysight continues to invest to be first to
market with solutions and remains highly engaged with key market players. For example, we recently
announced the use of our Scienlab battery test solution in the BMW Group's new Battery Cell Competence
Centre in Germany.

Foundry customers are continuing to prioritize investment in advanced process node technologies and
incremental infrastructure. This resulted in revenue growth for our semiconductor measurement solutions
where we had less supply chain disruption.

Software and services continue to contribute to the differentiation of our solutions and recurring revenue
base. While growing above the company average over time, they are strengthening the durability and
diversity of our business model. In Q2, the combination of both software and services represented
approximately 35% of revenue.

Turning back to the current COVID-19 pandemic. We are committed to supporting our customers and our
communities through this challenge. For our customers, we launched an Innovate Anywhere program to
enable IT teams to support remote users, ensuring VPN performance and security. We also implemented
various health and safety measures at our facilities to ensure all safeguards are met before production and
other operations resume.

For our communities, we are contributing to the relief efforts globally through monetary and supply
donations. These include donations of personal protective equipment to local hospitals and government
agencies, providing support to children, families and the most vulnerable. We are also making direct
financial contributions to local communities and global nonprofit organizations.

Before turning the call over to Neil, I'll close with a few key points. Keysight is a market leader in large,
diverse and growing end markets and serves a diversified global base of over 32,000 customers across
multiple industries. The challenges of this pandemic are unprecedented, and I'm proud on how our
team has responded. Our execution demonstrates the durability of our business and the resilience of
our business model with 19% operating margin and solid cash flow even with a Q2 revenue impact. We
continue our significant investment in R&D and remain focused on first-to-market solutions.

Our sales teams remain highly engaged with our customers, and we continue to execute our strategy for
long-term above-market growth. While we expect ongoing COVID-19 demand and supply chain headwinds
over the next few quarters, our long-term secular market growth trends and the strength of our operating
model remain intact. We expect to come through this challenge stronger than ever.

Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and the outlook in more detail.

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-
over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise.

Keysight delivered a solid quarter, thanks to strong execution in a challenging environment. While supply
chain disruptions dampened our revenue performance during the second half of the quarter, our results
demonstrated the resiliency of our operating model and durable cash generation. We responded quickly
with proactive measures to reduce costs and preserve liquidity while supporting our customers and
advancing key projects.

For the second quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue of $895 million, down 18% on a reported and
core basis due to our site closures and supply chain disruptions that started in mid-March and continued

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

through the end of the quarter. Orders of $1.1 billion were down 3% on a reported and core basis. As Ron
mentioned, we continue to see steady demand in investment across multiple end markets, particularly for
our next-generation communications solutions.

Turning to our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 63%, with improved mix and lower
spending, partially offsetting the impact of lower revenue. The flexibility of our cost structure resulted
in lower variable compensation and a reduction in outsourced manufacturing costs. This, combined with
other specific actions, such as a temporary hiring freeze and reductions in discretionary spending enabled
our flexible operating model to perform as expected, resulting in 19% operating margin for the quarter.

Net income in the second quarter was $148 million. On a per-share basis, we delivered $0.78 in earnings.
Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 189 million shares.

Regarding the performance of our segments. In light of the broad supply chain disruptions, CSG and EISG
expense management and margin performance were exceptional. CSG operating margin was 18%, while
EISG delivered 24% operating margin. On the demand side, general electronics, education and automotive
were weak. While investment continued in 5G, aerospace, defense and other leading-edge technology
solutions.

Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with a record $1.8 billion in cash
and cash equivalents with $450 million of additional liquidity available under our undrawn revolving credit
facility. We reported cash flow from operations of $298 million and record free cash flow of $275 million or
31% of revenue.

The strength of our cash generation reflects the power of our financial operating model, which incorporates
a flexible cost structure and includes a financial playbook that is designed to preserve margins and cash
generation during challenging times.

Under our share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 1.3 million shares on the open
market in the first half of the quarter at an average price of $91.14 for a total consideration of $120
million. Our year-to-date repurchases are sufficient to achieve our objective of being anti-dilutive for the
full year and to exit the year at 190 million shares. While we are focused on optimizing liquidity, given our
strong operating model and cash generation, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.

Now turning to our outlook and guidance. While we are not quite back to full capacity, our production
operations and those of our suppliers have been ramping since mid-April. We expect to make continued
progress in Q3, and as a result, expect third quarter revenue, operating margin and earnings to be in line
with or better than Q2. These expectations are based on our order funnel, a strong backlog position and
assume limited incremental supply chain constraints or disruption from additional shutdowns or a second
wave of the pandemic. While maintaining R&D investments for the future growth, we will continue to focus
on profitability and leverage the flexibility of our operating model to manage expenses.

In closing, the near-term situation is obviously challenging, but we remain focused on our long-term
strategy of enabling our customers success though first-to-market leading-edge solutions. Once the
COVID-19 situation stabilizes, the durability of our business model, cash generation, strong balance sheet
and market leadership position give us confidence in our long-term financial targets that we shared with
you at our Investor Day in early March. Specifically, sustainable long-term core growth of 4% to 6%,
operating margin of 26% to 27% and EPS growth of at least 10% over the long term.

With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations
Thank you, Neil. Robert, will you please give instructions for the Q&A.?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Yes. I want to go back to your reported backlog. Despite the shortfall in revenues, you were still able to
grow backlog by double-digit. And given your assumption for booking for the current July quarter, do you
expect a resumption of year-over-year growth in quarterly revenue by the October quarter? And I have a
follow-up.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. This is Ron. Our backlog -- our book-to-bill was 1.22 for the quarter, showing very strong backlog
build and obviously, our profitability, our operating model was strong and held up at 19%. If we had
shipped that, we clearly would have been in very strong shape with operating margin in the mid-20s.

As far as the quarter going forward, we have seen our operations turn on. Our main international
operations that we have in Penang, Malaysia, is back to 100% capacity. The main operations that we have
in the U.S. are at about 70% capacity and will be at 100% by the end of the quarter. So even though
there is a short-term disruption to the end of -- to the second half of Q2 and the first half of Q3, we expect
Q3 revenue to be at about the same level. We don't guide for orders for the future quarter, though.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. Perhaps maybe I could rephrase the question in different way. I'm assuming that the strength in
your communication group is driven by orders for millimeter wave on R&D and also, you highlighted 400-
gig networking. As R&D activity on the millimeter wave picks up, is there any synergy between [ wave ]
and the networking that would enable you with a bigger size of the customer wallet? In other words, the
stack approach that you have focused on, would that finally becoming material so that you could capture
a bigger part of the customer? And is that's what's going to be driving the momentum with booking for
some of the growth areas?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. We had a strong quarter in 5G. We had a very strong quarter in 400-gig back into the network. And
our overall play of winning up and down the ecosystem does create that synergy. I'm going to let Satish
talk a little bit about the details.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & President of the Communications Solutions Group

Yes. Thanks, Ron. Mehdi, you're correct in that communications, especially these new areas such as 5G
with millimeter wave adoption and 400-gig and such are really gaining increased importance in today's
world, given what we have seen in terms of a disruption. So that should start to manifest itself. In fact,
with discussions with customers we're having today, the focus is on accelerating innovation and going
faster. So that positions us well, having the entire Layer 1 to Layer 7 capabilities internal to the company
and having built that platform I referenced at the Investor Day, gives us an advantage to go faster and
deploy solutions with customers.

You will also note that we have a number of industry-leading collaborations that we announced just this
quarter with the likes of Qualcomm, Rakuten, China Unicom, SONiC and others that spans the wireless to
wireline arenas and positions us well for the future.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

So does that mean that the synergies are beginning to materialize?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & President of the Communications Solutions Group

Yes, I think so, and you'll start to see them accelerate as we launch more solutions. We have some [ 90 ]
new solutions planned for the second half of the year, which we're investing for and that should continue
to position us very well in the communications space.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just wanted to ask about the China market. Could you talk a little bit about the trends there? Obviously,
the timing from manufacturing and businesses opening was a little bit different. So -- and obviously, some
more political talk there. So can you just give us an update how China was and how you're viewing that
the next few quarters? And then I had a follow-up.

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

So Tim, this is Mark Wallace. I'll take that question, talking about China. So the main headline from Q2 is
that our business remained steady. We had a stronger February than we expected coming out of the Lunar
New Year that, as you recall, was extended by an extra week. And we saw strengths continuing in 5G and
commercial coms, as Satish had talking about both at the physical layer and across the protocol stack,
400-gigabit R&D and optical manufacturing continued to ramp as we saw global demand to come from the
carriers and the data centers.

Automotive was down, and we saw some mixed conditions in general electronics and education as we
made comments in the opening remarks. And China continues to accelerate investments in semiconductor
capability, particularly around next-generation semiconductor technology.

And as you alluded to, there's a continuing set of evolving U.S. regulations. We're paying very close
attention to these. At this point, there might be some indirect impact to some of the foundry business,
we're not really able to quantify that just yet. We have assessed the overall situation in terms of the most
recent [ USDOC ] restrictions and regulations. And we believe it represents something on the order of 1
to 2 points of headwind going forward. But as we did with the August 2018 RPL additions, we will redirect
sales resources to go after new opportunities to drive growth elsewhere. And all of these restrictions go
across all of our technology companies that supply into China, not just Keysight.

So the bottom line, I would say, with China is our customer engagements remained high during
the quarter as we adapted to the new remote environment that we're now leveraging across other
geographies, and our business in China remain steady despite all of these challenges and headwinds.

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned 35% of revenues coming from software and
service in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the ramp there? And do you think -- are you hearing
from customers with the kind of global disruption like this that there might be more of an accelerated
move to those type of models?

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

Yes. Tim, this is Mark again. I'll take that. Regarding software and services, as you point out, we saw
revenue growth in the quarter faster than the rest of Keysight as has been the case for many quarters.
Revenue for software was roughly flat, services was up slightly on a core basis. We had a record high
Q2 for our design software orders, which indicates the continued demand from customers who continue
to work remotely during the global pandemic. And as Ron mentioned in his opening comments, we
introduced the Innovate Anywhere initiative, which was very successful, really enabling thousands of
software engineers to work from home.

And moving forward, we see this program feeding into the superior software and services growth that
we've been delivering for a long time. Our customers and their engineering workflow has changed, and
we expect to see customers continuing to work in this mix lab and work-from-home environment. And I
think our software and services provides us another way to support their engineering teams in either case
to maintain engineering productivity. So yes, we do see our software strengths continuing to be a factor,
especially in the new go-forward environment that we're experiencing.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Marchetti with Stifel.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the demand side as you've gone through these last
couple of months. You mentioned obviously that January through March, both orders and revenue were
growing in the mid-single digits. But I'm just curious, with orders down 3% year-over-year for the quarter,
did you have customer behavior change dramatically in that month of April as well that coincided with your
ability to ship? How has this sort of disrupted your customer landscape, not just your own supply-side
issues?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Sure. Obviously, we had a drop-off in April when everything pretty much shut down. So our order level
was lower. Our sales organization worked from home and actually has been very effective after the first
couple of weeks, just trying to figure out how to contact customers. A matter of fact, they've been finding
it pretty efficient to be able to get on with Zoom as long as they have an established relationship with
those customers. But that's what we saw with regards to the seasonality in the quarter.

Revenue, we've talked about that and how that is ramping now and will be back to full strength by the end
of the quarter. Mark, would you like to add anything?

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. What I would add is we did see customers working hard from home. They were actually more
accessible than they normally would be because we knew where to find them. So we engaged with them.
We continue to book business, and we continue to build our funnel for Q3 and beyond. It's at the highest
level, really it's ever been looking out 3 months.

But there was some pullback in certain areas. As an example, some of our general electronics business is
tied to new engineers being hired, right? And obviously, that wasn't going on. Some of the government-
funded activities such as research, obviously, our education business based on universities being closed
were affected. And we saw that effect happen more toward the end of the quarter. So there's some
dynamics from the industry that really played in that timing as well.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up to that, was there a big difference that you saw geographically?
Obviously, we all know that China has kind of come back from this a little bit more quickly than some

10

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

other areas just given that that's where everything started. But as you look out across North America and
Europe, have there been, I guess, big regional differences as you've seen those demand trends play out?

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. John, what I would say is there was some regional differences, mainly from kind of the distribution of
different segments and different customer behaviors. As an example, we already talked about the fact that
we saw strong order growth in the U.S. from aerospace defense. That continued throughout the quarter
from both the direct government and the prime contractors.

Whereas in Europe, the strength was really more around semiconductor solutions tied to advanced
technologies like EUV, which is Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography and some next-generation processes. And
then we saw some growth in commercial comms and Europe tied to some new 5G design wins. And so it
varied. What I would say is most regions saw the impact when it came to kind of the general electronics
and automotive segments. So there's some variety from region-to-region based on different industry
dynamics in each of the regions.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

It is interesting. John. It's interesting to note, though that a lot of our major customers have said they're
not slipping schedules and they're doing everything they can to either stay on track or make up for any
type of shortfall what they have. And that bodes well for some type of, let's say, accelerated purchasing at
some point when they do need it.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So as we get back to a more normal environment, you would expect that you'll be able to at least sort of
make up some of this shortfall here in this fiscal 2Q and 3Q?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. And clearly, with the backlog, you could see, we built $200 million worth of backlog in the last
quarter. There's no doubt that we will be able to clear that out at some point in the future. We've guided
or given you a range for Q3, where we expect to be. But beyond that, we expect ourselves to be at 100%,
and we'll be ramping rapidly from there.

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Ron, the only other -- I'd add for, John, just real quick. We look at cancellations, we didn't see any
increase in cancellations. We look at, is there any kind of pushouts to Ron's point about projects staying
on track, we really didn't see a lot of push-outs either. So we built a strong funnel, and I think we're going
to be in a good position when the economy begins to recover.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

And the good news is the global race continues to be ahead of 5G, which nobody wants to pause.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Ron, you talked about record 5G bookings in the quarter. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more
on that in terms of the composition of those orders between R&D test and production test? And if you can

kind of speak to individual customer groups like the chip guys and the base station customers, the mobile
smartphone customers, that would be helpful. And then I've got a quick follow-up.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Sure, Toshi. I'll let Satish, who's right in the middle of it give you more of the details.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & President of the Communications Solutions Group

Yes, Toshi, it's a very strong order quarter for 5G. Our orders grew a record level, as we mentioned before,
in Ron's comments, but equally worth noting was the strength continued into April, and the growth that
we saw was broad. It was across all regions grew and all segments of the customer base grew all the ones
that you referenced chipsets, devices and the NANDs and even the operator segments.

I would say if we fill back the types of applications that sustained investments in R&D, manufacturing
started to ramp. In fact, we had a good uptick for our modular offerings, which were enabling some of
the component manufacturers to ramp up. So that was a positive note for us. And then we also saw
success in new verticals such as automotive with the CV-2 X application that we just launched and with
our aerospace and a solution with some of the 5G security offerings we've launched.

So in summary, some of the opportunity progression that I had outlined at the Investor Day sort of started
to play out in Q2. And we also added 40 new customers for our 5G platform through our marketing efforts
and working with our sales teams globally.

I also want to say that our customer engagement through this phase has been very strong. Even though
some of our customers are working from home, they have been continually engaged, as Ron mentioned,
to make sure that their projects don't slip too much. And in some cases, with they slipping, they're looking
at ways to accelerate.

I also want to highlight some of our, let's say, remote working with customers is working very well. In fact,
our 5G virtual events have been well attended by over 8,000 customers. So that points to the strength of
our solutions there.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. Very helpful. And then as a quick follow up. You spoke about some of the near-term headwinds
related to automotive, general electronics, education and government, curious what percentage of your
overall business do those end markets collectively account for? And is it fair to say fundamentals, whether
it be bookings or revenue troughs in the April quarter? Or could there be continued weakness into July?
And as a follow-up to that, if you can kind of speak to your exposure to Huawei and the foundries in the
semiconductor business? That would be very helpful.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. We haven't sized those specific markets, Toshiya, but the GE and automotive markets are a significant
portion, more than half of EISG. Obviously, the part that's missing there is a semi business, which has
been strong. But EISG's business is kind of more heavily or more -- the weaker market areas are more
heavily weighted towards the EISG with general electronics, automotive, EISG, these things that tend to
be more tightly linked to GDP.

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

The auto business, in particular, has slowed down. We obviously saw significant slowdowns as everybody
is seeing in the industries for the old technologies or old auto, some of the new auto wasn't as strong as it

was pre-Covid. But we still feel very good about our position. So we are there for when that market snaps
back.

And then to the second part of your question, as it relates to Huawei, we don't really have any change at
this point as it relates to our expectations of Huawei going forward. We kind of still expect them to be a
1% to 2% customer for us on a go-forward basis.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. Ron, I was just wondering if you could help us understand what do you think the supply impact was
for COVID in the quarter? And I guess in your prepared comments, you said it was both a production and
an order fulfillment hit. So I'd be kind of curious as to how much revenue and orders do you think you lost
in the quarter from the supply side of COVID?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. I mean, it's impossible for us to what would have happened, right? But I think if you go back to where
we were at the beginning of the quarter, we obviously put a guide out for the quarter that we had a high
degree of confidence in our ability to hit. And so you can look at that delta relative to our guidance on the
revenue line and for all intents and purposes, I would attribute that shortfall to COVID.

I think from our perspective, the world changed in mid-March, as we talked about the sites being closed,
limited productivity in April, but we continue to be very optimistic about how we're positioned on a go-
forward basis. We're a leader in our markets. We have a strong technology position. And I think as
markets recover, we're going to come through this even stronger.

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

I think it is fair to say, taking a look at our order rate and knowing how we do our supply chain planning, a
book-to-bill of around 1 was probably would have been normal if there wasn't a COVID issue for Q2.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then, guys, I know you're not giving official guidance for the July quarter, but I'm just
kind of curious, from a production perspective, if you look at the April quarter relative to 100%, where
were you for the blended average of the quarter? And as you look into July, I know there's a lot of moving
parts, but how do you think sort of relative to 100%, your production levels look in July versus April?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Well, you could go back and look at the history of where we've been operating somewhere around the
$1.1 billion per quarter kind of range as close to full production. So that gives you an idea of something to
key off of -- obviously, the dynamic is a little bit different, right? We were going full steam ahead through
mid-March and then it shut off pretty quickly with a ramp in April. We're now continuing to ramp in May,
expecting to be back to something close to 100% across the ecosystem by the end of the quarter. So you
kind of have the ramp down last quarter, followed by the ramp-up this quarter. And as close as we can call
it at this point, the revenue numbers and profitability numbers are going to be in the same vicinity as one
another.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

So if you look at that, you could see where we were down roughly a couple of hundred million dollars.
We're down at roughly 80% of capacity. So the fact that we took out, we lost a couple of weeks in March,
and then you could take another 1 week or 2 out of April, just as you start to see that ramp or ramp
linearly. So that's a very rough estimate, but I think it's pretty accurate.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And Ron, if I could just sneak one last one in. Just given your production issues, can you talk a little
bit about your share position? And is there any concern that competitors might be able to take this
opportunity to steal some share on the margin?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

I don't think so. There could have been -- there can be some very minor issues. But if I take a look at
orders and I look at orders January, February and March, we grew mid-single digits on the order line,
which is pretty competitive. Nobody else or very few people have reported in our industry, what happened
in April. So when they come out, I'd be surprised that their numbers were not the same. We've been
growing above market every single quarter now for years. And for everything that was going on, I do
anticipate that we are at market or better. And our backlog position now is so strong. You'll see that flow
into revenue and profitability and cash flow as we go forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.

Adam Robert Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to try to understand the margin disparity in Q2 just because the EISG margins held up so much
better? And is that a trend you expect to continue?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. So I mean, if you look across our business, right, the one area where we saw actual revenue growth
was in semi, which is a -- which is all within EISG, and it's also a very high margin segment for us. So I
think you're predominantly looking at a mix issue or not issue -- a mix benefit that EISG received with the
very strong semi shipments relative to the other parts of their business. And so that's really what you see
going on there.

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

And it's worthwhile to note that obviously, with a lot of fixed infrastructure as we start to see the business
come back, you'll continue to see very strong gross margin performance.

Adam Robert Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then -- so high level, it sounds like you're kind of girding for a more projected downturn at
EISG. But at communications, it sounds like when the COVID situation allows, you'll kind of quickly run
back to revenue growth, is that fair?

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. I think EISG has businesses that are more GDP linked. We talked about General Electronics, which
includes the Education segment. But if we just talk about education for a while, until -- there's really 2

aspects of education. There's the teaching aspect and the research aspect. But in both cases, you need
students on campus, right, to really get those education markets up and going.

Automotive, we know what's happening in the auto industry. So we still don't know what the shape of
the recovery is going to look like. You can read all the same reports that I read about what the ultimate
recovery is looking like, but EISG, I think, tends to be more macro linked and more linked to GDP linked
or GDP -- where the drivers within CSGs roll out of 5G, the rollout of 400 gigabit, the aerospace defense
and investments potentially have the ability to buck some of those trends as folks work to get those
technologies to market.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.

Jim Suva
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And I have 2 questions. I'll ask them both at the same time, so you can answer them in any order, and
they're pretty straightforward. The first is, with coronavirus, is the R&D cycle still lengthening? Or are
people now adjusted to work from home and work remotely now where it's actually compressing? The
reason why asked is because it seems like 2 months ago, it was everything progressing slower. And it now
sounds like from your comments and other companies' comments, things are kind of coming back. So I
was kind of wondering about the design cycle.

And then my second question is, your inventory went up quite a bit, but you talked about supply chain
issues. Was that simply not having all the right parts to put together your heavy equipment and your big
calibration items in your test and measurement things? Or did some of your inventory like you trapped in
certain locations or you're missing just a couple of widgets that go into it. And so you're like 98% of the
box completed before you can ship?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Sure. Jim, this is Ron. I'll just take the questions. I'll take them in reverse order. With regards to the
inventory situation, it's real simple. We have parts coming in the door, and we have no one in the factory
to build them. And that's the case that we had in the second half of March. It's not the case now as we
have Penang up and running, but we also supply parts from our tech center in the United States. So when
there's nobody putting together parts or even if things are put together and they're not shipped, there's
no revenue credit.

So all parts have to be there in order to complete a product. There are thousands of parts in certain
products, some made within Keysight and more of the commodity type pieces that are put into products
in addition to our unique differentiators. Some of them flow in and some flow out, but the bottom line was
we weren't from together any systems or shipping them out. And that was because of not only internal
to the Keysight manufacturing facilities but also the contract manufacturers that would do subassemblies.
But now we're very happy with the progress that has been made and where we are now and where we
expect to be by the end of this quarter.

The second issue with regard to the R&D cycle, there was a bit of a stop that everyone was trying to
figure out how to operate in this new normal, where every customer that we spoke to are very, very high
percentage of them went through that. Now they've situated to work at home to go in part time to use
test systems or, in some cases, like China returned back to work.

So we see the R&D engineers being much more efficient. And accordingly, they're trying to figure out how
to keep their projects on track because they are competing against their ultimate competition. So that's
why we see things accelerating in that cycle. How much equipment acceleration we'll see at what rate is
yet to be seen, but we feel very positive as we look forward.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

A few questions -- 2 questions. One just kind of targeted at aerospace, defense. And just a couple
of thoughts here. What was the order growth in A&D year-over-year? And then secondly, was the --
with A&D, was the business in the revenue there disproportionately impacted by the plant shutdowns?
Because it wasn't a very tough comp, but I'm just curious, with the revenue down 25%, if there was a
disproportionate impact there?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So I'll take that. We -- from the order perspective, orders were basically stable versus last year. With
regard to the revenue impact, some of that stuff, particularly for the U.S. markets required to be built in
the U.S. We did get earlier access to our Penang facilities than we did to some of our locations in the U.S.
And so there probably was, I think, it is fair to say that there was a disproportionate impact on aerospace
defense from a manufacturing perspective just given the fact that the access to the U.S. facilities lagged,
the access to our facilities in Asia in April.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got you. And then just a follow-up question around the backlog. One would expect perhaps that given
access just globally is better to customers as hopefully they -- everybody starts to return to work here.
And we got some of the access things maybe worked out a little bit in the fiscal second quarter. But
typically, your orders are flat to a bit softer in the third quarter relative to the second. But again, with
improvements around access, would you expect to build backlog again in the third quarter, given where
you are in the disconnect between the production ramp and kind of what's going on the order and sales
side?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

We don't guide orders out for Q3, Rick, I think, as you know, but we're going to try to do everything we
can to lower our backlog. I'm not saying that we've guided that, but what we're trying to do is improve
our position to get our deliveries out to the customers that need them. You're right, on a typical non-
COVID environment, we see a ramp at the end of Q2 and then the biggest ramp at the end of Q4, which is
literally how we do the comp in the field organization. And then Q3 is as not as high as you would expect
when looking at Q2. But overall, we expect orders to be very solid and not out of line with what we've
seen in the past.

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I think -- I mean, obviously, the COVID situation is going to supersede the normal seasonality of
the business. From a Q2 perspective, we had the first half of the quarter, which was I don't want to say
unimpacted, but through the first half of our quarter, this was essentially still viewed as largely China
problem. It didn't go global until mid-March in the second part of the quarter.

I think the macro side of things is where it is now. We don't know where it's headed, but -- so I think
you're going to see a different seasonality than is as typical. And then I like Ron's way of characterizing it.
I mean, I think we've guided revenue in Q3, in line with Q2. We're certainly pushing on the manufacturing
side as hard as we can push it. But right now, the way we see it and the way we see the ramp
progressing, you're going to be looking at revenues that are more or less in line.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

And the reason why you see that isn't so much the internal capacity, you could do the math and say, for
100% right now internationally in Penang and we're at 70% in the U.S. and you do some type of linear
extrapolation of basically the facility that we have in our fab in the U.S., you could come up with a much
higher number. But in order to produce products, you need 3 things. You need all the parts, you need your
contract manufacturers for subassemblies and you need the Keysight manufacturing facilities.

The CMs are very close to 100%. You see our facilities getting close to 100%, but we still are relying on
the delivery of components from different suppliers that go into our products. And that is something that
is a bit extended that is figured into our guide.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I see. Okay. And can I just -- putting that all together, just tying it together, Neil, if we're looking at a
similar cadence of revenue monthly through the fiscal third quarter, we've got the issues that you've
spoken to around production, production ramp, overhead. Is there any reason to assume the decremental
for the third quarter won't be similar to the second quarter, given the flexibility in the model?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

I expect it to be similar.

Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Sure. So China's stimulus package included $30 billion-or-so earmarked for data centers. And in the U.S.
and Europe, the work-from-home trend has shown some of the weaknesses that are out there in corporate
data centers and networks. How do you think about Keysight and their ability to benefit on a relative basis
from those trends?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Satish owns the data center portion, and I'll let him answer.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & President of the Communications Solutions Group

Yes. I think we think with the upgrades to data center technology and in lieu of what people have learned
from working at home and at the scale is definitely going to be a positive driver for us, especially for our
Ixia business with multiple implications. Speed is one of them, security is one of them and visibility being
the other piece to it. Right now, we did have a strong double-digit quarter for 400-gig based on some
ramps we're seeing in China, and our outlook for that part of the business continues to be favorable.

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And then a question, could you maybe quantify the cost savings actions that you took? And if there
are some that are structural in nature, could you maybe call that out?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. We're very pleased with the way our operating model has performed. We've talked a lot about what
we felt we could do in a down cycle. The business -- the model has a number of structural elements that
are designed to respond instantaneously to changes in condition. The #1 of those is the variable pay

component. Again, 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with our business
results.

Outside of the executives, the rank and file, if you will, that's really tied to our growth rates and to our
operating margins. And so as both of those things corrected in the third quarter, we saw a significant
reduction in our people-related costs. Similarly with contract manufacturing, outsourced sales, those types
of things those came online.

Beyond that, we took action to reduce discretionary spend everything from -- again, certain things
happened relatively automatically like travel, basically crashed towards 0 in the second half of the quarter.
Reductions in temporary workers. The executives we have actually put in a pay cut for our executive team,
ranging from 100% at the CEO level to 50% for the Senior Vice Presidents. So we've taken a number of
different actions to further reduce spending.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Ron, just a quick one for you. Now you're back to the net cash position out, I'm curious what you might
be seeing in terms of the M&A funnel? And if the dislocation in the market is perhaps created some
incremental opportunities for you to take a look at here?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. Well, Brandon, we have the same priorities that we had before, obviously, to fund organic growth to
make sure that we stay neutral or antidilutive and to look at M&A opportunities. In certain cases, things
have become more attractive, but we still have a high hurdle to beat our cost of capital with our return --
excuse me, to beat our WACC with our ROIC. And we continue to look pretty aggressively at those. But
again, we will make sure that the ROIC is high enough.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And a quick one for Neil, just on the CapEx line for the year. Are you still thinking about $120 million for
the year? Is that still a firm number? Or do you expect some of those projects to maybe get pushed out
on...

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. No, we'll probably push out a little bit, obviously, made significant capital commitments already for
the year, but we all -- we would expect to understand. We're probably now looking at something more like
$100 million to $110 million for the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just wanted to start off with more a question on the manufacturing footprint here. I mean we've seen a
lot of companies face supply chain headwinds this quarter, but your magnitude of the shortfall has been
obviously larger given your kind of concentration in U.S. and Malaysia. Just wanted to get your thoughts
about whether you're thinking any differently about the long-term plans relating to the manufacturing
footprint, anything to mitigate that risk. Obviously, I understand it's once in a lifetime thing, but how are
you thinking about it in the long-term about where you want to be?

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 26, 2020

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. To have a global pandemic come and literally be ordered out of our own factory is something that
we don't think is typical. And I don't know if it's once in a lifetime, but it's a very rare occasion. We also
have a lot of our manufacturing capacity that are spread around with CMs and the CMs are located in
different countries where they can move their production from one facility to another and move it around
into different countries.

So we look at that, we review that annually and make sure that we have an optimized footprint trying to
balance what we typically would see and what type of benefit there is financially versus spreading out over
multiple factories. So we continue to do that analysis. We have the discussions all the time, and there are
some things that we do that were not always public.

Samik Chatterjee
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just a follow-up, and I know you've commented quite a bit on the call here about kind of the strength in
the order trends you're seeing. Just wanted to kind of see if you can help us match that up relative to kind
of how you expect some of the customers that you're interacting with to respond if the macro remains
quite weak going into the second half, obviously, order trends here are strong, but the expectation, I
think, remains from the customers that macro will hold up quite well. What do you think in terms of where
do you expect to see some incremental weakness or which customers or projects do you expect to be
more fungible, relative to if we have a weaker macro in the back half of the year?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

I think the country-by-country race to lead in 5G will continue regardless of the macro situation. There
is too much of stake for a lot of our large customers, and you know them from the NEMs right through
-- right through the whole ecosystem in communications. And they will continue to drive towards getting
to market first. When you look at the GDP plus or the GDP or GDP plus businesses such as general
electronics and the general manufacturing there, you could see a slowdown, as we've seen, for instance,
in automotive.

So I think those are the businesses that will continue to see some weaknesses, which are automotive and
general electronics, but I do expect the Communications business, where there's a race for that to be
robust going forward. And as you know, that's the strongest part of the business, and that enabled us to
produce 19% operating margin.
