William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Thank you, Aaron, and good afternoon, everyone.

This is my first earnings call as acting CEO of MGM Resorts. But as most of you know, I've been with
the company for over 22 years, in the industry for over 40. I've seen many difficult periods in that time,
including the original MGM fire, 9/11, the global financial crisis, 1 October. But the COVID-19 pandemic
is truly unprecedented. I am proud of the discipline and focus that has defined our response to the crisis,
and I'm confident we are taking the necessary actions to position MGM Resorts for a sustainable recovery.

We usually start these calls with results, but since many of you have already seen our first quarter
numbers we disclosed last week, I'd like to address the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, our
employees and our communities, and then I will walk you through the quarter and our longer-term
outlook.

Before I do, I'd like to acknowledge the stewardship of our Board of Directors and the partnership of our
Chairman, Paul Salem of Providence Equity Partners. I'm grateful for their counsel as we manage through
the current environment. Paul's background provides valuable expertise on capital allocations, and we will
work together to enhance the company's overall return on investment.

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a tremendous challenge to the global economy, to society as a
whole and, of course, to a company like ours, which exists to offer guests world-class entertainment and
hospitality experiences. On an individual level, the suffering imposed by COVID-19 has been enormous.
Our hearts go to all of those who have lost family members, friends and colleagues. We have also lost 11

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

of our own at MGM. We're all extremely grateful to the medical personnel and first responders who are
serving on the frontline of this pandemic and also like to recognize the MGM employees who are reporting
to work every day and are essential to keeping our properties safe and secure.

As you all know, in mid-March, we closed all of our U.S. properties. At that time, we began to take decisive
measures to protect our business by maximizing liquidity and minimizing our cash outflows. In the past
few weeks, we have cut our dividend, reduced our deferred nonessential spending, amended our credit
agreement and raised $750 million in new bonds. The most difficult step, however, was to furlough nearly
63,000 employees. This was painful and a hard decision to make, but we are actively preparing for the day
we can welcome them back. As a result of these actions and our real estate transactions, MGM has $4.6
billion of cash on its balance sheet, excluding MGM China and MGP, an estimated domestic cash outflow of
approximately $270 million per month while we are closed.

During this international health crisis, we have focused on the safety of our employees and guests and in
strengthening the communities in which we operate. This has been and continues to be our top priority.
As such, we have committed to continue providing health benefits to our impacted employees. And while
difficult, this experience has again confirmed the strength of our values and our culture. The company, our
employees and our partners collectively have raised $12.8 million for the employee emergency grant fund
to provide relief for employees and immediate families in need. We have also given over $1 million in food
and products to local communities, provided logistics for 250,000 COVID-19 tests in Nevada and donated
over 1 million units of PPE.

MGM China has also made significant efforts to supporting the region through the crisis, including donating
MOP 20 million or approximately USD 2.5 million to the Hubei province and providing other means of
support, PPE or otherwise, to its local community.

Although COVID-19 presents unique challenges, we are extremely well positioned culturally, financially
and operationally to handle this crisis. Because of the strength and the actions we are now taking, we
are poised to regain momentum as soon as the danger to public health lifts, and we can begin to restore
normal operations.

I'm going to briefly walk you through some of the key strategic questions that will play a major role in
our performance going forward. Right now, we are intensely focused on but a few, how and when do
we reopen and what does it mean to gather safely. While we have always put health and safety at the
forefront of all that we do, they are new imperatives. Consumer confidence is key to economic recovery
and thoughtful reopening strategies are vital to building public trust. This is a responsibility that we take
extremely seriously.

So let me briefly outline our thinking about the question of how we reopen. We are working through our
safety plan right now and expect to make this public in the next 2 weeks. We know there are a number of
key areas that are essential to protect the public and build confidence in our ability to put people back to
work and safely welcome guests. We are collaborating with public health officials, experts in epidemiology
and biosafety and both state and federal governments to come up with a set of protocols that will help
deliver a secure environment. These will include measures like physical distancing, stringent sanitation
and cleanliness protocols, the provisions of PPE, crowd management and more. We're also developing
digital innovations for touchless interactions across the guest experience to improve protection and create
greater overall confidence in the hospitality environment and their overall experience. We'll continue to
be driven by data, by science and by public health guidelines as we evaluate and evolve our operating
practices and guest interactions.

This brings us to the second question, when will we be able to reopen our domestic properties? Ultimately,
the precise reopening dates depend on decisions by elected officials in consulting with public health
authorities. In MGM's case, that means the Governors of Nevada, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Ohio and New York. Due to various public health conditions in these states,
we're preparing to open properties in phases.

Given the stabilization of cases in Asia and recent comments by the Macau's Chief Executive, we anticipate
this market may show meaningful recovery early this summer. In the U.S., certain states such as

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Mississippi will likely open sooner than more heavily impacted states, and we anticipate that regional drive
markets obviously will rebound faster than fly-in destinations. Once Las Vegas casinos are allowed to
open, we'll have made decisions about property openings based on consumer demand and the economics
of individual properties. We'll also balance those needs of our employees, our local regulators and other
key stakeholders. In all cases, we will open in a way that protects the health and safety of our guests and
our employees. And again, I must stress, that is our highest priority.

Now let's spend a few minutes looking back over our Q1 results. Our net income was $807 million versus
$31 million in the prior period due to a $1.5 billion pretax gain relating to the MGM Grand and Mandalay
Bay transactions. As we previously announced, our first 2 months were even stronger than our internal
projections. Las Vegas Strip adjusted property EBITDAR was up 27%, and our regional operations
adjusted property EBITDAR was up 26%, both on a same-store basis. These strong results were driven
by robust organic growth and Phase 1 of MGM 2020 working in its full force. As expected, performance
deteriorated dramatically in March when we were required to close all of our domestic properties. As a
result, our Q1 consolidated adjusted EBITDAR was down 61% to $295 million, Las Vegas down 34% and
our regional down 28% and MGM China recording an EBITDAR loss of $22 million.

Looking ahead, our strategic planning is being driven by 3 overriding goals: to simplify our operating
model, maintain a commitment to strict capital discipline and bring an intense focus on executing our
current initiatives such as MGM 2020. Let me touch on a few of these areas.

We are significantly reducing our operating expenses by cutting expenses across all properties and
corporate departments. This is crucial to achieving long-term recovery. We moved quickly to reduce
operating costs through furloughs and freezing positions as well as eliminating nonessential expenditures.
We also initiated a program to allow senior executives and directors to receive 2020 compensation in the
form of restricted stock units.

And while operating efficiently and effectively with an eye towards improving margins has been a core
philosophy, we are taking more aggressive actions to further adjust our operating model in response to
the current environment. We believe this is a very opportunistic moment in time to operate and to take a
look at all things that we've been doing historically.

We're carefully also managing our cash to protect the company's financial position. We have deferred
or reduced our expected 2020 domestic capital expenditures by at least 50% or approximately $200
million. We have announced that the Board reduced our dividend to $0.01 per share annually, resulting
in quarterly savings of approximately $73 million. And importantly, we will continue to meet our rental
obligations to MGP and Blackstone.

We also have strengthened our liquidity position. In addition to the $4.6 billion of cash on our domestic
balance sheet today adjusted for the bond offering, MGP has also agreed to redeem $1.4 billion of our
OP units in cash should we elect to have them redeemed. We have additional liquidity levers, including
our remaining stake in MGP, our 50% stake in CityCenter and a ROFO asset, MGM China. We also have
a 56% stake in MGM China. Although to be clear, we continue to believe in the future of Macau and look
forward to continuing to invest in our presence there. We have no debt maturing prior to 2022 and just
yesterday closed on our credit agreement, an addendum providing additional flexibility on our financial
covenants. MGM China is also well positioned with over $800 million of liquidity. And earlier this month, it
further amended its credit agreement to provide for additional financial covenant relief as well. MGP has
also drawn down on its revolver for additional liquidity.

We are also continuing to advance our long-term strategic initiatives. We will drive progress on MGM 2020
by continuing to reduce expenses and pursue capital projects that allow for higher margins and returns
once our business fully recovers. We will continue to execute on our real estate strategy over time, and
we'll continue to invest in growth opportunities such as Japan, Macau, sports betting and online gaming.
And in particular, I want to emphasize, we remain fully committed to our partnership with Orix to develop
a world-class integrated resort in Osaka.

Let me spend but a moment on Macau. I was recently elected to be Chairman of MGM China alongside
Pansy Ho as Co-Chair. I am personally just as excited today about Macau as I was 20 years ago when I

first visited. We believe the market will rebound rapidly with the visa scheme and other restriction -- once
other restrictions are loosened. MGM China's properties are currently incurring cash operating expenses
of approximately $1.5 million per day, which is in excess of amounts being earned, obviously, by those
properties. While we are currently focused on managing the current situation and driving efficiencies with
our current footprint, we will continue to invest in our properties and expand our offerings, especially
on non-gaming, with more suites and more room product. I look forward to working with the new Chief
Executive of Macau and his administration and to support the strategies for further development in Macau.

In summary, we remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business. We had a strong start of
the year, which was encouraging and points to the success of a number of initiatives such as MGM 2020
that we had recently implemented. In Las Vegas, our margins were back over 30%. We have leading
assets in most of our markets, which will further support a healthy recovery to our business. We will
continue to simplify the way we operate and refocus resources into areas that create the most value for
our shareholders.

On a more personal note, to wrap up, as someone with 4 decades of experience in this industry, I'm
honored for the opportunity to lead a great company like MGM Resorts. The efforts I've outlined today
speak to my intent of being clear and focused, of being disciplined in all things and to striving to be
transparent in my leadership of this organization. Hopefully, they will become the hallmarks of what I want
to stand for and what this company stands for going forward.

While there's no proven playbook for the current challenges we face, I have faith in our deep operating
experience, our expertise in safely managing public gatherings, the strength of our long-term plan and
our tenure in this business. And more than that, I have a tremendous amount of confidence that the men
and women of MGM Resorts and our partners around the world will rise to this challenge as they have on
so many occasions before. I look forward to the day soon when we will say, once again, let's entertain the
world. Thank you.
And with that, I'll open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.

Joseph Richard Greff
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I was going to start off, Bill, with you and ask specifically you what you might be doing differently than,
say, Jim did in his tenure as CEO. But I kind of thought you laid it out pretty eloquently. So I will not take
that as 1 of my 2 questions.

So starting with question #1, and I know you talked about it, it's premature to talk about the timing of
when you can reopen your domestic properties. And so just maybe can you talk about how you think
about how you will start to phase in properties, particularly on the Las Vegas Strip? I think before, maybe
it was on CNBC, you said that maybe you would start with properties that are not on -- at the higher price
point like Excalibur, nor would it be those properties who have traditionally hosted a large percentage of
international visitors. If the Las Vegas Strip opens for the summer, how many properties by the end of
this year, realistically, optimally, do you anticipate to be opened by the end of this year? How many by the
middle of next year? How much of your views will be in reaction to airline capacity coming back? And how
much of it is dependent on the group business?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Thank you, Joe. I appreciate begging off the first question and focusing on the short, simple one. So
I'll go through this maybe in 3 buckets, and obviously, Corey can and will chime in here. Macau speaks
for itself, and Grant's on the phone to the extent, at the end of this, you want to ask some additional
questions. But we are hopeful that early this summer, given all the indicators and things we see in China,
that, that market will begin to open up. Guangdong province of note, which is critical to us, is feeling
better, although it goes back and forth, as you know. But the order of magnitude of caseloads there are
significantly down, and we feel better about what's happening, and we think there's some opportunity
there in early summer.

The regional properties, obviously, like I said in my prepared comments, are going to be -- as all of these
places are going to be predicated on what the government says, what governors are saying is at least
the baseline mandate and our regulators, we do see Mississippi first. Obviously, we see places like Empire
potentially off to later in the year, time to be determined. The good news about our regionals is they're
drive markets, with the exception of Beau, which does have some fly capacity given the 800 keys there
and the programs that we run. But we see those potentially Mississippi, potentially Maryland down the
road of note and then begin to roll out. You've all seen what's going on in Michigan. So obviously, we're in
the midst of all of that in Detroit. So we'll take one step at a time.

More specific to your question, Las Vegas, we have a view and don't know exactly when. The governor
has been speaking almost daily now on when to open. He, like most governors, is looking at a 3-phase
process, trying to open up small businesses, things like golf courses, et cetera, understand what happens
in those -- with the community in that respect, then go to the next bucket. In some areas, we're in that
next bucket, Nevada of note. And in some areas, potentially like Maryland, we may be in the third bucket
of activity. But in there, it's believed that gaming will open universally, meaning all of gaming in Southern
Nevada will have a chance to open at the same time. When it's deemed safe, again, we just don't know.
We're probably looking at 2 or 3 offerings initially, obviously something of a value set. We tend to lean
into New York-New York because it's one of our simpler places to run. It's 2,000 rooms. We're probably
looking at Bellagio at the other end. I'm wanting to ensure -- I'm sure the competitor set down the street's
going to open because they only have one in the context of Wynn and Sands. So I want to be in the high-
end business. And then from there, we're talking about what other properties should open, if any, at that
point in time. And we'll go slow. We'll be responsive and responsible. We'll look to the economics of some

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

of it. Most of these properties need to be between 30% and 50% to generate any kind of cash that is
meaningful, i.e., meaning not going backwards from being closed. And so we're going to see how the
market responds.

You did mention the airlines. We were in a conversation last week with Southwest, its President and
remaining of its leadership team. They're still bullish on Las Vegas. The interesting thing, I think, is the
point-to-point carriers will come first. Obviously, the hub guys, the Uniteds, the Americans, the Deltas
of the world have other challenges with hubs. That may restrict some activity here. But Southwest feels
relatively bullish. They won't start here first, but I think over time, you'll see them focus on this market
because, as always, in these circumstances, Las Vegas presents a great deal of value.

Corey, I don't know if you want to?

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I think you hit all the key points, Bill. I mean, obviously, safety is a key thing. We want to avoid any
spikes in numbers and things like that. So we'll do it cautiously. And in general, a lot of it will be demand-
driven. Just as a reminder, about 50% of the traffic coming into Las Vegas is from automobiles, and we do
think there will be some pent-up demand. And as the opportunity comes about, we'll definitely open up
properties to maximize our cash flow.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Grant, anything to add on Macau? Grant?

Grant R. Bowie
Executive Director

I think, Bill, I'll just reiterate again. Yes, Bill, thank you. I guess the challenge is, is that it's about
opening up, as you have seen. The critical point for us is that we expect that the volumes of traffic will
be significantly restricted. But we see that as actually somewhat of a positive because, by and large, we
think that the premium market will come back first. That's obviously where we have our strength, and
that's what we're looking to. I think everybody probably also heard that Hong Kong has extended their
quarantining requirements through June 7. But we do hope that within that time that there may be some
adjustments with China, and we're waiting just to get that information. So we're very positive, we're very
comfortable that we are trying to manage as best we can. But most importantly, from our discussions with
our customers, the demand is there, the opportunity for them to travel is the only thing they're looking
for. Thank you.

Operator

The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

You guys have spent the last several quarters, years actually, kind of putting together a top-down
framework of how to run the business more efficiently and whatnot. One of the questions I had was as you
sit from that perspective now having consolidated a lot of your expense rationale and thinking along those
lines, how much does that help you in an environment like this where you're almost starting from a very
low baseline in terms of expenses and the ability to kind of bring those expenses back on in a smart kind
of demand-driven way?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Again, I'll kick it off, and Corey. Look, I think it's been immensely valuable. If you recall, we actually
started in 2016 with, what do we call it, Corey?

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

PGP.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

PGP. Obviously, 2020, I became Chief Operating Officer last March or something along that lines. And so
our ability to understand, frankly, at most every level, whether it was corporate centers of excellence or
the various properties, regions, how we were operating, what the things we were doing, why we were
doing them, what was really bringing value, we have a very clear lens on. And so now as we think about
relaunching in a post-COVID environment and the ramp it's going to take, we have another lens into that
in terms of how we're going to structure the organization, and we have some work to do there. But we
believe when it's all said and done and we return back to a normal state, we're going to be a much more
efficient organization, focused on those things that are priority, those things that truly matter to driving
the day-to-day customer experience and our business in all the places that we serve.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

And what I would add, Carlo, is MGM 2020 really is less than a year old. And as we stood up these COEs
and centralized components of it, we've evolved since then. This closing has allowed us to really rethink
that. And we think there's opportunities to become even more efficient. The other thing that MGM 2020
gave us the discipline on is on our variable labor and staffing the business volumes. We've become very
disciplined, which is helping out tremendously in a time like this.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. And then if I could, just one follow-up. Bill, you mentioned it earlier, obviously, that the $1.4 billion
that's kind of available to you there. Clearly, with the balance sheet as it's structured today and the more
nimble expense paradigm that you guys are in, there's plenty of kind of runway with respect to liquidity. Is
the decision to kind of pull the string on that $1.4 billion more dependent on how this situation evolves 6,
9 months down the road? Or would you be advantageous in the event that you saw the valuation of that
stock more fairly reflects kind of what you, and myself included, think it's worth?

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Carlo, it's Corey. I'll take that. Look, I think based on the agreement we have with MGP, we really do
have a long-dated option. We -- as you mentioned, I think we feel really good about our liquidity position.
And it does give us -- especially what we did last week, it gives us the ability to not be in any big rush.
We'll transact when we believe it's the right time to transact and the right point and whatever is the most
efficient manner in it for us so -- and just as a reminder, MGP is a pretty important stock for us. We have
over $5 billion of value in MGP.

Next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I think in the opening remarks you mentioned still being committed to Japan. Can you just provide an
update on the milestones investors should be watching how the investment timing and size may have
evolved? And any color on expected returns?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

10

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Sure. Look, Japan, like most places in the world, is being impacted by COVID-19. I think, literally as
early as today, you may see Abe stick additional restrictions for up to another 30 days is what has been
rumored to being discussed. I think the impact to that is it will slow down, although we are not definitively
sure of the RFP process. As it currently sits in Osaka -- and we are ready for this, by the way. We have an
RFP submission that is due end of July. Our team has worked hard on this. As you know, we're the lone
standing applicant there, and we would submit. But I think what may happen is that whole process gets
pushed closer to the end of the year, which I think is appropriate and fine by us. In terms of its scale,
you see -- in terms of other opportunities in Japan, Yokohama has expressed sincere interest. It's now
working its way through its own process and time to tell whether others actually join. We still see Asia as
a huge build and as a huge upside for the company and, frankly, for the industry. We're very bullish on
Macau in the long run. And we're absolutely bullish on Japan in the long run. You're still zoned $10 billion
investment, and the returns on that to be determined once we get through all of the regs. But they're
significant, and they would be significant to the company in its overall portfolio and how we balance our
earnings as we look at everything that we have. And so we remain bullish. I think it will get delayed. And
we're ready if it does not is really, I guess, my final point.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up is related to Joe's earlier question. You had mentioned occupancy is needing
to be around -- I think it was 30% to 50% to generate meaningful cash flow. Given the model has
typically been run with very high occupancies on the strip, what are the biggest bottlenecks that you can
tackle to help alleviate crowds, increase distance and maximize that cash flow as you think about different
parts of either the property or the segment of business?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Yes, there is -- and Corey will help me with this. There's a couple of different aspects to it. Obviously,
getting air back and getting large group gatherings are critical to the ultimate and final recovery. We do
believe because of driving traffic, which particularly spikes in the summer, that regionally, we will see a
substantial amount of drive-in. I mean there's obviously pent-up demand. You saw what happened in the
beaches of California when they opened for a weekend. I think they're going to close again, which is not
what we want to do, to be clear. But I think you will see leisure demand. I think you will see drive traffic,
and it will push what happens from that perspective. The casino has always been active. Our offer set
that remains out there, people are still booking into the balance of this year and into next already. They're
anxious. They have pent-up demand as well here and in Macau to want to come back. And so irrespective
of large-scale events, I think championship fight hosted with 15,000 people, the casino segment is anxious
to come back.

Group, obviously, will be the last. I would tell you this on group as a way to think about it. We have lost
a little less than half of our group business because of the pandemic. Half of that is already rebooked
over the next 12 months. And so if you think about it in macro, we're down about 25%. But the really
encouraging thing there is that large group formats, and particularly for our company, tech businesses
come back. And so there's not a change of mindset around how people will come and gather into the
future from the Microsofts of the world who want to come back to this market and do it in a meaningful
way. So we're encouraged by that longer term. And then ultimately, obviously, we have a partnership with
AEG. We do a lot with Live Nation. Getting back major events is really going to get down to the protocols it
requires to host an event of that scale and time. I think that simply is going to probably be the last to cure
and to heal. Corey, you want to talk maybe the environment inside and the costs and...

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

I think, in general, we're going to be following a lot of the protocols like many of our competitors are. We'll
have the supplies, the gear we'll need, the distancing we will need. We're sizing that up right now on what
that would mean as how we open in all the jurisdictions. We should have a fairly good idea of that by the
next time we talk. The other area, I think, where we're going to probably see some decent play, especially

in Las Vegas at a property like Bellagio or any of our high-end, is the high-end casino customer. As Bill
mentioned, we have been in contact with them, and they were the last to leave when we closed down.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Yes, they were.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

I have a feeling some of them will be back the day we open. So that's positive. But I think the key for us
to get our margins back up will be as that group business returns. And what's strange is we still have quite
a few rooms on the books for the back half of the year. And as Bill mentioned, booking for next year has
been very strong. And in particular, in comparing it to where we were at the same time last year, looking
at 2019 and '18, which is more apples-to-apples, which was our best year, by the way, in convention room
nights, we have more rooms on the books now for 2021 than we did for 2019, at the same time in 2018.

Operator

Next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Corey, respecting your last comments, you're still working through this, I'm just trying to figure out when
you do reopen these properties and there are going to be clear social distancing measures like having
to keep a space between slot machines, like can you just give us a rough sense of like what kind of
percentage or positions you can get back online versus history? Would it be 30%, 50%, 70%? Any rough
sense in kind of the difference between Vegas and regional?

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

We're still working on those numbers. We'll be able to give you some good ideas. I could tell you the
regionals will have more of an impact. The floors in Las Vegas were built 10, 15 years ago, and this is our
chance to probably rightsize them with the proper distancing and positioning. The regionals will take a
little bit more effort, and we'll be able to talk more about it in the next quarter.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

And Tom, at Park MGM and at Aria, we're -- actually we're putting down in particularly 2 of those places
new casino carpet. Now is a good time to do it. And so we're reconfiguring those floors with the space in
mind for distancing. And so the environment will feel a little different when people walk in from day 1.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

And the only other thing I would add is some of these jurisdictions might have limits to number of people
in the building. And if that would be the case, our floor format would be adjusted for that.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Helpful. And then, look, this may be a long shot, but you're in a lot better liquidity position than some of
your peers. Have you given any thought about going on the offense?

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

It's Bill. Yes, we've given it -- of course, you always give it thought. But look, we're going to stay very
focused. We don't know how long this is going to take. We like the projects that, ultimately, if we come out
of this, we've defined with sports betting, hopefully, an extension of a license and continuation in Macau
and Japan, very -- on principal. You never say never, but that's not going to be our focus. And again, not
knowing how long all of this takes and what it does to our balance sheet. Look, right now, it's strong. If
we're up and operating, it would be stronger than it's ever been, I think, in the history of the company in
many, many decades anyways. And so we are fortunate in that respect. But again, we just don't know.

Operator

The next question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Bill, I just wanted to -- you have a unique position on some of these larger-scale group events. And Bill, I
know you spend a lot of time in some of your prior roles in some of these bigger sports relationships and
whatnot. Just kind of any insights maybe there. I mean, obviously, you've said that the group piece, which
I think you're thinking more maybe convention, may take time to come back. But what are your thoughts
specifically on some of the event-like things, so let's call it, sports and some of the key entertainment
pieces here? Just what are you hearing? What are some of those vendors, the Live Nations of the world is
saying at the moment? Can you just give us a little bit more color there? Because I think this is important
to so many people.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Yes. I mean, and obviously, this is coming from our perspective, so I don't want to speak for Live Nation
or AEG. But I would say this. As it relates to first entertainment here, we have a mindset that we will open
some of our smaller showrooms. And I'll give a simple example like Carrot Top or something that's small
and intimate with a 1-person show can be open and relatively simplistically, we can provide the proper
protections, et cetera. Obviously, that begins to scale a little bit differently when you get to Cirque. And
then when you get to the big events, on the convention side, it's not easy. But remember, we're fortunate.
We have 3.5 million square feet of space in Las Vegas. And so our ability to stretch things out more than
most, if not all, is unique. And so we can host an event. And yes, it will be a bit of a space pig, but at
least we'll be able to host the event. And so we can set up as we have with various meeting planners and
already organizations different protocols to how to do that. Until we get all the health and safety protocols,
we're not going to be definitive, but we do have that unique capacity.

As it relates to sports, and obviously for us, and you remember how we were talking about this before
this started with the Raiders, what we've seen with hockey, long-term Las Vegas will recover. Long term,
the Raiders Stadium is in our backyard, but we may see a few games this year without people. A simple
example, we were creating a large pregame environment outside of Mandalay and Luxor, which can be
pretty special. You walk over to the bridge, you go to the game and you'd be able to come back, tailgate
party. We've put that on hold because it's our general view that if we're fortunate enough to see real fans,
it won't be 65,000. And so we'll probably see stuff like that spring. We have been in ongoing dialogue
with leagues and other sporting activities around televised-only events, think boxing, MMA, NBA, NHL, et
cetera. And we can host some of that. We are working diligently with those to do that. But I think the idea
that we're going to get 15,000 people in T-Mobile for a concert anytime this year is probably a stretch.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

That's helpful. Then as my follow-up, and this is a little bit technical, so my apologies. But just I think in
the covenant waiver that came through yesterday, some of the MGP shares were pledged as collateral
for the credit facility. And so I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what kind of restrictions that
means for either the OP unit repurchase or, specifically, maybe the ability to sell down MGP shares in the
future.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Shaun, it's Corey. Yes, we did agree to pledge our OP units as collateral under our revolver credit
facility. We do not agree to any restrictions on our ability to monetize the units though, so for cash. So we
are not limited in our ability to pursue, for example, the cash redemption of up to $1.4 billion or future
other sales. There is -- in the amendment, it does provide that if we sell units under a certain level, falling
below 30%, then incremental proceeds would have to be used to reduce the commitments as long as
we're in this waiver period.

The next question will come from Harry Curtis with Instinet.

Harry Croyle Curtis
Instinet, LLC, Research Division

Bill, I wanted to ask a question about CapEx first. And now that you've been in the CEO chair for such a
long period...

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Thanks, Harry.

Harry Croyle Curtis
Instinet, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Do you -- as you look at CapEx, not in the next 6 or 12 months, but how do you feel or maybe
prioritize CapEx projects globally and their potential returns once your core business settles down? What
are the best opportunities? And maybe Grant can chime in on this as well.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Maybe a general overview, and then Corey and Grant can clearly clean up. Look, you've seen that we've
reduced our CapEx, I think I mentioned in my pre-opening remarks, in half this year. There are things that
are going to be essential to maintain the stores in the condition that we think they ought to be. It's simple
things like room remodels, Bellagio and others that will be just -- going to be ongoing maintenance costs
on things that we're going to want to do. We will become more disciplined on some of the projects. We will
become more focused on what's to be accomplished and why, with a real mindset for margin around it in
terms of just the day-to-day CapEx stuff. Domestically, with maybe the exception of New York, I think our
primary focus is going to be Asia. And so to the extent we can work our way through a license in Macau
and a renewal, which we're very hopeful for, and I think, frankly, all those activity around COVID-19, Grant
and the team have done a magnificent job putting us in good stead there with the government. But time
to tell, that would be a large priority. And then ultimately, for us, it's still all about Asia and it's Japan.
Japan represents, without a doubt, the chance to move the needle. I mean we're talking about something
that would generate EBITDA in the 20-odd percent range to boost our company and put Asia at roughly a
50% EBITDA percentage in terms of our total EBITDA. So we're focused on that.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

To Bill's point, everything -- our main focus, especially on growth, will be increasing our return on
investment. Domestically, as Bill mentioned, outside of New York, the digital technology components have
become big. And I think as we open up in this environment, you'll start seeing benefits from that. And we
still think there's a future there. Grant, I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about Asia.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

I think the critical issue, I just repeat what I -- what was said previously. We've got the south suites
coming on, and that's really important. More accommodation for us is really important. In terms of the
existing capital allocation we have, we've critically reviewed all those items and we're actually pulling back
on ones -- because what we also want to be prepared is we want to have some money left in the kitty. We
don't want to spend for the sake of spending. So we're actually taking monies we would have allocated
and then identified when we reopen, there may be some adjustments we need to make, maybe some food
and beverage things. So rather than spending and then having to come back and do it again, we're pulling
back.

Reiterating what Bill said as well, the focus for all of us is all about the concession renewal, and we have
significant plans that we have discussed earlier about opportunities to develop. But we also need to be
mindful of what the expectations of the Chief Executive are, and he is -- he does have different views. And
what we're excited about is we're putting aside funds that we will be in a position to obviously respond to
the diversification strategies that he's putting forward.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

And then, Harry, it's not huge capital dollars in respect to some of the other things we're talking about,
but sports betting, iGaming is a real opportunity. I was just reading this morning Morgan Stanley's piece.
I think the market's $8.5 billion, $10 billion. Whatever it is, it's becoming real. In New Jersey, this month
alone, if we paced out what we did the last couple of weeks in iGaming, it's a $100 million business for
us. Pennsylvania is around the corner, Michigan's around the corner and Colorado's around the corner.
And given what's happening in states because of the stress of COVID, we think that will open sooner than
later. And while not extensive capital dollars, it does run in the hundreds of -- a couple of hundred million
potentially before we "turn the corner and really make something of this." But it is, without a doubt, I
think, one of the things that's not been unlocked in our value and our valuation, but it can and it will be
over time.

Harry Croyle Curtis
Instinet, LLC, Research Division

I appreciate that. And maybe one more for Grant. And this is a very broad leading question, but can you
do enough to satisfy the Chief Executive? I'll leave it at that.

Grant R. Bowie
Executive Director

I think, clearly, all the concessionaires that are in Macau, I think, are well positioned and, clearly, we will
do what's necessary. Bill's made it very clear this is the focus of the company. We're very confident. We're
very positive. I think the simple thing, as I keep saying, is we just have to keep doing the things we're
doing better. We need to do the right thing by the people. We need to do everything well. I think during
this difficult time, I think ourselves and all the concessionaires have demonstrated our true commitment
to Macau, to the people of Macau and the future of Macau. And I think that's just how we need to always
focus it, one day at a time. It's not a single-day decision. It's all about a cumulative effort, and that's what
we're good at. We're building confidence, we're building respect and then, hopefully, for us, the rewards
will flow.

Operator

The next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So Bill, there are buyers of assets out there. You have Las Vegas Sands. You've talked about M&A. We've
seen news, Blackstone. And acknowledging that you might not make that kind of decision now, would you
be open to selling further assets?

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

President & Acting CEO

It's not immediately on the horizon. Of course, you would always be open to selling assets, I suspect, but
it's not something that we've got in our strategic plan. We have, obviously, the ROFO in Springfield, which
is an opportunity. We're looking to acquire over time the other side of CityCenter, not go that way. But
given where we are today, we've got a lot in front of us.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Look, I think we're in a really good position, and I don't think we could get the value that we got for
Bellagio or MGM today. So we'll build that business back up. And if there's an opportune time, we'll look at
for that.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And just, Grant, you had talked about the quarantine in Guangdong and just kind of watching that,
as we all are. Just adding Hong Kong into that picture, how are you thinking about Hong Kong and the
ability to travel to and from there? And how important is that to your thoughts about recovery in Macau?

Grant R. Bowie
Executive Director

Well, I think it's pretty clear that Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong, the Greater Bay Area, are all
inextricably linked. We already know that the quarantining requirements in Hong Kong will not be lifted
until the 7th of June at the earliest. Hong Kong is always an important fee to market. Even many of our
customers coming in from China come via Hong Kong, as you know. But on the other side of it, there is
a possibility, and we obviously are sitting here hoping that's happening, and the Chief Executive even
acknowledged that he is in dialogue with Guangdong to see if there cannot be some relaxation or some
progressive opening up of the Zhuhai, China border. So we know the Hong Kong date for review. We're
still positive and somewhat expectant that we may see some opportunities coming up in May for China.
And it will be multistep. The first will be the removal of the return-to-China quarantining. And then the
ultimate objective that we see coming out in the next weeks and months is the releasing of the IVS
system. And that's really the critical point for us once the IVS comes back. So Felicia, I'm sorry, I don't
have the specific timings. Those are the steps.

As I said earlier, talking to the customers, they're positive, they're confident. All of us are just sitting here
waiting to make sure that it's safe to travel. They are confident that we can take care of them. I think
we've been very good at communicating that. So it's -- we're ready to go. And frankly, after all this time,
we're very anxious to get started, as you can imagine.

Operator

The next question will come from John DeCree with Union Gaming.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Research, LLC

Just one for me, maybe for Corey. Last slide in your deck talked about the CARES Act and some of the
possible benefits there related to payroll, tax and carrybacks. I was wondering if you could give us some
insight as to what that might -- what that quantum might be. Or if you've kind of sized that up. Is it
meaningful for you? Might be a little too early to some of those carrybacks, but I just wanted to get your
initial thoughts on what that means for your company.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I'll go through each one, and I'm not sure I could quantify them all because not knowing where
our numbers are going to be, that would be dependent on that. But obviously, the refund of the federal

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

income tax 5-year carryback, that will play on our 2020 return, which we'll file in '21. That will be a pretty
good number based on where our projections are. We haven't quantified it yet, but we'll -- hopefully, over
the next few months, we'll be able to.

On the interest expense deduction limitation for income tax benefits, we also expect to see a little bit
benefit of that in '21 but more in '22 since we'll be carrying back most of our loss. There's actually 2
payroll provisions. One is actually on the payments of furlough and health benefits, we will receive a 50%
deduction on that component. Those regulations are getting written right now. We had a pretty significant
payment that we will receive that credit -- actually, right now, we're receiving it. And then finally, there's
the deferral of the FICA tax of the employer portion. Any of those payments would be deferred to '21 and
'22. So we haven't quantified the amounts yet. Over the next few months, we'll try to put some numbers
around that and get that out there.

Catherine Park
Executive Director of Investor Relations

And we'll take the last question, please.

Operator

Sure. Then that question will be from David Katz from Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Last. Seriously, I appreciate it and all of the detail. Look, there's a bit of dissonance that I was hoping you
could talk a bit more about because you have talked about the efforts to size the business appropriately
that were ongoing precrisis, that are still ongoing and they change. At the same time, reopening may bear
some incremental costs as well. Have you had a moment to sort of lay those side by side? And ultimately,
I suppose the thrust of my question is which one of this -- which one's bigger? Does it come out to be net
positive at the end of the day? Is that what you're ultimately hoping to solve for?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Well, let me kick it off, and then Corey can clearly clean it up. Yes, the answer is, of course, it wants
to be net positive. There are going to be, given the protocols that we have talked about, whether they
are cleaning or otherwise, some additional cost. But I would offset it with a simple idea and a notion.
The protocol to clean a room in this environment is going to be extensive. And therefore, you could
argue that the efficiency around room credits will have to be altered. I would argue the other side of
that, which would simply say, if I'm a guest in Bellagio, I want to know that my room is pristine when
I go in. And during my stay, unless I want and need clean towels, I'm probably not going to let a guest
room attendant or any other service personnel in my room. And so I think you'll see a varying degree
of offsets. Things like restaurants, even though we are talking about opening Bellagio potentially first, it
won't be full service to all restaurants. There will be some. There will be pickup, pick and go, if you will,
for pickup opportunities for food and beverage. And so we're going to take the current state in mind. Until
we get through all of the health protocols, it's a bit difficult, and that's why I said 2 weeks in my prepared
comments, but we will be by then. To then putting Corey and his team are working diligently around some
of the costs, we definitely think they offset kind of the moves we're talking about in terms of structure.
But Corey, maybe you could...

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. What I would say, David, is we do have a decent understanding of what those costs are going to be.
We think we'll end up on the better side of that. And by the way, we open the properties and ramp them.
We will be able to manage a component of that. More in particular, we think we should be able to offset
most of these costs at fairly low occupancy. So as we open properties and determine that, that will be --
the demand for the town will be a big component of that.

Aaron Alexander Fischer
Chief Strategy Officer

Yes, David, it's Aaron. Just to clarify something, so obviously, we're not giving disclosures in terms of our
breakeven points. But naturally, we recognize that our occupancy and utilization rates are going to be
lower as we ramp up. So what we're aiming to do through the cost-cutting is lower our breakeven points.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President & Acting CEO

Okay. Maybe if I could just offer up a couple of closing thoughts, and I appreciate everyone's time today.

First and foremost, for me and the company, getting these properties up and operating, doing it in a safe
manner both for our employees and our guests is priority one. I think, again, we're ideally positioned to
do that. We understand the environment well. We understand the organization well. And candidly, we feel
the responsibility. Particularly here in Southern Nevada, our industry to this state is the most important
industry in any state in the country, more than autos are to Michigan, more than tech is to California. And
we are the largest taxpayer and largest employer in the state. So I can assure you, we are keenly focused
on wanting to reopen, but we will only do it safely.

We are going to be a better, more efficient organization moving forward. You have our commitment on
that and mine. We know how to do this, and we will do this, and we'll make this as effective as it can be.
Obviously, as we roll out, there are going to be things that we've never experienced before, so we'll have
some ups and downs. But I can assure you, collectively, we'll end up with a more efficient organization
when we fully come out of the other side of this thing.

Despite all of it, we are not going to lose track of our long-term strategic initiatives. We are keenly focused
particularly on sports and iGaming in this time frame. There is real money particularly in iGaming today.
And sports will begin to unfold this fall and hopefully sooner. And our real estate strategies in creating, yet
again, a fortress balance sheet are critical. The notion of asset-light moving forward is critical.

And ultimately, my goal, my desire, my push, and I know it's shared by our Board, is to be ever present
and larger and more meaningfully involved in Asia, both in Macau and, hopefully, in Japan, if we're
fortunate enough to win a license there.

So I thank you for your time. Everyone, be safe and be well. And I look forward to talking to you again
next trip. Thank you.

Operator
And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You
