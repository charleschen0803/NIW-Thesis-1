Thanks, Lauren
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your participation on the call this morning
In today's challenging fast-changing retail landscape, the results Lauren just described are a truly exceptional achievement
It took an incredibly talented team of associates to produce the sixth consecutive year of all-time best financial performance as an athletic specialty company
And I want to start off my remarks by sincerely thanking each of our associates for their dedicated efforts in the quarter and throughout 2016. Their work has firmly positioned our banners at the center of sneaker culture, which not only has produced strong results in recent years, but has also established a strong foundation upon which to build and shape our business in the future
This work is an ongoing effort
We introduced a new strategic framework at the beginning of 2015, and revised the key strategic initiatives that the company has been working on diligently since 2010. These initiatives are: driving performance in the core business; expanding leadership in Kids; expanding in Europe; building our apparel business; elevating our digital business; and delivering growth in the women's business
As I'll describe next, these initiatives have driven our recent financial success
And we intend to continue to pursue these initiatives further in 2017 to sustain our key leadership position in the athletic retail industry
First, we drove strong performance in our core business, namely our male banners in North America including Foot Locker, Champs Sports and Footaction
Coming on top of last year's outstanding results, this year's strength spans several categories, the most important of which was lifestyle running
Nike remained the lead brand, with solid sales of Huarache and Presto, along with Air Max products, while adidas led the category's growth, with Nomad, Boost, AlphaBOUNCE, Tubular Shadow, and YEEZYs, all posting strong sell-throughs
The Jordan Retro assortments were very productive in the quarter, helping more than offset the declines in signature basketball
The overall basketball category posted a modest gain for the quarter and full year, led by the Jordan brand and Superstars
Classic sneakers remain very much on trend in our core business, led primarily by adi and PUMA, although Nike also had successes
The opening of our flagship store on 34th Street in August really energized many of our customers, as has the grand opening of the Foot Locker in Times Square earlier this month
It's great to see the excitement that these pinnacle retail destinations generate for our brand
As Lauren mentioned, we also have reopened a key store in Sydney this month and have similar openings coming up in Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Melbourne later this year
In other words, we're cultivating that strong connection with sneaker culture in major markets not just in the U.S
, but in many of our key cities around the world
Second, our Kids business continues to generate the largest dollar sales increases among our growth pillars, driven by many of the same styles I mentioned for the core business
Our younger customers are connected digitally at a very early age and they really want the same cool sneakers that their big brother or sister or, oftentimes, their parents are wearing
And they want them now, not a few months down the road
A solid comparable sales increase of Kids footwear within our adult banners was partially offset by the sales decline Lauren mentioned at Kids Foot Locker
In part, this was a function of the fact that not all of today's hottest styles are available on the same timelines in sufficient quantity in kids' sizes
Nonetheless, total Kids Foot Locker sales in the U.S
increased and we expanded the banner's footprint outside the U.S
to 41 at year-end
Next, our Foot Locker banner in Europe produced another strong year
Although sales did not increase as rapidly in 2016 as they had in recent years, productivity and profitability remained high, with solid momentum across categories and families of business
As we have discussed, our customers in Europe are just as engaged with sneaker culture in their own way as their American peers
We continued to strengthen our pan-European presence by opening 22 new Foot Locker stores over the course of 2016. We're also investing in pinnacle retail experiences in Europe, as evidenced by the new Jumpman store in Paris that we opened in November, in partnership with brand Jordan
We intend to continue to invest aggressively in our European business, including new stores and remodels
As Lauren mentioned, our German-based Runners Point and Sidestep banners continued to struggle in Q4. We've recently had a management change there and we continue to work internally and with our vendors to position these banners over time with the trend-right assortments that we believe will resonate with their respective customers
We recently opened a new Sidestep store in Cologne, in a space that a Foot Locker store had outgrown and the early results from this somewhat larger space for Sidestep have been encouraging
Our fourth strategic initiative calls for building apparel penetration and profitability
In this case, we were one out of two, as the profitability piece improved across most of our banners in both the quarter and 2016. In the U.S
, the growth of adidas in footwear was mirrored by strength in apparel, whereas internationally, it was Nike that posted the best apparel growth
On the women's apparel side, PUMA also contributed significantly
The focus on premium asset-connected, and predominantly branded apparel as opposed to the old cotton by the pound model, continues to help augment our connection with our customers beyond sneakers and push apparel margins ever closer to footwear margins
In total, apparel and accessories sales were just under 18% of our business, down a bit from the 18.5% for 2015. The digital business, our next growth pillar, had a good year, especially encouraging progress in Europe and Canada where the proportion of digital to total banner sales is still relatively low
In the U.S
, sales in our much more mature store banner dot-com businesses collectively increased almost 20%
Although we report sales on sales channels, our customers don't think in those terms
They think in terms of our brands, excuse me
Foot Locker on their smartphone is the same to them as the Foot Locker store and they choose whether to transact with us digitally or in-store based on the variety of factors which continue to evolve
The investments we are making in our new ecommerce platform which will be rolled out by banner during the course of 2017, will provide us with tremendous capabilities to enhance and connect our customer experiences far better than we do today
The soft spot in our digital business in 2016 was Eastbay
While that customer still loves the performance gear Eastbay is best known for, we could have done a better job than the last year or two, keeping connected with that high-school athlete
While we've been focusing on providing him and her with the latest performance styles, we somewhat lost sight of the fact that for every pair of true performance shoes in their closet or locker, there're probably a half a dozen or more casual athletic pairs in there too
Our final growth pillar, women's, posted solid improvements in 2016. While the sale of women's footwear in our predominantly male banners was strong virtually all year, the SIX:02 results picked up especially in the second half of the year, after the new flagship store on 34th Street opened
Another key factor was the decision we made early in the year to fully integrate the SIX:02 digital and store teams, which has begun to bear fruit as seen in the substantial momentum at SIX:02.com in the fall season
As Lauren mentioned, much of that progress was driven by our relationship with PUMA and the position we were able to take in the highly sought-after FENTY product by Rihanna
Looking ahead, the new SIX:02 store in Times Square will introduce the banner to a vast number of new customers and we plan to open a similar pinnacle store in a new Foot Locker location in Los Angeles later this year
This brings me to the most important piece of our strategic framework; our people
I firmly believe we have the best team in retail, and I can't thank them enough for their performance in 2016. We have an enviable mix of backgrounds at Foot Locker, Inc
For example, we were recently recognized by Fortune magazine as having one of the Best Workplaces for Diversity
We have many industry veterans, people who have been with us for decades as well as some exceptional new talent that has joined us very recently
It's a diverse, inclusive, engaging, forward-thinking, and ever-changing mix of talent, that for me at least, makes everyday a fun and invigorating experience at Foot Locker, and makes Foot Locker a great place to work
So before we get to your questions, let me turn the call back to Lauren to give you our initial read on 2017.
Good morning, Paul
Well, Paul, I think that the consumer is moving towards cool, right? I mean, that's what our â€“ really drives sneaker culture and them finding the coolest sneaker at the right time is what's important
We don't believe that fundamentally, the consumer's appetite has changed at all for products
So the guidance around mid single digit comps, we know that the tax checks are going to flow and we know that our consumer likes to buy new sneakers when they get their tax refunds
So as important as the running category was in 2016, we continue to see that category being important
We see some life in basketball
There's been some sparks that certainly we saw down in New Orleans at the All-Star Game
We expect that to continue to improve throughout 2017. Casual has sort of the life of its own and the consumer moves from silhouette to silhouette depending on their need on any given day
And then I see continued strength in apparel
So our families of business, from men's, women's, and Kids continue to have opportunity across various categories
So the confidence and our consumer still having a huge passion around sneakers is still there
We expect ASP growth to continue to have some upside, Paul
We've talked about it many times that our ASP model is pretty complex
There's a shift from one silhouette to another in footwear
There's a shift amongst preschool, infant and grade school
There's more expensive apparel that's being sold rather than less expensive
So we see that there is upside in our ASP certainly in 2017.
Thanks, Paul
Well, in terms of remodels, we've talked about an ongoing program
Lauren detailed the capital expense plans for 2017. So we'll continue certainly to upgrade the fleet
And we manage a big portfolio of stores and with our real estate and store development team continue to identify the right opportunities to upgrade those stores from a remodel perspective
So that program will continue
And we certainly have had some great learnings with SIX:02 on Times Square and on 34th Street
And, as Lauren mentioned, or I guess I mentioned, we'll open another SIX:02 store inside a flagship Foot Locker out in Los Angeles later this year
We will continue to upgrade our current fleet from the learnings that we've got around brands, merchandising, et cetera, that we learned from these two pinnacle spaces; also take some of the learnings that we get from our online digital business
Are there brands that we've tested there that we should roll out? Those are the key learnings that we'll use to help mature that SIX:02 brand
Well, Kids Foot Locker did underperform its past track record, and I think certainly the fourth quarter was in (39:33) a bit of an anomaly
We still have a lot of faith in the Kids Foot Locker banner as we continue to expand its footprint
We had some doors where we added a partnership space, the Fly Zone, so there's some learnings that go along with the right amount of space allocation between the Fly Zone product and the base Kids Foot Locker product
So our Kids Foot Locker team is energized for 2017 and they're certainly making great decisions in terms of the products that they're flowing in
We continue to work with our vendors to help them understand that our family of muse is actually in Kids Foot Locker between the young male, the young female, and the parents that are providing the money to shop, they look for the same products as Foot Locker has, or Lady Foot Locker, SIX:02 or Champs Sports have all at the same time
And we're working with our vendors to try to ensure that deliveries line up, so that when cool hits the big brother store, it's also there for the little brother
Okay, Kathy?
