TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the TE Connectivity First Quarter
Earnings Call for Fiscal Year 2020. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I
would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah.
Please go ahead.

Sujal Shah
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's first quarter
2020 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath
Mitts.

During this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the
forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain
non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press
release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.

The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor
Relations portion of our website at te.com.

Also, within the Industrial segment, we have broken out sales for our medical business separately from
industrial equipment. On Slide 17 and on our website, you will see 8 quarters of historical revenue for
the medical business and industrial equipment for your reference. There is no change to our segment
reporting or those numbers.

[Operator Instructions]

Now let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Thank you, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to cover our first quarter results as well
as our increased outlook for fiscal 2020.

As I normally do, before we get into the slides, I do want to frame out some of the key points that Heath
and I will bring out during today's call.

First is that things are playing out as we expected when we provided our original guidance to you 90 days
ago. Our expectations of markets in fiscal 2020 is essentially unchanged. Our order patterns are indicating
stability. And the distribution destocking that we talked about for a few quarters is trending as we expect.

In addition to the things playing out, I'm also very pleased with our execution in the first quarter. And this
is against the continued challenging market backdrop. We delivered revenue above the guidance midpoint
and adjusted earnings per share above the high end of guidance, driven by strong operational execution
across our segments.

Based upon our strong first quarter, we are raising our full year guidance to reflect the outperformance in
the first quarter, and we're maintaining a view of second half that is consistent with our guidance that we
gave you 90 days ago.

And then finally, there are 2 things that we talked about with you and we're focused on within this market
backdrop that we're operating in. First is we're going to continue to focus on content growth that will
enable outperformance versus the underlying end markets that we positioned TE around, and we are
continuing to benefit from these secular trends across our businesses. The second key thing is that we

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

continue to improve our earnings power by executing on cost actions and footprint consolidation plans,
which we will expect to generate higher margins and earnings from the first half to the second half of our
fiscal year.

So with that as a quick summary, let's get into the slides, and let me ask you to turn to Slide 3, and
I'll get into some of the highlights from the first quarter. Sales of $3.2 billion exceeded the midpoint
of our guidance, representing 5% year-on-year declines on both reported and organic basis driven by
market weakness. While the number of our markets are challenging, we continue to demonstrate content
growth across our business, and this can be whether it's an electric vehicle or autonomous features and
transportation, next-generation aircraft and non-invasive medical procedures in our Industrial segment, or
cloud computing in communications.

By segment, Transportation was down 6% organically as we expected, driven by production declines in
both the auto market as well as commercial transportation market.

Industrial Solutions saw growth 1% organically, which was ahead of our guidance, driven by continued
strength in AD&M, medical and energy.

And our Communications segment declined 14% organically as we expected, driven by continued
inventory destocking in the distribution channel, which we've been talking about for a few quarters.

As we've highlighted to you, supply chain adjustments take a few quarters to play out, and this is
happening as we expected supported by our orders increasing sequentially and our book-to-bill ending the
quarter at 1.02, and I'll cover that when I cover the order slide in a few minutes.

From an earnings perspective, adjusted operating margins were approximately 16% as we expected.
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.21, which exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by higher
sales and execution of our cost initiatives.

On a 5% sales decline, adjusted earnings per share declined at a similar rate, demonstrating strong
operating performance and the benefit of pulling levers to reduce costs in an uncertain market
environment to preserve earnings resiliency.

From a cash flow perspective, our free cash flow was very strong during the quarter at approximately
$245 million. And approximately, we returned approximately $300 million back to our owners through
dividends and share repurchases. I want to be clear that our capital strategy continues to include capital
deployment to build out our portfolio inorganically and capitalize on secular trends to drive future growth.

Now let me turn over and talk about our full year guidance briefly, and I'll come back towards the end of
the call and get into more details about it. For the full year, this does reflect the upside in our first quarter
and a view of the second half that is consistent with our prior view. We now expect sales of $13.05 billion.
The sales guidance assumes organic decline for the year of 1% to 3%.

On a year-on-year basis, our sales guidance reflects a decline of approximately $400 million. Half of this
is due to currency exchange rates, and the other hand is driven by the market weakness in distribution,
inventory destocking, which we discussed with you last quarter. We are raising the low end of our adjusted
EPS guidance to get to a midpoint of $5.10. This midpoint continues to include $0.30 of year-over-year
headwinds from currency and tax impacts, which is the same as our guide from last quarter.

While we can influence the market environment, I am pleased that we continue to execute on leverage,
which we can control to drive our cost reduction and footprint consolidation plans, while continuing to
invest in the long-term growth and our content opportunities.

As we discussed last quarter, we expect to generate improvements in both margin and earnings per share
as we move from the first half to the second half of this fiscal year.

So with that as a backdrop of our first quarter results, let me get into order trends, and I'd ask you to turn
to Slide 4.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

For the first quarter, our book-to-bill was 1.02, and this exceeded 1 for the first time since the second
quarter of 2019 and reflects an improving supply chain as well as stability in certain end markets. Organic
orders were down 2% year-over-year, but we did see orders grow sequentially, signaling stabilization in
some of the key markets.

When I talk about orders, I'm going to talk about them on a sequential basis, and this helped lays
out the foundation for our quarter 2 guidance and how we're thinking about the shape of our year. In
transportation, orders declined slightly sequentially as we expected, driven by North America, and this was
offset by growth in China.

In Europe, in Transportation, orders were essentially flat on a sequential basis. And as we think about
the market, we continue to expect global auto production to be stable at a run rate of approximately 21
million units per quarter through fiscal 2020.

Turning to Industrial. Our orders grew sequentially across all regions, and the growth was driven by AD&M
as well as medical.

In the Communications segment, we saw strong sequential order growth in both appliances and data
devices, reinforcing our expectation of growth in the second half. And as we talked about the distribution
channel, from an overall basis, and certainly, the channel impacts our CS segment the most as well as our
industrial equipment business in industrial. Our orders did decline 10% year-over-year, as we expected,
but more importantly, we saw orders growth grow double digits sequentially and have reinforced our view
of the inventory normalization that we expect by the end of quarter 2 and will drive sequential growth as
we get into the second half of the year.

So with that being a summary of orders, let's get into the segment performance, and I'll start with
transportation that begins on Slide 5.

Transportation sales were down 6% organically year-over-year as we expected. Our auto sales were down
3% organically, driven by global auto production declines. Once again, we continue to outperform auto
production due to content growth, driven by the increase in electric vehicles

as well as autonomous features and vehicles.

In our commercial transportation business, sales were down 16% organically, driven by weakness in North
America and Europe, and this was partially offset by growth in China as a result of China 6 emissions
adoption as well as content gains by us.

In sensors, our sales were down 11% organically, and this was driven by the weakness in the commercial
transportation and industrial end markets. In auto, our sensors revenue was flat year-over-year despite
production declines, as it reflects the ramps of the new design wins that we've been talking about for a
number of years.

From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were 17.4% as expected, down year-over-year on
lower volumes.

So let's turn to Industrial Solutions segment, and that starts on Slide 6. For the segment, sales grew 1%
organically year-over-year, and this was above our expectations. Three of our businesses in the segment
saw very strong growth, which was partially offset by ongoing weakness in the industrial equipment
market. Our aerospace, defense and marine business delivered another very strong quarter of 9% organic
growth, driven by content growth and new programs in both commercial aerospace as well as defense.

As Sujal mentioned earlier, we are now breaking out our medical business from our industrial equipment
business to give you greater visibility to another area of growth within TE. Now just as a reminder, in
medical, we serve both the interventional and surgical imaging markets, and the key area of focus from
an application perspective are areas around minimally invasive medical products. What's great here is
we are a partner of choice to premier OEMs, and our technology enables customers to build the medical
devices that save lives as well as reduce costs. What's really nice about what we've built here is that our

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

engineering capability as well as track record of quality, medical expertise and broad technical offering
really differentiate TE in this market.

From a performance perspective in the quarter, the medical business grew 7%, and it was driven by
growth entirely by interventional applications, and this trend is one that's going to continue to drive
growth for quite some time for us.

And our energy business had very nice quarter. It was up 12% organically. And this growth was being
driven by investments in renewable energies as well as infrastructure upgrades in certain parts of the
world.

In the industrial equipment business, our sales were down 15% organically, driven by both weak market
conditions and factory automation applications as well as this unit is being impacted by distribution
inventory destocking.

From an earnings perspective, adjusted operating margins were down as we expected due to the cost
from footprint optimization activities. And as we talked to you before, we continue to remain on track with
our multiyear margin expansion plan for the segment.

So with that, I'd like to turn to Slide 7, and let me get into Communications Solutions. Data devices sales
were down 15% organically, and our appliance business sales were also down double-digit organically.
And these were in line with our expectations. We saw demand-driven weakness across all regions, along
with ongoing inventory destocking in the distribution channel. As a reminder, this segment has the highest
percentage of our business going through distribution, so they will always have a greater impact from
channel dynamics than the other 2 segments. As I mentioned earlier, what's really nice is we did see
sequential growth in orders for both of these businesses, which gives us confidence of growth as we move
into the second half of our fiscal year.

Margins in the segment were 12.1%, and they were impacted by the volume-driven sales decline. And we
expect to return to mid-teen target margins in the second half as distribution channel normalizes to be
more in line with market conditions.

With that, I'm going to turn it over to Heath, who will go through the financials in some more detail, and
I'll come back and cover guidance in a little bit.

Heath A. Mitts
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more
details on the Q1 financials.

Adjusted operating income was $502 million with an adjusted operating margin of 15.8%. GAAP operating
income was $471 million and included $24 million of restructuring and other charges and $7 million of
acquisition charges. We continue to expect fiscal 2020 restructuring charges to be similar to fiscal '19.

Adjusted EPS was $1.21, down 6% year-over-year. And as Terrence mentioned, on a 5% sales decline,
adjusted EPS declined at a similar rate, demonstrating our ability to execute on multiple levers to drive
earnings performance. GAAP EPS was $0.07 for the quarter but then included a tax-related charge of
$1.05, which was related to the impact of the Swiss tax reform that we had talked to you about last
summer. This was a noncash charge. We also had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.09.

The adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 18.6%. And for the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted
effective tax rate of around %18 to %18.5 and that's unchanged from our prior review from 90 days ago.

Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year.

Now if you turn to Slide 9. Sales of $3.2 billion were down 5% year-over-year on both the reported
and organic basis. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted sales by $43 million versus the prior
year. Adjusted operating margins were 15.8% as expected. As Terrence mentioned, we expect margin

expansion from the first half to the second half of the year as we see benefits of sales growth and the cost
actions we've initiated over the past year.

I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in driving improvements to our cost structure.
The team is executing well, but we still have work to do on our footprint optimization plan. As discussed in
the past, this is a multiyear journey, but I feel like we're on track.

In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $411 million and up 25% year-on-year. Free cash flow
was $243 million, and we returned $297 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases
in the quarter.

Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect cash flow to remain strong, which provides us the
flexibility to utilize cash to support organic growth investments to drive long-term sustainable growth while
also allowing us to return capital to shareholders and continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions.

We are seeing the benefits of the levers in our business model to help mitigate the impacts on weaker
sales on our margin and EPS performance. And as you should expect, we will continue to balance our
structural cost actions with our long-term growth investments to ensure sustainability in our business
model.

So with that, I'll turn back to Terrence to cover guidance.

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Thanks, Heath. And, yes, let me get into our guidance, and I'll get into the second quarter, which is on
Slide 10.

As I mentioned earlier, our markets are playing out as we expected and we laid out for you 90 days ago.
Driven by the order patterns that we see in quarter 1 that I covered earlier, we do expect second quarter
revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 to $1.28 per share.

At the midpoint, this represents declines in reported sales of 6% overall and organic sales of 5% year-
over-year and reflects the weakness in the end markets and the ongoing effects of destocking in the
distribution channel. We do expect to grow sequentially from the first quarter to the second in both sales
and adjusted earnings per share, and that is a view that gives us confidence about stabilization.

By segment, we do expect Transportation Solutions to be down low single digits organically, and it's mainly
going to be driven by the weakness in the commercial transportation market and with mid- single-digit
declines in global auto production.

Industrial Solutions is expected to be down low single digits organically with continued market weakness
in industrial equipment, being partially offset by growth in medical, defense and energy. And in
Communications, we expect to be down low teens organically driven by continued inventory destocking in
the distribution channel.

So please turn to Slide 11, and let me get into the full year guidance. As I covered earlier, we expect full
year sales of $13.05 billion at midpoint, and this will represent year-over-year declines in reported sales of
3% and on an organic basis, 2%. We are continuing to expect year-over-year headwinds of approximately
$0.30 from currency exchange and tax rates, and note that most of the year-over-year tax headwind will
occur in the second half.

Let me get into some more color on our segments that are included in our guidance. In Transportation, we
expect for the year to be down low single digits organically. We expect our organic auto sales to be flat to
down slightly for the full year. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect a global auto production
run rate of approximately 21 million vehicles per quarter, resulting in mid-single-digit global production
declines for fiscal 2020, which is consistent with our prior view. We expect content growth to enable us to
continue to outperform declining auto production. We also expect our commercial transportation business
to outperform high single-digit market declines in that market due to content growth and share gains this
year.

TE CONNECTIVITY LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

In our Industrial segment, we expect to grow low single digits organically, with growth in defense, medical
and energy, partially offset by declines in industrial equipment.

And finally, in Communications, we do expect to be down mid-single digits organically, with both data and
devices, appliances being impacted by the continued broad market weakness and inventory destocking
in the distribution channel. Once we work through the inventory adjustments in the first half, we do
expect to move back to positive year-on-year organic growth for the second half of the year in our
Communications segment.

So before I get into questions, let me just recap the key points that we made today, and I'm sure we'll talk
more about in Q&A.

First, we have built a strong portfolio with leadership positions in the markets we serve. This portfolio that
we built is performing significantly better than the last time we went through a market downturn. This
is evident in our quarter 1 results, where we delivered sales and adjusted earnings per share ahead of
guidance, and our operating execution enabled us to raise our guidance for fiscal 2020.

The second key point are things are playing out as we expected when we provided our guidance 90 days
ago. Our expectations of markets in fiscal 2020 is essentially unchanged. Our order patterns are indicating
stability, and distribution destocking is trending as we expected, giving us confidence in the sales and
earnings growth sequentially in the second half.

The third key point is around content. And content growth is enabling outperformance even in declining
markets and is helping to buffer the market conditions we're seeing. We're going to continue to benefit
from secular trends, whether it's electric vehicles, autonomy, next-generation aircraft, minimally-invasive
medical applications, factory automation or cloud computing. And these trends are going to be with us for
a long time. And finally, we are executing on what we can control through our restructuring plans across
all of our segments, and we're focused on this to ensure we get greater leverage in earnings power when
markets return to growth.

So with that, I do want to thank our employees around the world for their continued strong execution
as well as our continued commitment towards our customers and a future that is safer, sustainable,
productive and connected.

So Sujal, with that, let's get to Q&A.

Sujal Shah
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. Amy, could you give the instructions for the Q&A session?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. Terrence, nice performance in a pretty tough end market here. So can you maybe talk a little bit -- in
a little bit more detail what your assumptions are for the year for the various end markets and with some
color on geographic performance as well?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks, Wamsi. And yes, during the call, I used the word stable a lot. I also said challenging, so
your question is very fair.

There's markets that have been strong and are going to continue to be strong. Yes. They're medical,
certainly defense, energy, and you heard that a lot, and they're in our Industrial segment. But when
I used the word stable, it really says some of the supply chain things are working off like we saw in
distribution, but there's still are markets that are challenging.

Auto production, we expect to be down mid-single digits. I talked about that around the 21 million units
a quarter, and we're repositioning ourselves on content, will help get us down to closer to flat on the year
versus a negative production environment. The industrial transportation space, certainly, that space is one
where North America heavy truck rolled over, and we're being impacted by that. But we do expect that
market to be down high single digits for the year because of also how we're positioned in China. You got
Euro VI emissions. You also have strong content gain we have in that market, and that's going to buffer to
get us nice separation there.

The other area that I would say that I think is going to continue to be challenging is the factory
automation and industrial equipment market. That's a market that's clearly being impacted by capital
spending on the planet. Our business both has the underlying market. It's going to continue to be
challenged. And -- but we also have some inventory destocking.

So how I would frame, and similar to how we framed it 90 days ago, was we don't see a world where our
markets are going to get a lot better this year. We see some of these supply chain effects working through
March, basically the end of our second quarter, and we're going to get our normal seasonality. So I would
say the markets we're playing with, I'm glad we have the content opportunity. We have to buffer some of
it. And we'll start seeing some growth in some of the markets later in the year once the channel effects
get off.

From a geographic perspective -- so hopefully, that helps. From a geographic perspective, Wamsi, it was
an interesting environment, and I'm probably going to talk much more around sequentially. We saw --
China was a little bit better coming out of our first quarter sequentially. Europe was a little bit worse,
and North America was relatively sideways. So it's other things that are very much around how do we
see things from a stability perspective. Our book-to-bill was above 1 in all regions. We were 1.02 overall,
which, as I said on the call, it was the first time we were above 1. It gives us a view that things were
working through and getting a little bit more back to parity. So it means we built some backlog, which is
good as we get into the second half of the year.

Sujal Shah
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, Wamsi.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.

Christopher D. Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Just wondering if you're seeing any interesting changes in the cadence around design cycles in electric
vehicles, China and EU come to mind, versus the baseline expectations for the development of that
market.

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

No. Thanks, Chris. And when you look at it, what's intriguing is we've always talked to you about electric
vehicles, and electric vehicle production is probably going to go from about a little bit over 6 million units,
sorry, to over 9 million units. And this year is going to be really one that's driven by Europe. China, we
sort of view -- and when I do electric vehicles, many of you know, I include plug-in hybrids and hybrids in
that number. It's not a pure NAV number. Just it's the broader thing. And really, what we're seeing is we're
seeing a year where China will be in sideways. They had some of the stimulus come off from a production,
but Europe is going to be the real growth driver. And you're seeing it with the CO2 regulations. We aren't
seeing any changes in designs. We are still of the opinion, if you take the 2 mega trends that we have in
automotive around electric vehicle as well as autonomy features, our customers are prioritizing electric
vehicles ahead of autonomy. We're going to benefit from both of those trends, which I think is a unique
proposition that we have. But the electric vehicle trend is helping drive the content buffer I talked about,
and we're not seeing any change in design cycles at all. If anything, they're trying to get their designs
done at quicker rates than traditional combustion engines.

Sujal Shah
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, Chris.

Operator

Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.

Craig Matthew Hettenbach
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Terrence, can you provide an update just on the automotive sensor design pipeline? And any particular
sensor types from -- that you're seeing traction within automotive?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Yes, no. So a couple of things, Craig. Thanks for the question. First off, when you look at our sensors'
results, you see really -- 75% of our sensors business from a revenue is still sort of pointed at heavy
vehicle as well as the industrial markets. And some of our growth we saw this quarter looks very much
similar to what we saw in our industrial equipment and commercial transportation in our core connector
products. But our auto sensor revenue was flat. So certainly getting outperformance versus the mid-
single-digit declines we're talking about. And the ramps are continuing to happen as we thought. We're
being impacted by a slower environment, but the traction we've talked to you about and the pipeline we've
talked to you about continues to remain intact. And right now it's really all about production is impacting
why we're not seeing more growth other than flat in that market.

Sujal Shah
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, Craig.

Erin Alexandra Welcenbach
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

This is Erin Welcenbach on for David. So a follow-up question on the sort of the EV and autonomy
discussion. There's been some talk in the industry about architectural changes. What are you seeing with
respect to EV and autonomy trends? And how do these architectural changes impact content growth for
TE?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Thanks, Erin. And I will build on the question I talked about earlier. So number one is we feel very good
about our content growth opportunities. And our content growth opportunities, you have to realize, all
starts where does power need to go in the car, where does signaling need to be in the car as well as when
you deal with autonomy and data. And data is the one that is really the latecomer, but when you deal with
power and you go to electric vehicle architecture, you're dealing with different power than a 12-volt or 48-
volt system that we've lived with or changing to. So it's what gives us confidence around this 4% to 6%.

And as I said, for us, a bigger driver will be electrification. We also will benefit from autonomy as the data
network and the car continues to evolve. And architecture in a car always evolves. Our OEM customers are
the ones that control the architecture. It is part of how they differentiate, and it's something they own.
And they typically don't let a Tier 1 control that. But when you look at it, as those 3 building blocks build,
and what we see -- we continue to be encouraged of how that architecture gets evolved and where we're
positioned globally.

If you think about my discussion earlier about electric vehicles. The trends in the number of units made
in the world are going to be more in Asia and in Europe, and we are a leading position in those markets,
and we're working with the largest OEMs on those. So nothing has changed around how we think about
architecture, where do we play, and we're -- what's really nice about TE, we benefit from both. And
electric vehicle is more in the front of the brain for our OEM customers, where autonomy has slipped back
a little bit. And feel very good about the 4% to 6% we've talked to you about.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi Investment.

Jim Suva
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Can you talk a little bit about the trends that happened in your sensor business, maybe on a year-over-
year perspective? It looks like they may have taken a little bit of a step-down compared to September
year-over-year. And then maybe the content on automobiles that you're seeing now, I believe you typically
viewed long-term content growth of kind of 4% to 6% range. Kind of where we're sitting at kind of for this
quarter and the outlook?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Sure, Jim. Thanks, Jim. First off, on the sensors question, I'll probably repeat what I said a little bit
earlier. In the quarter for sensors, we did have -- our growth was reflective of about the 75% we have
in industrial equipment and commercial vehicle. What we saw on those markets are very similar to what
we saw in our connector businesses, which really drove the revenue being down double digit. In auto, we
were flat, and that shows the content and the ramps that we're getting.

And then secondly, Jim, the separation around the content growth we saw in the quarter and as we're
guiding for the year is pretty much right on top of the 4% to 6%. And it's as EVs continue to get adopted
and the other trends I could add to the vehicles, you're going to see we expect that automotive will be
basically flat to slightly down in a minus single-digit production environment. And that's where our guide
is.

Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.

Shawn Matthew Harrison
Longbow Research LLC

And my congrats on the solid execution this quarter. I believe you already gave an idea of kind of the
range of where you expect Communications margins to kind of exit the year on a run rate. I was hoping
we could get an update on where you would expect Transportation and Industrial margins to exit the fiscal
year.

Heath A. Mitts
Executive VP & CFO

Shawn, this is Heath, and I appreciate the question. As you mentioned, the CS margins, we feel good
about our ability to move into the mid-teens in terms of where we see those margins, and that's reflective
of a lot of the hard work the team is doing to mitigate pretty significant top line pressures in that business.

Within Industrial, we'll see moderate, nominal, however you want to say it, margin expansion year-
over-year. That's a multiyear journey, as we've talked about, within the Industrial business on the
footprint consolidation side. There are -- in this particular quarter we just finished, sometimes we
do run into situations where we have to spend some money in advance of facilities coming offline to
get those transitioned correctly and do not disrupt our customers. So in a given quarter, you can see
some movement within those types of activities, but we still expect Industrial to see a nominal margin
expansion for the year. And I think if you look at it over a multiyear horizon as well as our trajectory into
the next couple of years, you'll continue to see that we're on plan.

Within Transportation, we're dealing with a couple of different pieces on the top line pressures that
Terrence mentioned earlier, particularly on the commercial transportation side, which is a very profitable
business for us. That being down certainly has a pinch point for us. And then -- but that's offset with some
of the activities within automotive and some of the footprint moves there. Now these moves, as we talked
about in prior quarters, take a while, particularly the ones outside the U.S., to get offline. And so you'll see
more of those savings later in this year and more into FY '21 and '22. But I would expect Transportation to
be able to hold roughly where it is, maybe a little bit of expansion as we exit the year.

Sujal Shah

recovery beyond just easy comps in that part of the region? And also, how should we think about the plant
closures in China, just putting a [ rent ] on your outlook, if at all, just given this coronavirus scare?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Now a couple of things. So let me take the second part of your question first. Certainly, on the
coronavirus, it's a very fluid situation. China is important. And we're very much focused on dealing with it
real time and making sure our employees are safe. That being said, first thing I want to highlight is that
we don't have operations or factories in the Wuhan province. Our operations are not in that area. And we
are in the middle of the Lunar New Year celebration, and that we are running lower shifts right now as
we speak, and we're going to continue to run those lower shifts. But the government has extended the
Lunar New Year a few days. And then some of the industrial parks we serve, they are actually shutting in
an extra week. And we're going to be -- do everything in compliance with the government. So net-net, it
is an uncertainty that we have, but we have those uncertainties in many parts of our business every day.

On China momentum, we did see production improve in the first quarter. And like I said in some of my
comments already, China was a little bit better. I would say that was around automotive production.
Europe was a little worse, net-net, getting to a neutral point for the year. I think the one thing that we're
trying to keep our eyes on is not only what is production but what are end sales in China. And end sales,
while they are not declining as we were, still are not accelerating. So we still have a view that China will
play out as we talked before. But we did see increased momentum before the Lunar New Year celebration.
We sort of got us down to -- hey, supply chain was getting better. But we got to continue to watch it, and
our guidance is sort of unchanged where we were 90 days ago.

Sujal Shah
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, Deepa.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I was hoping the company could quantify where inventory in the channel is relative to historical levels
on either a dollars or a days basis. And when you talk about the restock in distribution -- sorry, let me
rephrase that. When we talk about better trends into the distribution channel in the second half of the
year, are you assuming to restock? Or just that your shipments catch up to what the distributors are doing
on a sell-through basis?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

No. Thanks. So first off, we assume there's not restock. We assume it's at parity with demand. So
that's a key point and a very good question. When we sit there and what we've looked at, our major
channel partners are getting book-to-bills above 1 again. We've talked to them about where did inventory
burn through in their December quarter to get back more in parity. And as we told you last quarter, we
thought the first half impact was around $100 million. We're about halfway through that what sort of the
destocking was going to be across the network. So what's nice is we're seeing it work out as we thought
in the first quarter. It needs to work through in the second quarter. The trend is right on track, and we're
actually starting to see a pickup in bookings sequentially, as I said, by 10%. So feels like things are
moving as expected. And the second half is all about getting to parity with demand, not restocking.

Just curious, given your, like, broad breadth in auto and who you work with and who you compete
against, if you had any -- what does the BorgWarner-Delphi transaction do or not do to the competitive
environment in that space?

Terrence R. Curtin

For us, it does -- really does nothing for us. When you look at those 2 mergers, you're really dealing
with more people dealing with the mechanical side of things and our customers. Certainly, in some areas
they're our customers, but they would not be major customers. So for us, that's a net-net nothing.

Your next question comes from the line of David Kelley with Jefferies.

David Lee Kelley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

You referenced continued strength in defense. Just wondering if you've seen any incremental softness in
aerospace? And any impact from the Boeing grounding that we should be thinking about their modeling?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Yes. So a couple of things, and thanks for the question. Certainly, we do have commercial aerospace
business. When we talk about aerospace and defense and marine, that business in our Industrial segment,
about half of it's commercial aerospace, and it covers all the commercial airframe manufacturers including
Boeing. So the Boeing situation has impacted us on that airframe specifically. It's probably about 0.5 point
headwind to overall TE growth that we're absorbing with the diversity of our portfolio. But certainly, that
market has gotten weaker due to the production schedule Boeing has laid out.

The key, I think, for us is that's a nice content driver. That is sort of transitory in my mind, and it will
impact us this year. But when Boeing works through its issues and those planes start to get delivered,
we'll get a reacceleration on the other side. So near-term headwind that we've absorbed into our
guidance, but it will become a tailwind once they work through the issue with the FAA.

Sujal Shah

Okay. Thank you, David.

Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Unknown Analyst

This is [ Bharat ] on for Samik. So my question is in the Communications segment, the expectations
heading into 2020 remain for a pickup in hyperscale spending and higher service provider CapEx towards
5G as well. So can you walk us through your expectations for spending from these 2 verticals? How is that

15

tracking? And can there be an upside in outlook for 2020 in this segment overall if the spending ramps
through the year?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Well, for 2020 -- thank you for the question. We certainly have seen how that segment has been impacted
by the distribution channel. I would say, cloud spending, we have seen an improvement in our orders
on the cloud side. And certainly, that's across many of the cloud providers. And one of the things our
team has done a nice job is continue to penetrate and broaden our cloud customer breadth. So that is an
important growth driver for that segment, and we continue to improve our positioning there.

5G is a little bit of a different story. 5G is one where in places like Korea, you have very dense networks
that have been laid out and you get more of the use cases that they're developing.

In the U.S., 5G is not moving as quick, mainly due to the merger between T-Mobile that's out there, has
sort of delayed how this 5G get invested in. So I would say we've seen a pause in 5G investment here in
the United States. That -- we hope that once that merger is done, the operators will invest and then we'll
benefit from those deployments. We do play in 5G, though, on the infrastructure side. We don't play on
the handset side. But it is something that's a good content opportunity as that spending accelerates.

Okay. Thank you, [ Bharat ].

Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.

William Stein
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

An earlier question addressed automotive networks. And one of the things that seemed more prominent
this year at CES was the emerging changes in network architecture in cars, specifically ECU consolidation
and automotive networks transitioning to more sort of hierarchical one with domain controllers. Can you
comment on how this might affect revenue and margins and maybe mix of cabling versus connectors?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

No. Certainly. So first off, yes, it's important that when you say cabling and connectors, we are not a
harness maker. And so as harnesses get rationalized, certainly, there are people that are on the wire side
that are going to get more impacted than us. Because as you even get into more consolidated ECUs, zonal
architectures, the interconnects get absolutely more complicated, which play to the strength of which we
have. So these architectures have continued to evolve. Whether you go to zonal or you go to centralized
compute in a car, these are things that how do you continue to get the connection points, the sensing
points around are things that are part of our 4% to 6%.

This will continue to evolve. Our OEM customers will be the ones that make those architectural decisions
of what you see at CES. And what's really nice is how we engage with our OEM customers on our design.
We know as those architectural changes are occurring. So when we think about the 4% to 6%, that
does assume how the architecture will evolve. And what's really nice is -- I remember when we used to
talk about architecture and people just want to talk about SAAR. It's really nice that the content trend,
whether it be electric vehicle or autonomy and compute architecture in the car, are things that people are
really talking to us about. And that's what we do. And that's what's driving some of the growth trends for
TE.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.

Matthew John Sheerin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Regarding your positive commentary, Terrence, on the medical market and the nice growth there, how
much of that is adoption of newer technologies and an upgrade cycle, if you will, versus share gains?
And I know or assume most of these products came from the Creganna acquisition from 2016. So any
commentary on how that acquisition has been going for you?

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

I think when you look at the growth, it's a combination of things that we acquired, but also how we
continue to bring the capabilities that TE and Creganna had. If you look at that business, that business
is approaching $800 million, and Creganna was a little bit over $300 million when we bought it. And
we continue to put the capabilities of TE and Creganna together, and we've also have the design center
set up where the innovation occurs around interventional devices. What is nice is it is a mix, Matt, to
your question. And also, what's nice is it's not just the therapies that we're used to today that we all
benefit from, but it's also about the therapies of the future of other areas in the heart where they want to
take interventional procedures where they still can't take them today. And that's the innovation that we
continue to work on with the largest customers in the world that are focused on this.

So it is a combination of new programs, existing programs. And what's nice is with what we've built,
we really have the door open with our customers and bringing our engineers in to work on the next-
generation therapies that the largest companies -- medical device companies in the world are working on.
So it's really nice. It's going to drive the high single-digit growth that we talked about today, and it's been
driving.

Gentlemen, your final question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Terrence, just bigger picture. Yesterday, we heard a company talk about how as automakers move to new
and electric platforms. The connector catalog, so to speak, is opening up for them because they require
these new types of interconnect products. And I think you've hinted that the moat could widen as you
move towards electrification in these new platforms. So I just really want to better understand how you
think that business evolves as platforms shift, and maybe an example or 2 of what you're doing to retain
and enhance your competitive positioning with the customers.

Terrence R. Curtin
CEO & Director

Well, I think one thing that's important when you deal with electric vehicles and the penetration we have
is -- one of the things around electric vehicles, we have to be honest, you're still at -- even if we get to
the 9 million units we have this year, it's still a small part of an $84 million market. And one of the things
both from the relationships that we have, you also have to get to global scale to continue to bring the
cost points of the electric vehicles down. And we view we were part of that equation. So how do you get
to standardization? And while certainly, different people are driving different technologies, over time, we

17

still have to get to a vehicle that people can afford without subsidies long term. And when I think about
what we have done historically through our global customer reach as well as the breadth of technology we
bring, I think we're one of the ones that are best positioned to capitalize on that and also making sure we
scale it. And that's one of the things that our OEM customers and certainly other people still have some
challenges of how do they scale electric vehicle. And we basically view we get to help them do that. So
that's the breadth we have. You see it in some of the global OEMs that are going more platform versus
individual model. And they are some of the customers that we have very good relationships with and
design wins with that we're going to help them solve that problem. And then we can also take it like we
do with the rest of our connector portfolio into other areas to make sure that we bring productivity to the
electric vehicle as well while getting our margin.
