Operator

Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Before we begin, Elisabeth
Eisleben, Senior Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement
concerning forward-looking statements that will be discussed on this call.

Elisabeth Eisleben
Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2020 results. I'm joined by Tom
Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will turn our attention to answering your
questions.

Before we begin, please be advised that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements, including, but not
limited to, statements regarding our initiatives, plans, projections and future performance. Actual results
could differ materially from those projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Additional
information about factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found under the caption forward-
looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings
made with the commission.

Now let me turn the call over to Tom Greco.

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Good morning, everyone, and allow me to start by thanking each of our Advance team members
and Carquest independent partners for their tireless efforts to delight and serve our customers. Our
entire team faced challenges every single week throughout Q3, and I'm reminded daily that our role in
supporting essential workers has never been more important to our success.

We've been operating with 3 overarching priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic: first, prioritize the
health, safety and well-being of our team members and customers; second, preserve cash and protect the
P&L during the crisis; and third, prepare to be even stronger following the crisis.

We made progress on each of these objectives in the quarter. Our dedicated leadership team remains
focused on the health and safety of our team members and customers, regularly cascading safety
protocols and updating our playbooks for the pandemic. This includes health checks for all team members
instituted company-wide in Q3. We also provided cooling fabric masks in the summer to address key
concerns while ensuring our team members have face protection. Our communications team keeps the
visibility high through virtual town halls and regular video updates to ensure team member engagement.
We're also benchmarking and working collaboratively with industry and professional organizations to
continuously improve our response to this rapidly changing environment. Bottom line, we remain vigilant
to protect our team members and to ensure that our customers have a safe and positive experience in our
stores.

Turning to Q3 results. Our net sales grew 9.9% to $2.5 billion compared to the prior year, and we
delivered comparable sales growth of 10.2%. This is our strongest quarterly performance in 15 years.
Adjusted operating income increased by approximately 33% to $272 million, and our adjusted operating
income margin rate increased 183 basis points to 10.7%.

As you'll hear from Jeff, we also strengthened our cash and liquidity position throughout the quarter,
highlighted by our quarterly free cash flow improvement of 95%.

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Regionally, we saw positive comp sales across every region, with the Gulf Coast, Central and Southeast
posting strong double-digit comp curve. Our Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West regions, while still positive
at mid- to high single digits, were below our overall comp growth in the quarter. As we noted in Q2, there
remains a wide gap between our highest and lowest-performing regions, although this narrowed in Q3
to approximately 900 basis points on average between the 6 regions I just mentioned. The good news is
that the Northeast, which is our largest region, had the most improvement of any region in the quarter
versus Q2. As we have done in the broader auto parts industry and total retail data, the performance of
these lower-growth geographies has been more impacted by COVID-19 and is consistent with our internal
results. On a category basis, we saw sales strength in battery as well as continued growth in appearance
and optics that began in Q2 when stay-at-home orders were implemented.

While there are many puts and takes in Q3, we believe the net benefit for the industry was driven by
3 primary external demand drivers: First, there are economic drivers. Due to the uncertainty of the
macroeconomic climate and increased unemployment, there have been fewer new vehicle sales and more
used vehicle sales. This results in an aging fleet, which is good for both DIY and ultimately, pro.

Secondly, there are COVID-related factors. As we've discussed before, we believe consumers have an
understandable fear of using mass transportation, creating a heightened emphasis and reliance on
personal vehicles. In some cases, people are working from home and have time on their hands to do their
own DIY maintenance and repairs.

Finally, it's our belief that when motorists have DIY needs in this environment, they prefer to shop in
smaller boxes. In our stores, they can feel safe that they have the trust and advice they need and get
back on the road quickly so they can do the job well. Of course, some of the benefit from these external
factors is offset by the reduction in miles driven, which is an important demand driver for our industry.
When this begins to recover, we expect it will provide a tailwind for the industry.

We believe the majority of our accelerated top line growth in the quarter and in particular, the strong
DIY performance, is due to these external factors. Our industry has historically performed well during
challenging economic times. Considering prior periods when the economy was challenged, DIY is generally
an early beneficiary, followed relatively quickly by pro recovery.

Looking more closely at our Pro business, we delivered mid-single-digit net sales growth in Q3 following a
decline in Q2 due to the temporary closure of garages across North America. In Q3, our machine learning
platform, dynamic assortment, enable us to have the right part in the right place and improve availability.
This enabled both assortment and close rate improvements as lookups and demand surged. We also
deployed new customer delivery software for Worldpac, Advance and Carquest, which includes real-time
updates and notifications for all users.

In addition, our pro customers were very appreciative of the continued interactive virtual classroom
training we provided through our CARQUEST Technical Institute. This included the ability for pro customers
to extend the training content to all technicians within their repair shops.

On our MotoLogic platform, we continue to enhance our technical service bulletins and also deploy this
valuable tool in Carquest Canada. These tools, in addition to our sustained focus on improving the overall
experience for pro customers, enable us to further grow our TechNet base during Q3 as we crossed the
12,000 customer mark.

In addition, our Carquest independent team had another strong quarter and has now converted 36
new stores to the Carquest family year-to-date. Once again, we know this has been a difficult time for
professional shops, and we believe the work we've done to be there for professional customers when they
need us most has set us apart.

Moving on to DIY Omnichannel. We delivered another quarter of double-digit net sales growth in Q3.
These results were driven by the external drivers discussed earlier, coupled with our DIY growth initiatives.
Our growth initiatives are primarily focused on increasing share of wallet with existing DIYers while
attracting new DIY customers.

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Based on the syndicated data available to us, we drove meaningful share gains throughout the quarter.
Our DIY initiatives start with DieHard. While we believe DieHard is benefiting our performance in all
channels, we can clearly see improvements in our DIY battery share behind our launch. In October, we
introduced our #DieHardisBack campaign. This advertising launched with a 2-minute film on October
18 during the Fox NFL game of the week. This integrated campaign featuring Bruce Willis has already
generated over 2 billion impressions and more than 1,200 earned media placements. We believe our
marketing plans will drive continued support during the winter months when batteries fail and customers
need a reliable solution. We think we have significant room to grow DieHard in the battery segment.

Secondly, we continue to focus on building awareness for the Advance brand to attract new customers and
drive traffic. In addition to leveraging more effective advertising, including DieHard, we're strengthening
our digital engagement with DIYers when they visit our website or download our app. Q3 highlights include
the continued growth of our Advance Same Day suite of services and strong momentum and consumer
response to the launch of our mobile app earlier this year. These and other initiatives helped drive strong
double-digit sales growth in e-commerce for the quarter.

Third, we continue to see year-over-year growth in active Speed Perks members since the rollout of our
new program in the summer of 2019. Importantly, we're seeing a steady increase in members graduating
to the elite and VIP levels. Our graduation rates improved by more than 20% year-over-year, reflecting
important share of wallet gains with heavy DIYers. We're leveraging first-party data gathered through this
program to deliver a personalized experience for our customers.

Finally, we remain focused on execution across the board. We did an excellent job with the DieHard launch
overall and saw year-over-year Net Promoter Score improvement across all channels.

In summary, our top line performed well in the third quarter driven by the factors just discussed. So far
in Q4 through the first 4 weeks, comp sales remained positive across all channels in the mid-single-digit
range. As a reminder, Q4 tends to be the most volatile quarter each year primarily due to fluctuations in
weather. In addition, we remain sensitive to potential volatility from other external factors in the current
environment, particularly those related to the future spread of COVID and the possibility of heightened
stay-at-home orders in the near term.

Much more within our control is the execution of our 4 pillars of margin expansion, as we demonstrated
in Q3. Starting with our first pillar. Our top line growth during Q3 contributed towards sales per store
improvement versus the previous year. Additionally, on a rate basis, our SG&A per store improved year-
over-year. We're managing store payroll with greater effectiveness as a result of our MyDay scheduling
tool. Our team continues to plan payroll conservatively in the current environment, balancing customer
service and costs very closely.

In terms of supply chain, we're making progress with our cross-banner replenishment, or CBR, initiative.
We completed nearly 1/3 of our original plan, which redirects stores to a more freight logical distribution
center and reduces spend models across our network. We're already beginning to see savings from the
stores that have been completed as a result of reduced miles. We're on track to complete approximately
40% of our identified stores by the end of the year, with completion and full run rate expected to be
realized by Q4 2021. Importantly, our team has found further opportunities for improvement than initially
modeled, which includes additional stores that can be included following the completion of the first phase.

In addition to CBR, our single warehouse management system implementation, or WMS, is also well
underway after a temporary pause due to the pandemic. Our team mobilized to adjust our plans, which
now includes virtual implementation capabilities. We're installing the new WMS starting with our 11 largest
DCs, of which we expect 4 to be completed this year. Based on what we know today, we expect to finish
the entire WMS implementation by the end of 2022. With that said, we'll realize savings as each additional
DC is completed.

In terms of category management, we made progress in Q3 on own brand expansion. We expect to finish
2020 with a significant increase in own brand SKUs and to further enhance our SKU mix next year. Our
margin rate on own brand SKUs is meaningfully higher than comparable applications in their respective
categories. This will enable further growth in margin rate in the years to come. Separately, our new

strategic pricing tool is beginning to enable both profit dollar and margin rate improvement through pricing
initiatives rolled out in the quarter.

Finally, SG&A productivity continues to be a source of margin expansion. First, we made progress on the
consolidation of disparate back office systems, which is our largest area of opportunity within SG&A. In
Q3, this was highlighted by progress on our finance ERP implementation. In addition, we continued with
the integration of Worldpac and Autopart International.

We also continue to address opportunities to optimize our organizational structure, including support
contracts and professional fees. Consistent with this, we made the decision to consolidate our field
structure from 2 divisions to 1 in May. In early October, we further streamlined our field structure from
12 to 8 regions. We believe that these moves enable us to serve our customers with even greater
effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility.

The recent deal changes also enabled us to bolster certain areas in our corporate support center with
seasoned field operators. As an example, we frequently discussed the importance of diversity and inclusion
and its inextricable link to our business strategy. As part of this, we welcomed Dena LaMar, having served
as our RVP of the Great Lakes region for the past 3 years, to our leadership team as our new VP and Chief
Inclusion and Diversity Officer. Dena has a deep field leadership background in retail, both inside and
outside of Advance, and her leadership and enthusiasm for building a high-performing, diverse workforce
made her an ideal candidate for this role.

A second area of opportunity within SG&A is rent. Based on the current environment, we're thoughtfully
evaluating our real estate footprint, including office space. This involves negotiating with landlords for
concessions on low-return properties and in some cases, exiting a property altogether. We've engaged
a third-party to help with this and expect it may result in some short-term cost headwinds in Q4.
Specifically, buying out leases that are unproductive, where we determine the building is no longer
necessary.

Third, we have a dedicated team reviewing the existing plans we have for every single line item within
SG&A. They're assessing the productivity we had planned pre-COVID and also capturing key learnings
we've had during COVID. This team is recommending areas of refinement and further opportunity as we
move forward. For example, during COVID, we limited company-wide travel, which will continue for the
balance of the year. Going forward, we intend to leverage virtual options and do not plan to return to pre-
COVID levels of travel.

Another area of opportunity is further reduction in our insurance and claims expenses. Here, we continue
to make progress on our lost time injury rate. LTIR represents our most severe accidents and was
33% lower than the prior year. In addition, our sustained focus in Q3 resulted in a reduction in collision
frequency rates of 13% versus the prior year. Our advanced driver program and smart drive event-based
video coaching is also being rolled out, which we believe will help us further reduce our collision frequency
rate.

In summary, we continue to believe that margin expansion is a significant opportunity for Advance to
drive total shareholder return, and we remain focused on the initiatives we have in place pre-COVID for
the 4 pillars of margin expansion. While executing these previously established plans, we're also closely
monitoring the current and future environment to identify new productivity opportunities to drive total
shareholder return.

Before I turn it over to Jeff, I'd like to recognize the impressive results our team members and generous
customers delivered in our American Heart Association campaign. Following a successful campaign last
year, I could not be prouder of our team's efforts this year to raise $1.4 million, which was a 38% increase
compared to last year. We delivered this record-setting campaign while providing exceptional customer
service and remaining relentless on the execution of our long-term plan.

In closing, our third quarter results were another step in the right direction. Despite uncertainty that
remains in the current environment, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy.

With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff for details on our financial performance.

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to reiterate Tom's thanks to our team members for
their dedication and hard work, not only this past quarter but since the pandemic began. We have been
extremely diligent in ensuring safety measures are in place throughout the enterprise. At the same time,
our team members have risen to the challenge. The positive trend we released today would not have been
possible without them.

In Q3, our adjusted gross profit was approximately $1.1 billion. This was an increase of 11% compared
to Q3 of the prior year. Adjusted gross profit margin rate improved 50 basis points year-over-year to
44.4%, driven by favorable pricing actions and supply chain efficiencies. These improvements, coupled
with channel mix, were slightly offset by unfavorable product mix and headwinds associated with shrink
and defective. It's also important to note that while we experienced tailwinds associated with LIFO, these
tailwinds were offset by capitalized supply chain costs, resulting in no net impact from the inventory-
related costs and benefits both in the quarter and compared to the prior year.

Our adjusted SG&A was approximately $857 million in Q3, an increase of 5.8% compared to Q3 of
2019. Adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales improved by 133 basis points compared to the prior year,
primarily driven by an improved payroll and rent leverage, reduction in travel and our continued focus on
safety leading to a reduction in insurance claims, as Tom had mentioned. These cost savings were partially
offset by an increase in support contracts related to our transformation initiatives.

In addition, our COVID expenses for the quarter were approximately $9 million. The majority of these
expenses are related to ongoing costs, such as cleaning supplies, gloves and masks and enhanced 6th day
benefits during the pandemic. We expect to incur these costs for the foreseeable future.

Adjusted operating income in Q3 was $272 million, which improved 32.6% compared to the prior year
quarter. Our adjusted OI margin rate improved 183 basis points to 10.7% in the quarter. Adjusted diluted
EPS was $2.81, an increase of 34%. Year-to-date free cash flow was $616.6 million compared to $539.3
million during the same period in 2019 driven by strong top line results, improved working capital and the
deferral of federal payroll tax. In Q3, our capital expenditures were $52.5 million, which was a decrease of
$5.3 million compared to the prior year.

In line with our financial priorities, during the quarter, we completed the early redemption of our 2022
notes and tendered approximately 57% of our 2023 notes, both of which carry a 4.5% coupon rate. This
was completed using both cash on hand as well as proceeds from the $350 million 1.75% note issued
during the quarter.

Our disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet has allowed us to take advantage of the current
low interest rate environment resulting in a stronger debt maturity profile and improved leverage ratio. We
believe our debt financing initiatives have further safeguarded the business for the future. Our disciplined
approach to managing cash resulted in an AP ratio of 80.8%, which is the highest we've achieved since
the GPI acquisition.

We remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash from the business and to opportunistically
return cash to shareholders. As we discussed last quarter, we lifted the temporary suspension of our share
repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly $110 million of Advance stock at an
average price of approximately $153 per share. This, combined with the continued payment of the $0.25
quarterly cash dividend per share approved by our Board, further demonstrates our confidence in the
long-term strength of our business.

Given the continued uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19 and the current economic situation, we
will not be providing guidance for the balance of the year. Traditionally, Q4 has been our most volatile
quarter, with weather having a meaningful impact on results.

In addition, there are a couple of factors impacting SG&A to consider in Q4: First, we have known
incremental costs compared to the prior year related to COVID-19 expenses; secondly, as Tom mentioned,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

there will be costs associated with buying out unproductive leases; third, we are investing in the
#DieHardisBack marketing campaign.

We also want to remind you that our fourth quarter this year includes a 53rd week. With the exception of
comparable store sales, we encourage you to include the impact of these factors in your modeling.

Finally, we are updating our strategic business plan informed by our best estimates and assumptions of
the environment. Our plan is to finalize this in early 2021 and provide you with an update after our Q4
earnings release. We expect to finalize the date in the near future and look forward to sharing additional
details with you.

In conclusion, we are pleased with the results of the quarter and believe that we have positioned ourselves
positively for the remainder of 2020. We know that we cannot predict what this winter will bring, but we
remain committed to top line growth, margin expansion and managing our liquidity.
With that, let's open the call to address your questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I realized you're not ready to talk about guidance going forward for '21. Can you talk about the
transformation overall? And you said that you've restarted some elements of the supply chain overall.
Can you -- can we get to, I guess, operating margin expansion that's a little bit higher than what we saw
this quarter -- or not higher, sorry, in a 50 to 75 basis point range going forward in more of a normalized
environment? Or have some of the elements of the supply chain being delayed this year will cause those
to be prolonged?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Definitely, it has taken a lot of time over the last couple of months to look forward and really understand
what we think is going to happen over the next several years and put all of our initiatives through what we
call a post-COVID lens and feel very excited about the TSR opportunity ahead. For sure, the expansion of
margins is a big part of that. And as we said consistently, we do believe we can expand at a greater rate
than we certainly did last year.

So that's the plan. We're going to continue to drive the key areas of margin expansion that we've spoken
about. Sales and profit per store, the supply chain initiatives are key, driving the category management
initiatives and then further opportunities within SG&A. And that, combined with continued top line growth,
will drive some strong cash flow for the company and be able to return excess cash to shareholders. So
the plan is continuing on, and we look forward to executing against it next year.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I have 2 follow-ups to that, Tom. I think Jeff mentioned some marketing accelerated in the fourth
quarter. The spending on DieHard caused you to like slow some of that expansion to invest a little bit
faster in marketing in the near term. And then you said using cash, it seems like the cash is growing. Are
you going to deploy it quicker? Or are you waiting to get through this environment before deploying it?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, on DieHard, it's really a comment on the quarter -- the fourth quarter in terms of an investment
behind marketing in the fourth quarter, as we said all year. We launched DieHard. As you know, we
launched it on July 4, and the marketing broke on October 18, 3 weeks ago. And you're going to see
heavy advertising on DieHard starting again next week. Obviously, we pulled it off, Simeon, for the
election week. We knew that, that was going to be pretty cluttered and people are going to be obviously
focused on the election. But starting next week, you'll see our advertising come back, and we're really
going to hit DieHard hard for several weeks as we head into the winter season. So Jeff can respond to the
cash question.

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. In terms of cash, it's still at an elevated level, and we did repurchase about $110 million worth of
our stock in the third quarter. And so we're going to continue to be opportunistic there. We've got to be
somewhat prudent in terms of the uncertainty of the environment. We're pleased with what we were able
to do in the third quarter, and the fourth quarter is going to present new challenges. So we are going to

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

try to be opportunistic in terms of repurchasing. We continue with the dividend at $0.25 a share, so we're
pleased with that. And as we close out the balance of the year, we're going to maintain that trajectory.

Operator

The next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So I wanted to ask about the top line. You seem to be narrowing the gap versus your competitors, and
then you also mentioned mid-single-digit quarter-to-date, which is a strong trend. Others had talked
about moderation in October as well. So can you maybe diagnose what is changing from that 10 to the
mid-single digit? Is it DIY slowing but commercial relatively constant? And overall, is that -- how is that
playing out regionally? Is the gap between the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic versus the other areas
continuing to narrow?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Well, first of all, Chris, the gap did narrow meaningfully in the third quarter. We were around 2,000 basis
points in the second quarter, and we narrowed that to 900. Those particular COVID areas -- or heavier
areas for COVID are much more challenged with miles driven. And across broader retail, you're seeing
that -- those lower numbers. But we are seeing it narrow, and we're excited about the future there. I
mean, eventually, that's going to come back. And the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic regions are big for us so we
want them to come back.

In terms of the fourth quarter, we've seen a moderation. It's been really more winter-related categories.
It's still early. There's lots of time left in the quarter. So as you know, there can be volatility in the fourth
quarter. But overall, we're pleased with our performance quarter-to-date, and we're going to continue to
execute our plan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. And then as a follow-up to that, when you talk about winter-related categories, is that more
DIY, like batteries slowing ahead of the winter? And is that impacting the commercial side of the business?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's more DIY.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Understood. And then, Jeff, you gave us some good commentary around SG&A for the fourth
quarter. So any comments on gross margin factors that we should consider there? And then as you think
about 2021, based on all the initiatives, holding comp constant, it would seem like -- is it fair to say you
would see sort of increasing margin expansion over the cadence of 2021? Clearly, you have to -- impact
for the comparisons on the COVID front, but just on an underlying basis.

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. A couple of things there, Chris. I think for Q4, first of all, as you saw in Q3, we're lapping the
coupons. We're lapping the tariffs. We're going to continue to see that in the fourth quarter. Our supply
chain efforts is that -- is something that as we take out the stem miles, we're going to continue to see
those savings. That will continue into the fourth quarter, and that will certainly continue into '21. But we're
obviously not going to be giving you any guidance around '21, but I think those are some of the factors
that we can be looking at.

And then just in terms of overall inflation, I think it'd be the other thing that we've been watching closely.
That's been relatively low certainly in the third quarter, and we don't have any reason to believe we're
going to see any significant inflationary factors, at least in the fourth quarter. A little bit early to speculate
on '21.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And so just last question. So does that mean from like a LIFO on a capitalized inventory cost perspective
that -- should that remain at this point, you think, relatively neutral in 4Q?

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

Your next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Tom, it seems like some of your operating costs right now are a little bit higher than what you had
previously expected based on the SG&A performance this quarter or next quarter. Plus some of the gross
margin-driving initiatives are taking a little bit longer than what you had previously thought due in part to
COVID. Is the overall margin opportunity that you've long talked about the same, equal to or not as great
or even better than what you thought previously?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's been very much in line, Michael. We're continuing to execute the initiatives that we've spoken
about. And as we said at the beginning of the year before and this year, last year and this year, we're
expected to be lower versus 2021. And we continue to expect that, overall, 2021 will be greater than we
delivered in these 2 years. So there's really no change in our approach in the margin expansion initiatives.
Some of them have been delayed, as you said. The only major ones are the cross-banner replenishment
initiative on supply chain and the warehouse management initiative. But other than that, we're continuing
to execute each one of the initiatives that we have.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

The SG&A this quarter and next quarter, we should view that as a one-off or temporary, not an indication
of more longer-lasting trend?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Really more this quarter here, fourth quarter, as we called out, there are some unique things in the
quarter, an investment to launch a new brand, which we're very excited about, and a very important
investment to drive awareness of DieHard to make sure that consumers know that the place -- the only
auto part store that you can get a DieHard battery is Advance or Carquest. And that's a very important
message for us to land, and it's got very -- the early returns on what we're doing there are really, really
strong in terms of market share.

We also talked about rent. There's some onetime things with rent that we need to go do. And then COVID,
obviously, we're ongoing dealing with COVID. At some point, if there's a vaccine, some of those costs will
go away. But those are the things that we called out for the fourth quarter.

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And just to clarify that, Tom, on your -- on the return that you're getting on the DieHard investments.
Presumably, the slowdown that you've experienced quarter-to-date has largely been DIY-driven. And it
also quarter-to-date coincides with the time that you launched the new campaign. So how do you expect
the timing and the impact of the return on the DieHard investment to play out? When we -- when do you
expect to see it through just better sales in your DIY business?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Well, we just reported very strong sales on our DIY business, and it continues to perform well. Just
relative to the third quarter, there has been a softening there. But overall, I mean, a marketing investment
that we're making to launch a brand that we expect to be a $1 billion brand is not a -- you launched the
advertising on October 18 and you look for a sales increase on the 19th. We're going to continue to invest
behind this brand. It's going to be a multiyear platform for us. It's not just something that we want to
launch in batteries. It's going to be in other categories.

So we're going to continue to measure every discrete investment against DieHard, but it's overall designed
to drive differentiation for the company and ensure that people come to our stores to buy DieHard. So we
feel very good about where it is. The advertising has resonated. We've had a significant number of views,
impressions, shares. Over time, that's going to be very powerful for us.

Your next question is from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. I guess just continuing on the margin topic. Compared to last quarter, there was a little less SG&A
leverage, even though the comp growth was higher. We've heard from some others in the industry that
there's a sweet spot for operating leverage in sort of the mid- to high single digits, where you can deliver
sales growth comfortably without pushing the limits of what your associates in the supply chain can
manage. Have you found that to be the case as well where -- when growth exceeds a certain level, it's
harder to get that leverage? Or do you feel like stronger sales are just always better?

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Well, stronger sales are always better. There's certainly a sweet spot. It varies. You've got to think about
the category mix as well. The professional sales we cover, that requires more labor. So it's not as simple
as saying revenue is actually -- our leverage point becomes wide. You really got to look close at category
mix. We saw the benefit in the second quarter. We saw the benefit in the third quarter. As professional
sales continue to recover, as we anticipate it will, that requires more labor. So that is a little bit more art
than science from that standpoint. Some of the others are more straightforward in terms of the leverage
you get on more traditionally fixed categories such as rent. But certainly, the higher sales levels do help
us.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And can you break out and help us quantify some of the puts and takes of gross margin in the third
quarter? I know you mentioned pricing actions and supply chain efficiencies partially offset by the
unfavorable product mix. Were there some other factors like the lapping of Speed Perks, lapping a tariffs
and channel mix that you can help us quantify some of those puts and takes?

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

13

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Yes. You got it right. Pricing and supply chain both equally benefited the quarter. In terms of price, it was
a little bit of everything. We saw slight increases in sort of our POS price. We got a little bit of a benefit in
sort of that coupons and rebates. So think about Speed Perks. None of them individually meaningful, but
they're all going the right way.

And then the other category is what we call price management override, so just controlling the price that
we're giving the customer in the store. We saw improvement there. So in the pricing category, we saw a
little bit of improvement across all of those categories as they gave us the larger benefit.

Supply chain, as you know, we've talked about in terms of getting leverage from the elevated sales and
in addition to that, the work that we're doing to drive out the stem mile. The one we did call out, because
we talked about this a little bit in the second quarter, was mix, and that overall was flat. So we saw
improvements in our channel mix that was offset by our product mix.

And then the only other one I'd call out is we did see there are some headwinds associated with shrink
and defective, and that's really timing. I don't expect that to be an ongoing headwind into the fourth
quarter going forward. There was a little bit of favorability that we saw last year. Nothing meaningful.
Then we had a little bit of a headwind this year. So when you compare the 2, it exacerbates it a little bit,
but nothing significant in terms of ongoing problems or ongoing headwinds that we expect to see going
forward.

Operator

The next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I had 2 questions. One -- both follow-ups, I believe. So if comps slowed into the fourth quarter, is it fair to
say that it's been more on the DIY side than the do-it-for-me given your comments? In other words, has
do-it-for-me sort of stayed stable? And then the second question is what sort of savings do you get from
each DC when WMS is implemented?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Well, Greg, first of all, I have to clarify here, we're talking weeks here in the fourth quarter. So you
can see volatility in DIY in weeks frequently. As you know, DIY tends to be a more volatile business
as it pertains to weather and things like that. So we have seen more softening in DIY than in pro. Pro
is generally more consistent. COVID changed that a little bit in the second quarter when things were
completely shut down. But over the long term, the pro business tends to be more stable. So I would
attribute it far more to that than anything else. I think you're going to continue to see DIY perform well
balance of year into the next year. And the pro business -- as we begin to recover and miles driven starts
to come back, you'll see the pro business come back. In particular, categories like brakes.

I mean our hard parts business has been very solid on the pro side of the business. Engine management,
ride control, we're very happy with our overall performance there. So overall, continued performance on
pro, more consistent, but DIY is also performing well. Your second question, remind me.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. It's really about learning more about the supply chain savings. So I think you mentioned your 4 --
by the end of the year, 4 of 11 DCs will be converted onto WMS. So just trying to frame how much of that
help when you -- whatever time you get one converted, either a dollar amount or bps of margin? How do
we think about it?

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Yes. Well, first of all, we've called out supply chain as one of the largest areas of margin expansion that
we have, right? So you've got a couple of territories there. You've got cross-banner. You've got warehouse
management systems. You've got execution. And we're also integrating the Worldpac and Autopart
International supply chain. So those 4 initiatives ladder up to a significant number as it pertains to margin
expansion. We haven't broken out specifics on WMS, but what we get there is savings through improved
processes across our system and much more rigorous labor management standards.

Reuben Slone, who heads up our supply chain, has done a terrific job really driving that agenda. We were
in one of our distribution centers yesterday. The performance is improving. We've leveraged it again in the
most recent quarter. We're going to leverage again next year and the year after. So we're excited about
those supply chain initiatives. They build over time, and you're going to start to see the benefit of that as
we get into '21 and '22 on a full year basis.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And so when you said 1/3 along the way on that, that was talking about the 4 initiatives together.
Some a little ahead, some a little behind. Is that a fair way to think of it?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The 1/3 was related to cross-banner. So that's a separate initiative. That's just really pointing stores
at a different DC. And that one -- we're accounting these savings now. I mean we're starting to see
savings right now, yes. And we'll finish that job in the third quarter of next year. So we'll be getting the full
benefit of that, Greg, in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Operator

Your next question is from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.

Seth Ian Sigman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

You mentioned some regional differences. I'm curious, has that been more pronounced on either the DIY
or pro side? And then just focusing in here on the pro, I realize the market share is more difficult to see.
But if you could just update us on the progress in terms of gaining share of wallet with your customers
and any sort of wins on the new customer front and I guess, how cross-banner and other initiatives may
actually be helping from an execution perspective.

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, first of all, we've got a pretty concentrated business on pro in the Northeast, right, Seth. I mean
it's not just Advance. Concentrated with our Carquest business, our Worldpac business, our Autopart
International business. So as the early stages of the Northeast reaction to COVID happened, that was a
pretty significant impact and obviously represents an opportunity for us next year. That has moderated,
as we said. We're gradually starting to see that come back when I phone our top professional customers,
which I do frequently. I do hear that they're starting to see the same thing as us, that you're starting to
see things come back certainly in places like Upstate New York and rural Massachusetts. And as the city
starts to come back and as DC starts to come back, we'll see that miles driven benefit.

In terms of what we've been doing on the pro side, I think Bob Cushing has done a great job leading the
big initiatives there, which is to really leverage the assortment of the enterprise. Our dynamic assortment
initiative is rolled out pretty much across all backroom categories now. We're seeing improvement in our
assortment rate and our close rate. We're definitely seeing improvement in our TechNet business. TechNet
has really led the way in the quarter. Our strategic accounts are starting to come back. So we're seeing
gradual progress on the pro business, and we expect that to continue as we go into next year and candidly
lap some pretty difficult time on the professional side of the house.

Seth Ian Sigman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then I think you spoke to more margin expansion expected in FY '21. Just
curious, is that more gross margin or SG&A? And then just another clarification. Jeff, the cost you talked
about in the fourth quarter, the incremental SG&A, are you able to quantify that for us?

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the fourth quarter, we haven't quantified it. But the combination of all those, we anticipate it's
going to be meaningful. COVID, you can probably start to model. We had $9 million in the third quarter.
We had $15 million to $16 million in the first and second quarter. So it's going to be somewhere in that
range. We're not seeing -- I don't know when the vaccine's coming out, but we certainly don't expect a
meaningful impact in the fourth quarter. So that's one of them you can certainly model.

In terms of longer-term margin expansion, we're going to come back in March with some more details.
But what I would tell you is we expect to see margin opportunities, both in gross margin and in SG&A.

Your next question is from Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Scott Ciccarelli. So we've heard there is some stress in the supply chain and with product availability for
the industry. Can you clarify kind of what you guys are seeing on your own inventory availability and if
shortages have been a challenge or if you feel like you pretty much have the supply chain where you need
it at this point?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Sure, Scott. There are some isolated categories. I won't specify them because we've got calls with those
particular suppliers coming up. But there are some isolated categories where we see that. In general,
we've done pretty well through this thing. I mean our -- we review it every Monday, every Friday. We go
through what our fill rates are, where we are versus each stratification of SKUs, a, b, c, d, e. Generally
speaking, our team has done a great job managing through, and I think it's been to our advantage. And I
think that's why you saw us run double-digit comps in the quarter relative to others. I think that's a very
respectable number. So we're going to continue to monitor it, but it's -- overall, we've done pretty well
managing it. And those isolated situations, obviously, we have to stay on top of.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then you did mention private brand penetration increasing. Is that just the addition of
DieHard? Or does it kind of go beyond that?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

It's primarily -- I mean, really, if you think about it, we had an own brand in AutoCraft before. So DieHard
is not a change in our own brand penetration with the exception of the fact that we expect to sell a whole
lot more than we sold at AutoCraft.

Now Carquest is a different story. Carquest is a great brand. It's a loved brand by our professional
customers, literally over $2 billion in sales. So we're going to continue to drive that brand, and it's very,
very popular with our pro customers. They love it. So you'll see us continue to drive that. So look for
Carquest.

Your next question is from Michael Baker with Davidson.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

So maybe this is a tough one to answer, but I wanted to just ask about COVID in general. And I guess the
conundrum is or the question is, is COVID good or bad for your business, understanding the human cost,
of course? But clearly, everyone in the space is comping better than they ever have, yet I think it sounds
like in the fourth quarter, as COVID has started to come back a little bit more, you're seeing a slowdown
in your business. So just trying to understand how you think about COVID in general and what's important
about that is, I guess, how you lap against it next year.

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Well, first of all, I think on the Professional side, which is 60% of our business, I believe we've got a big
opportunity next year. Let's just say that. Clearly, when a garage is shut down and when you've got people
staying home working remote, that's going to have a negative -- a net negative impact on the Professional
business. Obviously, with the announcement of a vaccine, we don't know the timing or anything pertaining
to how quickly we're going to get back in the office and back to work. But ultimately, that's going to
happen. And when it does, people are going to get back in their cars. They're going to commute to work.
They're going to go to where they need to go. They're going to get back on -- go to football games and
they go to restaurants and things like that, and that will be good for our business overall. Miles driven is a
positive for this industry for decades. So when you've got miles driven that are down, I think that's clearly
something that has a drag on the business.

Now in the case of some of the larger players, I think we benefited a little bit based on our scale. We've
got a scaled supply chain. We've got an online portal. We've been able to gain share during this time
frame. And obviously, the trick from here is to hold on to those people that we picked up. And that's what
we're focused on right now, and we do that through our loyalty program and through other personalization
engagement. So that's how I'd explain it, Scott (sic) [ Michael ].

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Interesting. It's Mike. And so you think it's as much of anything of a share gain rather than the overall
industry trends benefiting from COVID. One follow-up. On -- in the fourth quarter, you talked about it
slowing down a little bit in more in the Northeast. I guess I'm a little confused. Was that -- is that more
because COVID has come back in the Northeast? Or more because the Northeast is impacted by the
weather? Or is it a little bit of both?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No. I spoke about the Northeast recovering. I mean there's really no regional trends that we spoke to
in the fourth quarter. So it's overall, yes.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that.

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Just to make sure, Mike, I think your point is right that the gain -- the share gains that we've experienced,
I would say, the larger players, have not necessarily reflected the overall industry. If you look at the
industry numbers, the industry is not calling for the business to be up this year overall. I mean it's calling

for it to be slightly down. So I do think the scale players benefited during this, but I'm not sure the auto
part aftermarket was an overall beneficiary, like other sectors.

Your next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

You're talking about sort of evaluating the real estate footprint and maybe seeing some SG&A expense on
lease terminations in the fourth quarter. How many stores are you looking at as far as closure is going, I
guess, into the end of this year and beginning of next year?

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. First of all, we're looking at our entire profile of real estate. So it's not necessarily stores. We're also
looking at some of our back office. We have field offices throughout the country. So we're really looking at
the entire real estate portfolio. Kind of the CSC, corporate support. We're looking at that. We are looking
at a number of stores. We haven't broken that out. Obviously, it impacts our team members so we haven't
given any more specificity around that. So we're really just looking across our portfolio. And anything
that's underperforming, again, doesn't have to be a store. We're just looking at that entire portfolio and
say, "Okay, do we really need this?"

One of the things that we've learned during this pandemic is the amount of corporate real estate you
needed prior to COVID is much different in a COVID environment. We can work remotely. And so as Tom
had mentioned, putting everything through a post-COVID lens, that's what we're doing with our real
estate.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then a question on DieHard. I guess could you give us more, I guess, granularity as far as
the share gain you've seen since the launch in July? And then maybe the product extensions as you
leverage some of the spending around the brand, what's the timing that we should expect as far as seeing
incremental product available under that label?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Well, first of all, on the share gains, we've had something like 30 consecutive weeks here now of overall
share gains inside of DIY Omnichannel, which is what we can see, right, through the syndicated data. It
definitely accelerated beyond the launch of DieHard. We're not going to break it out specifically, but we
can see the absolute market share and the year-over-year share gain behind the launch. Obviously, we
can't see anything from the most recent period. So we're not clear on the benefit on the advertising yet,
but we'll see that at some point and we'll continue to iterate.

But this is a terrific brand. Our organization is so excited about it. I think we -- our field team and
the entire merchant supply chain, you're talking about a change that was close to 1 million store SKU
combinations that we executed flawlessly heading into the July 4 weekend. On July 4, we were in
distribution everywhere. And we were able to drive that over the last several months and into the October
18 launch of the advertising, which all hit exactly when we expected it to.

In terms of extensions, right now, we're focused on batteries. Very focused on driving market share in
batteries, battery accessories. We have ideas around other things that we can do there, but we want to do
the job really well on batteries for a period of time, and more to come on extensions.

Okay. And I guess, to that question, you commented on building out your own brand exposure. Could
you talk about sort of where you are and where you think you can get as a percentage of your revenues
coming from own brand?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a pretty big number. Obviously, we've got a couple of thousand SKUs out there now that have
been launched in the last year, and we have a plan to increase that substantially over the next 3 years.
So that's really the plan, and it's gradual. I mean you're talking about exiting certain products in certain
categories and transitioning them through the supply chain. So once we do that, we'll see the full benefit
of this.

But early performance in terms of when we get the Carquest SKU in there, it's often at a more attractive
price. It's at a higher margin. Our customers are choosing that brand, and they like that brand. As I said
earlier, our professional customers are very comfortable with the Carquest brand. We've had a strong
brake program for a number of years, and it's just a matter of extending that into some other categories.

Your next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

So I guess, the first question I had was on SG&A. Obviously, like very good overall rate improvement.
But I just want to get a sense for the SG&A per square foot or dollar growth. Like what were like some of
the discrete items that drove that 6% or so increase? Was it just labor matching up with a higher sales
productivity? Was it just -- I know DieHard is more of a Q4 event, but was there like DieHard start-up
cost? Anything you can frame for us on discrete items that -- and do those discrete items continue into Q4
into front half 2021?

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. You actually got it right. It's really payroll in terms of the dollar investment that we had. Just in
terms of some of the professional payroll dollars and just getting some of the needed payroll back into
the stores, we were running very thin in the second quarter and it just wasn't going to be sustainable. So
some of that was just payroll that was needed to get back in there due to normal cleaning -- forget silver
for a second, but the normal cleaning and restocking and everything else you need to do in the store. So it
was primarily payables.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Got you. Okay. And then the DieHard seems really cool. What's the -- like when you think about that, I
know you mentioned earlier it's years, not months. So like typically, for this type of marketing campaign,
what's the payback period that you would expect to realize an investment of this type? Are we talking
months, quarters, weeks? Like what's typically the sales cadence of a big launch like this and -- that
you've seen historically? Maybe you've never done anything -- nothing to this scale, obviously, but any
kind of -- any way you could frame would be helpful.

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I mean, first of all, we will measure the performance of each discrete element of the campaign
and measure that against our cost per incremental dollar metrics that we have. And our marketing
investments this year have proven to be very effective in that regard and much better than our historical
rates. So we'll continue to measure that. And when we obviously have the -- enough time, Chris, to
measure the performance against this particular advertising, we'll look at that very clearly.

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

The reference to years is we're talking about building a brand that's over $1 billion. So that takes a
sustained investment over time. We're not talking about year-on-year increases necessarily in marketing
in 2021 and '22. We're talking about a quarterly increase in the fourth quarter to get the brand launched
and being smart about how we spend our marketing dollars next year. So overall, the profile of this is to
create differentiation for our brand to drive traffic to our stores to really make sure that people know that
we're a destination for DieHard batteries, and that requires an investment and a sustained investment.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Got you. That's helpful. And then just one final clarification question. The big picture for DieHard is
essentially that you're going to just replace your old brand, the AutoCraft or whatever it's called. So like
for every SKU that there was an auto -- the AutoCraft brand, you're going to have a DieHard SKU now.
And then do you foresee like higher pricing power with DieHard? Like for the same SKU, would you charge
more for DieHard or do that at the same price? Is it more like a traffic play? Or is there also a margin
play?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's really both. I mean we're looking very carefully at that and have already taken some actions to
strengthen the margin profile of our batteries already. So there's a couple of things that we're doing there
that we're pretty excited about that can drive margin and already have. So you're going to continue to see
not only top line benefit, but gross margin benefit there.

Your next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush.

Seth Mckain Basham
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

My first question is just diving a little bit deeper into cross--banner replenishment. You guys are seeing
some benefits to gross margin from that now on a net basis. As we look forward, should we be thinking
about that net benefit growing as you convert more to cross-banner replenishment?

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Absolutely. Obviously, the more stores you have, the better it is. The good thing, Seth, with this is we
were able to identify new buildings now that can potentially accommodate some of these changes based
on capacity moves and some of the additional analysis we've done. So we've got the initial savings that
we modeled. Pretty confident we'll be able to put that in the bank by the end of the third quarter, as we
said earlier. And now there's some additional stores that we're going to add beyond that. But every time
we convert a store, we take miles out. And there's -- literally the plan is for millions of miles to come out
of the system, and that obviously saves you on a rate basis per mile.

Seth Mckain Basham
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, thinking about your store portfolio, you guys are reevaluating
likely to negotiate some rent for stores as well as other real estate next quarter. But as we think about
the portfolio at large, do you think there's going to be a material reduction in the number of stores you're
operating? Or are you just setting the base to resume growth?

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We're not anticipating a material reduction. We closed about 50 stores in the first half of the year.
In the third quarter, it was a handful, 10 or 12. We've taken out most of our -- nearly all of our structural

issues in terms of stores, stores across the street from each other, less than a mile apart, just in the
wrong geographic location within a market. That's what we've been doing the last several years.

And so again, the real estate is a much broader initiative. We do have some stores that we've recently
closed that are closed but were still paying the rent. We call them dark stores, and we're getting out
of those. And really what that does is it sets us up for '21. And once we stop paying that rent, it's an
immediate benefit. And so we're looking at that. We're looking at the field offices. We're looking at our
corporate locations and just making sure we have the correct footprint. So I don't anticipate this to have a
meaningful impact on our stores. We're always going to be closing a few stores here and there. So we're
done with that, and we're going to be looking strategically at stores that we can start to open. So that's
sort of the plan going forward into '21.

Seth Mckain Basham
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Understood. Just to put some numbers around it, Jeff. I know you're not providing guidance. But if you
were to maintain mid-single-digit comps, would you expect to still be able to leverage SG&A despite some
of these headwinds associated with the advertising as well as the lease buyouts?

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Are you talking specifically in the fourth quarter?

Seth Mckain Basham
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Yes.

Jeffrey W. Shepherd
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think we could.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Tom Greco for closing remarks.

Thomas R. Greco
President, CEO & Director

Well, thanks to everyone for joining us. As you've heard today, we continue to improve execution across
Advance, and we're proud of how our team has responded throughout this unprecedented time. We
believe the next few months for our country will continue to have its challenges, but we're confident that
we're taking the necessary steps towards the health, safety and well-being of our team members and
customers while helping to make AAP even stronger.

Before we conclude the call, I want to take a moment to thank all of our veterans from each branch of
the military for their service, including the thousands of Advance team members who previously served.
We're honored to continue partnering with several organizations to recruit and support current and
former service members, including Building Homes for Heroes. I've personally seen the impact that this
organization has had on families, and I'm proud of the impact and our commitment to continue supporting
these important initiatives in the years to come.

Once again, thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing our Q4 results with you in
February.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now
disconnect.
