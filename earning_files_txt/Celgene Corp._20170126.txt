Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone
The fourth quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for the Hematology and Oncology franchise
Our team produced an excellent sales performance, and we also continue to make significant progress with our development programs
Our sales performance and growth was driven by strong underlying demand across brands and geographies
REVLIMID demand increased globally, with further share and duration gains in newly diagnosed myeloma
POMALYST/IMNOVID continued to grow at an impressive rate in both U.S
and ex-U.S
, and the brand achieved blockbuster status, surpassing $1 billion in net sales in 2016. Finally, ABRAXANE had steady growth outside the U.S
market continued to be relatively stable in spite of significant competitive market dynamics in lung cancer and breast cancer
Our 2017 key drivers are on track
We are awaiting the U.S
and EU approvals of REVLIMID in transplant-eligible maintenance and U.S
POMALYST approval in combination with daratumumab
Triplet combinations in myeloma will continue to drive share and duration around the globe
The new drug application for enasidenib was submitted to the FDA at the end of December and we expect a U.S
regulatory decision by the second half of 2017. And we'll have multiple Phase III data readouts by the end of 2017, with the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials for REVLIMID in indolent lymphoma and the ABRAXANE APACT trial in adjuvant pancreatic cancer
Our mid to late-stage pipeline is advancing and we are accelerating many programs
We have 11 pivotal programs with existing and new assets enrolling and we hope to initiate more than 10 additional pivotal programs with our later-stage pipeline assets by the end of 2017. I will share more of those details later in my remarks
REVLIMID net sales grew 16% year-over-year and slightly declined by 4% quarter-over-quarter
As you will recall, we had significant Russian tenders in both the fourth quarter 2015 and the third quarter 2016 which impacted REVLIMID's annual and sequential growth rate
Without the impact of the Russian tenders, REVLIMID Q4 net sales grew approximately 10% year-over-year outside of the U.S
and the REVLIMID Q4 year-over-year volume growth outside of U.S
was 14%
We are very pleased with the performance in underlying growth drivers for REVLIMID globally
REVLIMID TRxs increased versus prior year and versus prior quarter
Outside the U.S
, we are equally optimistic, as REVLIMID continues to have global share and duration gain, with very successful launches in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
We have 20 countries reimbursed for NDMM and we expect to have additional reimbursement in France in Q1. We're still early in the international launch and expect significant market share growth in Europe and Japan during 2017. Finally, we are beginning to see the cumulative impact of NDMM and triplets on treatment duration in many markets and duration is increasing rapidly
In addition to the ongoing launch in lung transplant eligible patients, we have many additional drivers coming soon
We are expecting approval from maintenance and transplant eligible NDMM patients in the U.S
in the first quarter and in the EU in the first half of the year
We believe this will be a significant driver for REVLIMID globally, as it will give us the opportunity to highlight the unique value proposition of REVLIMID in this patient population and to further educate on treating patients to disease progression
We are also in discussion with health authorities regarding the submission of an NDA for RVD in first-line transplant and lung transplant patients
This would create additional opportunities to expand the use of REVLIMID-based triplets
2017 will also be an important year for our lymphoma program
The R-squared based RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials in indolent lymphoma will both read out by the end of 2017. We have strong clinical evidence from multiple Phase II studies with R-squared in this indication and we are very optimistic about the benefit of R-squared versus current standard of care
In 2017 we also expect to complete enrollment of the ROBUST trial, our R-CHOP induction Phase III study in first-line diffuse large B-cell patients with the ABC subtype
All of these lymphoma trials will generate significant growth and opportunity for REVLIMID in the coming years and are complementary to our efforts to bring next generation CELMoDs to NHL patients
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered impressive growth in Q4, with 29% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth
The brand is maintaining its leadership position in the third and fourth-line plus patient segment in major markets, in spite of the increasing number of available new therapies and later lines of treatment
In fact, POMALYST/IMNOVID has experienced accelerated growth in many markets, as duration continues to increase at a fast pace driven by the increased worldwide views of POMALYST/IMNOVID in triplet combinations
In addition, we are awaiting the FDA approval POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma by June of this year
Finally, we are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combinations
Our Phase III OPTIMISM trial in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment lines is expected to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017. ABRAXANE continues to have quite stable demand
ABRAXANE net sales grew 14% quarter-over-quarter and declined by 1% year-over-year
business had a significant increase in Q4 due to the impact of customer buying patterns
ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer and demand is relatively stable in breast and lung cancer
Outside of the U.S
, ABRAXANE grew 5% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer
We still see multiple growth drivers ahead for ABRAXANE
We expect the results of the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017 and the pivotal ABRAXANE/Tecentriq combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer will read out in 2018. In addition to our excellent financial performance, I'd like to provide you with an update on some of the exciting progress we are making with our rich mid and late-stage pipeline in multiple myeloma, lymphoma, myeloid diseases and solid tumors
Starting with multiple myeloma, our BCMA collaboration with bluebird continues to progress nicely
Interim data from the ongoing Phase I study of BB2121 were presented in December at the Triple symposium in Munich
These data showed impressive efficacy and safety in the quadruple refractory myeloma population
We are moving forward with plans to initiate a pivotal program for BB2121 in patients with relapsed refractory myeloma later this year
We are now enrolling eight trials for the durvalumab FUSION program
These studies are enrolling in newly diagnosed myeloma, relapsed/refractory myeloma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, CLL, MDS and AML
These trials are in combination with key inline brands and novel agents
We expect pivotal study-enabling data in myeloma, MDS and AML to be available throughout 2017. Moving to lymphoma
In addition to the REVLIMID Phase III readouts at the end of the year, the CC-122 program continues to enroll multiple proof-of-concept studies in lymphoma, CLL, myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents
We expect data from most of these indications this year and we are planning to initiate the first pivotal program in relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by year end, with further pivotal opportunities as additional data reads out
Our collaboration with Juno to develop JCAR017 continues to advance
Based on very encouraging NHL data shared at ASH in December, the EMA granted JCAR017 access to the Priority Medicine, or PRIME, scheme for relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
We hope to initiate a pivotal study in this indication later this year
We are very excited about the number of opportunities we have to truly transform the myeloid space
We are pleased to announce that we submitted a new drug application to the FDA for enasidenib, or AG-221, in relapsed refractory AML at the end of last year
The NDA was based on data from the Phase I, II study of AG-221 in patients with relapsed refractory AML
We expect a regulatory decision on enasidenib in the U.S
in this indication in the second half of 2017, while we're pursuing first-line AML opportunities in combination with azacitidine and standard chemotherapy
We've also made great progress with the collaboration with the luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron
Our two Phase III trials in lower-risk MDS patients and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia will be fully recruited in 2017, and we are actively engaged in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the asset in additional patient segments and indications
We plan to initiate a Phase II trial in myelofibrosis later this year and are evaluating additional pivotal opportunities in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia
Our two CC-486 Phase III studies, known as the QUAZAR studies, in higher-risk MDS and first-line AML maintenance, continue to enroll well
Data presented at ASH in December highlighted the impressive results of CC-486 in patients who were relapsed or refractory to injectable hypomethylating agents, so-called HMA failures
These data helped to further understand the differentiated profile of CC-486 and allow us to work on potential additional pivotal opportunities in MDS and AML
We continue to build our solid tumor franchise beyond ABRAXANE based on encouraging data in relapsed refractory neuroblastoma as monotherapy and in combination with AVASTIN we exercised an option to acquire the rights to marizomib during the fourth quarter
We are advancing marizomib in first-line neuroblastoma in combination with Temodar radiotherapy, and we hope to initiate a respective pivotal program later this year
Finally, through our collaboration with OncoMed, we are awaiting data from our ongoing demcizumab program
An ongoing Phase II randomized trial is evaluating demcizumab plus ABRAXANE and gemcitabine in patients with first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, and we expect to see data from this study in the first half of 2017, allowing us to decide on a potential pivotal path in this indication
In summary, we had another excellent quarter and year for the Hematology and Oncology franchise
Our financial performance was driven by strong underlying demand for both REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID
We have many key growth drivers for 2017 in place, including upcoming regulatory decisions on REVLIMID, POMALYST and enasidenib
There are multiple Phase III data readouts expected by year end for REVLIMID and ABRAXANE
We have multiple pivotal programs underway, and we will be making many decisions to initiate additional pivotal programs for our later-stage pipeline assets in 2017. Thank you
And I will now turn the call over to Scott
Thanks, Eric, for the question
And I think to start with this question, it makes sense to really look at the overall growth that we have throughout the year
When we're looking at U.S
, we had a 3% sequential growth and 24% annual growth
So all the growth drivers are intact
What you see in Europe is really an impact of a large Russian tender that we had in Q3. We also had a large Russian tender by the end of 2015, so that has impacted the annual growth rates and the sequential growth rates
If you take the Russian tender out, I think what can you can see is very good growth in Europe both from a volume perspective and from a sales perspective
So all of the growth drivers are intact
Shares are increasing
Duration is increasing, all of that worldwide
What you see in Europe was really impacted by a large Russian tender
Yeah, thanks, Geoffrey, for the question
Starting with your first one about usage and maintenance post transplant patients ready
The picture is actually different in U.S
In the U.S
, around about 50% of the eligible transplant patients are getting REVLIMID in maintenance onto the progression
The other 50% don't
They either don't get maintenance at all or they don't get REVLIMID or they get REVLIMID and maintenance but not onto the progression
So we think there's a really nice opportunity in the U.S
In Europe, we don't have any maintenance at the moment of time
The reason it is very simple
In order to get reimbursed, you have to have approval
And we are very optimistic that we're going to be able to obtain that
So combined the opportunity in the post-maintenance setting is probably as big as the opportunity that we have in the non-transplant setting
So it's a very substantial opportunity for the company
Talking about the myeloma market as such and the opportunity, there's a couple of points to make, starting with, yes, the data with REVLIMID is really good
But there is segments of patients that are absolutely not doing well
Even with the best combination at this moment of time, which we think is probably the combination of an IMiD, in that case, REVLIMID, with daratumumab
A third of the patients is relapsing after six to 12 months
All of these patients are going to die after three to four years
That's number one
There are high-risk patients out there with adverse cytogenetics, del(17p), for example, which are going to die after three to four years
There is elderly, frail patients out there where you cannot use triplets at this moment of time
And then, unfortunately, you still have patients who are relapsing after all available treatment options
So I think there's multiple options for us to develop, not just CELMoDs, but our whole portfolio that we're having with CAR-T, with bispecific antibodies, with new CELMoDs, and we're going to be very, very thoughtful and going into the right patient populations right from the get-go
Yeah, hi, Michael
Thanks for the question
So starting with the APACT study
So it's going to read out by the end of the year
The time point at which it is exactly going to read out is going to be event-driven
We've been showing recently at the ASCO GI Meeting data in an earlier patient population, so patients with local advanced pancreatic cancer
And the results look really excellent
Many of these patients that were not operable before became operable
Which tells us this that the combination of ABRAXANE and gemcitabine is really an excellent choice in patients with earlier cancer, pancreatic cancer
So we are very confident in that regard
And there was really not a lot of progress for those patients in the past year, so if the study's positive, and we assume it's going to be, there's going to be a very fast uptake of the combination
In terms of the chemo combos, we also followed the recent development with Merck
What basically it tells you I think is a couple of things
A, monotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is not the right thing to do with everybody
B, in patients with low expression of PD-L1, the jury is still out who's going to qualify for I-O, I-O versus chemo I-O
And, C, we really think that ABRAXANE has an advantage versus other chemotherapies in that patient population
Roche has been publishing in abstract form the response rates that have been achieved in the non-small cell lung cancer population with the combination of ABRAXANE and Tecentriq and it really looks excellent
We think those data are definitely better than anything that has been published
So we think we're going to have advantage in the chemo field
We think there is going to be a role for chemo I-O combinations in patients who are low or low-expressive
And we also think that we're going to have an economic advantage compared to I-O, I-O ABRAXANE I-O is just going to be very favorable for payers
So I hope that answers your question
