Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CF Industries Holdings 9 Month and Third Quarter
2020 Results and Conference Call. My name is Joanna, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator
Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick,
with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.

Martin A. Jarosick
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thanks for joining the CF Industries Year-to-Date 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'm
Martin Jarosick, Vice President, Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Chris Bohn,
CFO; and Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain. CF Industries
reported its year-to-date 2020 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we will review the CF Industries
year-to-date results in detail, discuss our outlook and then host a question-and-answer session.

Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statement. More detailed information about
factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on
our website. Also, you'll find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release
and presentation posted on our website.

Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we posted our financial results for the first
9 months of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion. We feel good about
our position as we near the end of the year. As we review our results on this call, I'd like to remind you
that we evaluate our performance based on half years and full years rather than a single quarter. This
is because there can be significant shifts across quarters due to weather or other events. However,
that spikiness tends to smooth out over time so a longer time period provides a better picture of actual
performance than focusing on an individual quarter.

As of today, with 2 months to go and most of the fall ammonia season still ahead of us, we continue to
expect that our full year 2020 results will end up within plus or minus a few percentage points of our 2018
performance for adjusted EBITDA. Our outlook hasn't changed since back in February when we first gave
our expectations for the full year.

Overall, the CF team continues to execute exceptionally well. Asset utilization remains high, and our
sales volumes through 9 months are new company record. We also continue to efficiently convert EBITDA
into free cash. Most importantly, we are operating safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate
at the end of September was 0.17 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, which is a new company record
and substantially better than industry benchmarks. This is a tremendous accomplishment, and we're
extraordinarily proud of our team's unwavering focus on safety, particularly in the face of the pandemic.
Speaking of which, our pandemic-related precautionary measures have been working well, and we
have not had a single known transmission of the COVID-19 virus within any of our locations. With these
precautions in place, we were able to complete safely critical turnaround activity at several locations
during the quarter.

As we look toward next year, the company is well positioned for the opportunities ahead. As Bert will
describe in a few moments, we expect solid global demand and widening energy spreads, which will

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

create greater price realization opportunities during '21 compared to this year. Given our position at the
low end of the global cost curve, we believe these dynamics will support continued strong free cash flow
generation.

We are very excited about our announcement last week and our commitment to the clean energy
economy, which provides a real growth platform for the company. As we discussed, hydrogen has emerged
as a leading clean energy source to help the world achieve net 0 carbon emissions, and ammonia is one
of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen. Because CF is the world's largest producer of
ammonia, we are uniquely positioned with our unparalleled asset base and technical knowledge to serve
this developing demand.

As we decarbonize our network and aggressively scale our ability to produce green and low-carbon
ammonia, we believe we will be able to realize the clean fuel value for ammonia rather than its nutrient
value. In doing so, we expect to realize a substantial premium compared to the value of ammonia as a
fertilizer or a feedstock. Last Thursday, we announced our first steps in seizing this growth opportunity
with the green ammonia project at Donaldsonville as the centerpiece of initial investments. We look
forward to sharing our progress and our follow-on steps in the months ahead.

With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market. Then Chris will follow to
talk about our financial position and capital allocation before I return for some closing comments. Bert?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Thanks, Tony. Year-to-date, the global nitrogen market has been incredibly resilient in light of the
pandemic. Demand for agricultural applications has grown in 2020, and industrial demand continues to
recover from the disruptions in April and May. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect solid global demand led
by North America, India and Brazil. We also project improving price dynamics as the global cost curve
steepens with rising energy prices and wider energy spreads compared to North America.

As we noted in the press release, we are projecting a healthy level of corn planting as well as increases in
wheat and canola plantings in North America, supporting good demand in the region. We are forecasting
approximately 90 million planted corn acres in the United States in 2021. This is in line with the levels
of the last 10 years and supported by improved farm economics due to higher corn futures, government
payments and lower input prices. If weather conditions allow, we would expect to have a strong fall
ammonia season due to the farm economics I just described and the attractiveness of ammonia prices
today compared to the other nitrogen products.

We expect that industrial demand will continue to recover in line with economic activity. We believe
industrial demand for ammonia has been mostly tied to the state of the economy due to the pandemic. In
contrast, demand for feed-grade urea and diesel exhaust fluid has been relatively resilient. Our year-to-
date DEF sales volumes are up 6% compared to 2019, which would have been difficult to foresee in April
when economic activity and miles driven declined so dramatically.

Outside of North America, we continue to expect positive demand in most growing regions, particularly
India and Brazil. We believe India is likely to exceed 9 million metric tons of urea imports through tenders
in 2020. We also expect demand for urea imports into Brazil of approximately 6.5 million metric tons will
continue to be supported by improved farm incomes and no active domestic urea production.

As we look at our cost curve projection for the next year on Slide 12, we see opportunities for greater
price realizations during 2021 compared to this year. In 2020, the convergence of global natural gas prices
in the first half led to a largely flat global cost curve. Formally, high-cost producers pursued this temporary
margin opportunity available to them, increasing operating rates and pressuring product prices.

In recent months, energy prices have risen across the globe but at a much higher rate in Europe and Asia
than in North America. These higher gas costs and the steeper global cost curve that results increases
opportunities for low-cost producers like CF to achieve greater price realizations. Indeed, some of our
most profitable years has been when our own natural gas costs were higher but energy spreads were

wider. We are well prepared as the nitrogen market dynamics adjust over the coming year and the
direction of the global response to the pandemic becomes clearer.

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Bert. For the first 9 months of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common
stockholders of $230 million or $1.07 per diluted share. EBITDA was $982 million, and adjusted EBITDA
was $1 billion. For the third quarter of 2020, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders
of $28 million or $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $196 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $204
million.

As you know, the third quarter typically has our lowest realized prices, lowest volumes and highest level
of maintenance and turnaround activity. This quarter was no different. However, both our year-to-date
and quarterly results reflect the same overall factors: lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices partially
offset by lower natural gas and SG&A costs.

On a trailing 12-month basis, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion,
and free cash flow was $756 million. At the end of October, cash on the balance sheet was well over $600
million, and we are well positioned to fulfill our commitment to repay the remaining $250 million on our
2021 notes.

We expect capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $350 million as we maintain our high
standards of reliability and safety. As we noted in the press release, this is lower than our initial estimate
due largely to the deferral of nonessential activity as a result of the pandemic. We expect our capital
budget will return to our typical $400 million to $450 million range in 2021 and beyond. Each year, our
capital -- CapEx budget includes not only turnarounds and other sustaining activities, but also investments
in improvement projects that allow us to pursue strategic opportunities. Recent examples from this lighter
include the nitric acid expansion project announced this year and the diesel exhaust fluid unit completed
in 2017, both at our Donaldsonville facility. The green ammonia project at Donaldsonville will fit into this
improvement portion of our capital expenditure budget over the next 3 years, which allows us to maintain
our overall CapEx at normal levels.

That said, we expect that additional steps we will take to enable the production of green and low-carbon
ammonia will require investment beyond this $400 million to $450 million annual range. We are excited to
invest in the growth of the company given the expected profile -- expected return profile, and we see a lot
of opportunities ahead to do just that. So after the repayment of the $250 million in 2021 notes, we would
expect that our primary use of cash in the coming years will be in support of our strategic focus on clean
hydrogen and ammonia projects.

With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Chris. Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their continued
outstanding execution. Our team continues to demonstrate their focus, operational excellence and the
strength of our business during the most unusual of years. I also want to recognize the winner of our
annual Wilson Award for Excellence in Safety. This year's winner is our Courtright Nitrogen Facility in
Ontario for their deployment of wireless technology to better predict and prevent equipment failures. This
award is a great reflection of our safety culture at work, and I encourage everyone to view the impressive
ideas from this year's finalists, which can be found on our website.

As the world focuses on decarbonization, hydrogen will be a key clean energy source, and ammonia is a
critical enabler for the storage and transport of hydrogen. CF Industries is the world's largest producer
of ammonia, and we will leverage our significant competitive advantages, which include the strength
of our team, our operational excellence, technical knowledge and unparalleled asset base, advantages

that will enable us to deliver green and low-carbon ammonia at scale years faster and billions of dollars
less capital-intensive than many others looking at this opportunity. This will propel us to the forefront of
hydrogen supply, being a leader in producing clean fuels for a sustainable world and providing a growth
platform to create shareholder value.
With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just regarding the focus on ammonia as a fuel source in the intermediate to long term. Just what appears
to be the -- this ultimately appears to be a reflection of the Japanese efforts. Can you just speak to the
potential intermediate-term growth of blue NH3 in the context of the current merchant ammonia market?
So generally, just out of the $20 million-or-so funds, what percent of these will actually -- could be utilized
for fuels just given the required retrofits, technology, infrastructure, et cetera? It seems like that Saudi is
and, ultimately, you guys in North America are well positioned, but what about others? So just how should
we be thinking about that?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Chris. I'll handle this, and then I'll also ask Bert and Chris to chime in as we go here. But as you said,
initially, I think the first sources of demand that we're seeing right now are really coming from some of
the Japanese utility providers. As you know, in the wake of the terrible tragedy at Fukushima, the nuclear
fleet was decommissioned in Japan, and that necessitated a movement back to coal-based electricity
production. Obviously, that's going the wrong direction from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective.
And so they are very focused and moving aggressively toward alternative clean sources of energy to help
offset the coal-based production of electricity, and injecting ammonia is one of those ways that they're
going to improve their footprint from a country perspective.

But we see a number of other applications that are rapidly developing as well, including marine transport,
where ammonia can be used directly as a fuel as well as disassociated into hydrogen to be used as a fuel.
And there's a number of other off-road and industrial applications that are being pretty rapidly explored
along with vehicle traffic. And so our view is that this is actually going to hit a tipping point pretty soon.
And the more infrastructure that gets developed, the faster that will happen, and then you'll see really
rapid evolution. But obviously, that can't occur until you start developing the supply base. And so we're on
the front edge of this to be able to develop the supply base and help facilitate the -- really getting to the
infrastructure and the tipping point faster. So we're really excited about this opportunity. I think it's the
only way the world is going to make a dramatic dent in the overall greenhouse gas emissions profile, and
we're excited to be leading the efforts. Bert, Chris?

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

No. That's helpful. And just a very quick follow-up, just very simple. But given the -- it's been a year since
UAN trade flows have readjusted out of Europe, can you just give us a quick update on your projections
for UAN parity pricing? Do you still expect a discount in the U.S. in '21? Or do you expect that to normalize
ultimately?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

What we've seen through 2020 is, again, that price discount relative to other nitrogen opportunities.
Especially in North America, we've seen a substantial increase or kind of -- as North American production
has ramped up, we've seen a continued import level that has probably been in excess of what is needed.
That pressure price is lower. It was just about a year ago when the EU sanctions went into full effect,
and that playout is -- was -- played out for that price reflection was more of the impact in 2020. So I
think with growth and what we're seeing with acres in 2021 and depending on how the fall application for

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

ammonia goes, we're going to -- we expect to see greater increases of UAN consumption, which should
improve the pricing profile.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America.

Luke Emerson Washer
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

This is actually Luke Washer on for Steve. You talked about average selling prices being pressured over the
course of the year due to lower energy prices, spur of increased production rates. Was that meaningfully
skewed towards one nitrogen product in particular, like urea or ammonia? And with natural gas costs now
coming back up, have you started to see that global supply start to normalize? And in what regions are
you seeing that normalize?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll give a little bit of an answer and then ask Bert to chime in as well. But the places where you see it
manifest in terms of lower prices are particularly in the highly traded and commodities for which there's a
lot of additional supply. So that's particularly in ammonia and urea. Obviously, per the previous question
that Bert talked about, with the UAN rebalancing, there's still some downward pressure on UAN as well.

But I think in response, what you've seen is some of the higher-cost producers or production facilities
globally have actually curtailed or shut down. There's been at least 3 significant plants in Trinidad that
have curtailed for an extended period of time. And the benefit that we see going forward is as you see
energy spreads expand between North America and Europe and Asia in particular, even if the overall
energy complex is going up, it's the spread that actually matters a lot because that will push the kind of
high-cost second-tier -- or second quartile, third quartile people into the fourth and dramatically pressure
margins to the point that during parts of the year where it was pretty sloppy this year from excess
supply, you won't see that excess supply next year. And that's why we think there'll be pretty significant
improvement opportunities in terms of pricing. And so we're excited about getting kind of the normal
energy spread differential back to where it should be.

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

I think 2 things. The energy issue is the probably the cost side where we fell to as low as $1.50 in North
America, but also equally cheap in Europe and the U.K., which brought on their continued high-cost
capacity to operate. But the pandemic was a big impact. And in April and May, we went from $270, $280 a
short ton of NOLA. And by May and June, we're down to $190 to $200. So a substantial fall or a decrease
in pricing and then some inventory carryover. And so you just had an imbalance and then a perception of
where value lied and what type of risk would be taken on by either the retail or wholesaler group.

And the 1 positive -- or 2 positives that have really pushed the market back into a normal operating
rate have been India and Brazil. And so we see -- the positive factors going into 2021 are the economic
position, hopefully, we get through this pandemic, good acre plantings and good international support with
a higher cost curve that should improve prices.

Operator

We have our next question that comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.

Kendall Renee Marthaler
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

This is Kendall Marthaler on for P.J. So just sticking with prices. Obviously, U.S. urea prices are at a
pretty big discount to international prices right now. So how high do you think those could go to meet

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

international parity in the first quarter next year? And I guess, in order to meet that parity, do you see any
decline in international prices? Or is it mostly just growth in U.S. prices to get back up to parity?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

So when you look at the urea discount today, you're correct, we are operating at a $30 to $40 differential
negatively to the world market. And again, those are -- goes to the issues that I just mentioned for the
last caller. But what is -- where we are today and the most recent India tender in the $270 a metric ton
delivered, it's a China story. And China's operating rates today are around 55 million tons of supply with
4 million to 5 million tons exported. And what is that price level with the RMB, at currently RMB 6.7,
and coal costs where they are, the marginal producer is going to be pressured and probably will not be
participating in the international tenders. That, coupled with increasing Chinese demand for urea and
crop production as well as production of NPKs, we don't see China being as big of a force probably post-
November in the international market. Again, coupled with good demand globally, where we see the key
markets driving and Europe yet to buy, we see healthy demand going into spring that should tighten up
the market. We're at, I think, through September, 600,000 tons of imports into the United States. That's
probably below where it should be. And so at some point, we need to start catching up and bidding in
those tons from either North Africa or the Middle East or Russia, and so that should drive pricing as we
get closer to spring. And again, corn plantings could be higher than what we're projecting with a $4 corn
position out there today.

Operator

We have our next question from the line of John Roberts from UBS.

Lucas Charles Beaumont
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

This is Lucas Beaumont on for John. Just wanted to follow up on the energy costs. So in terms of the
normalizing differentials, do you see any risks around the normalization either from lack of availability of
supply in North America as demand picks back up and with some supply shut in or on the demand side
from Europe with the deteriorating kind of conditions over there in the last 4 to 6 weeks as there's sort of
increasing COVID-related shutdowns?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think rising energy costs in North America is actually a good thing for us because what that
means is the LNG cargoes, from a replacement economic perspective, starts becoming incrementally
more expensive. And that's really what's going to end up driving the energy price differentials or that
spread. What happened this last year was in the -- as Bert talked about in the aftermath of the economic
slowdown driven by COVID, you had very cheap natural gas cost in the U.S., and you had a lot of
excess cargoes of LNG floating around it, for which there was really no home. And that led to a massive
oversupply, and the result of that was extraordinarily low-cost gas into Europe. There was a big chunk
of the year we were paying less for natural gas in our U.K. facilities than we were in North America, and
that's completely upside down from normal. So that led to the abnormally high operating rates in the rest
of the world and excess supply, which capped pricing for nitrogen.

And I think in a rising price for natural gas environment where the demand is really trying to kind of
spur back on again, we'd expect there to be, given the reduction in LNG exports, a return to normal
differentials, and that provides a much better price environment even if our cost structure is higher. I
think Bert mentioned this in his prepared remarks, but some of our best years from the standpoint of
profitability actually were with a relatively higher natural gas cost in North America compared to a real low
cost. And so we think that this actually portends well for us looking forward.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

With your newer focus here now on green ammonia, blue ammonia, if we think about down the road
and kind of M&A opportunities, which you start -- and be very cautious on maybe some smaller deals.
But would this imply that you really wouldn't do any kind of smaller nitrogen acquisition, plants that are
obviously kicking in gas as feedstock unless you thought you could have some sequestration to those
assets? Like how do you think about how your newer focus might affect your M&A strategy over the next
decade?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, Joel, it really comes down to the particular assets in question and access to renewable energy,
access to sequestration and also access to end markets from a logistics standpoint. And I think, at the end
of the day, this all really is a price value and what would the investment have to be compared to making
those investments and modifications to our own existing asset base. And as you know, we put a bunch
of money into the old Terra assets when we finished up that acquisition, and now all of those assets are
running at extraordinarily high utilization rates and on-stream factor. I don't know that there's another set
of assets out there that are close to ours.

So one of the embedded costs of M&A is you have to first start off with assets that are probably not as
well maintained and get them up to our standard before then you make additional investments on top to
convert into low carbon and green ammonia. So while it's certainly a possibility, and again it comes down
to price value, I really like our asset base, and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to reinvest
in it.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank.

Benjamin Isaacson
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Tony, in the past, when the fall ammonia window was narrow, CF has talked about demand being made
up in the spring. So I guess my question is, is the reverse true? When you have a strong or wide fall
window, are we going to start to see some sales in the spring get cannibalized? And does that matter by
product mix? And then second, can you just touch quickly on the China's ban on Australian coal imports?
Is that propping up the nitrogen cost curve right now? And is that at risk of going down if that dispute gets
solved?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes, you bet, Ben. So I'll start off a little bit here and then pass it over to Bert. But in general, if you're a
grower, you need a certain amount of nitrogen load. And if you're able to apply some of that in the fall,
that requires less nitrogen in the spring. But we really like ammonia going down, whether it's in the fall or
the spring, because we have a differential asset base that allows us to realize terrific values for ammonia.
And if you end up with poor ammonia application, then we end up having to export ammonia, and the
price realization for that tends to be lower.

And in general, we sell everything that we make and we run our plants full on. And so the benefit that
we have is given that North America is an import region, that we're not really worried about are you
"cannibalizing" sales out of next year to be able to move from this year? We run our plants at capacity. We
sell everything that we make over the course of a year. And so we either get it in the fall or we get it in
spring, but basically, it's the same number of tons ultimately that go down.

And there is this sort of love-hate relationship we have with ammonia. On the one hand, again, we've
got this differential asset base that allows us to exploit and realize terrific values. But on the other side,
the less anhydrous ammonia that goes down means the more upgraded product that goes down. And

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

basically, you're putting on 2 tons of urea for every ton of ammonia that didn't go down or about 3 tons of
UAN for every ton of ammonia that didn't go down. And the margins on a per unit of nitrogen basis tend
to be better on upgraded products. So in a strong ammonia market, we're going to do really well because
we get great value. In an ammonia market that doesn't move a lot, we're going to do really well because
of the volume of upgraded products that we make. So it's a really good kind of natural hedge position that
we have based on our product mix. Bert, do you want to...

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes. I'd just say we've had some difficult ammonia seasons, where it was either too wet, too cold, and
that moved to spring. And we've had some difficult springs where we've had river floods and excess
moisture and inability to apply and did well in both of those markets because of our ability or adaptability
to transition and put the right product into the market at the right time. You also have to remember, with
precision ag, the impact of fall ammonia is less than it was 20 years ago, where you're actually probably
applying less on that one pass-through and doing multiple applications, whether that be some ammonia
in fall or spring and then urea or UAN on top. And so the impact of a negative fall is less. And again, what
Tony said, our ability to manage through it is pretty solid.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital.

Andrew D. Wong
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Going back to green and blue ammonia, is there a market for that product in the ag and fertilizer space?
Could there be some future drive to decarbonize farming that results in demand for the low-carbon
nitrogen?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

We see that that's a possibility. I would say it's not real strong right now, although there's a number of
growers and actually other entities that are beginning to look at the ability to do carbon sequestration
within the soil and end up in a regime that's got a cap and trade system or so forth. That can be a fairly
valuable source of income for farmers. And so potentially, in that environment, if you're using lower
carbon inputs, you can get even additional benefits associated with in-soil sequestration. And so I think
that's a possibility. I'd say, right now, that doesn't really exist. But particularly if we end up projecting
forward around a set of carbon regs and legislation that may be developing here, I could imagine that,
that might be something pretty attractive. And Bert's had a number of conversations with customers of
ours and others that are looking at modeling carbon sequestration at the farm level and the value that,
that can provide.

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes, that's exactly right. So we're meeting with the leaders of that. We're -- as an input provider and a key
part of that value chain, there is a recognition, obviously, for what we bring to the table with the strength
of our network and team, but that value will lie at the farm gate. So it's how do you help that farmer
achieve through feed technology, crop protection, nutrients, farming practices, and then put together
with -- or married with other opportunities, whether that's hedging or derivatives that are out there for
weather and crop insurance, and then tracking the level of production correlated with the potential for
what percentage of carbon is being captured. And I think that's measurable, and that's the next step for
this industry. If we're able to achieve that, we'll play a critical role because of what we believe we can do
with our network to help that solution.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Okay. That's interesting. And then just maybe just in regards to the rollout of the green ammonia capacity
across the network. I guess just -- versus the $100 million CapEx -- initial CapEx for D'ville, is that typical
of the cost that you would need for future capacity? And just generally, like how would you finance that?
You have cash flow. But if you want to build that a little bit more significantly, it seems like you might need
a little bit more cash than your general cash flow. So what would be your preferred approach for financing
that?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Andrew. So in terms of the initial investment for, call it, circa 20,000 tons per year, it's $100 million.
I think as we talked about last week, a lot of that investment then becomes scalable. So subsequent
improvements in capacity come at a discount as long as you're adding to the same plants. And so in
subsequent chunks, we can get some capital efficiency. But every time you move over to either a new
complex or a new plant within the same complex, there's going to be some baseline that you're starting
from. However, we would expect on our second and third, once these -- that we'll end up with a lot of
learnings and some efficiencies and improvements. And so subsequent investments, we would expect to
come down. But I think at least the initial 1 or 2, we are generating plenty of cash to be able to self-fund
those out of cash flow from operations. And Chris, do you want to talk about...

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think also what we're going to see here is efficiencies in innovation that comes from the
electrolyzers and even the renewable energy side, where those costs are going to come down as well.
So based on the initial project that we're looking at here, we feel confident of what we're seeing from a
return profile. But I think that profile just continues to get better as we expand. And as Tony said, based
on scalable units with having [indiscernible] already in place, that's going to put us ahead of many other
of our peer groups.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

I also think, Andrew, as we look forward and expect there to be a significant premium associated with
these tons, you'd expect to see growth on the EBITDA front, and that can certainly support additional
debt. I know our focus the last sort of 4 or 5 years here has been really to delever, and we're back down --
once we finish the $250 million next year that Chris talked about, back down to a very comfortable level of
debt. So if you correspondently see some growth on the adjusted EBITDA line, that can certainly support
some incremental borrowings that can be used to basically self-fund some of this CapEx that we're looking
at.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So a question just on the urea market, and I just want to make sure I'm clear on the expectations on
supply and capacity expansions. There's a couple of big projects in Nigeria that are supposed to start
up next year, projects in India and Iran late this year or early next year that they're starting up. So I
just want to make sure I -- when you talk about the global market for global nitrogen demand growth
exceeding net capacity additions, is that actually true in 2021? And if so, where do you see capacity
closures in the next 12 months?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes. I agree with you on your list. You got the Lordegan plant that's coming on -- or is probably ready to
come on, the Dangote project in Nigeria, and then you have the projects in India. All of these projects

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

have been delayed, and we expect continued delays. And then it's the ancillary issues of connections;
feedstock; start-ups; and ability to export, that being the case of Dangote with pier imports and loadings.
And so there -- if that's the list, there is not a great list of capacity coming on, coupled with where we see
growth and economic recovery on the industrial side for -- and being what we've already articulated. So
we see a tightening market.

And what we've seen in Trinidad with 1 million tons of ammonia coming off and a rising energy market
where we're now at -- in looking at the JKM gas market close to $7 and NBP in Europe and the U.K. over
$5, $5.50, that's a good spread, and that does make higher-cost producers at current pricing for ammonia
uneconomic. And so you would expect to see trade flows start to adjust back to where they were, lower-
cost areas moving to higher-cost areas, and that would tighten up the market. But we've had very good
demand in 2020, all things being considered, and we expect that to continue in 2021.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Adam, the other thing I want to just tack on to the Bert's comments is that there have been a number of
plants in India that have come online in the last couple of years. But in aggregate, Indian production has
not actually increased. So what you've seen is a number of the older, less efficient plants have shut down.
And in fact, I think, Bert, this year for India was a record urea import.

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes, we're saying above 9 million, but it's going to be closer to 10 million. A very good healthy demand.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So despite the fact that you've seen these capacity additions, there's been rationalization that's been
coincident with it. So we're not looking at those plants as being problematic from the standpoint of trade
flows.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.

Jonas I. Oxgaard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Wondering, one of the industrial gas companies announced green hydrogen this week as well, but sourcing
biogas instead of electricity. So I was wondering if that's an approach that you have considered and if you
can talk a little bit about the plus and minuses.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I don't know quite enough about what the consistency and regularity of the biogas production stream
looks like and whether you can actually run a commercial operation off of it. I know that, for instance, the
Matix plant in India had all kinds of problems trying to get coal seam methane because of the lack of sort
of consistent regular compressibility of a gas stream into the plant, which created all kinds of whip sign.
And as you know, Jonas, that is never good for these kind of chemical plants to be up and down and see
disruptive supply associated with it. So I don't really know enough about the -- what the source of gas
looks like coming off of these bio sources, but it's an interesting idea.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Just wanted to delve in a little bit more on the UAN strategy. I mean are you guys sort of expecting more
imports to come in as the year progresses? And I guess, just wondering, if we start to see urea prices
move higher, are you kind of waiting for that? Or just any more thoughts in terms of how you're thinking
about managing kind of your UAN pricing and the flow of imports and exports over the next several
months?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes. When you look at the UAN market in North America of about 15 million tons of demand, you break
out domestic production, we've been receiving around 2.5 million to 3 million tons of imports principally
from Trinidad and Russia. And so, one, there's the side of demand with increased acres possibly in 2021.
We think that demand will be stable to increasing. But looking at where the market is overall, there hasn't
been a lot of new capacity coming in. You've had Acron, a producer in Russia, drop a urea plant in to
decrease their production in that market. You've had growing demand in Argentina and Brazil, which has
helped support the market. And then you've seen some of the moves that we have made with DEF and
nitric acid to take that existing stream into further higher-valued products. And so as we have repatriated
our tons from Europe, we have not fully pushed those into the market. And that is how the market, at this
point, has been balanced. But we see some very good opportunities for end market plans and continue to
value UAN as a key, if not ducky, product of the company.

Operator

We have our next question coming from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just wanted to sort of ask on next year and make sure I understood, Tony, what your sort of
characterization of the market was going to look like with the movement within the cost curve because I
see on your slide, you have it kind of moving up $5, $10. So I'm just wondering if -- when we think about
the year or what you're trying to get across to us, that we'll see higher lows during the year as well as
some higher highs. But when we think about your average realization for the year, it's going to be more
because the low end of the period is going to come up and is going to stay sort of in the middle range
longer during the year than might have been the case this year. Is that how we should be thinking about
as we look at our quarterly models?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Vincent, that's a great explanation. I'm going to throw it over to Chris here and let him talk about it a
little bit.

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would agree with your characterization there. Essentially, what we're expecting to see is, as Bert
and Tony have talked about, with these energy spreads beginning to widen, $2 already in Europe and $3
for JKM, that the expectation is it's going to put pressure on margin. And you should see lower operating
rates by some of those mid-tier, call it, sort of third and fourth quartile players. And this year, as you
saw, we're at much the low end of the range for the cost curve, and that is really predominantly because
we are right on top of each other from a differential. As Tony mentioned, we are paying less in the U.K.
than we were here in the U.S. So I think what 2021 is going to provide us is not only higher end of the
cost curve, but also during particular times of the year, more pricing opportunity than what we've seen
specifically this year.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Okay. And just as a follow-up, does the shift into the green arena -- we've been talking about sort of the
desire to get back to investment grade. Does that sort of make that even more of a desire? Or does it --
maybe less of a desire? Or does it not change anything in terms of how you're thinking about your balance
sheet overall?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

No. I mean I -- yes. I think we still have a strong desire to get back to investment grade. I think having
another source from a customer base that is fundamentally different helps get a little more diversification
in terms of the end market with higher margin associated with that base. And because we can go ahead
and fund this first round of investments out of operating cash, we can continue to delever at the same
time. So I think all of those are positives.

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think as we mentioned, this first sort of wave is going to be within our $400 million to $450 million
of CapEx. And there's project -- subsequent projects that we're reviewing here, some of those specifically
with carbon sequestration, there are incentives from like a 45Q tax credit. And the thing to remember is
we already have the capture and the removal process in all of our plants right now because we use that
CO2 for our plants that puts us at an advantage. So I think both when you look at the initial projects laid
out, the incentives coming in, the early periods here, we feel pretty good about just funding this straight
out of cash flow.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Tony, I was hoping you could give us your perspective on the proposed U.K. ban on solid urea. It seems
like it's sort of going in the wrong direction with what's happening with green and blue. And how would
you respond to that?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think part of the rationale, Mark, is around the volatilization and decomposition of the urea, which
then releases the CO2 back in the atmosphere even though it's been kind of temporarily sequestered
in the urea granule. And so I think that fundamentally gets to the issue of the U.K. being very serious
about trying to reduce aggregate emissions and -- from agriculture as well. Relative to our North American
production base, that's a little bit challenging. But in the U.K., we make ammonium nitrate, which is the
-- really the fertilizer of choice in the U.K. given the soil conditions and the climate and the crops that are
grown over there. And so reducing a substitute from -- away from our AN business is actually very helpful
over there. But I think we're prepared to support the U.K. farmers regardless of which direction they end
up going. But I think, again, it just speaks to how serious certain countries have gotten around carbon
reduction, and we're excited about some opportunities that exist in the U.K. for us to be able to produce
green and low-carbon ammonia over there as well. So I think we're really well positioned when you start
seeing movements like that.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

But as a policy position, doesn't this concern you direction-wise? I mean it's the U.K. and you're well
positioned there. But if this starts to spread, it starts to hurt everybody.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Well, I mean, I think one of the questions that sort of it's going to raise, ultimately, Mark, is what's the
price of food, right? Because to the extent you take what is currently the most ubiquitous form of nitrogen
fertilizer globally traded and start reducing demand, you've got to substitute other forms of nitrogen for
it. And that then starts putting incremental demand with a relatively captive supply that doesn't expand
readily. And so you ultimately are driving up price of nutrients to the farmer that's going to work its way
through the supply chain into the price of food on the grocery store shelf. And that's a question then that
governments are going to have to wrestle with. I think it's probably easier to be managed at -- in some
more affluent areas of the world than it is in others but, I guess, we'll see how it develops.

The good news is because we're moving early on decarbonizing our network, we'll be in a position that
whether it's ammonia that's low carbon, whether it's AN that's low carbon, whether it's a different form,
we'll be in a position to be able to supply whatever is needed, both at -- for an energy source and a
nutrient content. And I think it's a movement that is actually very, very helpful for our business.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. And just one follow-up. There was a lot of excitement earlier in the season for a big Brazil corn
crop, and that's maybe been tempered a little bit by the late planting. As you think about Brazil, do you --
are you assuming a steady increase in Brazil acres and a steady increase in nitrogen demand there?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

It's exciting for what has been happening in Brazil over the last decades when you've gone from, let's say,
in 2000, 16 million tons of fertilizer demand to probably 38 million tons this year and probably heading
towards 50 million tons in not-too-distant future. It's been a steadily increasing demand. I think one of
the issues that we're dealing with, with Tony's comments, climactically relate directly to Brazil and opening
new acres and what -- where they're opening those acres and how they're opening those acres. And
Bolsonaro has been pretty aggressive of opening up the outer reaches of the savanna and so that's been
controversial globally. But there is a substantial land available that's -- to cattle feeding today, grass-fed,
that could be opened up with not too much difficulty in Mato Grosso do Sul or even Goias and some of
the outer reaches of area of Bahia. And so the opportunity in Brazil is there. They're taking advantage of
it with the devaluation of the currency that we experienced this year down to, let's say, BRL 5.70 to the
dollar. That's been super attractive for the Brazilian producer. And what have they done? They've done
exactly as they economically should, which is increase areas, increase yields through further fertilization.
And the sophistication of the Brazilian farmer is on an equal basis with the American farmer on equipment,
on technology, on the things that are happening. So we're fairly bullish what can happen. You've seen urea
grow from 2 million tons 20 years ago of imports to 6.5 million tons this year. And guess what? You've
seen a consummate increase in yield. They have further yield to go in corn especially. The late planting
was more related to dryness than it was anything else. So I think you're going to see -- you may see a
yield impact, again, due to that dry weather pattern that has hovered there and then the late plantings.
We'll see what happens with [indiscernible], which is the second crop corn that gets planted because of
soybeans being planted late. That means the second crop corn will be planted late. So more to come.
We're constructive. We're participating in the Brazilian market and like to see what's happening down
there.
