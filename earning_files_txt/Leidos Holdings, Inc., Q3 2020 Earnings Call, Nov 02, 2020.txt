Presentation

Operator

Greetings. Welcome to Leidos Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this
conference is being recorded.

At this time, I'll turn the floor over to Peter Berl with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Peter Berl
Head of Investor Relations

Great. Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2020
earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Reagan, our
Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our
results for the quarter ending October 2, 2020. Roger will lead off the call with notable highlights from the
quarter as well as comments on the market environment and our company strategy. Jim will follow with
a discussion of our financial performance and our guidance expectations. After these remarks from Roger
and Jim, we'll open the call for your questions.

Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it
and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information
on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Finally, during the call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation
between the 2 was included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the
presentation slides. The press release and presentation as well as a supplementary financial information
file are provided on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.leidos.com.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone.

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Peter, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our third quarter 2020 earnings
conference call. As we near the end of a challenging year from both an individual and community
perspective, I sincerely hope that each of you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy.

Leidos' third quarter results reflect the hard work and dedication of our employees and close collaboration
with our customers as we provided continuity of operations while accelerating our pandemic response
plans. This is evidenced by record revenue, solid margins, record backlog and record operational cash
generation. While challenges still remain, we're pleased with the growth and margin trajectory as we enter
the fourth quarter and beyond.

In the quarter, the business delivered revenue of $3.24 billion, a new high watermark for the corporation,
reflecting 14.4% growth from the prior year. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestiture activity, organic
revenue grew by almost 2%, demonstrating the declining effects of COVID-19 as our teams diligently
executed their recovery plans.

We recorded non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $1.47, up 8% from the prior year. In addition,
the business generated a record $592 million of cash from operations. Net bookings of $4.3 billion in
the quarter yielded a book-to-bill of 1.3x as well as 1.5x on a trailing 12-month basis despite several bid
protests at the end of the quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.7% reflects strong program execution across all business segments,
including an accelerated reopening of our medical exam business, as we designed workflow protocols and
safety measures that met customer requirements. While the impact of maintaining our fixed-cost exam

infrastructure was deeply felt in Q2, that investment was the right decision as the market demand for our
services rebounded well in the third quarter, as demonstrated by our results.

For the quarter, COVID-19 impacts to the overall business were approximately $109 million in revenue and
$23 million in operating income, representing a significant decline from the prior quarter's impact of $223
million and $78 million, respectively. Furthermore, third quarter impacts were partially offset by program
performance and on-contact growth across our highly diversified portfolio. We continue to expect recovery
of greater than 70% of COVID-19 impacts in future quarters.

Now turning to some notable awards that contributed to our ninth consecutive quarter of record backlog.
In the Defense Solutions segment, Leidos was awarded a $306 million follow-on contract by the Army
Contracting Command to provide the full spectrum of turnkey ground and flight operations for the Saturn
Arch aircraft in OCONUS contingency environments. In the Civil segment, we won a $292 million prime
contract by the Federal Aviation Administration to design and develop a system to provide real-time access
to essential weather, aeronautical and National Airspace System, NAS, information through a common
NAS-wide Enterprise - Information Display System. Additionally, within the intelligence community, the
company was awarded contracts collectively valued at $445 million, which encompass mission-critical
services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security.

Our $31.7 billion backlog, about 2.5x our third quarter annualized revenue run rate, coupled with our
strong new business pipeline, provides a strong foundation for accelerated growth into next year and
beyond. Furthermore, our backlog does not reflect recent awards with the Defense Health Agency and the
Army Special Operations Command due to protest activity at the close of the quarter.

Similarly, the $8 billion Navy NextGen protest remains in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims with oral
arguments now scheduled for November 13. We still anticipate a favorable outcome shortly thereafter.

Now turning to the macro environment. The U.S. government is currently operating under a continuing
resolution through December 11 which includes an extension of Section 3610 of the CARES Act. It is likely
that the CR is extended into the next calendar year. We do not anticipate any material impacts to our 2020
year-end results.

Furthermore, we remain engaged with our industry partners to help ensure that extension of the CR also
includes the existing Section 3610 language. Looking to 2021 and beyond, we continue to have conviction
that our positioning in infrastructure, space exploration and health care in the federal civil markets and in
unmanned systems, hypersonics and digital modernization in the defense and intel markets closely aligns
with our customers' enduring needs, which are supported by both sides of the aisle within the federal
government.

Next, I want to update you on the Leidos Relief Foundation, which has been a tremendous resource
for so many members of our Leidos family who have been affected by the pandemic. The foundation is
generously funded by hundreds of fellow employees as well as members of the Leidos executive leadership
team and Board of Directors. To date, funds from the foundation have already been directed to assist 175
employees or employee families who have experienced a financial hardship or lost a loved one during
these challenging times. The health and well-being of our employees is our top priority, and I am proud to
be part of a team that continually supports one another.

I want to mention one other important development to you today. On October 20, we announced the
departure of a valued colleague from our Board of Directors, Lawrence C. Nussdorf. Larry stepped down
from the company's Board of Directors for medical reasons, effective October 15. Larry has dedicated
more than a decade of service and leadership to our company, seeing us through transformational change
growth and helping create enviable shareholder value. He has accelerated our strategies and added value
at every turn. Recognizing that Larry is irreplaceable, our Board decided to eliminate the vacancy caused
by his departure, and we will carry on with 12 directors.

To say that we will miss Larry is an understatement as his expertise in all aspects of financial investment
and legal activities gave us a sounding board we could always rely on. I am personally thankful for his
friendship and counsel. At times, he has challenged me, and I have grown because of it. I am incredibly

appreciative of his mentorship and friendship, and I didn't want to close today without acknowledging his
many contributions. We wish Larry and his family well as he focuses on his recovery.

I will now turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our third quarter
results and guidance.

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. In the interest of getting to your
questions, I'll focus my comments on our solid third quarter results and full year guidance.

Third quarter revenue was strong, growing 14% over the prior year period, including 1.7% organically.
In addition to contributions from recent acquisitions, our growth was primarily fueled by recent program
wins and on-contract growth, plus our ability to accelerate the reopening of medical exam clinics, which is
a part of our business with high operating leverage. Today, we are performing at volumes that exceed pre-
pandemic levels to address the backlog of medical exams that had built up during the second quarter.

These increases were partially offset by $109 million of COVID-19 impacts, comprised of approximately
$40 million of year-over-year impacts plus $69 million of anticipated growth that we would have achieved
on existing and new programs. Adjusting for the impact of COVID-19 on the quarter, organic revenue
growth would have been roughly 5.5%.

Adjusted EBITDA margins were also strong at 10.7%, consistent with the prior year period in spite of
a $23 million COVID-19 headwind to expected growth. This compares well with our prior year adjusted
EBITDA margin of 10.7%, which had been assisted by the $54 million Greek arbitration award. Our robust
margins this quarter were driven by exceptional program execution and indirect cost management across
all of our segments.

Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.47 exceeded our expectations, growing $0.11 over the prior year period.
Our strong program performance and increased volume on existing and new programs, partially offset by
higher interest expense, drove the 8% growth year-over-year.

Record-high operating cash flows of $592 million for the quarter were driven by strong operational
performance across the enterprise, higher customer advance payments and favorable timing of vendor
disbursements. The AR monetization facility contributed only $7 million during the quarter.

Keeping with our disciplined capital deployment strategy and our commitment to delever, this quarter,
we used cash on hand to pay down $477 million of debt, retiring a $450 million senior unsecured note 3
months early.

Additionally, in October, we completed a $1 billion bond deal that benefited us in 3 ways: First, enabled by
our investment-grade credit rating, we were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions by securing
lower long-term interest rates. Second, we replaced certain debt instruments with ones with extended
maturities. And lastly, the deal provided our balance sheet with greater near-term liquidity that allows us
to take advantage of smaller tuck-in acquisition opportunities where speed of execution provides us with
an advantage.

As of the end of the quarter, our adjusted net leverage was slightly above 3.0, which was a goal we had
previously set for early 2021 after we completed the 2 acquisitions earlier this year. Having reached our
target leverage, we remain committed to our long-term, balanced capital deployment strategy, which
consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating; returning a quarterly
dividend to our shareholders; and reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically; and returning
excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.

Bookings of $4.3 billion were strong across all segments and resulted in a 1.3x book -- consolidated book-
to-bill, with record backlog ending the quarter at $31.7 billion. This record backlog reflects a 33% increase
over the prior year period. It's also worth noting that excluded from our book-to-bill and our backlog is the
impact of $9 billion of contract awards that are currently under protest.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 22% over the prior year
and 3.5% organically. Driving this growth was the Dynetics acquisition and the strong execution of new
programs, partially offset by COVID-19 impacts of $26 million from reduced volumes on legacy programs
and $14 million from expected growth.

Non-GAAP operating margins in the Defense Solutions segment of 8.8% grew 110 basis points from
the prior year quarter. Contributing to the increase was the Dynetics acquisition, new program wins
and reduced indirect spending, partially offset by impacts due to COVID-19, including the effects of
maintaining mission-essential personnel in a ready state for key customers. Defense Solutions booked
over $1.8 billion in net awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.9x for the quarter and 1.2 on a trailing 12-
month basis.

In our Civil segment, revenue grew 5.2% over the prior year period and contracted 4.9% organically. The
top line growth was driven by the acquisition of the security detection and automation businesses. This
increase was offset by COVID-19 impacts, consisting of $14 million from reduced program volumes and
$38 million from expected growth on existing and new programs.

Civil non-GAAP operating margins of 10.5% increased 220 basis points over the prior year quarter. The
primary drivers were increased volumes on mature programs and a decrease in bad debt expense that
reduced the prior year's third quarter results. Civil recorded nearly $1 billion in net bookings for the
quarter, resulting in a 1.3x book-to-bill and 2.4 on a trailing 12-month basis.

And finally, turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues increased 2.4% over the prior year
quarter and 30% sequentially. Additionally, after adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity, Health
revenues grew 5.8% organically. This growth was directly attributable to the hard work accomplished
by our team to both reopen and ramp the medical exam business back to pre-COVID levels faster than
previously forecasted.

Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 16.3%, an increase of 150 basis points over
the prior year quarter, reflecting the accelerated recovery in our medical exam business, the divestiture
of the health staff augmentation business in the third quarter of 2019 and a reduction in business
investments. The Health segment booked over $1.5 billion in net awards, driven by an increase to backlog
in the medical exam business based on sustained elevated case deliveries and demand. This 13% growth
over the prior year period resulted in a 3.0 book-to-bill for the quarter and 1.0 on a trailing 12-month
basis.

Moving now to the remainder of the year. With the strength of our Q3 results, we are revising our 2020
guidance as follows: We expect revenue for the year to be between $12.3 billion and $12.5 billion,
reaffirming the prior midpoint and tightening the range. This update reflects the execution of our strategy
outlined in the second quarter earnings call and returning to normalized run rates and business mix in the
fourth quarter.

We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the year between 10.6% and 10.8%, a 60 basis point increase at
the midpoint from the previous guidance. This reflects the improved margins in the third quarter from high
staff utilization, reduced indirect costs and strong program execution across the entire business. We now
expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $5.65 to $5.85, an increase of $0.35 at the midpoint
of the prior guide.

Finally, we expect cash from operations to be at, at least $1.2 billion, consistent with the prior guide.
However, due to the strong cash flow generated on a year-to-date basis, coupled with the additional
liquidity stemming from the October bond deal, we no longer anticipate any full year contribution from our
existing AR monetization facility, whereas the prior guidance had assumed $300 million.

As we look to the coming year, the accelerated recovery we have seen during the third quarter, along
with our strong level of contract awards this year, gives us increased confidence that we will have a
strong 2021. Assuming continued success in defending the awards that are in protest and our customers'
continued ability to adapt to the pandemic, we could achieve organic revenue growth in 2021 of at least

10% to 12% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 10.3% or better. As is our normal business
practice, formal 2021 guidance will be discussed at our fourth quarter earnings conference call.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.

Joseph William DeNardi
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Jim, can you maybe just provide some of the puts and takes that go into the margin commentary for next
year that you just talked about? Maybe what are some of the headwinds? How much of that is tied to
COVID versus newer opportunities ramping up?

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. For next year, Joe, we don't see a significant headwind related to COVID. And as we've said in the
call, we're really finding ourselves within -- with a reduction in run rate and indirect expenses, strong
program execution.

And in terms of how we're thinking about next year, I want to make sure I reiterate the fact that this is
really preliminary, and it's based on where we see the numbers penciling out for next year. We're right in
the middle of our planning process. And right now, we're seeing some ability to sustain the strength in
margins that we're seeing in the third quarter.

The only real headwinds that are worth pointing out right now that we have to be cognizant of is that
we have a couple of very large, new programs ramping in the coming year. And as we've said before,
typically, margins on those programs can be as low as low single digits.

We think of our entire company as a portfolio of programs, and while there are a number of programs
that have margins that continue to increase, we do have a couple of big programs where we have early-
stage margin pressure that typically starts to resolve itself after the first couple of years of these long-
term programs. And that's really what that reflects. We feel like, given the portfolio that we have, we're
definitely going to be seeing strengthening margins into next year.

Joseph William DeNardi
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then Roger, I wonder if you could just talk about kind of the overall award
environment. Book-to-bill was maybe a little seasonally light. You're not alone. Some of your peers have
reported similar. But did you see any kind of slowdown in the quarter? Or do you see pent-up demand
over the next few quarters?

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Maybe a little. There's -- we have a program with the FAA that we say it's going to award any week, and
then we don't know which week.

I think our book-to-bill was probably impacted more by protests. One of those programs is with the
second protest. And we had sort of hoped that we had answered all the issues from the first protest, and
we're optimistic that we would have booked that in the quarter, and it turned out that, that didn't happen.
And then Navy NextGen got delayed about another 2 weeks.

So I just -- there's always some delays to the write -- even in good times before COVID. There's -- within
a given month, it's a little bit unpredictable. And with the government's fiscal year, there was stuff it was
trying to get out within the quarter and it slid. We think we'll pick most of that up in the fourth quarter.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

And we haven't seen, from the customer activities, like an effect from -- I don't know whether we call
ourselves in a second wave or a third wave or whatever you want to call where we are now. But it
certainly -- I don't see things accelerating, but I think they're kind of going at the usual pace. So for us,
really, the 1.3 really is a protest story. Thanks, Joe.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.

Seth Michael Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wonder in that outlook for next year in terms of how you think about the duration of the continuing
resolution. And at what point it starts to have an impact, given that we could have an extended one
following the election?

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Our base assumption is that we get another CR on the 11th of December. It includes 3610. And
frankly, it probably goes until March. We get through whatever happens tomorrow, and that's -- its effect
on January. And it's either the current administration, and they have a lot of vacancies they want to fill; or
it's a new administration, they've got vacancies. I think our assumption is, yes, they're going to CR their
way all the way through that until they fill out their leadership team. And so it could be March, it could be
even beyond that.

And there's precedence for this. We've seen it before. So it's fully baked into our thoughts about the
future, and that means you'll be halfway through the government fiscal year before you actually get a bill.

But again, we've all been doing this a long time. We've seen it before. And frankly, there may even be
advantages, because if we get a CR, then everybody holds on to the budgets that they had last year. And
you don't see a lot of reprioritization amongst different programs at different agencies. So no, I don't see
much impact.

Seth Michael Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then if I could just follow up quickly on the 2 acquisitions and their contributions in the quarter. Really
nice sequential pickup on Dynetics and just how things are tracking there versus your expectations for the
year and into '21. And then slight sequential stepdown in airport security products and kind of how things
are shaping up there, given what's happening in the air travel environment.

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll do sort of qualitative, and if Jim wants to put a little bit of quantitative out there, he can.

But let me start from the active integrating, okay? That's back-office systems, people. And the -- both
Dynetics and security detection and automation businesses, they're doing really quite well. I mean we're
ahead of our milestones. We're getting systems converted, people converted to our employee system. And
so that's going really, really well.

From a leadership standpoint, we're just really pleased and excited that the leadership team of both
organizations have continued to stay. And we're very happy that we've literally -- we launched nobody off
of either senior leadership team.

The Dynetics business, because of Lander and some other things, is ahead of our expectations. And we
integrated them with our Leidos Innovation Center, and that has really created some cross-linking into our
existing R&D business, which is really, really exciting.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

I think you touched on what's going on in air traffic. We were over a million passengers like 2 weeks
ago, and then this sort of second wave has tempered that a little bit. And so we have seen -- we've got
a couple of foreign bids that have gotten delayed by a couple of weeks. TSA is actually moved forward
with some CT at the checkpoint opportunities. But our expectation is it's going to be a long recovery, and
orders are going to stretch to the right. And so there is, I think, cause to have a balanced view of our
security detection and automation business. But -- and by the way, for us, that's almost good because
we get a chance to really focus on integration and get those systems and processes into what we call the
Leidos business framework and where we want them before we see any significant ramp-up. But the --
we've seen air traffic. I think the U.K. just went on a month shutdown.

And so this second wave, third wave is going to be problematic. And I think we're very circumspect about
that and its effect it will have on our business. But a great opportunity for us to get our CT product to the
market and to get things through the qualification process with TSA. So again, we're very excited about
that business. It's just -- we're in the middle of this second wave in the pandemic.

Jim, I don't know if you want to talk about numbers.

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

Just to amplify what you said, Roger. The Dynetics business is performing in some metrics better than
we expected; on some, we're spot on. And we're pleased with how that business is accelerating through
integration. And as you said, that's tempered with the other acquisition, which is seeing some of the
COVID-19 impacts. Not so much with win rates, but more how some awards and some deliveries have
been pushed out as a result of the pandemic.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Barclays.

Matthew Carl Akers
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I want to follow up real quickly on the CR commentary and specifically the 3610 extension. I just wanted
to ask kind of how important is that specifically. I think based on some of the commentary from some of
your peers, I think it sounded like a lot of people covered by 3610 had already sort of returned to work.
So if you could just comment on sort of how big that is for you at this point.

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, I'm happy to share our numbers. So 97% of our team is back at work on regular hours. So we
have really only about 1.5% at a reduced standing, and that's the people that would really be affected by
3610. And then we have 1.5% is kind of miscellaneous, just some structural things. And so it's really not a
big impact for us anymore. I think that's -- we've seen that across the industry and certainly our peers in
these agencies.

I think it -- there are some things around 3610 that may be more important for some of the bigger
aerospace primes relative to factories and things, but that doesn't affect many of our programs because of
the nature of our work, which is really people coming to work and writing software and doing mission and
things like that. And so not as important as it was at the beginning of this journey. Would still be nice to
have. And -- but we don't see a major impact.

Matthew Carl Akers
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess if I could just one more on sort of budget risk next year. I think
that's kind of the biggest concern I see from investors. But I guess if you just sort of look across your
addressable market, are there certain areas that you think are maybe more susceptible to budget cuts as

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

you look out over the next couple of years as opposed to maybe other areas that you think are more well
protected? And how do you think about sort of positioning Leidos within that?

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And we've talked about it at the last quarter, and I'll just reiterate some of our themes. If you're in
support of legacy programs within DoD, I mean, that's probably not a great place to be. You want to be in
the emerging technologies, I think, regardless of who gets elected.

And the Biden campaign has come out and said that they're not looking to cut defense. And we think
that's true. That means that they're not going to cut it. They probably wouldn't grow it as fast as a second
Trump administration would. And then the shifting of priorities. I think Biden is going to kind of go back to
international alliances and maybe reopen trade. I think that Trump will continue what he has done.

We think in any administration, pandemic response, health care, civil infrastructure, we think our return
to the moon program is strongly supported, by the way, from both sides of the aisle. Both administrations
have said that.

And I've said this in many, many calls is, everybody gets elected or reelected with hopes and ambitions
and a set of priorities. And then you walk in the office and you're faced with a record deficit; 8%, 9%
unemployment; and you're on the precipice of a recession. And so I think either administration is going to
look for another CARES relief act. I think the tax increase, which is purported in the Biden administration,
will be delayed because the last thing you want to do is tamp down economic growth because that's how
we pull ourselves out of this large unemployment.

And so I actually think that 2021 looks a lot like 2020, and 2022 is already in planning. It's in what we
call the POM and EPP cycle. If you talk to customers, they've already put their budgets in for '22. And of
course, our backlog takes us well into '23 and '24 before our programs start to be affected.

So there will be changes in priorities, more civil infrastructure. I think we've got to get pandemic
response-ready and that CDC and organizations like FEMA and NIAID and USAID and NIH, all of which we
have been carefully positioning the company with a balanced portfolio to be able to address what would be
a shift in priorities in the federal government. And so we're very happy with where we're positioned, and
we're going to continue to stay up late tomorrow night and see who got elected, but I think we're going to
be in great shape either way.

Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

How do we -- I wanted to ask first on revenue drivers in defense and Civil. What's going on in those
businesses? I appreciate the ex COVID impact. They were up 6% and 2% organically. So what are some of
the puts and takes? And how do we think about those going forward?

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So in particular, defense and Civil revenue drivers, both for -- actually for the back end of this year
and into next, some program wins that represented takeaways, and growth in existing programs are
really the drivers. And we had an Air Force takeaway, for example. I'll just give you a couple of examples.
Something called ACC ISR, which was a takeaway. There's a contract in CBP that is a traveler vetting
system contract that we won. And these are the kinds of things that are providing us organic growth. And
again, that's in the defense business.

If we want to think about in the Civil, inorganically, obviously it's SD&A. But there's also some growth of
existing programs that we're looking at for next year in the DOE. The NETL contract is one example. And

then also -- so we have some expansion in our MSA contract there as well. So that -- those are the things
that have been driving revenue growth.

But probably also interesting is margin expansion that we're seeing both in those 2 businesses and
really across the whole portfolio that has to do with really strong program performance and effective
management of indirect costs as we kind of work through the pandemic. And these have been things that
have more than offset some of the headwinds that we've had from COVID-19. And it really is a testament
to the program teams and the management team that are out there driving those improvements.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then one more for you, because we can't seemingly keep up with your puts and takes for free
cash flow. So just to clarify on the -- because of the prefunding of the $1 billion bond or the financing of
that, how do we think about AR for this year? Is it net neutral? And how that flows over to 2021?

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So for the full year, the impact of our AR monetization facility is going to be 0. Previously, we had
included in our guidance a $300 million add that shows up in operating cash flow. That is, in effect, the
sale of our receivables at a very, very low cost of capital. And we don't need to do that now to maintain
the level of liquidity that we want. We've got ample liquidity, so we don't need that anymore. So you
can think about the $1.2 billion guide that we have today as being a $300 million improvement from a
performance standpoint versus where we were last quarter.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.

Cai von Rumohr
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. Could you just refresh us in terms of the defense, health and the Army SOCOM protest,
approximately how large were they? And when do you expect the protest time line to be over?

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Okay, Cai, let me see if I can get these right. First of all, the total number we have in protest is about
$9.3 billion. So if you add all the programs that we have collectively. The -- what we call RHRP program is
rounded to $1 billion, give or take a little bit. And it doesn't mean that's exactly what we'll book when we
achieve the protest. And I think that's in January, right? We don't get that until January.

And then the other program we refer to it as STAMP, which stands, of course, for something, is about
$600 million, $650 million. And then, of course, you add NextGen to that at about $8 billion, maybe a little
less than that, $7.7 billion, $7.8 billion. That gets you to about $9.3 billion. And I think the STAMP, we're
hopeful will happen in fourth quarter, so if it doesn't get reprotested, which we're getting used to but...

And then Navy NextGen, you didn't ask, I touched on it in my remarks, we're kind of -- whether it's before
Thanksgiving or after Thanksgiving, it's hard to tell. You do oral arguments. The Court of Federal Claims is
not -- you can't set your clock by it like you can with the GAO. And so we'll go oral arguments, and then
we're in the hands of the judge, and he can make a ruling anytime after oral arguments from that day to
probably a couple of weeks.

Cai von Rumohr
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Terrific. And then the second one would be, your margins were good, and you've talked about the COVID
headwind. To what extent do you feel that COVID was a tailwind in terms of indirect expenses benefiting

from lower travel and meeting expenses, and utilization benefiting from lower paid vacation time off
because there was fewer places for people to go?

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Cai, that was certainly a factor. I don't know whether it's 20 or 30 bps, maybe something like that.
I mean it's a little hard to put our finger on it, but clearly made a difference. And our medical costs are
down double digit millions.

And the challenge for all of us, by the way -- and it's all relatively good. The challenge, I think, for us
and for the industry is to decide what comes back and what doesn't. We're at somewhere between 25%
and 50% occupancy in our buildings, and we're running just fine. We have 65% of our employees are
telecommuting, and they're doing reasonably well. I think actually very well.

And we start to look at 2021 and say we need less real estate. We don't need to go to all the trade shows
that we've been to -- or at least not in person. Some of the virtual work that we've done on AUSA and AFA
have worked actually extremely well. We've actually talked to more general officers because you can Zoom
them, and you can do one right after another, and they don't get caught in somebody else's show booth,
right?

So we are really taking a look at the lessons learned, and we want to capture and internalize a significant
portion of that reduction in our margin going forward. And I think you're seeing that across the board.

Operator

The next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I was going to ask Sheila's question, but Jim, since you didn't fully answer it, maybe I'll take another
whack at it. It's just about big moving pieces into 2021. Thanks for clarifying the AR this year. But thinking
about '21 over '20 cash flow, I mean, are we sort of still looking at about $1 billion operating cash? I think
that number has been thrown around previously. Or can we actually sustain at this $1.2 billion or greater
going into '21 with all those moving pieces, including I know payroll, tax and whatnot?

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Jon, we'll have more to say about that when we issue our guidance at the end of the fourth quarter
call. We were purposeful in not putting all the details out there because we're still working through that.
I would tell you that this year has been -- has been benefited significantly by the ability to defer taxes
into next year. And we'll have a lot of the moving parts for that available when we give you the kind of the
walk of this year's cash flow to next year.

Another thing you have to remember is that next year, we're not going to have a repeat of VirnetX. That
was $80 million. So the strength of this year's cash conversion has really been on the backs of the CARES
Act legislation, VirnetX, strong program performance and our continued focus on monetizing receivables,
getting things billed faster, getting them collected faster.

So now we always have these things that I refer to as recurring nonrecurrings, but we just -- we can't
plan those. But who knows what next year's tailwind on cash flow might be. But like I said, we'll have
more to say about that in next quarter's call.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. I appreciate that. And then just on your -- the incremental debt raise. Can you just clarify, how much
are you actually taking out with that $1 billion? Or is it all just additional?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

And then you mentioned your capital deployment priorities. But with that additional debt, you're sort of
looking -- you mentioned some tuck-in M&A capabilities. What are some of those opportunities that might
be out there at this point, size-wise and market-wise and capability-wise?

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll answer the first part of that question, and Roger can speak to the second half about what we
might be interested in. But out of the $1 billion raise, we paid off debt to the tune of $750 million. And we
left $250 million in the cash account to give us the kind of flexibility that we're talking about.

And then Roger can speak to the kinds of things that could represent tuck-ins. We don't have anything
specific, but like I said, we want to have some flexibility, and that's why we're keeping some cash around.

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Jon, we're always working a pipeline of where do we want to be. What are the technologies that support
the programs that we see 3 and 5 years out? And then we take a look internally within what we call our
technical core competencies and whether we're deep enough or not.

And there tends to be kind of a make-by decision and time to market. And there's -- at any given time,
we'll have half a dozen $50 million to $250 million deals kind of in a pipeline. And some are in diligence,
some we're just -- we're wishful. And I don't really have anything to say at this time. Of course, we never
comment on M&A anyway.

But I don't think anything that's going to surprise you. I mean you've been listening to the calls. You know
where we're moving in digital transformation, hypersonic space, cyber, physical cyber, electronic warfare,
that -- the whole list that we've been talking about for a long time. And there are some companies that
have been in kind of PE or venture capital that are looking for a liquidity event.

And by the way, one point I made before, maybe interesting to remind everyone, usually the companies
that we buy, we've had a relationship with for a long time. We do over and under. They might be a sub to
us. We've probably been working with these companies for 5 years, some up to a decade. And we know
the management team well. We know the technology well and especially the culture of the company.

Culture is really a big thing for us, and we want people that will fit with our organization. We're a little
different because we're employee-owned for so long with sort of more of an open, collaborative culture,
and culture is really a big deal for us. But -- and if it doesn't work out, then we're happy to have them in a
partnership relationship going forward. But that's kind of what we're looking at.

The next question is from the line of Rob Spingarn with Crédit Suisse.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I know you don't want to guide to next year, but you did mention that 10% to 12%. And understanding
that there's some moving pieces and delays and protests and so forth, is there a way to talk about that
qualitatively by segment?

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Rob, we don't -- as we've said before, we don't guide by segment, right? But to speak to it
qualitatively, it is -- it really is based on where we're kind of halfway through or near maybe 2/3 of the
way through planning for next year. And the early returns that are coming up from the units are consistent
with kind of what the top-down math looks like. Strong book-to-bill over the last 12 months. The contract
lengths haven't gotten longer. We have some really big enterprise IT programs that are ramping. And with
those, we could easily pencil out growth to the tune of what we said earlier on the call.

15

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

But by segment, today, we're seeing expanding margins across each one of our segments. And we think
that next year could have some strong organic growth across the entire business, because we're -- and
we're pleased that across the portfolio, everything has strong book-to-bills, and that translates to strong
organic growth next year.

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Rob, let me jump on the back of that is, given our last 2 quarters and what happened in our Health
business and the amount of time we spent with the community on how the exam business works, and we
try to be as transparent as we could, is that if we get to the point where the -- our clinics are shut down,
we can't do exams. And so we went through that period as, of course, everyone saw.

But those -- as we have said and we said on the last call, which is to repeat again, the exams don't go
away. Those disability exams, whether the Department of Labor or for the veterans or for workmen's
comp, still have to get done. And so we're now faced with sort of an inventory of exams we have to work
our way through.

And so we're fortunate we ended the third quarter at higher than COVID levels. Although for the quarter,
we were probably kind of at or about where we were before, starting lower, ending higher. But we now
have to work through that inventory of exams, and that's going to take us well into '21 to do so.

So we again, we tried to be transparent with everybody when we had to shut down the clinics and what
we'll look like when we were open. We're now reopened. All of our clinics are open. We still have PPE, and
we have to have appropriate protocols, because the pandemic is clearly alive and well out there. But we
expect sort of the tailwind certainly from the exam business to go significantly into '21.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Similar question, maybe higher level and looking out a little bit further. But with the potential
changes in strategy, if we have a change in administration, longer term, Roger, how do we think about
your service exposure changing in the defense business? And I'm talking about Army, Navy, Air Force
exposure. Is that something you can speak about?

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, I'll touch a little bit and then maybe if we have time at the end, you can ask a second question.

Yes, and I get -- I always get wrapped up. When you use the word service, I want to stop and talk about
the lower-end services is not the business that you'll find that Leidos is in, is that we tend to be mission-
focused. We don't do services, right? We do solutions. And we partner with our customers on mission.

But a comment maybe you were leading to is like what will happen in the AOR in the Middle East, and
Trump had made a commitment to pull troops down, and there have been troops. We have reduced our
footprint in the Middle East. And I think we all anticipated that, that is likely to continue, I think, under
either administration.

The number is not going to go to 0. And part of what we do is we provide support not for the U.S.
troops, but for the Afghans. Some of our aviation programs are in direct support of Afghan operations
by Afghanis. But we could see sort of a slowing down of some of the work that we do in theater, which
frankly, is a wonderful thing. It means we don't have troops at risk.

But the customers are going to take that obligation authority, and they're going to spend it in other areas.
They may spend it in modernization, which is great for us because we're well positioned in the future of
our customers.

But what we have all learned is that if it quiets down in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's going to get hot
someplace else. And unfortunately, history has told us is that there's always a place to deploy troops.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

And -- but I would tell you that we have been fortunate to subtly shift our portfolio out of that very, very
low end. And our OCO numbers are very small. And so we're fairly well insulated to what I would call that
pure services play if that were to be deemphasized in the budget.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. What I was thinking about is just large, if Army became a bill payer for growth at Air Force, Navy and
in space, clearly at Dynetics, you have very good exposure to all those growing things. So that's the way I
was thinking about it. That's certainly something that investors are asking us.

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And again, we are -- why don't I let you go and we'll come back. I would simply say, we haven't seen
it. Our support contracts to the Army are doing fine. I think there's some things around Army in strength
and requires a longer conversation. I'd rather not use everybody else's time. But Rob, maybe we'll call you
after the call, and we can talk a little bit more about what we think is going on in the Army.

The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Robert W. Baird.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Roger, just maybe just to talk briefly about kind of a follow-on to Rob's question about '21. Just
specifically, when we think about the SD&A Businesses, just to clarify, do we -- is there an expectation
that, that visibility there in '21 will actually -- will see a return to growth for that business? Or how should
we be thinking about just the revenue profile of that business?

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

It's a little early for us to know with specificity that part of what we call our security products business,
which is actually being integrated in with the legacy Leidos business. I think that right now we're not
viewing that as being a big grower for next year just because of what we think of as kind of a hangover
from COVID-19. However, we can probably have more color on that in the next call as we have more
visibility into how well the order pipeline has developed.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And just as a quick follow-on, just regarding your ability in general to add new hires in this
environment. How has that been proceeding?

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

It's been terrific. We went to a virtual hiring platform. We do virtual new employee orientation. We've got
employees who are part of the company, who are working from home, who have never been to a Leidos
building. And we're very, very fortunate that people see what's going on at the company. They understand
our culture. They love the work. They love working together, and they love the workplace flexibility that
we now offer. And so hiring has not been a constraint for us.

Now we were hoping that we would have had Navy NextGen in our portfolio by now. That is going to
require a significant, literally above 1,000 people. And we hope that will be our problem next year, and
we'll add that.

And of course, we've added a lot of people through the acquisitions of the Dynetics and the SD&A. All told,
between direct hiring and acquisitions, we'll probably add around 9,000 people this year.

The next question is from the line of Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs.

Gavin Eric Parsons
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Jim, just a quick one on guidance assumptions. Last quarter, you guys provided a pretty helpful slide on
the sizing of COVID and the engine pushout. I was wondering if you could just update us on the 2020
expected impact of COVID to revenue and EBITDA?

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

We haven't provided anything specific. I can tell you that the change in the expectation on COVID-19
in 2020 is the revenue impact is going to be a little bigger, but it isn't materially bigger. And that the
operating income impact on COVID-19 for the full year is a little bit lower, because of the recovery that
we've seen in Q3 being a little bit faster than we had expected when we talked to you a quarter ago.

Gavin Eric Parsons
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Sorry, just to clarify. You're saying the revenue headwind is larger than you'd been anticipating last
quarter for all of this year.

James C. Reagan
Executive VP & CFO

A little bit. No, I wouldn't call it material. It's a small number.

Gavin Eric Parsons
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then, Roger, the comment on visibility into growth is really helpful, just on the authority
and outlays catching up to authority and the unobligated balance, your visibility in the backlog. But if I
look at just kind of the main Investor Day and the anticipation of a 5% addressable growth CAGR for your
addressable markets, how do you think about planning differently, given the political uncertainty and the
budget deficit? And then whether or not you're still on a growth posture for a 5-year outlook? And then
whether or not that changes how you plan for the business?

Roger A. Krone
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Okay. I'll try to be short because I know we're running late. But first of all, you raised the unobligated
balance. By our numbers, it's $130 billion. So there's a ton of budget overhang of, if you will, unspent
prior authorized balances. So add that to the CR and you see your way through '21 and '22. And clearly, in
our Investor Day, we were talking 5%, where kind of our conversation now begins at 10% and goes north
from there.

We run the same scenarios everybody else does. What is the federal deficit? What's it take to get to a
balanced budget? And those numbers are in such large magnitude. I mean you could remove the NASA
budget completely and you don't even make a dent.

So we have some longer, structural things as a country that we need to better understand, and there's
some inflation that has to happen. And so you can pay debt off 10 years with inflated dollars and things.

But what we have heard, talking to both administrations and the Hill, is we need economic growth. That's
what's going to get us back on firm footing. And you can't make huge reductions in federal spending and
get the economic recovery that you need over the next 3 to 5 years. So we may see a little bit of top line
temperament.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

But I think the big change that we're going to see is, if Biden were to get elected versus Trump, a
reprioritization of what is a federal government budget that grows kind of with GNP. So you're talking
2.7%, 2.8%, maybe 3% GNP growth. And if you plot history, president to president, the federal
government spending is pretty constant. What changes is priorities within the 2 administrations or within
different administrations. And we think we've done a really good job of portfolioing this company so that
we can shift to more health and infrastructure if a Biden government were to go in that direction.

And we've talked a lot, and I don't want to go on too much. But the -- I don't think you solve the deficit
problem with spending. I think you're going to have to find sources of revenue. And everybody says oh,
that means taxes. And we said, yes, probably eventually, we could see the corporate rate start to creep
back to where it was. But other sources of revenue, like users' fees at parks and things like that, it's just
what's going to have to happen. There -- going to take some smarter people than I to figure out how we
pay off these trillions and trillions of dollars that we've borrowed to keep people employed.

So -- but with that, I think we, again, we got to wrap it up, but we can follow up with you on a one-on-
one.

At this time, I will turn the floor back to management for closing comments.
