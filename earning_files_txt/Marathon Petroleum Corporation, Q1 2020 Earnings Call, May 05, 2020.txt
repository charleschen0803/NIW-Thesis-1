Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is Jacqueline, and I will be your operator
for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.

Kristina Anna Kazarian
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference
Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under
the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Don Templin, CFO; and other
members of the executive team.

We also invite you to read the safe harbor statement on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking
statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included
there as well as in our SEC filings.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. As everyone is aware,
the global pandemic became the focus in the quarter, and that continues today with our immediate priority
on safely operating our assets to supply products to the market, protecting the health and safety of our
employees and customers and supporting the communities in which we operate. The actions taken to
prevent the spread of the virus have significantly reduced global economic activity and demand for our
products, specifically towards the last month of the quarter.

Our refining operating areas have been particularly hard hit in the Upper Midwest and on the West Coast.
At the same time, our Midstream and Retail businesses reported strong results, which offset some of the
financial impact of lower refining demand and margins.

As a result of this difficult situation, we're responding with prudent tactical changes in our business:
First, reducing our total capital spend by $1.4 billion or approximately 30% to $3 billion for 2020. This
includes approximately $700 million at MPC and $700 million at MPLX. This reduction is planned across all
segments of the business, with the remaining growth capital spend primarily related to projects that are in
progress or nearing completion.

Second, we have reduced our planned operating expenses by approximately $950 million, primarily
through reductions of fixed costs and deferring certain expense projects. This includes $750 million of
operating expense reductions at MPC and $200 million of operating expense reductions at MPLX.

Third, we have taken steps to maintain our financial flexibility. We've secured $3.5 billion of additional
liquidity, including a new $1 billion 364-day revolver and issued $2.5 billion of senior notes. After taking
these actions, we have approximately $6.8 billion of undrawn availability on our credit facilities. These
actions strengthen our liquidity and also strengthen the through-cycle earnings power of our business.

At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Don to review the first quarter results in more detail, then I'll come
back and share my early focus areas as we start to implement changes at MPC going forward.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported
an adjusted loss per share of $0.16. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.9 billion for the quarter. Cash from
operations before working capital changes was $1.3 billion, and our dividend payments for the quarter
were $377 million.

Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2019 to first quarter 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was down approximately $1.3 billion quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by lower
earnings in Refining & Marketing. Lower crack spreads due to demand destruction from the COVID-19
pandemic significantly impacted R&M earnings. First quarter results also included noncash lower of cost or
market adjustments to inventory and goodwill and asset impairments totaling $12.4 billion.

Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the fourth
quarter of 2019. Midstream EBITDA increased $19 million versus the fourth quarter. The increase was
driven by stable fee-based earnings and sustained organic growth in the base business, overcoming
headwinds from declining natural gas prices in the quarter.

Slide 8 provides an overview of our Retail segment. First quarter EBITDA was $644 million. Retail margins
were nearly $0.33 per gallon in the first quarter. These strong fuel margins were partially offset by lower
fuel volumes compared to fourth quarter, reflecting demand destruction associated with COVID-19.

Same-store merchandise sales increased year-over-year despite fuel demand pressures in the quarter,
reflecting the resiliency of the Speedway brand. We continue to target fourth quarter 2020 for the
completion of the separation of Speedway, and we are progressing separation activities. However, the
separation timing could change given the COVID-19-related impacts to the business environment and
access to the capital markets.

Slide 9 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Performance in this segment reflected
the challenges associated with managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated shelter-
in-place orders. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $154 million, a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion
versus the fourth quarter.

Margins in all regions decreased compared to fourth quarter 2019, particularly in the Mid-Con and West
Coast regions where we saw negative gas cracks towards the end of March. Despite these challenges, our
commercial team was able to capture favorable price realizations for both gasoline and diesel. Slide 20
of the appendix provides additional details on some of the primary drivers for capture. Refining operating
costs decreased approximately $129 million from the fourth quarter.

Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at
the end of the quarter was approximately $1.7 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working
capital was just over $1.3 billion. Changes in working capital were an approximately $2 billion use of
cash in the quarter due primarily to the sequential decline in crude oil prices during the quarter. As you
know, payment terms for our crude oil purchases are roughly 30 days, while our accounts receivables
typically average around 10 days. Coupling this 20-day net payable position with our 3 million barrel per
day system results in an approximately $60 million use of cash for every $1 decline in crude oil prices. The
opposite is also true when crude oil prices are increasing. The company drew $3.5 billion on its revolving
credit facilities in March and April primarily as a result of working capital changes.

On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook, which includes estimated throughput reductions
at our facilities based on projected demand destruction from COVID-19 and associated shelter-in-place
orders. We expect total throughput volumes of just over 2 million barrels per day, approximately 2/3 of
our nominal -- normal operating capacity. We have temporarily idled our Martinez and Gallup facilities in
response to demand destruction.

Planned turnaround costs are projected to be $215 million in the second quarter, which includes work
at our Galveston Bay and Los Angeles facilities. Total operating costs, including major maintenance, are
projected to be $6.90 per barrel for the quarter. Total operating costs on a dollar basis are lower compared
to historic levels, but the per-barrel costs reflect the impact of lower throughputs throughout our system.
Distribution costs are projected to be $1.275 billion.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

For the Retail segment, we expect fuel volumes of approximately 1.45 billion to 1.65 billion gallons and
merchandise sales in a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. While fuel volumes have been significantly
impacted by demand destruction associated with shelter-in-place orders, we expect merchandise sales to
remain relatively resilient.

Slide 12 highlights the proactive steps we've taken to strengthen our liquidity position. At quarter end, we
had a $5 billion revolving credit facility, a $1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility and $750 million from
a trade receivables facility. During the first quarter, we drew $2 billion on the $5 billion revolver. And in
mid-April, we drew an additional $1.5 billion, primarily to manage working capital impacts. In late April,
we added a $1 billion 364-day revolver, and we issued $2.5 billion in senior notes. We used proceeds from
the senior notes to repay borrowings under the revolver. As of today, the undrawn capacity on our credit
facilities total $6.75 billion.

As shown on Slide 13, we have a strong track record of maintaining through-cycle financial discipline.
MPC's parent-level debt of approximately $11.1 billion represents 1.5x the last 12 months of MPC's stand-
alone EBITDA. This ratio excludes the debt and EBITDA of MPLX but includes distributions MPLX paid to
MPC. We believe a strong balance sheet is essential to succeeding in this industry, and we are committed
to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Mike for some closing remarks before questions.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Don. Obviously, the current environment has required our immediate focus to ensure our through-
cycle resiliency of our business, but I also wanted to briefly share my view for the future. Over the
past decade, this company has grown to become one of the largest energy platforms in the country.
Although MPC has been successful in many areas, there's also a strong case for change to drive increased
profitability, stronger through-cycle earnings and long-term value creation.

There are 3 areas that will be our early focus to help us achieve these objectives. First, we need to
strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. This means positioning our assets to be a leader in
cost, operating and financial performance metrics. MPC has always been focused on safety and operational
excellence, and that will not change. However, we need to focus further on the contribution of each of our
individual assets and ensure the financial performance in all cycles meets our expectations and contributes
to shareholder returns.

Second, we need to improve our commercial performance. We are fortunate to have an extensive
integrated footprint, but we have an opportunity to be more dynamic to capture higher margins across
the value chain. Success for our refining system starts with raw material selection, and it's an area of
opportunity for us to further take advantage of the refining asset capability. In addition, we have the
opportunity to enhance and optimize the placement of our products across both the sales channels and the
geographic marketplace. Focused enhancements to both raw material selection and product placement will
increase our ability to maximize value across the entire value chain, increasing the margin we deliver to
the bottom line.

And third, we need to lower our overall cost structure and be extremely disciplined in capital allocation.
This means lowering our costs in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be incredibly
disciplined in every expense dollar we spend across our organization. It also means having a strict protocol
on capital investment for the long term to focus on the highest-return projects, risk adjusting them and
ensuring that we position the company to achieve these returns irrespective of market environment.

I'm confident that if we excel in these areas and sharpen our focus on execution across our refining,
marketing and midstream platforms, we will deliver better results, create a higher level of through-cycle
earnings and provide a compelling value proposition for shareholders. It's an appropriate time for change,
I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us.

In closing, I'd like to say that we take our responsibility to be a good corporate leader seriously and
that we are grateful for everyone working on the front lines of this pandemic. This quarter, to support

the efforts of health care workers across the country, we donated 575,000 N95 masks to 45 different
hospitals across the country. Additionally, the Marathon Petroleum Foundation made a $1 million donation
to the American Red Cross in April to help supply critical resources to communities in crisis. We have been
inspired by the story shared with us as these supplies reach many communities in dire need, and we're
proud to do our part by contributing supplies and funds to organizations supporting those in crisis.

In addition, I'd also like to thank our business-critical employees who have been on the front line of our
business, in the stores, in the control rooms and at our facilities and assets.

And with that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.

Kristina Anna Kazarian
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Mike. [Operator Instructions] We will now open the line for questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neil Mehta.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Mike, congratulations on the new role as CEO. My kickoff question here is on the cost savings and the
capital reductions that you announced. Can you put some more meat on the bones behind the key line
items that drove those reductions? And how should we think about whether cost and capital reductions are
cyclical in response to the environment versus a structurally more capital-efficient approach you're taking
to running the business?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Neil. I'll say, overall, we expect it to be more structural. There's a little bit of cyclicality, and
we'll talk about that in a second, but mainly overall to be more structural. So as I said in my prepared
remarks, I mean, one of the things that we're going to focus on is very strict discipline on capital
allocation. I'll start with Midstream, and I'll let Don and Tim jump in, in their respective areas as far as a
little more color. But in Midstream, we've stated for some time that we want to have free cash flow come
out of MPLX. And we've been on a program to reduce capital, to be real smart about where we're investing
for the long term in that business and kind of shifting the portfolio much more towards the L&S business
and a little less towards the investments in the G&P business because that investment has been pretty
robust over time. So if we get MPLX down to around that $1 billion or less, we expect to be free cash flow
positive in that business, and we've kind of stated that as a target for 2021.

So overall, I think you're going to see us try and maintain that level. And right now, we have a couple of
projects that we've talked about, Wink-to-Webster and Whistler that are MPC-backed long-haul projects as
well as the terminal that we're building next to our Garyville refinery as an enhancement to that facility.
So that's a lot of where we're putting the money in that business.

In addition, I will tell you, one of my philosophies, Neil, is generating free cash flow from all of our assets.
So as we look at capital overall, we got to make sure each of our assets are contributing cash back to the
business. So I know there's a little more detail in the refining assets. I'll let Don give a little more color on
what we're doing in refining there.

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Neil. As you'll recall, when we rolled out our budget for 2020, our Refining & Marketing budget was
$1.55 billion. That included $450 million of maintenance capital, so it essentially included $1.1 billion of
growth capital. And when we talked about our plan originally for 2020, about 60% of that growth capital
was really attributable to 2 primary projects: one was the continuation of the STAR program, which will
run into next year, 2021, so that's at Galveston Bay; and the other was the Dickinson Renewable Diesel
project, which will complete this year.

So if you think about 60% of our $600 million basically of capital -- of the growth capital was those
2 projects, one will be completely done and the other will be in sort of a tapering mode and nearing
completion, you'll see that we'll have a lot of flexibility around our capital budget next year.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

And Neil, it's Mike. I'm going to add a little bit to the expense side. So again, back to your question on
how much is variable versus structural. Obviously, with the pandemic and us reducing refining rates back

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

to minimum, there's a portion of variable cost there. But out of the $750 million of expense reduction on
the MPC side, the majority of that is fixed costs that we expect to maintain at a lower level, about $500
million of it being fixed. And I'm going to let Ray kind of comment on that, in that area. And then partially,
part of it is variable. On the Midstream side, about $200 million of it mostly we said was deferred expense
projects. So right now, they sit in the deferred column. But as we look at that further, we're going to take
a look at whether they need to be deferred or whether they actually are part of our long-term plan. So let
me let Ray add a little bit of color to the Refining fixed cost situation.

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Sure, Mike. On the fixed cost in Refining, there's really 3 components that make that up. The first would
be the turnaround segment, just lower overall turnaround expenses for the year with some deferral out
of 2020. And then the other categories, there's just lower maintenance costs and expense projects, just
choosing to do less work, less projects at our refineries.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Does that answer your question, Neil?

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Yes, very thorough. A lot of good color there. The follow-up is just on Speedway. And then, Mike, can you
just talk about from your perspective as the new CEO, how strongly you believe in the strategic merit of
the Speedway spin-off or sale or whether you're still targeting the fourth quarter, which you indicated
in the press release? And just any strategic updates around the execution of the sale, which for many
investors is an important catalyst for the stock.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I understand, Neil. It's a good question. So I do believe in the separation is the best value
proposition for MPC shareholders. So what we said in our remarks is we are still on schedule. And
the expectation that we had guided before was completion in the fourth quarter. I'd say we're still
scheduling and on target to accomplish that. So strategically, I still believe the separation is the best value
enhancement for MPC shareholders.

The only caveat that we put out here obviously is the COVID-19 situation is still very fluid, and we'll have
to see how that plays out as far as recovery in the business. And then the capital market access is another
important part of executing that separation in a highly efficient manner. So with those 2 caveats, we
are still committed to a separation and we're continuing on the schedule. However, we just want to be
cognizant of the current environment that could implement the timing a little bit. But we'll have to see
how that plays out.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I hope everybody is doing well. And Mike, let me add my congratulations to your new role. Looking
forward to seeing what you do next. In that regard, I wonder if I could just pick up on one of your
comments you made on the call about the 3 steps you're taking and maybe ask you a bit of a leading
question. Where do you see the weak links in the remaining portfolio post Speedway? What are the areas
you think need to be addressed to achieve your objectives?

Michael J. Hennigan

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Yes, Doug, I'm not ready to disclose the term weak links. What I will tell you, though, is we're going to do
a comprehensive look at all of our assets, and over time, you're going to see us come out with disclosures
as to where we feel we are from a competitive position on each of the assets. As I mentioned earlier
to Neil's question, I'm a big believer in looking at long-term value of the assets. I'm a big believer in
managing to free cash flow on an individual asset basis so that the overall portfolio is generating cash.
I mean, as you're very aware, this is a lot -- to a large extent, a return of capital business. And I think
we've done a good job of that in the past, and I think there's just an opportunity to do a little better in
there if we really look at the portfolio.

So I do think -- I hope the takeaway is we are going to spend a lot of time on the portfolio of all the
assets. We're going to look at where we can improve the competitiveness of those assets, either from a
cost standpoint or a commercial standpoint. That's going to be a very high focus. So I'm hoping to leave
you with those 3 items that each asset in the portfolio is going to be examined, our overall commercial
approach, and we've started into that discussion already, is going to be discussed quite a bit. And then --
and lastly, we're just going to lower the cost structure of the company. We think there's an opportunity to
do that at this point, and we're going to get after that as quickly as we can.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Presumably, that means asset rationalization is on the table, Mike?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think so, Doug. As I said, all the assets that we have in the portfolio are going to be examined.
But yes, I think so. And I had previously mentioned in the Midstream space that we didn't -- we don't
want to be in 8 basins. That's still a true statement. However, the gas business is now going through
a little bit of a change. But yes, it applies to all the other assets that we have in the portfolio, whether
they're retail assets in the short term or the Refining assets as well. So yes, a real good examination of
the competitiveness of our portfolio is the first priority.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

That's great. My follow-up is I was going to ask you about the dividend but you've talked about return
of cash to business, so I'll leave that for someone else. What I would like to ask you guys is you're in a
unique position to monitor demand trends. A couple of your competitors obviously have talked about, I
would call it, green shoots coming out of April. I'm just wondering what you can share with us in terms of
how you see things evolving in your markets. And I guess, more importantly, the 65% utilization guided
for the next quarter, how would you respond? How quickly would you look to step up your activity before
you feel comfortable enough, I guess, that the demand recovery is really underway? I'll leave it there.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Doug. It's another really good question. So I'll start off on the high-level macro. Obviously,
there's a lot of optimism towards recovery. At a very high macro level, fiscal policy from the administration
towards stimulus packages are being implemented. Monetary policy is at low rates. Oil prices are at low
rates for consumers, so there's a lot of optimism in recovery. My caution, however, is we are currently
in an oversupplied market. This has been a demand-driven event, both globally and in the U.S. We've
been particularly hard hit, in our view, in the Upper Midwest and then even more particularly on the West
Coast. So we're optimistic that we're starting to see that recovery. We'll have some comments -- I'll let
Tim comment on specifically at the gasoline level as far as our same-store sales, et cetera, give you a little
bit more color there. And then I'll let Brian give you a little color overall on the diesel market as well.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

So I'd say, overall, optimistically that we're seeing good signs of recovery, but we still got a long way to
go, that we're still oversupplied on pretty much crude and products across the board. So there's a lot of
inventory that needs to work off.

As far as when do you respond, obviously, the market will tell us that. So it's a demand-driven event, and
when the demand is sufficient for us to change our strategy, we'll do that. But for right now, we're staying
at minimum rates. So let me let Tim comment a little bit about what we're seeing at Speedway.

Timothy T. Griffith
President of Speedway LLC

Yes, Doug, at the retail level, as a lot of the stay-at-home orders got put in place in sort of the middle and
late part of March, we saw gas demand, which bottomed probably even more than 50% down, I mean
that was in sort of late March and early April. We've seen steady recovery since mid-April with 5% to 15%
improvement, really dependent upon the region, off of the lows. The weekly data that we're seeing in
terms of sales are supportive of that trend so far. And we expect to see continued improvement as more of
the states continue or start the reopening protocols over the next couple of months.

I mean the timing of a complete recovery is uncertain. It's really a function of how quickly these stay-at-
home orders are removed and how quickly the consumer gets back out on the roads. Obviously, we've
got a lot of businesses where people continue to work from home and they may continue through this
month. But we'll watch that activity. We've certainly seen a nice creep in demand and expect that's going
to continue. But we've got to get the commuters back on the roads, rather they're commuting to work,
rather they're taking kids to school, which we may not see until the fall, rather they're driving to locations
for vacation or elsewise, we've got to get the consumer back on the road and hopefully get some signs of
recovery.

So we're seeing some nice signs, but it's probably a few months before we can really give a better sense
for exactly how this is going to play out. But it's -- we're definitely off the lows and seeing some nice
improvement.

Brian K. Partee
Senior Vice President of Marketing

Yes. Doug, this is Brian. Just to kind of reiterate a little bit on the gasoline side and build off of what Tim
said. We have seen really the profile of the decline. It was really the last 2 weeks of March where we
really -- things clipped off very fast really across all geographies. We hit the bottom of the market. We
look week-on-week sales. We think this is the most relevant data points in the short term. So the week of
April 6 was really what we're calling kind of the bottom of the market. And over the last 3 weeks, we've
seen steady week-on-week growth. So we see that as an optimistic trend for some of the reasons Mike
indicated earlier, some of the drivers to that. So this week is starting off solid as well. But measured
optimism. This is an unprecedented event. Not exactly sure what the profile of recovery looks like, but
we're seeing positive trends.

On the distillate side, similarly, we hit the bottom of the market the week of 4/6. Very modest recovery,
though, since then. It's been less impacted. Overall, EIA call on distillate demand has been somewhere --
declined, has been somewhere in the 20% to 25%. We have not seen that across our whole book. We're
off more in the 15% range currently year-on-year. Part of that is just due to gearing. We're not really
exposed to PADD 1. So there's been -- with some of the corona depths of impact in PADD 1, we're not
really exposed to that the way maybe others are. So we're off more than 15%.

Recovery on the distillate side is really going to be tied to the broader economy. Traditionally, diesel
demand has been driven by the health of the economy. And we believe that's going to be the case coming
out of this. We're going to be watching the economic indicators we think that will drive the recovery on the
distillate side.

And our next question comes from Manav Gupta.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I have a question, a bit of a demand question. On the jet fuel side of the equation, we are seeing jet fuel
demand which is very low. And refiners are trying to compensate by blending jet more in the diesel, and
that is causing the diesel inventories to move out a little. I'm trying to understand how MPC kind of work
around this entire jet fuel situation. And is there something that can be done where you don't blend jet
fuel into the diesel causing the diesel inventory to move out?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Manav, I'm going to let Ray give you some specifics there, but I would add one comment to your question
and kind of what Doug was asking as well is I think there is some belief and we have this belief that there
could be slower recovery back into the jet world, but that may also be a little bit of a boost to gasoline
recovery as consumers kind of stay more towards vehicles as opposed to airplanes as the recovery starts
to happen. I think that's a phenomenon that we're going to see a little bit. But let me let Ray give you
some specifics on jet and diesel.

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Okay. Manav, with regards to jet fuel, we have a lot of capabilities to blend that into the diesel pool
and have done so. In cases where we have high-sulfur jet fuel, we have the ability with the excess
hydrotreating capacity, with the slowdowns, to hydrotreat that into ultra-low sulfur diesel.

I guess the thing I'd really like to communicate is it's been very fluid as far as whether distillates, strong
initially distillate products. And so we had the ability to put everything into the distillate pool, and we
really stretch the distillate pool now. We're seeing the strengthening of gasoline where we're reworking
those swing streams and pushing some back to gasoline. We've communicated in the past that our swing
between gasoline and distillate is about in the 10% range, and we've been exercising every bit of that
during the pandemic.

Our next question comes from Paul Cheng.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Mike, I want to add my belated congratulations. A couple of questions. First, on the commercial
improvement. If we look back, say, 20 years ago to your words from the commercial side, so when you're
looking at what you know about the market that maybe a while ago and how Marathon has been doing,
is there any area that you think, okay, maybe that I can change on the best package? In other words,
what is the overall -- and also that do you need to relocate the operation for the commercial to be closer
to maybe either Houston or that some of the commercial hub? And do you need a beef-up in your talent,
external talent on that operation? That's the first question.

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Paul. Yes, first of all, I mean, you hit it on the head. My personal background is more in the
commercial area and the financial area. So it's an area where I'm going to spend a lot of my early time
here. I don't want to give any real specifics, but I -- to your second question, though, we do plan to have
a bigger presence in Houston. That's something that's on our list of things that we want to accomplish. We
have not had that in the past. So Rick and his team are moving towards that. Dave already has some stuff
down in the Texas area. So I think you're going to see us, over time, develop much more of a presence
down in that area. I'm a believer that the Houston market is the center of the oil markets in the U.S.,
just like New York is the center of the financial market. So having a Houston presence, I think, is real
important for us.

As far as talent overall, it's another area that I think we're going to spend quite a bit of time looking at
where we can improve some of our talent across that area. So I guess the good news and the bad news
for my commercial team is I have a lot of background in this area. I have a lot of strong thoughts on how
to approach things. So there's going to be a good collaborative discussion about how to go about it. And
I will tell you, we started in that already. The immediate focus of what's happened with the markets as a
result of COVID has forced a lot of discussion here. So again, due to the competitive nature of it, Paul, I
can't get into a lot of specifics here. But I can tell you, as I stated earlier, it's one of my main 3 areas that
we're going to spend a lot of time on.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Maybe can I just ask that do you think historically that the team is good but perhaps that they are a bit
too conservative in their parameter, how they look at things and not changing as maybe rapidly as the
market condition change?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I was taking a second there to see what you were thinking there, Paul. I mean there are some
areas where I think we could be too conservative. There's other areas where there's different types of
opportunities. I don't really think of it overall in that regard. I think of it more in how we approach the
market, how we go about crude selection, how we view different things. I mean we recently just saw
pretty strong crude market contango, and how to take advantage of that, as an example, is some of the
discussions that we've had recently.

So I don't know if I'd use your term as the catch-all for what we're doing. I think of it more as looking at
what our assets do, how we position ourselves commercially, looking at how the markets are responding,
where product placement is best suited. So I think having maybe a little bit more quick flexibility and
reacting to markets quickly. If you're using that term to be conservative, then maybe I agree with that
from that perspective. But I just think I use the word being more dynamic, more flexible, more able to
adapt to market conditions quicker, and then overall, just having much more focus on what we're doing
commercially to support the assets that we have in place.

And I will tell you, one of the things that -- as a result of this COVID situation, we were having daily
meetings on what was occurring in the marketplace and how we should be responding to that. And that's
just one example of what the new environment will be going forward.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And the second question is for Don. Don, on the working capital management, if we look at your 2
major competitors, Phillips 66 and Valero, they're facing the same -- similar situation, and Valero, their
refining operation is probably pretty similar size to yours. But that the negative impact, at least for this
quarter, on the cash flow from working capital is substantially less, roughly one is about half and the other
one is far less than half of your impact. So can you maybe elaborate a little bit in terms of how perhaps

13

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

that you guys manage differently than your peers, if there's any difference? Or is there any room for
improvement so that we will be able to perhaps minimize the working capital swing a bit more?

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Paul. I mean, I guess the working capital changes are really a function of, for us, 3 primary things:
our accounts receivable, our inventory position and then our accounts payable position. And there's lots of
sort of moving pieces that impact each of those 3 components. What I did try to do was to give you a rule
of thumb so that you all could model changes in our business. I don't have sort of particular insight into
what the amount of crude volume is in our competitors' payables and what the amount of refined product
sales are in their receivables. But what I can tell you, for us, during the quarter, accounts receivable went
down -- for the first quarter, went down about $1.9 billion, so that was a source of cash for us, receivables
went down. Accounts payable went down about $2.5 billion in the quarter, and that was obviously a use
of cash. And then our inventories, because we're trying to manage inventory appropriately and to capture
contango in the market and those type of things, our inventories were up about $400 million. So the
combination of sort of $1.9 billion on the accounts receivable side and then the inventory and AP move
had a negative working capital impact of about $2 billion.

We are also seeing some of that. And I think we've articulated, we would have seen some of that continue
in April where we started buying less crude volume. So to support a 3 billion -- or I'm sorry, 3 million
barrel a day system in the first quarter, we're basically now supporting a 2 million barrel a day system.
So in April, you would have seen crude purchases going down from a volume perspective, but as we start
to ramp up, you should see the inverse of that, right? We will be moving upwards. We'll be buying more
crude. And at least recently, crude prices have started to increase as well, so that should also have a
favorable impact on working capital.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Just a quick side question that with a new CEO, is there any plan to look at the accounting policy for
turnaround expenses to capitalize it?

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Mike's shaking his head. I mean we've looked at that. I guess what we wanted to do, Paul, is we did
provide -- going back about a year now, we did try to provide information that was pulling out the
turnaround costs so that you could look at sort of our adjusted EBITDA on a comparable or like-to-like
basis. But some of our peers still actually expense it and some of our peers obviously capitalize it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Roger Read.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess I'd like to get into a little bit of maybe the forward-looking side, the refining restarts, particularly,
obviously, Martinez and Gallup. As we think about the OpEx and the CapEx guidance, is that built in
there for, say, a Q3 restart? Or should we presume that, that's out until '21 and then we'll have some
[indiscernible] on some of the CapEx, OpEx side?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

So Roger, it's Mike. I'll start off and then I'll turn it over to Ray. One of the things that I think everybody
realizes is the different regions have been hit harder or less to some extent, depending on where you are.
I mean we've been particularly hard hit on the West Coast. If you look at our guidance, we're at minimum
across the system. But in the West Coast system, we're running at about 50% of capacity as opposed to

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

the roughly 66%, 67%-ish overall. So the West Coast demand drop was even more severe than, I'll say,
the whole national average, which led us to take more action on the West Coast, specifically in that area.
So let me turn it over to Ray to give you a little more color on both Gallup and Martinez.

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

As far as Gallup and Martinez, your question as far as the guidance, does it take into account the cost
of Gallup and Martinez, and the short answer is yes, that it does. We chose to idle our 2 higher-cost
refineries and make up that production and resupply with lower-cost facilities. And all the cost impacts,
variable and fixed, are taken into account in that.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes, I understand in terms of the Q2 guidance. I guess I was just curious on a full year -- a restart of
those units, is that also included or does the guidance presume that those assets are off-line for all of
2020? That's what I was kind of getting at. In other words, we are seeing a recovery off of coronavirus.
And as we look to the latter part of the year, right, the expectation would be we get very close to kind of
normal levels, at least enough, I would think, gets both those units back online. So I was just curious, is
that included in the guidance? Then I had one follow-up question, please.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Roger, this is Mike. So yes, we stated that those assets are idled on a temporary basis, and we'll have to
see when the market requires them to come back online. I think the question you were asking, though,
is we don't see significant costs at all to bring those back up. I mean Ray has them on hot standby. So I'll
let him comment on that. So we are prepared to bring those back online when the demand in the market
requires it. We just, in the short term, have seen some recovery, as Tim and Brian had alluded to earlier,
but we still have a ways to go before we would be needing that asset, so to speak.

Raymond L. Brooks
Executive Vice President of Refining

Yes, Roger. Taking both those refineries down, Gallup and Martinez, is not dissimilar from a hurricane
standpoint. When we take one of our refineries down, we take them down sequentially. We keep the
utility systems going. We keep -- there are still operators and maintenance personnel looking after the
equipment. So we would see a restart being fairly easy done within the time period of about a week and
not a significant cost impact.

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Roger, this is Don. Sort of one other point. Achieving those capital cuts and those operating expense cuts
does not require those refineries to be idled for the rest of the year. I think maybe that was the way you're
asking the question. I mean we assume that those will come back online. And so our OpEx numbers and
our CapEx numbers assume we're operating at more normal levels as the year progresses.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. Yes, I was just trying to understand within the OpEx cut guidance, obviously, the
CapEx cut guidance and the other parts. And then maybe slipping back to the kind of strategy -- strategic
question a lot of guys have tried to get at here on the call. Mike, as you look at the company, do you
expect to do or are you already doing like a large sort of, call it, a benchmarking survey of everything that
Marathon does or doesn't do and how well it does it or it doesn't do it at all as you think about the 2021
and on version of Marathon, presumably separated from retail, as I think we all expect?

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Yes, Roger. So we started in that analysis. And obviously, I've been part of the Marathon team for a while
here, so I have my own initial thoughts. The only caveat I would give you, though, is in the 45 days or
so that I've had the helm, most of our time and most of the whole senior team's time has been dedicated
to the near-term situation. So hopefully, we'll get back to normal in the health situation as far as the
country and also as far as the economy and get back to normal. But yes, we've started into the process.
But I would also tell you that a lot of the time recently has been dedicated to the near-in situation. So
start it, more to come and I hope to disclose more as time goes by. But I don't want to kid you that the
opportunity has been limited because of the near-term situation and our focus on trying to respond to the
pandemic.

Operator

Our next question comes from Phil Gresh.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question, just on the balance sheet, Don. You talked about the target of having investment-grade
credit rating. Obviously, some of the rating agencies have put out some of their own metrics that they're
looking at. We have the Speedway spin-off here that is still planned. And I'm just wondering about how
that spin-off and the distribution you might get from that spin-off would help you achieve the investment-
grade rating long term -- or not achieve, but maintain it long term in light of the downturn we're going
through? And just more broadly, are there other levers that you think you can pull to ensure that you
maintain it through this down cycle?

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Phil, I guess I wanted to recommit to we want to defend our investment-grade credit profile, and we'll
continue to defend that. I think Mike mentioned in the discussions around Speedway, one of the important
things around the timing of the Speedway separation is our ability to capitalize Speedway and to be able
to have a balance sheet at Speedway that allows them to -- they're going to take on some leverage, and
that leverage will then result in cash at Speedway, which will be distributed back up to MPC. And when
they distribute that cash back up to MPC, we would expect that distribution would be on a tax-free basis,
and we would expect that we would be utilizing all of that cash to manage the balance sheet. It would
either be putting cash on the balance sheet to sort of support our core liquidity position.

So historically, we've maintained about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet in addition to the revolving
credit facilities that we've had. And I think we articulated when we announced the Speedway separation
that we thought that requirement would probably be closer to $2 billion versus $1 billion. We'll obviously
relook at sort of core liquidity in total given all the events that have transpired over the last 30 days to
make sure -- or 45 days to make sure that we're fully evaluating downside risk to the company. And then
the incremental amounts would be used to pay down debt.

It's one of the reasons why we had some debt maturities. We have $650 million of debt maturity at the
end of this year in December, and we had $1 billion of MPC debt maturity in the first quarter of 2021. And
we were planning on having those -- that debt mature and didn't try to extend it previously because we
wanted the capability to be able to pay off debt at MPC without incurring any incremental cost to do that.
So the timing of those maturities was really aligned with or coincident with Speedway transaction.

We did go out into the market in the end of April and issued senior notes. Once again, we were very
focused on shorter tenor notes, so 3 years and 5 years. There was some demand for 10 years, but we
didn't really want to get into the 10-year market. That felt like that was structural debt. We wanted to put
on -- we are basically, if you will, allowing ourselves the flexibility to have shorter-term debt, allows us to
pay it off and allows us to manage our balance sheet without incurring significant incremental costs.

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. I guess just the follow-up would be, just as I was referencing, other levers that you might
be able to pull just to continue to lower debt balances, whether it's at the parent level or at a consolidated
level. So how do you generally think about the distributions, whether it's the MPC dividend, the MPLX
distributions and the priority of maintaining lower leverage moving forward, particularly if we're going to
lose $1.5 billion of EBITDA from Speedway?

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

Phil, this is Mike. On dividend policy, first off, as you know, it's a Board decision and we had some very
robust discussion about it. We think about this in the long term and how do we see the business as far
as mid-cycle earnings and how we see the business in the long term. We obviously decided we wouldn't
want to make a major change in return on capital on what hopefully is a very short-term issue. So our
discussion led to our highest priority was defending liquidity, as Don said, and defending our investment-
grade rating. That was very important to us.

And I would just comment that we went into this event, if you want to call it that, with a little under $7
billion of liquidity. And now we've taken the working capital pain with the reduction in crude price, et
cetera. And as Don stated in his remarks, we're sitting here at about that very same level. So we still have
a lot of liquidity going forward. As far as recovery in the business, hopefully, it will be sooner rather than
later. I think you're hearing from our team, there's cautious optimism that we could be coming back. Yet
at the same time, as Tim mentioned, we're still pretty far down year-on-year on gasoline demand, but
we'll have to see how that recovers.

But overall, our return of capital is something that we obviously think is really important. I mentioned
earlier, I think this is, to a large extent, Refining is a return of capital business. So we'll have a lot of
discussion with the Board as to how that plays out going forward.

Donald C. Templin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Phil, I might also add, this is Don, on the working capital side. Given sort of the low volumes that
we're -- or the low utilization rates we're at and the lower crude prices, it is really, I'll call it, asymmetric
opportunity now. We would expect that working capital will be a source of cash going forward as prices
improve and as volumes pick up as opposed to the significant use of cash over the last 60 days.

Operator

Our next question comes from Prashant Rao.

Prashant Raghavendra Rao
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Mike, congratulations. Appreciate everything you outlined at the beginning there in terms of the 3 areas
of early focus. It's very helpful. My question is on -- really on return on invested capital expectations here.
First, on the remaining 2020 investments after these CapEx reductions, is it fair to assume that these
are probably toward the higher end of the range of clearing hurdle rates or on an NPV basis versus what
you've deferred? That's sort of more of a housekeeping question, I suppose.

But bigger picture then, the second question. Given this macro shock, the potential for strategic value
realization at Marathon, the overall portfolios you outlined and your early areas of focus here, could you
help us out with your thoughts on hurdle rates for capital projects, how they change going forward at all
and how that might be -- you're talking about every dollar earning, its return that's invested. I sort of
wanted to think about that in terms of the various end markets that you're in, the segments and what that
means for thinking about maybe putting higher hurdle rates on certain types of projects or in certain end
market exposures.

17

MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Yes, Prashant, I think the easy answer to your first question is yes. And then to your second point, yes,
the approach that I believe is, especially in this type of business which is very volatile, and when you
invest capital, you're investing for a very long time. So I think using the word strict discipline is the best
way to describe it. I stress test in general. How do we think about investing capital if X occurs or if Y
occurs? And my own personal bias is because it's a refining business that's very cyclical and there are
downturns, you got to make sure that you're still getting a good return even if you're having a down cycle,
so to speak.

So overall, I think without giving you a specific number, yes, we will be stress testing or, in your terms,
raising the hurdle rate to make sure that the investment that we do is very long-lasting and it's going
to guarantee us a good return. So in general, that will translate to a higher hurdle, yes. Without giving
you a number, I would say, yes, that's correct. And I think you're going to just see us have a lot more
robust discussion on the strategic nature of where we invest and guaranteeing ourselves that it's long-
term investment and convincing ourselves that it's a good use of capital. I mean, at the end of the day,
we're stewards of the shareholders' capital, and that's one of the most important things we can control.

I mean in our business -- and I know you guys often ask a lot of questions about our views on things that
we don't control, and we're happy to give you our views but I try to spend a lot more time on the things
we do control, and obviously have an opinion of things that we don't control as far as market conditions,
et cetera, et cetera, but really spend as much time as we can on the things that we actually control and
having discipline about how we spend that money, whether it's organic capital, whether it's M&A, whether
it's expense dollars, et cetera, et cetera, I think all of those deserve a lot of attention, and that's part of
what we'll focus going forward on.

Prashant Raghavendra Rao
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

That's very helpful. And my quick follow-up is really on the improving gasoline cracks that we're seeing
on the screen and sort of the sequential, I guess I use the term measured optimism, I like that, on the
product demand side. Just for -- our purpose is to help understand, given lower -- the low utilization
rates and also crude differential volatility, what are the impacts -- this is kind of unprecedented here, but
is capture impacted? Is it -- should we be thinking about some -- maybe taking a grain of salt in terms
of dislocations versus what you're able to capture on a realized basis versus what we're seeing on the
screen? Either way, either that you overcapture or undercapture, but just sort of trying to reconcile that
because we all kind of have an idea of what we do in more normal times, but these are obviously sort of
3-sigma type of period we're in right now. So I just wanted to sort of get your thoughts around that.

Michael J. Hennigan
President, CEO & Director

I'll give a couple of thoughts. One is -- and we did the term of cautious optimism that we're seeing some
recovery. But I also try and balance that with the overall inventories, we still have -- I don't know what the
exact number is, Dave can jump in, maybe 30 million barrels of light products, gasoline and distillate that
are over the long-term average. We're still sitting on roughly 50 million barrels of crude over that same
long-term average.

So even though I think we're seeing demand start to recover, I still think we have a ways to go to get back
to some closer-to-normal inventory levels and normal demand levels. So I think that's just going to play
itself out. Again, that falls into the category of something we don't control. We'll try and keep an eye on
the demand. We do have some insights from our marketing view, and we'll try and match the supply of
our products into those demands. And then we're always going to try and be opportunistic to find the best
market or the best region to optimize our system.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I guess that was a good segue into asking about another thing that you can't control. So I'm curious
about just the inland differentials that we're seeing now. Obviously, in late March and early April, we saw
these very wide differentials. Now as the shut-ins have started to increase, we're seeing relatively narrow
differentials, especially for WCS. So can you give your outlook on that? And any thoughts about how
sustainable it is if sort of the inland cracks aren't increasing at the same time?

Rick D. Hessling
Senior Vice President of Crude Oil Supply & Logistics

Yes. This is Rick Hessling. On inland differentials, you're spot on. We have seen incredible volatility,
literally from one end of the spectrum to the other. Right now, what you're seeing in the marketplace
is you're seeing the free market work. You're seeing North American producers and specifically U.S.
producers, Canadian producers, self-regulating, if you will, and it's affecting the differentials. However,
they've come in, they've swung the other way here in the last 3, 4 weeks versus blowing out 30 days ago.

I think the offset, honestly, will be as the states come out of shut-ins and demand increases, you'll see
some more volatility there. So predicting where they go is difficult. A lot of it is demand-driven. A lot of
it is producer cut-driven. So I would tell you, though, when you look at the Mid-Con specifically, Brad, it's
very tight. Inventories at Cushing are extremely high as that's well publicized, almost at maximum. So
I think you're going to continue to see incredible volatility in the Mid-Con, which we will be able to take
advantage of.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then as my follow-up, just a question about the asphalt market. So typically, when we have
flat price this low, asphalt is a much greater contributor to profitability than it would normally be. Is that
the case right now? And can you talk about how the demand side looks? Obviously, we have these COVID
impacts, but I would imagine maybe some governments are taking advantage of this to do more road
repairs than they normally would.

Brian K. Partee
Senior Vice President of Marketing

Yes. Brad, this is Brian Partee. Yes. So currently, asphalt, if you look at the inventories, we've been
towards the higher side in inventories. Part of that had to do with coming out of IMO in the first quarter.
But the work log is out there. We're seeing it -- we're seeing the demand starting to pick up as we head
into the season here. I don't know that asphalt has an outsized contribution at this point relative to overall
contribution. We have seen steady -- the benchmark we look at when we think about the asphalt market
is asphalt prices relative to TI, and we've been selling over TI consistently, which is fairly typical in a down
market.

So from a pricing standpoint, we're happy with where things are at. The work is starting to pick up. The
watch out or focus really on the asphalt demand is going to be really taxes and access to funding at
the local levels and cuts in discretionary spending. And it's uncertain whether we see that or not. That's
unfolding as we speak. But working with our customers, the backlog is there. They're ready to go to work.
We're starting to see it pick up. So I guess it falls into the measured optimism similar to what I said on the
distillate side of things. But that's kind of where we sit today on the asphalt market.

Kristina Anna Kazarian
