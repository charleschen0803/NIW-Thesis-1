Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Good morning, everyone. We delivered fourth quarter revenue slightly above our guidance range
on strengths in the U.S. market and new products. The global market economic backdrop, and the
competitive landscape in China was the main challenge. However, we are responding with product cost
reductions in differentiated new features and accessories for our core products. Furthermore, we're
leveraging one of our largest R&D investments in the laser industry to launch leading-edge laser products
and systems for new markets. This new solution, which represent about 1/5 of total sales enhance our
growth and margin profile and provide greater geographic and end-market diversification.

Also weaker microeconomic trends have reduced demand for our core product in the near term. We
introduced new lasers and new features that enhance productivity and flexibility for the industry.

In 2019, we saw a record number of high-powered lasers, increasing sales of sources at 1 kilowatt and
greater by near 23% in total, up to 14,500 units. These numbers include sales growth of laser with power
of 1 to 4-kilowatt of YLR type by 60%, and ultrahigh power laser of -- at 10-kilowatt and greater by more
than 25%. However, this extremely impressive growth did not compensate our revenue losses caused by
very aggressive artificial stimulated growth of fiber with the power price in Chinese market. It's absolutely
unfair competition. It's -- but it's -- obviously a different talk.

Multiple IPG customers are launching new cutting systems using our 12-kilowatt cutting applications
eightfold. Many of these are sold with our new ultra high power cutting sets. In addition, we sold our first
laser with high peak power and adjustable mode beam capability. HPP products delivered peak energy,

twice the average power of the laser, increasing cutting speed and quality by reducing scrap through
converter nesting of parts. Our -- a new AMB laser permit the broadest range of beam tunability, enabling
spatterless welding and enhancing the speed of electrical vehicle battery production. When combined
with our unique high-power pulse laser for foil cutting and ultra-high power CW laser for welding, we see
significant opportunity in the electric vehicle battery market this year.

Our fiber laser increased customer return on investment by delivering the industry highest power wall-
plug efficiency and reliability along with industry-leading beam quality. Competitors' laser often struggle to
maintain power even after only several hundred hours of operation. IPG lasers deliver peace of mind and
lower lifetime cost, while enhancing end user productivity. IPG also offers the highest brightness through
50-micron core diameter fiber, providing our customers with more than 70% higher productivity in cutting
thin metal versus -- which is a competitive -- a competing laser in 100 micron fiber. Augmenting our laser
solution with high-power optical head is a key differentiator versus our laser competitors.

In 2019, we delivered very good sales of optical heads and other beam delivery accessories, growing
sales of this product by 10%. We also shipped our first volume order for LDD process monitoring, our
patented real-time welding monitoring solution. LDD enables greater use of laser-based welding in
automated production environments, and we are pursuing multiple million dollar plus opportunities with
this technology and associated laser product sales. We sold a record number of systems for material
growth sales in 2019 with the revenue increasing 33%, excluding Genesis, which we acquired in December
2018. Standard and custom systems for vehicle and battery production, medical device manufacturing,
pipe welding, cleaning and inspection application drove systems growth. We plan to leverage Genesis'
unique expertise in robotic system integration to accelerate laser processing within the transportation,
aerospace and industrial end markets.

Product innovation remains core for IPG success. But in 2018, new product sales were 19% of total
revenue and 24% in the fourth quarter alone. Sales of green pulse lasers, used to improve solar cell
efficiency increased by more than 60% in 2018. Sales of ultrafast pulse lasers increased more than 80%
year-over-year off a small base, with more than 50 new projects for these lasers across a wide range
of applications as processing glass, ceramic, circuit boards, OLED film, batteries and solar cells. As we
enhance the pulse energy, expand the portfolio of new green ultraviolet and ultrafast pulse lasers, we
expect revenue of these products to grow rapidly over the coming years and become a more meaningful
percentage of total sales.

Sales of medical laser increased 80% in 2019, as our thulium laser solution received approval in China and
the U.S. We expect sales into urology and other soft tissue applications to ramp over the coming years off
a low base. Our medical laser business model include consumable fibers, a continuing revenue stream that
benefits as the number of installed system increase.

Sales of our RGB Luminaire Laser System for cinema application increased more than 100% in 2018. We
continue to invest in transformative new products within new application areas as well, including new
medical treatments, mid-infrared lasers for spectroscopy, inspection and sensing application and ultra-
high power single-mode laser for aerospace and defense. We will rely on our core scientific strengths and
strong cash flow to optimize investment in strategic initiatives critical to the long-term success of the
company. The initiatives include a greater mix of high-power laser, along with differentiated features and
solutions in new markets and applications. We expect to grow faster for these new product areas, enabling
IPG to deliver strong growth in revenue and cash flow. I want to thank our talented employees for their
hard work during the challenging year. As ever, I remain confident in IPG's ability to execute during this
period, delivering on our mission to make our fiber laser technology the tool of choice in mass production.

Finally, I will Dr. Eugene Scherbakov, IPG's Chief Operating Officer, to participate in our earnings calls.
As many you know, Eugene is a long-serving member of IPG's executive leadership team with extensive
operational and technical knowledge of our business. He will be able to provide you with additional insights
into IPG's operational performance during this quarter.

With that, I will turn the call over to Eugene.

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Thank you, Valentin, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you today and on future calls to
discuss the operational trends in our business.

IPG remains the clear market leader in fiber laser with hundreds of megawatts of installed capacity. In
2019, we shipped 52 megawatts of total optical power, increasing 14% year-over-year. We continue to
see aggressive prices among China-based competition, which intensified toward to the end of the second
quarter last year. Since that time, pricing has been more stable, and for the year, the decline of average
price per kilowatt has affected the dollar value of units sold. But our ability to rapidly reduce cost has
limited the gross margin impact from these price reductions.

Our team is focused on further cost reduction throughout the manufacturing process that we believe will
significantly reduce the cost of our high-power laser solutions from 1 up to 6 kilowatts, which accounts
for a majority of our high-power units sold. When combined with the full benefit of the cost actions we
undertook in the second half of 2019, we believe that these measures will help us sustain our industry-
leading margin profile and cash returns. We will continue to manage our cost structure to business
environment, targeting gross margin of 45% up to 50%. Excluding inventory provisions, we were at the
bottom of this region -- range during the fourth quarter. We executed well in controlling manufacturing
expenses, decreasing them by more than 10% from third quarter. This benefit was mostly offset by a
reduction of costs absorbed into inventory business lower production level. However, this enabled us
to generate cash from inventory as the reduction in the value of inventory on hand was greater than
inventory provisions.

Examining our performance by region, revenue in China decreased 21% year-over-year and represented
approximately 30% of our total sales. As we had expected, performance was impacted by weaker demand
due to the U.S.-China trade conflict, slowdown in capital investment and greater than average price
declines.

In Europe, revenue decreased 17% year-over-year. The demand environment in Europe remains very
challenging as the key macroeconomic indicators remain weak in the region. Revenue in North America
increased 30% year-over-year driven by acquisition of Genesis. Excluding Genesis sales, North America
increased 23% year-over-year with strong growth in welding, surgical and communications applications.
Our growth in North America is a testament to our diversified portfolio strategy where increasing adoption
of our beam-delivered accessories, and complete laser solution was augmented by growth in advanced
applications, communications and medical laser products.

Sales in Japan decreased 37% year-over-year. Similar to Europe, the macro economy in Japan remains
weak. However, we continue to work in -- of a number of substantial laser welding project in the region.

Sales in Korea increased 2% year-over-year on strength and battery welding. And sales in Turkey
decreased 80% year-over-year given macroeconomic pressures affecting cutting business in the region.

With that, I will turn the call over to Tim to discuss financial highlights in the quarter.

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Eugene, and good morning, everyone. Revenue in the fourth quarter declined 7% year-over-
year to $307 million. Revenue from materials processing applications decreased 11% year-over-year, and
revenue from other applications increased 42%. Sales of high-power CW lasers decreased 15% year-over-
year, and represented approximately 51% of total revenue. Reduced revenue from high-power CW lasers
in cutting and welding was partially offset by strength in other materials processing applications. Pulsed
laser sales decreased 33% year-over-year, with growth in green and ultraviolet pulsed lasers offset by
lower sales of pulsed lasers for marking and fine processing applications. System sales increased 69%
year-over-year, including Genesis, and increased 43% year-over-year, excluding Genesis. Medium-power
laser sales decreased 32% on softness in additive manufacturing and the transition to kilowatt-scale lasers
in cutting, while QCW sales increased 14% year-over-year. Other product sales increased 6% year-over-
year driven by growth in beam delivery accessories and service revenue. For the full year 2019, revenue

declined 10% year-over-year and 10% on an organic constant currency basis. Q4 GAAP gross margin was
40.5%, which declined 1,000 basis points year-over-year. Excluding higher inventory reserves, Q4 gross
margin would have been 45.2%, and normalizing for a full bonus accrual, gross margin would have been
44.1%. Compared with the year-ago period, higher inventory reserves reduced gross margin by 570 basis
points, less favorable absorption of manufacturing expenses reduced gross margin by 250 basis points,
and the acquisition of Genesis reduced gross margin by 180 basis points.

Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $243,000, and operating margin was 0.1%. Excluding higher
inventory reserves, foreign exchange and charges related to asset impairment and restructuring, Q4
operating margin would have been 20.9%. And normalizing for a full bonus accrual, operating margin
would have been 17.8%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter expenses did not include an accrual for
employee bonuses because of 2019 underperformance relative to our budget. For modeling purposes,
you should assume quarterly bonus expense of approximately $4 million in cost of sales, and $5 million
operating expenses in 2020.

Net loss was $4 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Higher inventory reserves and charges related to
impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets and restructuring reduced EPS by $0.99. In addition,
foreign exchange losses reduced EPS by a further $0.08, and discrete tax items benefited EPS by $0.08
as well. If exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar had been the same as 1 year ago, we would have
expected revenue to be $4 million higher and gross profit to be $2 million higher. The effective tax rate
in the quarter was 245%. The effective tax rate was increased by nondeductible charges related to
impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets and restructuring and decreased by certain discrete
benefits in the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding these effects, the underlying fourth quarter tax
rate was approximately 27%.

We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.18 billion, and
total debt of $42 million. More than 60% of our cash is held in the U.S. with most of the remaining cash
balance in Germany. Effective operational execution resulted in cash provided by operations of $130
million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $26 million in the quarter, and $134 million for the
year versus our revised target of less than $150 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 105,000
shares for $15 million. For the full year 2019, we repurchased $41 million worth of stock and have $84
million remaining on our current buyback authorization. We ended the year with $285 million of shippable
backlog, down 16% year-over-year, and total backlog, including frame agreements of $693 million, down
3% year-over-year. Fourth quarter book-to-bill was 1, in line with normal seasonality.

Turning to guidance. We believe we have significant long-term growth opportunities in laser welding,
fine processing, electric vehicle batteries and our portfolio of new products addressing opportunities in
micro-processing, medical systems and beam delivery solutions. Current demand for our leading-edge
laser solutions remains mixed, with strength in North America and emerging regions, such as India and
Southeast Asia offset by ongoing macro softness in Europe and Japan. Prior to the government-extended
Lunar New Year holiday, there were signs that business in China was firming, with order flow having picked
up in December and January. However, ongoing business disruption related to the novel coronavirus
outbreak makes forecasting our business in China and the impact on global demand very challenging at
this point. China is a large and important market for IPG with repercussions for other markets, and we
continue to monitor the situation closely.

For the first quarter of 2020, IPG expects revenue of $220 million to $250 million. The company expects
the first quarter tax rate to be approximately 26%. IPG anticipates delivering earnings per diluted share in
the range of $0.00 to $0.30, with 52.9 million basic common shares outstanding and 53.6 million diluted
common shares outstanding. This guidance assumes approximately $45 million in reduced revenue and
$0.45 lower EPS from business disruption related to the novel coronavirus outbreak. This estimate is
based upon the facts and understandings we have at this time.

As discussed in the safe harbor passage of today's earnings press release, actual results may differ from
our guidance due to factors, including, but not limited to, goodwill and other impairment charges, product
demand, order cancellation and delays, competition, tariffs, trade policies, health epidemics and general
economic conditions. Our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations, assumes

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of John Marchetti of Stifel.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I was hoping we could just spend a minute on some of the commentary that you talked about seeing some
strength in the order book, obviously, in December and January, out of China. Recognizing that, that's
likely very much up in the air right now given everything that's going on there, but just hoping you could
spend a couple of minutes talking about where you were seeing some of that strength. And then maybe as
we look out a little bit further into 2020, you may be looking around, maybe geographically, where you see
some of the bright spots and some of the risk points ex-China as we go through the year?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

I think there's been a general pickup in demand in China in terms of order flow, a little bit, we saw that
in December. It helped the book-to-bill equal 1. And then certainly, in January before the Lunar New Year
and the Coronavirus disruptions, the order flow in China has really been pretty positive across OEMs for
cutting applications. I haven't had a chance to look at the detail of where that was really coming from yet,
but we've looked at the total number, so we'd have to pass that through in a bit more detail. But it was
certainly a good start to the year, and we're showing significantly better tone than we've seen over the
previous 4 or 5 months.

In terms of the rest of the geographic regions, I mean, we look at the same macroeconomic data that
you would, and we continue to see that the underlying strength in the local economies is largely driven
by strength in the U.S., which continues to hold up well. Sentiment perhaps isn't quite as strong as it was
a year ago, but we've also got the benefit in the U.S. with a much more diverse product line with new
applications coming on-stream, referenced some of the cinema and medical opportunities are expected
to grow very strongly. So I think the U.S. is a reflection of where we'd like to see the whole business flow
globally with that diversification. Some of the medical will also -- we were selling some of the medical
lasers, for example, in India and China. Starting to sell them in China, so that should be a bit of a benefit
there.

I'd say, globally, Europe looks more -- at least it was looking a lot more stable, and order flow in Europe
at the beginning of the year has been reasonable. Europe is obviously a key. They rely on a lot of
export-driven industries, so it's going to be interesting to see whether some of the impact to China,
which is really uncertain at the moment, offsets some of the stabilization, if not even a bit of strength
in Europe. I was quite pleased to see where European order flow had been in the first 6 weeks of the
quarter. Japan remains weak, but orders in January were reasonable there. Korea was reasonable. I think
macroeconomic-wise, Japan is the other weak area at the moment.

Operator

Our next questions comes from the line of Tom Diffely of D.A. Davidson.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

So I was curious on the orders that picked up in December and early January. Have you since seen those
quarters pushed out or canceled? Or is it just a lack of new orders filling the void?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

We haven't had -- I mean, in relation to the shutdown, Tom, over the last 2 weeks in China?

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Correct. Yes.

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

So no, we just don't have any indication of whether they're just going to be pushed out or delayed and
taken later. It's a very fluid and changing situation with people back in our major offices only on Monday.
So we don't know whether it's going to lead to a big pickup in Q2 because demand recovers or whether it
is a permanent push out for the year. We also have not had any orders canceled, and the general theory
-- I mean, one of the comments from our general manager in China is that people are keen to get back
to work to offset the losses they're incurring. Whether that can happen or not is an open question, right?
This is a very changing situation. Even overnight, there's a bit more negativity around the way they're
diagnosing the virus, and certainly, that's having an impact on the U.S. market today and Europe. So it's
just such a changeable situation. It's not really possible to give you anything more definitive than the
estimates we've made as of today.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. And that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, just a little bit more maybe on the battery, the auto
battery market, what type or size of laser is used in that space? And what do you think the long-term
prospects are from a market point of view?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

There's a wide variety of lasers used in battery processes. Dr. Scherbakov knows a lot about this. So he'll
cover some of that.

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Yes, there is a different kind of applications for battery. Battery welding is one of the applications. The
second one, it's weldings -- also case for battery. And for these applications, our customers using different
kind of lasers. But the last lasers we should supply to our existing and some potential customer, with these
options, ABB, MBB options, adjustable mode beam diameter. And the first result demonstrates a very
good result. Just experiments demonstrates very good results. And from this point of view, we see a good
future for our high-power lasers, first of all.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

For us, growing demand for thin foil cutting, I would say, it's very special, very super high-speed cutting,
and they use our green laser now, I would say, a special fiber product will require, but so when we will
meet this requirement. But it's a real fast growing business. And also system business for automation of
the production of battery production, also, we're talking with some major Tier 1 players in this market.

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

And also important that such kind of battery are now using the different automotive customers. And for
example, we received a very big -- enough orders for other lasers, and together, with our online monitor,
produced by LDD. In this case, it's very important applications, and we see that also big interest in for
such kind of combinations. I mean our lasers, online monitor, welding monitor, especially for battery
production.

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

And then Tom, the other part of your question was, this is -- continues to be a decades long -- a decade-
long -- decades, perhaps, long investment cycle. It's really the transition to electric vehicles is going to
happen in the volumes that everyone is expecting. If you're going to get to 25% or 30% of vehicles,
there's probably over $1 billion of laser-based investment that's required over a 10-year period. So that
still hasn't changed at all at this point in time.

Operator

Our next questions come from the line of Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

So one of the things that I was kind of struck by in the quarter was the strength you're seeing in the ultra-
high power segment of the market. And so what does that reflect, just this shift in demand within China to
move at an accelerating pace to ultra-high power?

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Of course, there are some trends, first of all, in China, because in China, this customer, much more flexible
in comparison to the other countries. And some of these customers already used our, for example, 20-
kilowatt laser for cutting applications. They produce special machines. But for us, it's much also very
interesting because we are not supplying on the lasers, it's supplying our optical heads for these high
power lasers. And in this combination, there is also special produced fiber, we can generate a good
revenue. But also some customers now start to ask about 35-kilowatt laser for cutting applications. And
such kind of trends also we saw in Japan and with some delay also in Europe.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And Tim, if I may. Just with respect to the Q1 guidance, I assume there's going to be a
considerable headwind from underutilization impacting gross margins in Q1. Is there any way to think
about gross margins in the near term?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, unfortunately, this quarter is probably one of the most difficult quarters that we will have
had since 2009. So the gross margin that we're factoring in, in that guidance is below to 40%. We're
using operating expenses that will be a bit higher than they were in Q4 in the sort of $76 million to $78
million. If you exclude the impact related to the reduction in demand for China, gross margin would have
been closer to the 45%. It would have been slightly below at the top end of the range, 45%. And at the
bottom end of the Q1 range, it would have been about 40%. So Q1, even if you add back in the impact
of coronavirus, it was obviously going to be a difficult quarter for us. We would have expected that, if the
order trends had held up, to really transition into a stronger Q2 based upon what we'd seen on order flow.
So it is a difficult Q1, and probably, as I said, one of the more difficult quarters we've had for the last 10
years in that context.

James Andrew Ricchiuti

Got it. And last question for me is just with respect to the U.S. business, ex-Genesis, was there anything
unusual in terms of larger pieces of business that contributed to that growth?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

There were some battery welding projects we talked about that went into -- ultimate custom was
a European automotive entity, that was a nice order that we took. It was with the LDD that Eugene

mentioned. U.S., generally, we'll see a pickup into Q4, right? So you had that benefit in a similar way that
we had it before. That was probably the largest single order I can reference. You had some benefit coming
from a pickup in medical, but that's going to carry on. We've already got a significant large order that
was booked in January for the medical business for this year. Those are the 2 things I can think of. We
had a 100-kilowatt laser order in the U.S. that didn't actually ship, it's going to ship in January. And one
of the other benefits, by the way, on the ultra-high power was the -- talking about the overall ultra-high
power, the 120-kilowatt in Germany, by the way, did ship. So that benefited some of the ultra-high power
numbers as well.

The next question is coming from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Michael J. Feniger
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just first off, Tim, could you just help us? I know you talked about order flows picking up in December and
January. Obviously, it's difficult to forecast. I'm just -- is that something that you sequentially see? Can
you help us understand what gave you comfortability there to -- I know it's reassuring that order flows
were firming. I'm just curious, is that like how we -- is that seasonally just how the business typically
trends? Or did you feel like there was actually some pickup more than seasonality, given the depressed
markets before that?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

That's an interesting question. Normally, January is a weak month for order flow. In the last 2 years, so
the beginning of '18, coming off a depressed -- sorry, the beginning of '19, coming off a depressed end
to '18, we also had quite strong order flow in January in China and other areas. That drove the overall
strength in the business in the first half of last year, which then obviously tailed off when you got to the
end of June. So you saw a similar strength, if not even a bit more positive, I think, than last year overall
in the first few weeks of this year. Honestly, you're latching on a little bit to this positivity or we are --
you want to see those trends carry on. We want to see those trends carry on through Q1 and into Q2,
and we wouldn't want to see, obviously, a slowdown halfway through the year. We want to maintain this
momentum, but the general tone was pretty good.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Specifically this January, we have absolutely a record order flow, much higher than any other before. But
what fourth quarter was a practical [stock order] in total. We expect that January would be a way bigger
[plus] order compared to any other years.

Michael J. Feniger
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

That's helpful. And just, if I understand, Q1 is difficult just with the cost savings that's occurring now,
we can all try to have our own forecast on the macro. But with how you're managing the business, just
with the cost savings you're trying to achieve, if we see a revenue base of $350 million and we're through
the inventory charges, Tim, how can we think about maybe a gross margin range at that type of revenue
number?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

So $350 million, I'm comfortable of being back into the midpoint of the 45% to 50%. If you can get back
up to like the $400 million, which seems a long way off at the moment, it's closer to 50%. And then
operating expenses at that level would probably be around $80 million a quarter. So a bit above 20%
in operating margins trending to slightly around 25%, I should think. But we're comfortable with -- at
this point in time with that. I think the big caveat around that is so long as there isn't a massive change

12

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

in pricing again, and we continue to make some cost reductions that we've got rolling into the business
model over the next 2 quarters or so.

Michael J. Feniger
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And that is the -- if I could squeeze one more in, just on inventories. I think you mentioned, I believe, for
the quarter, it was over a 550 million -- 550 basis points hit to gross margins on inventories. Are you --
with where you are now, obviously, there's no crystal ball on the macro. But like how are you feeling with
your inventory position right now? And how we -- or do you think we're through some of those charges?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We went through a really detailed review of inventory, not just in Q4, but you saw -- you've seen
elevated provisions even in Q2 and Q3 compared to normal. We believe that we've dealt with potentially
excess items, and certainly, the slow-moving items that we'd identified, and we'll be targeting being more
in a normal range of 1% to 1.5% provisions per quarter.

Of course, if demand doesn't come back, it -- you have to caveat that statement with relative to where
demand was. But if you're getting back to like $300 million to $350 million, or $330 million to $350 million
in revenue, I'd be very comfortable with where we stand on inventory. I think the other good thing was
it wasn't just the inventory provisions that took inventory down, there was really good execution by the
manufacturing groups around the world so that we actually generated $20 million of cash from inventory
in the quarter, which was a great thing to see.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joe Wittine of Edgewater.

Joseph Helmut Wittine
Edgewater Research Company

Just some product questions for me, trying to understand how much a tailwind rising power levels could
be in 2020. It sounds like the 12s are finally coming to market in the west, it's been a while coming. And
then in China, wondering if you're seeing a continued extension at kind of the highest end of ultra high
power, 20s, et cetera?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

A question about the shift -- continuing shift, and how much a benefit it can be.

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Yes. Benefit -- definitely there is a economic benefit for us. And first of all, in the end, there are no
competition for such kind of high powered lasers, it's clear. And if -- and also for different kind of
applications. I already talked about cutting applications, but also for welding applications, special material
welding applications also. As much as possible, they use only high-power lasers. It's high efficiency and so
on. And from different kind of applications, high-power trend definitely will give us additional benefits.

Joseph Helmut Wittine
Edgewater Research Company

Okay. And then on high-peak power...

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Let me tell you, [indiscernible] the time when this year, we expect serious growth in high-power demand
for advanced applications. They have much more budget. Potential customer with whom we're working,

received this year much better -- higher budget than before it went for the volume introduction to the use
-- practical use, high-power different solutions we are working for.

Joseph Helmut Wittine
Edgewater Research Company

And what are those advanced applications? Could you elaborate further? Are those within macro, cutting
and welding, still?

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

No, no, no. It's other applications.

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

And special material process areas.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Aerospace mainly as application, not material processing.

Joseph Helmut Wittine
Edgewater Research Company

Understood. Then switching gears to high peak power QCW, the [ quals ] there, I would assume, are still
underway. And I think you said you shipped one. So I'm assuming you have some more insights into the
market acceptance. So as that product is fully commercialized, what sort of kind of kind of penetration are
you expecting throughout the broad cutting business? I mean could that product be half of your cutting
sales in the future once fully rolled out, more or less? Any help there would be great.

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

So I think on HPP, there continues to be a number of different customers that are evaluating the product
within their cutting applications. It's still relatively unclear as to what percentage of total sales it can
end up being, Joe. I think we'll have more clarity on that as we go through this year and customers start
to introduce product, incorporating that feature within it. There's a bit more clarity, I'd say, over AMB,
particularly for welding applications, where there's a lot of acceptance of that. We've always said the AMB
would be a very strong performer on welding, given the reduced splatter and improvement in quality
there.

Joseph Helmut Wittine
Edgewater Research Company

Okay. Great. And then, finally...

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

, In the second quarter, we introduced new families of the mid-power laser with HPP option. It's an
absolute new level competing in performance to compare existing current laser to our competition, nobody
from China, so don't want to have nothing similar. So the deal with HPP will still grow very fast. It's HPP
option for a new generation of the mid-powered lasers, including -- but also new performance and new
quality of laser [indiscernible] HPP option. And also much more [ quals ] than exist in the lasers also will
allow us to increase the gross margin very essentially for mid-power lasers to [yield] a return to very high
profitability, which was in spite of the drop of price.

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

Interesting. Finally for me, on the consumer electronics portion of your business, especially the fine
welding piece. Have you received any indication on orders for the mid part of the year related to
smartphones prior to the holiday and quarantine? I'm trying to assess how prudent it is for our models to
assume an uptick in those investments in that part of the supply chain, given I think everyone believes it's
going to be a stronger year for smartphone production from a unit perspective, coming off of a few quiet
years.

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

No, we don't have any indication yet on likely orders. The general view is from the laser supply side it's
probably going to not be a huge catalyst in terms of a typical biannual, there should be some pickup, but
it's not going to be a massive driver as it was in '17. For example, they continue to repurpose some of the
existing lasers into production lines, even for newer phones. So it's not as though it's going to drive like
doubling of QCW sales or anything like that this year, Joe.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller of The Benchmark Company.

Mark S. Miller
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to look at -- looking at the backlog and framing agreement went up year-over-year, but
orders were down. Can you provide some color on that?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

No, I think the total backlog, Mark, was down 3%. So including frame agreements, it points to being a
reasonable start to the year, but still a little bit uncertain. I think we focus a lot on the shippable side.
So there's still some underlying demand there in terms of the frame agreements. There's a lot of frame
agreements that have been put, for example, to get particularly higher power and ultra-high power
licenses. So there's clearly, if the economy stabilizes, I think that the biggest trend that could come
out of that is that you'll see the demand cycle for those ultra-high power lasers which require licenses
increase. That will be the biggest read through I would go with on the frame agreement side of it. But it
still requires more certainty on the macro, and clearly, resolution on -- not resolution, but some stability
in relation to the current situation in China. I think where we were more focused on rather than what the
closing backlog, the bookings in Q4 were, the book-to-bill was 1. So that was reasonable given that we're
at slightly above our guidance range. Our real focus on bookings, though, had been on the positive trends
we've seen in January and even the first week of February, excluding China, obviously.

Mark S. Miller
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

In terms of the backlog, too, in terms of the mix, is this a higher margin mix or similar to what you've
seen? And can we expect some improvements from the backlog in terms of margins?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

I referenced that some of the frame agreement backlog will be driven by licenses getting for ultra-high
power lasers in the 10, 12, and 20 and even in China moving towards potentially higher balances. That's
all got a margin benefit to us in Q4. You actually, I think, saw -- and Valentin referenced this as well, the
low end of the cutting market remained relatively stable in Q3 and Q4 that would have been a margin
impact to us. So you see a recovery in ultra-high power, then you see some orders coming from some of
these other advanced applications at ultra-high power, that has a margin benefit. We're selling more AMB
lasers into the battery welding application, that has a benefit. And we're combining for the welding with
the LDD, that has a benefit. And then key to everything as well is driving growth of ultrafast technology

in green lasers, which also have extremely high-margin on them. They wouldn't be significant volumes of
those in backlog at the moment, but growth of those business during the year is a target for the company.

Operator

Our next questions come from the line of Nick Todorov of Longbow Research.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Tim, you highlighted the strength in welding. Can you talk about mix within that? Maybe I'm assuming it's
more AMB with lasers. But is it systems or lasers? Can you give us any color on mix in welding?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

There's some benefit on systems, but there was also the significant order I mentioned for battery
processing in the U.S. that benefited welding. That wasn't actually AMB, but it was order that was supplied
with the LDD, the real-time weld monitoring and welding heads as well. There is some pickup in QCW in
Q4 that would have been outside of systems, that would have been a driver as well as some of the welding
performance. In the fourth quarter, there was some revenue recognized on some other welding systems,
though, as well, which benefited stuff. A lot of the stuff that goes through Genesis, though, is obviously
welding-based applications, not exclusively, but largely welding-based applications.

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Agriculture.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. I understand that in other markets like Europe and China, it's difficult to forecast. But North America
seems a little bit more stable. Are you willing to take a hit on what is the outlook you can see from North
America, particularly in the core cutting markets for 2020?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

I think I referenced that earlier in the call that we continue to see a reasonably robust demand
environment, not just across the core cutting applications, but across numerous different applications
in the U.S. And we're targeting reasonable growth on the U.S. for this year across all of these, not just
the cutting and welding, but some of the newer applications, such as medical, semiconductor, advanced
applications, deposition technologies, for example, like high-power cladding applications. And then the
systems business as well is largely focused, even outside of the acquired business, the organic systems
business -- the medical devices, for example, performed very well last year. There's a new system that's
being introduced, stent cutting, which we think enhances our competitive dynamics in that market as well.
So there's a lot of diversity in the U.S. business that would be helped by a stronger macro environment
here compared to the rest of the world.

Valentin P. Gapontsev
Founder, Chairman & CEO

And now until end of last year, second half last year, made a great drop. Now we go into a new level
of cooperation in the implementation of welding -- laser welding technology to the many segment of
industry. We signed now with very serious long term agreement with very big Tier 1 plays in aerospace
and transportation. And so we become the real long-term partner in mainly -- in the development, the
joint development of the new welding processes, including full -- not only to sell lasers before for them,
but provide them full complete solution, new process for special for each kind of the welding of material
parts and so on. Then full automation system in providing and identifying ready production lines. It's

a long-term cooperation with more and more such large -- the Tier 1 in the corresponding segment of
market -- plays in the market. In the U.S., in the Europe, and so on. In material -- in auto, not only metal
processing welding, but also in the material -- auto material processing, and also one. It's not just a retail
sales of long-term cooperation, where you see this partnership with biggest players in the market. It's
open for us to work on the opportunity.

Operator

Our final question comes from the line of Krish Sankar of Cowen & Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I had two quick questions. One is, Tim, on your commentary on gross margin, I understand the biggest
impact to gross margin is today from under absorption. So when you look at the revenue range of
$300 million to $400 million on a quarterly basis, gross margin were up 45% to 50%. Is the inherent
assumption service systems a similar percentage of the total revenue than it is today? And then a quick
follow-up for Dr. Scherbakov. Is the EV opportunity mainly on the welding side?

Timothy P. V. Mammen
Senior VP & CFO

So in terms of gross margin, in terms of the recovery to $350 million or $400 million, you'd actually
expect the laser business to perhaps recover a bit more quickly than proportion of growth in systems,
even though we're targeting very strong growth in systems. So there'll be a little bit of a margin benefit,
but the systems would still be a drag relative to the top end of that range, like on a -- an equivalent basis
compared to where we were before. If you excluded the systems, you'd be above 50% -- slightly above
50%.

Eugene A. Scherbakov
COO, Senior VP of Europe & Director

Okay. Of course, applications are not only connected to battery welding or cutting of foil, also there exists
some big opportunity to use our high-power laser for welding body and wide welding for a vehicle. And
from this point of view, also we see a very good perspective for our lasers.
