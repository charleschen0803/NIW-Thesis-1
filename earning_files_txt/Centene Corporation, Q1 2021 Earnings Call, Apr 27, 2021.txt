CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Centene Corporation First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President of Finance and
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Jennifer Lynch Gilligan
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2021
earnings results conference call.

Michael Neidorff, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which also can be accessed
through our website at centene.com.

Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-
looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. The actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking
statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent
Form 10-Q filed today, and the Form 10-K dated February 22, 2021, and other public SEC filings, including
the risks and uncertainties described with respect to the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business
and results of operation.

Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. While
the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we
specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A
reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our
first quarter 2021 press release, which is available on the company's website under the Investors section.
Additionally, please mark your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day to be held virtually on June 16,
2021.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter Earnings Call.

On today -- on the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our
markets and products and discuss how we are positioned to sustain our momentum in the ongoing
pandemic environment. While we have made great progress in working our way out of the pandemic,
nationally, as we have seen recently, it is not yet over.

We are off to a strong start in 2021, with solid revenue and earnings growth. It was a good quarter. Our
teams continue to execute well, generating revenue of $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the
first quarter of 2020. Membership was 25.1 million at the quarter end. This represents an increase of 1.3
million compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.63 compared to $0.86
in the prior year quarter, representing an increase of 90%.

Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the trajectory of our business. And today,
we are updating our full year guidance. This is primarily driven by several tailwinds. These include: first,
continued Medicaid membership growth amid suspended eligibility redeterminations. Our current guidance
anticipates the suspension continuing to at least August 1 based on the fact that it is renewed 90 days at

a time. Second, the marketplace special enrollment period, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. And
third, the hold on the Medicare sequestration.

Our results to date also reflect a decrease in normal utilization, offset by COVID-19 expenses and state
recoupment of premiums, which Jeff will provide additional detail on shortly.

As we have done throughout pandemic, we continue to monitor the headwinds and tailwinds we anticipate
will impact our operating landscapes for the remainder of the year and possibly into 2022. Consistent
with past quarters, I will provide you with updates based on the facts as we know them today. When
taken together, we believe the essence of these factors to be positive. Anticipated tailwinds include:
continued lower than normal utilization. Overall, the first quarter was lower compared to the prior quarter.
Although we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization in our marketplace business. While the trajectory of
utilization depends on the pandemic and remains uncertain, we continue to expect utilization to come in
below historical averages during the second quarter with the potential for some normalization starting to
occur in the second half of the year.

Other key possible tailwinds we see include: potential for continued growth resulting in higher-than-
anticipated membership in our marketplace business from the special enrollment period; and a probable
extension of the Medicaid eligibility redetermination suspension beyond August and through the end of the
year, possibly into the beginning of 2022.

As a potential headwind, we continue to monitor additional state rate adjustments. For 2021, we
anticipate a $550 million revenue impact of state revenue actions and rate actions. Jeff will provide some
additional color on this shortly. But I will share that we have seen only one action in the first quarter of
the year. And we are not currently aware of any additional planned adjustments or quarters. In fact, some
quarters, we believe, may be allowed to expire. To reiterate, overall, as we see them today, we believe
these factors balance in our favor.

As we conclude the first quarter of 2021, we are pleased with our ability to drive significant growth and
our updated guidance reflects the strength of our business through the year.

We also remain vigilant that this is a year with unique drivers, including the suspension of Medicaid
eligibility redeterminations and the marketplace special enrollment period, which we cannot be certain will
continue throughout all of 2022. Consistent with prior years, at our June Investor Day, we will provide an
update on these factors and 2022. We recognize a lot of factors, as we see them today, balance to the
positive, the outlook remains fluid and dependent on the prevalent policy landscape.

The strength of our diversified business is apparent across our product portfolio. In our Medicaid business,
we continue to participate in an active RFP pipeline. We successfully renewed our contract in Hawaii at the
end of March. And North Carolina and Oklahoma both remain on track to go live later this year. For 2021,
we continue to expect a composite rate adjustment of 1.7%, consistent with our initial guidance.

Our Medicare business delivered continued growth. Medicare grew by over $1 billion year-over-year in the
first quarter, representing growth of 41% and demonstrating the strength of the platform and our ability to
leverage our national scale going forward.

In our Marketplace business, we are pleased to be operating in a supportive environment. The
administration continues to invest in the product and just last week, announced an additional $80 million
for navigators to boost enrollment. Based on data released by CMS, Centene is a clear leader in new
enrollment on the federal exchange. And since the beginning of the year, we have enrolled over 320,000
new members in our Marketplace product. We believe these results demonstrate the strength of our
strategy to provide consistent quality care and not to participate in a price-related race to the bottom
with narrow network coverage. I will remind you that narrow networks often encourage out-of-network
utilization, which tends to be uncontrolled and expensive.

We see opportunity to further grow with the enhanced advanced premium tax credits that took effect
April 1, the impact of which, we believe, will encourage consumers to prioritize quality, consistency and
experience over premium [ growth ]. Moving ahead, we intend to maintain and consider building additional
products around this strategy.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

On the technology front, we're making meaningful progress to advance our capabilities to provide high-
quality integrated care for our members. We look forward to providing you more details on our unique
technology strategy at our Investors event in June.

We continued to advance towards the completion of the Magellan Health acquisition and remain on track
to close the transaction early in the second half of 2021. The Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired in
mid-March, and we're working diligently towards obtaining the necessary state approvals. Our integration
and planning efforts are in full swing, and we are enthusiastic about the combination, which will enable
us to expand access to special care and nurture -- to specialty care and nurture a fully integrated model
across behavioral and physical health.

I will remind you that Magellan will be part of our Health Care Enterprise portfolio, which will allow them to
maintain independence and serve third-party customers.

I would like to take a moment to comment on the situation in Ohio. We are still an active RFP process,
where we finished second out of 11 bidders, according to a scoring summary released by the Ohio
Department of Medicaid. Regarding the legal and regulatory landscape, Centene has been clear that we
maintain these claims to be unfounded. For additional information about our position on this matter, I will
direct you to our website for links to our court filings.

We look forward to answering any questions from our governmental partners regarding this issue and
remain committed to the highest levels of quality and transparency in how we serve our state partners.

Before I close, I'd like to talk about Centene's role in COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Over the past
few months, our data and care management teams have worked tirelessly to identify members at
the highest list for COVID-19 and provide those individuals with personalized and culturally sensitive
outreach. In addition, we have partnered with Lyft to support individuals with transportation to vaccine
appointments. And with the Gold Jackets of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, with whom we have had an
ongoing partnership, we created PSA's focus on increasing awareness about the safety and efficacy of
COVID vaccines.

This type of innovative work is happening across the organization, and I want to recognize and thank our
employees for their unwavering commitment and dedication.

In closing, we started the year strong and look forward to carrying this positive momentum through the
remainder of 2021 as we experience a supportive environment in expanding access to care. We continue
to see long-term opportunities to drive growth in our top and bottom line and enhance margins as we
provide the highest level of care to our members at the lowest cost.

I look forward to seeing all of you, albeit virtually, at our Investor event on June 16. Thank you for your
continued interest in Centene. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported first quarter 2021 results in
what was a good start to the year. First quarter revenues were $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared
to the first quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.63 compared to $0.86 last
year.

As a result of the strong first quarter performance, we increased our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance
by $0.05 per share to a range of $5.05 to $5.35. I will provide further comments related to our updated
financial guidance shortly.

First, let me provide additional details for the first quarter. Total revenues grew by $4 billion over the
first quarter of 2020 due to a full quarter of contribution from WellCare and the ongoing suspension of
Medicaid eligibility redeterminations partially offset by an overall decrease in marketplace membership,
state rate and risk-sharing actions and the repeal of the health insurer fee in 2021. Our marketplace

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

membership decline in the quarter was less significant than previously expected as a result of membership
gains achieved during the special enrollment period.

Total membership increased to 25.1 million in the quarter, up 5% compared to a year ago. Since the
pandemic began in March of 2020, we have added a total of 2 million Medicaid members. Our HBR was
86.8% in the first quarter compared to 88% in the first quarter of 2020. The HBR benefited from lower
overall medical utilization trends due to COVID pandemic and lower costs associated with the flu. This was
partially offset by COVID-related costs, state risk-sharing mechanisms and higher COVID and traditional
utilization in the marketplace business.

Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 8.1% in the first quarter this year
compared to 8.6% last year and 9.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio
benefited from the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the leveraging of
expenses over higher revenues due to recent acquisitions.

Cash flow provided by operations was $43 million in the first quarter. The lower operating cash flow for the
quarter was primarily driven by a delay in premium payments of $910 million from the state of New York
due to the end of their fiscal year, which was collected in April.

We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $369 million of unregulated cash on our balance
sheet at quarter end. Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $152 million of borrowings
on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5%, excluding our nonrecourse debt,
compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38% when netting our
unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end, which represents a 90 basis point decrease since March of
2020.

Our medical claims liability totaled $12.8 billion at quarter end and represents 49 days in claims payable
compared to 51 days in the fourth quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of medical and
pharmacy claim payments.

We are making excellent progress toward the closure of Magellan, and we remain comfortable with our
previously communicated accretion targets.

Over the last several months, we have gained increased visibility into a number of important factors and
have included those items in our updated 2021 financial guidance. These factors specifically include: the
ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations through August 1; the delay in the California
pharmacy carve-out until July 1; and the delay in the New York pharmacy carve-out through year-
end 2022; the new business win in Oklahoma with an assumed go-live date of October 1; expected
marketplace membership gains through the special enrollment period; Medicare membership, fee schedule
increase and sequestration delay; and updated expectations of state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms.
These changes increased our total revenue guidance for the year by $4 billion at the midpoint to be within
a range of $120.1 million and $122.1 billion.

Our HBR guidance increased by 50 basis points at the midpoint due to the mix of items such as the
Medicare fee schedule, increased state risk-sharing mechanisms and Medicaid growth, which all carry
a higher HBR. Taken all together, this has an overall neutral effect to earnings, and the dynamics are
consistent with the headwinds and tailwinds we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call.

Additionally, as I highlighted earlier, we have increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year
at the midpoint by $0.05, reflecting our strong first quarter performance.

Let me highlight some more details on some of these items. We now expect Medicare Advantage
enrollment growth to exceed 20% in 2021. This strong growth demonstrates the value the WellCare
acquisition provides positive momentum for the organization to build off of as we formulate our bids for
Medicare Advantage in 2022.

As Michael mentioned, Marketplace enrollment expectations for 2021 are better than our previous
estimates as the special enrollment period provides Centene with an opportunity to reach many more

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

eligible consumers. This strong growth demonstrates our organizational commitment to leadership in this
product. We continue to view Marketplace as a long-term growth opportunity for Centene.

We have increased our estimate for state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms from our previous guidance
to $550 million for 2021. In the first quarter, the state of New York implemented a risk corridor retroactive
to April 1, 2020 that increased our payback by $40 million. At this time, we are not aware of any new
corridors or retroactive rates and the increase in our full year estimate reflects the performance of risk
mitigation programs enacted last year.

As Michael noted, we continue to monitor utilization. During the first quarter, we saw overall utilization
that continues to be below the historical baseline and also slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2020.
The COVID inpatient admissions and costs peaked in January and decreased throughout the quarter.
We continue to see a diverging pattern of COVID and non-COVID utilization. The updated financial
guidance reflects typical utilization that remains below the historical baseline during the first half of 2021,
continuing to trend to normalized levels by the end of the year. COVID utilization, including testing and
treatment costs, are expected to partially offset the impact of lower traditional utilization. The duration
and intensity of higher COVID costs will be impacted by the trajectory of the pandemic and vaccination
rates.

Finally, as Michael discussed, we continued to monitor some additional factors that are not in our updated
guidance today. They include: the potential for the additional SCP membership gains in Marketplace
above our expectations driven by the enhanced advanced premium tax credits; the potential for Medicaid
redeterminations to be extended beyond August 1; any additional state rate and risk-sharing actions; and
the uncertainty associated with both COVID and traditional medical utilization for the remainder of the
year.

We believe these additional factors represent a net tailwind to the company for the remainder of 2021.
The seasonality of our earnings remains unchanged with approximately 60% in the first half of the year.

I'll close by reiterating our confidence in the strength of our business. Our balance sheet remains strong
and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused
on executing against our strategic plans and are committed to delivering shareholder value.
That concludes my remarks and operator, you may now open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

I think I'm still trying to -- I'm still trying to process an Investor Day on a Wednesday, not a Friday. So I'm
a little off over there.

My real question is Medicare revenues up 41% in the quarter. I know some of that was anniversarying of
WellCare. But MA lives were up 19% sequentially. It sounds like the outlook for the year is closer to 20%.
So that's up from previous expectations.

So can you break out how much of that revenue growth was organic in the quarter? Maybe a sense of
what revenues will do this year? And where are you seeing that success in terms of geographies and
products and whether it's coming from competitors or fee-for-service?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, I'll start off. We -- I think the growth is very balanced across our various markets. There's no one
market contributing. We've been expanding into new markets very successfully. And as we have -- as we
said when we went into the Wellcare deal, we felt that they had some competencies in this area that we
could build on. We also have a national presence as a total Centene Corporation. And so we've just been
building on it organically basically. It is -- there's some -- obviously, you take some from competition and
just some of it is just from the fee-for-service. But it's very balanced across all the potential elements we
grow. There's no one contributing more than another.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

And just as a follow-up, I know that Stars has been a big focus, and you guys are looking to for
improvement. Should we think about 2022 as an improvement year? And not necessarily looking for
another 20% growth here. But just in terms of positioning and margin, et cetera, do you feel like sort of
better results, better competitive positioning going forward as well?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think -- well, first of all, I won't put a number on the growth until June. But I like significant growth.
I think people know it. So we -- we'll be working against that.

Relative to Stars, we were within a few basis points last year, being at 4 Stars and we have very
aggressive programs. And as you know, it takes time to achieve that. They look -- it's a 1 or 2-year look
back. So on the Stars front, we can -- we believe we'll continue to make progress on it. And we tell the
Medicare people, it's not just 4 Stars, but 4.5 and beyond. So we're reaching for the stars, so to speak.
And so it's very balanced in that way, Josh.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. Just wanted to see how to think about the guidance and how much we should be thinking about as
being a good base first if we're thinking about future growth. It sounds like most of the revenue guide is

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

onetime in nature. Is that fair? I guess, you're waiting for the Oklahoma contract, but most of the other
things, whether it's sequestration or redeterminations or maybe even a special enrollment period might be
things that we wouldn't necessarily flow through to the future year.

And I guess, similar type of question but on MLR. It sounds like some of the MLR guidance is on items that
are happening this year, but maybe you wouldn't expect to be in the baseline for next year. Just how do
we think about those 2 dynamics?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Kevin, I'll start. We'll give you more guidance in June at our Investor Day, which is our practice,
particularly on the top line. These are unusual years. We think that the redetermination will continue
throughout the balance of the year, but we'll report to you a quarter -- 90 days at a time as the federal
government does it. And that's in the interest of being reasonably conservative. So we're being cautious
there.

Marketplace, we've demonstrated this past quarter, with the growth that we've had, that we are the
leader in the field and are in a very strong position to continue that growth. And we're going to continue it
through the balance of this year as we see it. And we see some upside there.

I think what's also important, as it relates to the redetermination. If they do drop off the redetermination,
people who maybe lose Medicaid coverage could pick up the Marketplace because once again, the cost
structure is such with the tax allowances that they can do that without any costs. And so I think we're
going to see -- I'm hearing a bird somewhere in the background. I'm hearing -- so I think we will see
growth continue. But as we said, governmental policies do have something to play, and it is a fluid
situation, and we work very well both sides, as we've talked about in the past. We're working with them
now into these various policies and approaches.

And as that unfolds, I think, between now and June, I hope to have more insight than we do as to what it
will mean for the balance of this year and going into 2022. The essence is positive.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe just a quick follow-up there. You mentioned that some rate corridors may expire. When would you
get visibility on that?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Pardon me? Well, just in terms of the states have just been not talking about adding to them and we have
talked about the -- their attitude is things seem to be stabilizing. And so I'm trying to give you a sense
of where we are today and what we're seeing. And I'm not saying which specific ones because it's -- we
were done. We only had one adjustment this past quarter, which is a very positive sign. So once again, I'm
trying to give you just some insight as we see it, Kevin.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

A couple of questions on the quarter. First, the PYD looked pretty strong relative to last year. I was
wondering if you could kind of parse out the impact that had on the quarter?

And then you talked about the -- a little bit higher cost on the Marketplace business. Any more color there
you can give us in terms of what you're seeing there, any kind of geographies? And then where margins
kind of end up for this year given that cost pressure?

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Jeff, do you want to take those?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, sure, Justin. As we look at development, we obviously track this from quarter-to-quarter. We're
looking for consistency. In our view, it's very consistent with what we've seen in the past. Now you have to
obviously account for the acquisition of WellCare. But roughly around that 1% range of prior year medical
costs. So I would say nothing unusual on the development front from our perspective, which is, I think
we've had a consistent practice over a long number of years.

On the Marketplace business, on the cost side, what we did see was just a little bit higher inpatient
authorizations on COVID, specifically in January. And then a little higher non-inpatient, really just
compared to our expectations. So it doesn't really change the margin profile for the year. I would just say
a tad higher than versus what we had modeled in Q1.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

That could have a positive impact on risk adjustment for us.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

That's right. The other thing we're tracking is the acuity of our membership. So -- and obviously, the SCP
members as well. So that's all going to factor into the risk adjustment calculation. And that's relative to
your competition, and the data on that doesn't come out until really the end of Q2. So more to come on
that.

Operator

Our next question today comes from A.J. Rice at Credit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I was interested in Michael's comments about the Marketplace or the public exchanges and the narrow
network competition. I think when you guys -- obviously, been a big leader there. The last few years, one
of the secret sauces that you had was to approach it with a more limited network approach relative to
some of the guys that came out of it as a traditional commercial product.

It now sounds like maybe some other competitors are leapfrogging and doing even more in that area. I'm
wondering if you think about the membership and what's happening with the membership, I know it's a
membership that's prone to switch, but it's not driven by premiums because there's a lot of subsidies. Is
it mainly networks that are driving people to pick and choose on the exchanges in your view at this point?
Are there other things that are factors in driving how people choose? Is there strategy involved?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I think what's important is we did see some significant pricing in the end of last year that cost us some
membership. As we said -- and that's because they had a narrow network, and we're able to do that. We
opted not to join that race to the bottom and keep -- maintain our broader networks. But I'm going to ask
Brent, who oversees this business, to try to pick it up. Brent?

During the special enrollment period, what we are seeing is really a focus on strong provider network,
so not narrow networks. We're also seeing a commitment to customer service from our role -- we're
figuring this everywhere, that at the end of the day, people that left us in 2020, today in 2021, what
they're finding is true commitment to a strong provider network and really focus on the customer. And
that's really fueling our growth. When you have a supportive administration, you have a special enrollment
period that's now going for 180 days, you have the enhanced tax credits being applied on April 1. And
really, at the same time, we really have a commitment to a strong distribution strategy. This is leading to
our growth.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. All right. Maybe just, Jeff, the 90-day PH -- Public Health Emergency, if that were to get extended to
year-end, what would that mean for you guys?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I'll give you a little flavor on the membership. I think we expect our membership to peak roughly 2.2
members -- 2.2 million members since the pandemic began roughly in July. And if it got extended, we
think that go up to 2.4 million. So we'd top out at 2.4 million before the end of the year.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

What that really means is we recouped what -- we have recruited to date plus from what we lost in the
last quarter of last year, and we see it continuing to grow significantly.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes.

And our next question today comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes, maybe I could ask you to talk about the -- what you're seeing in terms of your profitability in
Medicare Advantage? I'm asking the question just in the context of the impressive growth that you've
shown there, but wondering if some of that has come at the expense of margin, and maybe that was
planned?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we have not gotten specific by product line. I want to assure you, Matt, that everything we do, it will
be driven by profit and with a view to expanding margins. And I think we have a clear-cut approach to it.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Matt, this is Jeff. A couple of things. Obviously, as Michael mentioned, it's a unique year. Well, we had
the Medicare fee schedule cut. So that's not helping. And then obviously, we have a lot of room for margin
expansion in the future years based on Stars performance. So I think as you look at this year in isolation,
I would say, margin expansion opportunities going forward, primarily from eliminating the cut and then
obviously, performing better on Stars, which is one of the important tasks that we're focused on.

If I could ask a different question on the Medicaid redeterminations. If we get into that, whether it's later
this year or at the beginning of 2022, has your thinking in terms of the impact changed at all versus
maybe what we had discussed I'm thinking back in the December Investor Day?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think -- I'll start off. I think it's important to say we're going to have a better view of that come
the June Investor Day. I mean, that's typically what we talk about then. I did comment, though, that our
position in the marketplace, that if there is redetermination, if people lose Medicaid coverage, we believe
that we will be in a position to where they will flip into our marketplace because it's the same network and
things of that nature, that would be a good incentive and their costs are subsidized. So I think that it's a
matter of where that membership goes.

Our next question today comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

First question, just would be interested if you have any clarity for us on what you're learning just about
the New York rates being updated, if at all? Just obviously, a lot of developments there in the New York
budget more broadly after the [ ARC Bill ] was passed. And so interested if -- I know you guys called out
the risk corridor, the retroactive one that was put in place. But any updates to like -- because I know there
have been a 3% assumed cut previously in the budget, if you got an update on that? And then also just
on the quality payments in New York as well, which I know has been a dynamic for you guys, just where
things are trending there as well.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Scott. This is Jeff. I mean I think it's just too early to tell. We don't -- don't necessarily -- when these
things aren't finalized, they have a tendency to move late in the game, as we've seen in the past. And
so I guess from my perspective, I would say it's just too early to tell where it's going to land. But we're
comfortable, obviously, with what we have in the numbers for this year.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just a follow-up question. I saw that you guys have your updated view in the revenue
guidance on the sort of start date of the carve-out of the Medi-Cal PBM contract. I know the state had
announced that they were going to be conducting a review just around the Magellan acquisition and
looking at some things. Just interested at this point, has that review concluded and you've now gotten
visibility from the state or is that still ongoing? And if there has been any feedback so far on any changes
that the state would be requiring as part of the Magellan acquisition?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Sarah, do you want to make a comment on that? They work hard.

Sarah M. London
President of Health Care Enterprises & Executive VP of Advanced Technology

Yes, happy to. Magellan is working very closely with DHCS and California department leadership on a
conflict avoidance plan. That is still in process but progressing well. We don't yet have clarity from the
department on when the program would be kicked off, but we're hoping to have a sense within the next
month or so of the resolution of that conflict avoidance plan.

And our next question today comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Question on utilization in the acuity level. So Michael, you said that you are tracking acuity closely. What
are you seeing to date in terms of the population that's coming back? What's the acuity levels on the core
ex-COVID?

And then when we think about you're saying utilization is below baseline, I assume that, that related to
core utilization as well, but maybe you can give us a little bit more color on how it's trending per market?
And do you think that because you're now seeing sort of a mix towards more of an MA population that
that's impacting sort of utilization trends that you're seeing versus Medicaid in the market?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

So I think Jeff commented that in the marketplace, we saw some incremental increase in utilization, and
that's offset some in Medicaid. Jeff, why don't you take us through the numbers?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. On the utilization front, a lot packed into that question. So I'm not sure I heard the final piece of that.
But we really haven't seen a change in the acuity outside of our expectations. Specifically, just take the
Marketplace business. We knew our acuity was going to change based on the open enrollment, and that's
why we commented that we think our risk adjustment payable will go down substantially this year. So far,
I would say we haven't seen any acuity change in our base membership other than what we've expected.

So that -- I hope that answers part of your question. And if that doesn't, what's the -- what was the
second part?

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. So to your point, no change in acuity versus your expectations. So to add on that, what is embedded
into guidance by year-end? Are you assuming unchanged acuity or higher acuity?

And then the second part of the question was on the utilization. You said no change. I'm just kind of trying
to understand whether -- how did it look for the rest of the Medicare population versus Medicaid?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Yes, 2 things. I guess what I would say is we know the acuity of the members we have, right? And we
have projected that in our guidance. And if you go to our prepared remarks, what we've said is we expect
utilization to stay below the historical baseline for the first half, trending towards normal by the end of the
year. So I hope that helps.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

And yes, there is a difference in behavior between, I would say, Medicaid marketplace and Medicare. The
demographics of those members are extremely different from an age perspective. So there are different
utilization patterns, but we obviously incorporate that into our guidance.

Our next question today comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Could you talk a little bit about your long-term strategic growth outlook at this point? And in particular,
I was interested in how do you look at your major priorities beyond Medicaid and Marketplace? And how
much of the growth long term do you think are going to come from those areas like Medicare, Health Care
Enterprise or value-based care?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I appreciate the question. I think we'll get in more detail on 2022 growth to give us some sense of where
it's coming from in June, which is our practice. We still see ourselves very much as a growth company.
We see balanced growth across all the product lines. We demonstrated growth in Medicare. We've talked
about that being a growth engine for us. We think Marketplace will continue to be a growth engine as well
as Medicaid.

I mean we have a government in place now that believes that people should be insured. And so while
what we're working on now is we come up with the numbers for you that are reasonable, that we'll give
you in June, but we see us growing across all our products. And growing responsibly with expanding
margins and containing cost and improving quality. So it's a balance that we're trying to strike. And we
have a couple of new products that we're working on that I'm not going to talk about for confidentiality
reasons.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

And just to clarify on the -- like the Health Care Enterprise and some of the things with value-based care
delivery that maybe you're doing in Florida or places like that. How material are they to growth prospects
over the next 1, 2, 3 years?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think you're going to see that those things are put in place for long-term growth. And we have
some technology you're going to you're going to hear about it the June Investor Day that will drive growth
and will drive demand for our products because of what it can do for the quality and as our systems we
would like to talk about the provider and recipients' delight.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Got you. And just to be clear, for the technology, are those mainly drivers of the managed care business?
Or do you think those are stand-alone enablement businesses like kind of in line with Magellan supporting
other health plans?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Oh, no, I think what this -- what you're going to see on the systems is it's going to drive improvement
in quality and reduce costs. So it's -- you'll have higher performance in a -- from a quality standpoint,
improved quality, but it's going to significantly reduce our costs.

Our next question today comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.

Robert Patrick Jones
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. Actually just wanted to go back to A.J.'s question about the competitive landscape, Michael, in
the marketplace. You've mentioned a few times, obviously, end of last year that you saw some more
competitive pricing behaviors from some of the players there. I was wondering if maybe during the
special enrollment period, you've seen any of those competitors change behavior or continue with a more
aggressive pricing strategy? And I think within that, just curious, how widespread has this been? Is it
really kind of contained to a state or 2 or are you seeing it more broadly?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

So I think it's not broad. I think what we -- well, we're focused on ourselves and how we do things. And
as we said at the time, we're not going to join that race to the bottom. We know that that's not -- it's not
something you're going to do and it couldn't be sustained, in my opinion.

So what we've done is we've maintained our network. We have the subsidies that are necessary that have
really taken price off the table, in my opinion. Where people will look at the quality, the service that Brent
talked about. And that's where we're seeing the growth and return of membership to us as well as the
incremental new membership.

And so I think what we're very focused on is how to continue to grow it. And I learned a long time ago
when I was in consumer packaged goods. When you're trying to go in against somebody that's a clear
leader in the marketplace, which we were in a category, the only way you can hope to try and come
in is on price. And I think we had a strategic positioning that they are -- people are able to take some
membership away in price in a COVID environment as we come out of it. As I think we've demonstrated
in the first quarter of this year, we've recouped all that we've lost and then some, and we'll be giving you
guidance in June that shows continued growth.

Robert Patrick Jones
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, maybe just one quick follow-up, Jeff. I know at the Analyst Day, you
talked about the cadence of earnings maybe being a little bit more front half-weighted. I think it's like
65%. Any updated thoughts as you got 1 quarter under the belt now as far as how you're seeing earnings
play out for the year?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, yes. I think in -- a 60% front half would be where I would direct you to. And again, if you just think
about the utilization kind of assumptions that we have, that gives you the reason why there's more
earnings in the front half of the year.

Operator

And our next question today comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Jeff and Mike, just kind of a simple one. Can you talk about the vaccine initiatives and the uptake that
you're seeing in the managed Medicaid population?

And then my quick follow-up would be is I know that we've seen a continued suspension of the
redeterminations, but we continue to see smatterings of press releases as it relates to raising barriers to

access like increased use of prior auth and step edits coming out of various states. I'm wondering if you're
seeing this, and is it having impact on utilization or might it be too early to tell?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

So your first one was on the vaccine take up rate. Obviously, part of what some of the initiatives that
Michael had mentioned, where we're trying to stratify our membership population for those that are most
at risk and trying to get the vaccination to them. I think some of the challenges we've had on the data
side is that potential members could give vaccinations from alternative sites. So that's not within our
ecosystem. So -- but we are tracking that data as best we can and trying to obviously get our high-risk
members to get vaccinated.

So -- and the second question, again? I didn't catch that last part.

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. So just -- we subscribe to like all the state Medicaid agency press release distribution lists. And
we're starting to see a smattering of data flow around state agencies wanting to raise barriers to access.
So reinstituting prior authorizations with care delivery reinstituting step edits, I'm just wondering if
you're seeing any of this, if you expect it to impact utilization, will it be meaningful, not seeing it? Any
commentary around that?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I would say it's early. We haven't seen -- I'm not aware if we've seen anything at this point in time, and
that's something that we'll obviously be continuing to watch it.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I would add one thing about the vaccine that -- well, our focus has really been with the Gold Jackets
from the Hall of Fame and others is to help people that in our population that may be hesitant for various
historic reasons to not take the vaccine, to say, it's okay and having people that are well-respected in
sports and other areas, we had Bob Costas way back when do a public service announcement about
wearing a mask. So it's a matter of getting people that are respected, encouraging and providing an
incentive.

And what we're trying to really focus on is they're not doing it just for themselves, but they're doing it for
their loved ones, they're doing it for their parents, their children, their spouses, other members of their
family. So what's really important is just encouraging. So that's where we spend a lot of time and energy
and work with government officials to try and demonstrate that we're being responsible in that area.

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference
back over to the management team for any final remarks.

believe we have the momentum to continue the positive impact we're having in the marketplace. So stay
