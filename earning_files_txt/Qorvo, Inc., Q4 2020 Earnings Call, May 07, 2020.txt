QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Qorvo, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2020
Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Douglas DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Douglas DeLieto
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks very much. Hello, everybody, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2020 Fourth Quarter Earnings
Conference Call.

This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual
results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe
harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated
with our business in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC because these risk factors may
affect our operations and financial results.

In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide
this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results
and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain noncash expenses or other items that
may obscure trends in our underlying performance.

During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-
GAAP results. For complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our
earnings release issued earlier today available on our website at qorvo.com, under Investors.

Joining us today from multiple locations are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief
Financial Officer; James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense products group; Eric
Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group as well as other members of Qorvo's management
team.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Doug, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We will begin today with a look at our March
quarter and highlight what drove our performance in both Mobile Products and Infrastructure and Defense.
We will discuss COVID-19 and cover some of the steps we have taken to support our employees and
customers. Then Mark will provide additional details on our financials and operations.

Qorvo delivered a very strong March quarter. Revenue was $788 million, driven by broad-based demand
in 5G handsets and infrastructure, defense, WiFi 6 and IoT. Gross margin was 49.6%, up sequentially and
year-over-year.

During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions: Custom MMIC and Decawave. Custom MMIC expands
our leadership in GaAs and GaN RF products for defense and aerospace, while Decawave positions us
as a leading provider of ultra-wideband solutions for proximity awareness, secure payments and secure
access for smartphones, automotive and IoT. We are pleased to add Qorvo's scale to both of these well
established, high-performing teams to build on their successes and accelerate their growth.

Looking broadly at the March quarter, our performance reflects an exceptional effort by the entire Qorvo
team. Our employees have demonstrated extraordinary spirit and resilience, and I'm proud of their
ability to excel in a challenging and dynamic environment. We said on our January 29 earnings call that

QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

we expected the impact of COVID-19 to extend beyond the March quarter and affect both supply and
demand. On March 3, we updated our guidance as macro conditions worsened.

To safeguard our employees and operations, in January, we began to take precautionary measures. We
then activated a cross-functional COVID-19 response team as part of our global business continuity plan.
The success of our early efforts in Asia served as a model for our global operations. We enacted best
practices and implied enhanced safety protocols worldwide. That included temperature scanning, social
distancing protocols, travel restrictions and a rigorous screening and quarantine process for any suspected
or confirmed cases.

While our factories and engineering labs remained open, we successfully transitioned thousands of
employees to work from their homes. We have experienced no material disruptions in our business
operations, thanks to these and other ongoing efforts. We are maintaining product development
schedules. Our design and engineering teams continue to develop breakthrough technologies, and our
customer engagements are strong.

With that as context, I will recap our business performance by market. In mobile, shipments of our 5G
solutions grew sequentially and 5G design activity continued to increase. Qorvo's highly integrated and
high-performance 5G and LTE Advanced Pro solutions are helping our customers to enhance performance,
reduce product footprint and accelerate products to market. We are especially pleased with content gains
in 5G. Products like our 5G ultra-high band solutions are being adopted across customers and on all
leading 5G chipsets.

During the quarter, we helped enable Samsung's Galaxy S20 platform with a broad set of high-
performance and highly integrated components. These include our mid-high band and ultra-high band 5G
solutions. We also provided a leading manufacturer of 5G smartphones, the complete main path, including
our low, mid-high and ultrahigh band integrated solutions as well as our WiFi front-end module, switches,
tuners for the recently-launched 5G smartphone.

Our view on early adoption of 5G is unchanged, and although our overall view of smartphones is for a
decline of over 10% in calendar '20, we still expect 5G smartphones this year to be in line to slightly below
what we guided in early March.

Contributing to future growth, the demand for data analytics, remote management and system-level
optimization within the wide area industrial applications, such as meter reading and asset tracking, is
driving the need for global long-range connectivity via cellular IoT. Qorvo enjoys broad exposure to cellular
IoT, ranging from our discrete portfolio of RF solutions to our highly integrated modules through our
partnership with Nordic Semi for high-volume CAT-M and narrowband IoT applications.

Also, the need for proximity awareness and enhanced wireless security is driving the adoption of ultra-
wideband for context aware applications, including secured payments and secure access for smartphones,
automotive and IoT. We're enjoying increased demand as the market develops and we combine
Decawave's breakthrough technologies with our scale and customer reach. Our current generation of ultra-
wideband products going into production this year features the marriage of Decawave's state of the Art
radio technology with our front ends to enable enhance (sic) [ advanced ] angle of arrival capability.

In cellular infrastructure market, shipments of GaN high-power amplifiers and small signal components
increased sequentially in support of sub-6 gigahertz 5G networks. Demand for Qorvo's products has been
robust, driven by the ramp of massive MIMO antennas. We are engaged with multiple customers with our
GaN amplifiers, and we are well positioned to benefit from this multiyear technology upgrade cycle.

In our connectivity and broadband businesses, we accelerated shipments of WiFi 6 solutions and secured
cable amplifier design wins to support increased data to the home. During the quarter, we expanded the
global customer base of our WiFi 6 solutions, including our front-end modules and BAW filters.

In defense markets, we sampled our broadband 100- and 130-watt millimeter wave power amplifiers.
These products expand our portfolio of GaN-based solid-state amplifiers for millimeter wave applications,
including satcom, radar and electronic warfare. We're seeing strong growth driven by multiyear defense
programs and the acquisition of Custom MMIC further expands our capabilities in this market.

QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

In programmable power management, we enjoyed growth in data center, computing and gaming consoles
with our differentiated solutions. Qorvo's programmable ICs reduced solution size and cost, improved
system reliability and shortened system development time. We serve a broad range of industrial,
commercial and consumer markets and current demand is especially strong, driven by data centers.

After the quarter closed, we introduced our high sensitivity point-of-care diagnostic test platform and
cartridges, utilizing acoustic resonator technology for veterinary applications. Qorvo's diagnostic platform
has the potential to improve veterinary diagnostics by delivering central lab performance to the veterinary
clinic at point of care.

For the June quarter, the environment remains challenging and fluid, while constraints to global supplier
limited, the impact to global demand remains unclear given the uncertainty around the magnitude,
duration and geographic reach of COVID-19. We are confident, however, that the long-term secular drivers
in our end markets remain compelling. We believe our technologies and operations are more important
than ever as we support global deployments in 5G handsets and infrastructure, along with defense, WiFi 6
and IoT.

We are also adding new capabilities in programmable power management, ultra-wideband based precision
location and point-of-care diagnostic testing. We are operating well, focused on keeping our employees,
partners and communities healthy while supporting our customers. I'm proud of the team and thankful for
their efforts in helping the world stay connected.

And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark for more color on Q4 and our outlook for June.

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's revenue for the fourth quarter was $788 million, $18
million above the midpoint of our updated guidance and driven by stronger-than-expected mobile demand.
Mobile revenue of $556 million exceeded our expectations as mobile handset demand was greater and
global supply chain disruptions less impactful than we anticipated at the time of our early March update.
We expect mobile to decline sequentially in the June quarter due principally to COVID-19-related demand
effects.

IDP revenue improved sequentially in the March quarter to $232 million on infrastructure and WiFi growth.
We expect IDP revenue to increase again in the June quarter, returning to strong year-over-year growth
on 5G infrastructure demand, the ramp of WiFi 6 and sustained strength in defense.

Non-GAAP gross margin in the March quarter was 49.6%, with better-than-expected manufacturing costs
and favorable mix effects. Though we expect a sequential decline in gross margin in the June quarter, our
efforts to improve the portfolio, rightsize our manufacturing footprint and drive productivity are yielding
favorable results. As a result, we expect year-over-year gross margin expansion in the June quarter
despite a top line adversely impacted by COVID-19 and trade effects. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the
March quarter were $181 million, in line with expectations and up due in part to recent acquisitions.

Non-GAAP net income in the March quarter was $185 million, and diluted earnings per share was $1.57, a
record fourth quarter result for Qorvo.

Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $214 million, and CapEx was $35 million, yielding free
cash flow of $179 million. We repurchased $125 million of shares during the quarter.

Our full year free cash flow for fiscal '20 was over $780 million and approximately 24% of sales. Free cash
flow growth will continue to be a focus of this management team, and we will provide an updated free
cash flow target in the context of a broader financial outlook once our full year view is clear. Our free cash
flow generation underpins a strong credit profile.

We have ample liquidity and low leverage. We ended the quarter with $715 million of cash, an untapped
revolver and no near-term maturities. The weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt is June
of 2027. With this financial flexibility, we can focus on advancing technology, supporting customers and

QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

making prudent organic and inorganic investments that support long-term earnings and free cash flow
growth.

On that note, during the March quarter, we completed the purchase of Decawave, a pioneer and leading
supplier of ultra-wideband solutions and Custom MMIC, a leader in the high-performance GaAs and GaN
products. With Decawave, we see a wide array of solutions emerging with this wireless technology, and
we expect the business to contribute materially to Qorvo over time. Custom MMIC fits perfectly within
our defense products business and is on track to be accretive this year. Both of these acquisitions were
quickly integrated, and our new colleagues enjoy the full support and capabilities of Qorvo to help develop
products and serve customers.

Turning to our June quarter outlook. We expect revenue between $710 million and $750 million or $730
million at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 47.5%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings
per share of $1.13 at the midpoint of our guidance.

Our revenue range for the June quarter is wider than normal, reflecting more uncertainty in our markets
and the broader economy due to the effects of COVID-19. While we believe the near-term demand picture
is clear enough to provide June quarter guidance, there is too much uncertainty around out-quarter
demand and potentially global supply disruptions to provide a view on Qorvo's full fiscal year.

In the June quarter, we expect continued robust mobile 5G growth, though on lower base handset volumes
and a return to year-over-year growth for IDP. More specifically, for mobile, we expect June quarter sales
to decrease sequentially with parts of Asia partially offsetting weakness in the rest of the world.

Our current outlook had smartphone units decreasing over 10% for the calendar year. However, we still
see 5G-enabled handset demand for calendar '20 in line to slightly below what we guided in early March.
For IDP, we project June quarter sales to increase sequentially on 5G infrastructure customer demand
and the ramp of WiFi 6 as investment in the latest wireless infrastructure to support connectivity is more
important than ever.

On gross margin, our June quarter guide of approximately 47.5% is down sequentially due in part to lower
volumes, though as mentioned, up year-over-year. We expect the ongoing effects of COVID-19 to weigh
on our utilization. That, along with continued throughput improvements we've made in Richardson, afford
us the flexibility to defer further investment in Farmers Branch until additional capacity is needed.

We are continuously monitoring the demand and supply effects of COVID-19 and are sizing our inventories
and cost structure accordingly. With uncertainty in the demand profile, we intend to maintain lean
inventories, both in-house and in the channel.

Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to increase in the June quarter to approximately $187 million
on higher personnel costs, including incremental costs associated with the full quarter effect of recently
acquired businesses. Net interest expense will increase slightly on a lower average cash balance and lower
deposit rates in the June quarter versus the March quarter, which benefited from higher deposit rates and
had deposit balances over $1 billion prior to closing Decawave and Custom MMIC. We expect our June
quarter non-GAAP tax rate to be between 8% and 8.5%

We project capital expenditures in the near-term to remain consistent with spend over the last several
quarters. In fiscal '20, our spend was $164 million or just over 5% of sales. Our spend in fiscal '21 will
remain focused on BAW, GaN and other areas, which advance a differentiated position for Qorvo to best
serve customer needs.

As the March quarter results and our June outlook could show, Qorvo is operating well through a
challenging period while helping customers grow in 5G, WiFi, IoT and defense and other critical markets.

In closing, I'd like to join Bob in thanking Qorvo employees for their efforts during this time.
Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

Harsh V. Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And hope everybody in the Qorvo family is safe, and congratulations on excellent guide in these very
uncertain times. Mark, I have 1 for you on gross margin. Your December to March revenues were down,
call it, 90-something percent. You're down a little bit in June, but your December to March gross margin
stayed relatively flat within 30 basis points, but there's a material decline here in June. Could you maybe
help us understand if inventory build or lack of it is the factor here? Or what else is going on maybe?

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

Well, I mean, there's a lot in that question, Harsh. I think what I'll start with is on the third to fourth
quarter, we were about 100 basis points -- little over 100 basis points better than we thought we would
be. That was split, about half of that was favorable manufacturing costs, and about half of that was mix.

As far as third to fourth quarter sequential, it was largely driven by more favorable manufacturing
variances. As we move into the June quarter, we end up with lower volumes and then the manufacturing
costs are not as favorable. And then we have some product mix effects that are drags as well. So I think
the overall message, Harsh, is we continue -- nothing's changed in our story here. We're actively working
to continuously improve our gross margins despite trade effects and COVID, we've been making progress
and you see that in our results.

And as far as inventories -- yes, on inventories, Harsh, I'm never going to say we're satisfied with
inventories where they are. But we're in a reasonably good position. If you compare our inventory levels
to historical levels and then also compared to others that we've seen in the space, inventories were up
sequentially as we thought they would have been but as I mentioned, the turns are on the better side of
okay, historically speaking. And then our channel remains very, very healthy. Yes, we're continuing to work
inventories to keep them in line despite the uncertainty. And we certainly want to do our best to balance
keeping inventory levels low, while ensuring that we are not a constrained part of the supply chain.

Harsh V. Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I appreciate that, Mark. And my follow up, you talked about very strong sort of growth or sort of talking
just generally very strong trends in 5G handsets. I was curious if you could talk about the customer
breadth that you have, both in what you're seeing in shipments, particularly, I suppose, that's China and
then also your design wins that you have racked up for the year?

Steven E. Creviston
Corporate VP & President of Mobile Products

Harsh, this is Eric. I'll take that. I can tell you that the vast majority of the work we're doing these days,
both with our new product development and also engagements with customers is around 5G. Of course,
there's still some LTE Advanced going on as well. But customer portfolios are largely changing over to 5G
across the board. And we're seeing the transition now down into the middle tiers of the handset portfolio.
Interestingly, there's the same kind of $5 to $7 worth of content increase, whether you're going off of a
$20 to $25 base for a very advanced 4G smartphone or whether you're coming off a $5 to $7 baseline
from a mid-tier smartphone, you're still seeing roughly the same absolute dollars. So as you go down in
the portfolio, you see the percentage increase due to the 5G content has really increased significantly.

QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

We'll go next to Karl Ackerman with Cowen.

Karl Fredrick Ackerman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Two questions, if I may. Just first on some of the acquisitions you've made. I was curious, what revenue
contribution are you assuming for both Decawave and Custom MMIC in June? And as it relates to
Decawave, should we expect new design wins across automotive and mobile to filter into the model later
this year? And maybe just touch on the level of design activity for your ultra-wideband solutions and
customer engagement with that technology.

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

Maybe, Karl, I'll just start with the revenue picture. And I'm not going to -- we've done 4 acquisitions
over the past year. They're all tracking in line with expectations. They've all been successfully integrated.
Decawave and Cavendish, we've been clear that they're dilutive transactions. They have revenue, but
they're technologies that we're investing in, so they're dilutive. The programmable power management
business, which were effectively on a year at this point, we're lapping that acquisition. But that business
and Custom MMIC are both accretive. And so 2 different types of acquisitions that I've grouped the 4 into.

I'm not going to break down each acquisition, each quarter and what it's contributing or not. They're all
obviously -- they were reflected in the March update when we provided that, that was considered. They're
obviously contemplated in the June guide. What I can give you is that in fiscal '20, these acquisitions
were, in total, around $60 million of revenue. That includes programmable power management and the
others. In fiscal '21, we expect those to be over $110 million combined. So hopefully, that provides you
some perspective.

Steven E. Creviston
Corporate VP & President of Mobile Products

Yes. This is Eric. I'll talk a bit about the Decawave and ultra-wideband outlook. As we mentioned last
quarter, we strongly believe that the unique capabilities with the impulse radio ultra-wideband for very
precise location capability as well as proximity awareness and security would lead to becoming ubiquitous
in all mobile handsets. And then from that point, the mobile handset becomes the infrastructure and then
ties you into your smart home and your automobile and a host of other applications. And I could tell you,
our enthusiasm has only grown since then. So since we've integrated the Decawave team, the interaction
with the mobile community has certainly increased, and we're strongly engaged across both platform
providers as well as handset OEMs working to get them enabled as soon as possible.

But Decawave came to us with a strong pipeline to begin with across many other applications such as
automotive and IoT. So we continue to see that portfolio grow. The engagements are strong and growing
across like asset tags, smart home controls, various sort of industrial IoT applications. And notably, the
ability to have precise location and proximity awareness is quite applicable when you look at contact
tracing sort of applications for COVID-19. It complements the BOE approaches, which are being rolled out
first, of course, by providing a much, much more accurate distance measurements between folks. So we
have multiple customers already adapting the tags or IoT things they were doing to include the contact
tracing capability as well. So that's also, of course, driven a strong uptick with several customers that were
already in the pipeline for Decawave.

Karl Fredrick Ackerman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's very helpful. For a follow-up, if I may. In your prepared comments, you highlighted you offered
the complete main path for a 5G smartphone. That really stands out and highlights the breadth of your
offering that I don't think anyone else can match. Do you see the market evolving where smartphone
providers want to increasingly integrate the main path that will enable you to have an expanded role over
the next few years?

QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Thank you. Yes, I think we mentioned a quarter or 2 that, frankly, it's a bit ahead of our
expectations. We expected more of the portfolio to remain discrete. But the fact is size is such a premium
in today's handsets and the complexity of 5G has made it such that really integration is quite helpful to
the customer. It helps with performance as well as size and include other features. So there's no going
back. We don't typically see things reverse and go back to discrete. So we're running as fast as we can to
complement our already complete line of integrated solutions with the latest bands and capabilities and
new features and so forth with new performance -- higher performance, smaller filters and so forth adding
to the benefit there. But we think it's a trend that's absolutely central to providing customers what they
need for 5G.

Operator

And we'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.

Jamison Yeol Phillips-Crone
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

This is Jamison Phillips calling in for Ambrish. So first off, I was hoping you guys could talk about your
guidance and beyond that. So it's very strong given the environment. I was hoping you could give us
some color on how you think about seasonality for the September quarter and beyond.

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Jamison, this is Mark. Yes, I mean, asking for any additional guidance beyond the June quarter, I
think we've just got to acknowledge that we're in unprecedented times. The global economy slowing
down, and every company is wrestling with the risks in their outlooks. So I simply can't be specific beyond
what we've provided for the June quarter. What I can say is that we believe in the growth potential of
our markets. More broadly, the demand for connectivity, and this requires more and better RF. On our
business, specifically, we're operating well. And this current backdrop is highlighting how well we are
operating. We have a good balance sheet. We're serving customers with the best technology and products,
and we're sizing business appropriately.

So as a result, we're able to provide what we believe is a solid guide for June. Beyond June, it's tougher
to see. Currently, as we look to September quarter, we see top line growth, probably high single-digits
percent or maybe a bit more. We expect gross margin to be up, but modestly in part because utilization is
weighing on us more than we had planned it would.

And then finally, OpEx. You could expect to see around the levels through the year as we guided for the
June quarter. But beyond that, yes, there's just not enough clarity in the market. I think we're in good
company with most companies that are not providing full year guidance. I want to mention that risk
factors are very important here. COVID-19, trade and other risk factors need to be considered. And it --
those risk factors make it a particularly difficult time to forecast.

Jamison Yeol Phillips-Crone
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up is, I was wondering if you could touch base on your 10%
customers and how you've seen it grow, I guess, year-over-year, I guess, year-on-year change between
them?

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

We had 2 10% customers, and they can change. But -- so I can't really give comps year-over-year and all
that, I typically don't. But we had 2 10% customers this quarter, and that's all I typically say.

We'll go next to Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.

William Chapman Peterson
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Nice job on the results and guide in the midst this pandemic. My first question, you mentioned trade a
few time, but I was hoping you can elaborate more on that. Did you see this result in any pull-ins from
customers, particularly in China? Did you see more, let's say, demand you would expect from Huawei, for
example? Are you expecting this to go beyond Huawei? I'm just curious on what impacts you're discussing
when you think about your June outlook as well as the second half outlook as well?

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Bill -- and Bob will build on this. I think that the reason I mentioned trade a few times is certainly, as
we're looking at year-over-year comps, the trade effects have been -- have had a substantial impact on
us, March quarter year-over-year. And it remains a risk factor in our business. Though I would say that the
primary contributor to the current outlook is related to the effects of COVID-19. So just to be clear there.

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

Not much really to add, Bill. I'm sure a lot of you saw the recent Department of Commerce order. And
after extensive review by our legal team, we feel the rules are not applicable to our products. That doesn't
mean something new might come out. And I think that's the other thing. When you think about this, there
is a lot of saber rattling between the 2 countries right now, and we're being cautious. But we didn't see
any pull-ins or anything like that as a result of any of this. We're seeing it that -- we're seeing demand,
end demand of customers, like Mark talked about. Our channel is very healthy between us and our
customers, and I personally had very high level meetings via video with our customers in China. And I feel
real comfortable with their inventories of our products and how their sell-through is going.

William Chapman Peterson
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. Next, if we -- you didn't discuss it, but when we think about millimeter wave in
phones, and I know you discussed it last quarter, but it feels that you guys keep making progress on that.
I was hoping you can give us an update on your millimeter wave opportunities, and if you see this as a
potential revenue driver later this year or early next year?

Steven E. Creviston
Corporate VP & President of Mobile Products

Yes. I'll cover handsets. I'm sure James would love to jump in as well and talk about infrastructure. Really,
not a lot of change quarter-over-quarter. We continue to advance the technology and work on product
demonstration vehicles and so forth. This is the year where there's going to be some commercial rollout.
It would give the chance to prove the business case and really tackle a lot of the infrastructure concerns
with millimeter wave. We like our technology. We think we can really help in terms of efficiency around the
antenna and signal quality and so forth, it's really going to come down to the business case in the network
environment.

Yes. Bill, from my perspective, millimeter wave, still a really small part of the overall rollout of 5G.
Certainly, below 6 gigahertz is the majority. And today, that's really in China. We've seen an uptick in the
rollout of sub-6 gigahertz just in the last period, and we expect to be well on track with what we're doing
in China.

And we'll go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Can you hear me okay?

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sir.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. Bob, you talked about the smartphone market in calendar 2020, potentially being down 10%
year-over-year in your remarks. And I fully appreciate the lack of visibility today in the marketplace. But
assuming the market does come in sort of consistent with that outlook, do you think, given the strength in
5G, the relative resilience of 5G and given some of the socket wins that you guys are aware of, you think
you can grow the mobile segment in calendar 2020 in that sort of backdrop?

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

First, let me comment. Both Mark and I both comment, it was over 10%, just to be clear. And we'll really
have to see how the year plays out to answer that. I mean the percentage of 5G phones now is obviously
going to be a lot greater, there's a lot more dollar content that Eric's talked about $5 to $7, whether it's
mid-tier or high tier. So definitely, the opportunity is out there. We think there's going to be a nice TAM
this year in 5G, a lot of growth there. But we'll see how it plays out.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, Mark, a great job on the free cash flow generation in the year. You
obviously kind of stayed away from giving guidance for fiscal '21. But based on your CapEx commentary
and the intention to be disciplined there, given that you did have multiple acquisitions in the year, I would
think CapEx stays kind of around 5% of revenue, M&A, maybe less aggressive, and that would leave room
for buybacks. But how are you thinking about the balance there for the next couple of quarters?

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Toshiya, yes, we're pleased with what we've done on free cash flow as it relates to improving it. We're
not pleased that we've reached any sort of final result. It's more of a way point for us. So we're pleased
with that. As far as CapEx levels and capital allocation priorities, nothing has changed in the story there.
We've said that we would be moving down towards 5% to 7% of sales. Going forward, and there's no
change there. We got to 5% a bit faster than we thought. But I think you can attribute that to, in part, the
discipline and consistency of the team in enforcing capital discipline.

So I can't give you a percent of sales because then you'll back into the sales if I give a number. So I said
the next few quarters will run around what we've been running the past several quarters. So it could be
$40 million, $50 million, at most.

QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

As far as capital allocation, we're still below our leverage target. We're still actively looking at acquisitions,
and nothing's changed there around seeking value-creating acquisitions, principally technology assets for
the mobile business and bolt-ons and technology for IDP. And that's what you've seen us do over the past
year with over $1 billion worth of acquisitions. We never have provided rate and pace on the repurchase.
We did repurchase $125 million in this last quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $515 million in
addition to the $1 billion we spent on acquisitions. We'll report in the June quarter that we repurchased
some shares, I can say that. But amounts and future repurchases will be a function of the opportunities
that we have for cash, our leverage, our latest view on the outlook and other factors.

Operator

We'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.

Edward Francis Snyder
Charter Equity Research

Mark, you mentioned unfavorable mix in June is one of the factors that's pressuring gross margins. But
with mobile down and IDP up, shouldn't we see the opposite effect? Or is there a mix issue with IDP?
And if I could, James, I think guidance last quarter was that IDP would return to growth year-over-year
in March. It looks like you just missed that mark. Was this a shortfall in area? And then also, did you get
clearance to sell 5G products to Huawei?

And I'm sorry, but Eric, real quick. It sounds like your revenue mix is moving heavily to Korea and Asia.
Is that a trend we can expect to extend in the next calendar year? And how would you characterize the
uptake of Samsung's baseband and more importantly, your content on it relative to the other baseband
you support?

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

All right. Mark, do you remember the first question? It was a 5-part question. It was mix in June and...

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So Ed, it's a good question, and a nuanced one. I'm not sure if you picked up. I did say it was a
product mix, specifically. So you are correct that the IDP business is going to be a high percent of sales
in the June quarter. But that aside, mix effects overall are the smaller part of this compared to just the
manufacturing variances and the lower revenues.

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Mark. James, there was a question about year-over-year growth in IDP just being off by just a
slight little bit and can you sell 5G components to Huawei?

James L. Klein
Corporate VP and President of Infrastructure & Defense Products

Yes. Let me handle the Huawei one first. We are shipping some products that are exempt from restrictions
to Huawei, but they're immaterial in the amount of IDP's revenue in the fourth quarter and in our
guidance in Q1. And we currently have not received any licenses to ship products from the IDP portfolio to
Huawei.

As far as year-over-year growth, Ed, Mark had said last quarter that it was a long putt, and we got awful
close. I think we're headed for a really nice Q1 and be able to get back into year-over-year growth. Now
we did have a really nice Q4 as well, as Mark and Bob talked about, we ended a great year in defense,
where we had year-over-year total growth for defense business. We began the ramps in both 5G and WiFi
6 with a broad portfolio of products, including GaN. GaN's a great example there. We brought a lot of
products, different frequencies and different power levels to the market, and we almost doubled our GaN

last quarter, and I suspect we'll do it again. So overall, really pleased with the growth that we had in the
quarter, and I'm looking forward to Q1.

Steven E. Creviston
Corporate VP & President of Mobile Products

Yes. And Ed, I'll talk about your questions on mix, Korea and China as well as alignment with LSI and
so forth. So yes, certainly, in the near term, the mix towards Korea and China is pretty real. That's
because 2 factors, really. First of all, when you say Korea, a year ago, we're just turning the corner and
realigning our portfolio with Samsung. That's gone tremendously well, and it does continue to get better
and better. So as they're adding more content, adding more premium content, a lot of that is addressable
by us. So we expect that trend to absolutely continue, and it's a good thing. We want to continue to
grow with Samsung and align across mass tier as well as integrated -- or excuse me, as well as their
premium tier and bring full integrated content to both of those tiers as well as advanced tuning and power
management. So great alignment there. It should become a mix thing that way as we're catching up and
then even getting better with our share.

And then China as well. I mean that's just a fact that our customers are doing so well. If you look Vivo
and Xiaomi, really mixing towards 5G. We've got complete portfolio to support them. They're serving not
only China domestic, but they're also exporting more and more. So we've got a lot we can do to help them
across our portfolio. So naturally, yes, we're sort of mixing that way because they're doing really well in
the market currently. So that's good.

Regarding LSI, Samsung's own baseband, we love working with the guys. Of course, great partners.
We're aligned well. But I don't think there's anything particularly different there versus all the baseband
manufacturers. We're winning content in pretty much every category we sell across all the baseband
manufacturers. So it's good, and we absolutely want to support them all.

Operator

We'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.

Blayne Peter Curtis
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just kind of curious, 2 things. The shape of the 5G, you kept your number and Qualcomm kept their
number. So obviously, the mix of 5G is higher. I'm just kind of curious how if you look at March and what
you're expecting in June, how the shape of that deployment looks versus 3 months ago? There's been a
lot of talk about potential delays. I'm kind of just curious what you've already seen. And then can you just
comment on how big China was in the March quarter? That would be helpful as well.

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

Blayne, could you clarify, was that -- when you said shape of 5G, was that an infrastructure question or
ancillary question?

Blayne Peter Curtis
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Handset question. Sorry. You said you kept your 5G number effectively, you said in line to slightly below.
So that number was 250 million, if I remember, kind of just curious...

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

That's correct. That's what we said in March. Correct.

QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

What you've seen in the first half of the year, March and June and the kind of the shape of those
deployments, if it's the same or has it changed a bit?

Steven E. Creviston
Corporate VP & President of Mobile Products

Yes. So I guess, we don't generally break it down by quarter necessarily. I think the key thing is we're
seeing each region come into and come out of this virus-related demand and supply scenario differently.
So it's a little challenging to model. I think what's very clear is first half of the calendar year is significantly
impacted. And for every person that doesn't buy a 4G phone in the first half. When he goes to buy one
in the second half, it's more likely he's going to buy a 5G phone. So we think if there's any sort of silver
lining, which it really isn't much of a silver lining, but the good news for our industry, at least, is that
phones that don't sell in the first half will come back as more 5G content in the second half, more than
likely.

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Blayne, on China, we typically don't break that out. It's material, as you know, it ended up being less
as we ended the quarter and reported it than it was in our guide. I can say that. And then if you wanted to
know about Huawei, specifically, it held up a better than expected, but it was, I'd say, in line with what we
said, not a material part of our March quarter variance, and it remains a fraction of what we used to have
with that customer in the past. Expect that customer to remain under 5% in the June quarter.

Operator

We'll go next to Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities.

Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions. One on mobile, then one on IDP. First, on 5G, Eric, maybe you can talk about what
sort of content expansion you're seeing in early 5G designs? And as we go to second half, I'm guessing,
there's still some flagships that will be launched. And also, you're probably going to see much more in the
mid-range and even in the low end. So I'm just wondering how that content expansion might change as
we go into second half?

Steven E. Creviston
Corporate VP & President of Mobile Products

Yes. We're -- we talked in the past about what's driving the 5G content. Of course, there's much tighter
requirements on filtering. There's more bands generally added to the phone. There's also dual connect
scenarios where the phones have to work on 4G and 5G at the same time, which drives a lot of content
around the antennas, both tuning and switching and filtering and so forth to pull all that off. And so, as I
mentioned earlier in the call, I think we see about a $5 to $7 increase in content per handset, and that's
relatively constant, whether you're adding it to a premium smartphone or a mid-tier smartphone. I'm sure
as we get into mass tier later on, there'll be some more fine-tuned regional designs. But for now, we're
seeing, as it continues to mix down through the portfolio, that dollar content adder is remaining pretty
consistent.

Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then on the IDP, we've been hearing a lot about China being very aggressive in terms of
rollouts. I believe they're talking about almost 0.5 billion base stations -- I'm sorry, 0.5 million base
stations this year. I'm just curious, obviously, you're guiding for growth in IDP next quarter. I'm just trying
to understand how that plays out for you guys. Do you see that in 1 quarter? Is it -- do you expect that to
continue for the rest of the year? I'm just trying to understand how that roll out into your business.

QORVO, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Corporate VP and President of Infrastructure & Defense Products

Yes. Definitely agree with the over 0.5 million base stations deployed. We think the number will be closer
to 600,000, if not, perhaps, more. How we play is, we've got, obviously, a broad range of customers in the
space. And as we talked about in prepared remarks, we're ramping both GaN and small signal components
into that broad set of customers. So definitely going to continue to be a growth engine for us.

As far as how it continues, we definitely think deployments continue in China throughout the year with
additional tenders offered, and then it will pick up again in the first part of next year as they do additional
sets of deployments. We're also expecting, as we get into next year, the deployments to start to pick up in
the U.S. and rest of the world.

Operator

We'll go next to Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Mark, now that we're done with fiscal 2020, can you give us how big your largest customer was in terms
of percent of revenue?

Mark J. Murphy
Chief Financial Officer

I won't do on the call, Tim. I mean we'll be releasing the K, and you'll see that in the SEC financials here
when we report that.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess, I had a question on Huawei. So I think you just said that they'd be like less than
5% for June. So that implies that, that's going to get cut basically more than half Q-on-Q. I guess the
question is, if you look at their annual report, they have more than 110 days worth of inventory. It was
up like 35 days year-over-year. They've obviously seen some of these restrictions coming, so they seem
to be ordering ahead of all these restrictions. So I guess, the question is like what sort of shelf life does
the stuff that you've shipped to them have? Because you're one of the only ones that where the revenue
with them has sort of re-expanded and breach that 10% range again, but it's coming down in June. So I'm
just wondering, is that the beginning of inventory digestion? Or you think it's just weak smartphone sell-
through?

Robert A. Bruggeworth
President, CEO & Director

Tim, I want to make sure I understood your question. Number one, Huawei was not even close to the 10%
customer in March, not even close. And year-over-year, you guys will be amazed that the growth that
this company has put up less Huawei. They're not a significant customer. In June, they're even less. So I
don't understand your question. Second, when you say shelf life, I'm not sure I understand. We deal with
Huawei. I talk to them. They don't have our product stockpiled somewhere. I can tell you that. So I'm not
sure how to answer your question.

Rajvindra S. Gill

Congrats on the solid results. Just wanted to get a sense from you in terms of adoption of GaN base
stations relative to LDMOS in the 5G infrastructure deployment in China, and how your differentiation in
that technology is going to lend itself to perhaps more market share gains throughout the year?

James L. Klein
Corporate VP and President of Infrastructure & Defense Products

Yes. We're seeing rapid adoption of GaN across numerous customers in that space and certainly, in sub-6
gigahertz space. We believe we differentiate in a broad set of areas. I think we've got great performing
technology that we've had in place for the better part of 20 years. We've got a fantastic reliability. And
we've been continuously adding feature sets and scale over the last couple of years in preparation for this
ramp. So I definitely do believe that we'll continue to grow at or faster than the rate of the market.

Rajvindra S. Gill
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

And you touched upon WiFi 6, the adoption there and it's getting certified. What are some of the major
applications that you're seeing now for WiFi 6 in your products?

James L. Klein
Corporate VP and President of Infrastructure & Defense Products

Yes. WiFi 6 started with flagship smartphones, and I'll let maybe Eric talk about that. But it's clearly
stimulated the CPE side of the business to integrate WiFi 6 in their designs. And we see that happening
really across the board with high-end retail, but also in the MSO rollouts. It's accelerating, service
providers are also adopting the distributed technology and bring WiFi 6 to -- into that part of the market.
So for us, it's very, very broad brand. We bring a great set of front-end modules and filtering capability to
the space and think we'll continue to have a significant amount of success in the market.

Steven E. Creviston
Corporate VP & President of Mobile Products

Yes. And on the mobile side as well, yes, we're seeing good traction. In fact, it was -- it's rapidly mixing.
Our WiFi business is rapidly mixing towards WiFi 6, and especially as you move and add the new 7.2
gigahertz capability and so forth, we do have a lot of unique capability to bring to that. We participate
specifically on the chip-on-board part of the market, not the SIP part of the market. And so yes, it's
growing rapidly now. And I think the higher bandwidth and so forth is a key feature.
