LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Lam Research Corporation's December Quarter 2019 Financial Results
Conference Call.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia, Corporate VP of Investor
Relations. Ma'am, please begin.

Tina Correia
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference
call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial
results for the December 2019 quarter and our outlook for the March 2020 quarter. The press release
detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. The
release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the
presentation slides that accompany today's call.

Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying
slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be
presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between
GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last
until 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.

With that, I will hand the call over to Tim.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Tina, and welcome, everyone. In the December quarter, Lam delivered revenues and diluted
earnings per share above the midpoint of guidance, marking another quarter of solid execution and closing
out a year of strong performance in calendar 2019. Consistent with our comments throughout this year,
we entered 2020 with increasing momentum and an improved spending mix environment, which we
believe will lead to outperformance by Lam.

I have now completed my first year as CEO of Lam Research, and I am incredibly proud of what our
people have achieved. Underpinning our strong financial results this past year has been a company-wide
focus on execution and an emphasis on our culture where all employees can perform their best. I want to
thank Lam's employees across our global organization for their efforts and, of course, our partners and
customers for their valued support.

I also want to take a moment to address the coronavirus situation. Our concern, first and foremost, is
with the health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners. And with this in mind, we have
implemented precautionary measures within our global business operations. Additionally, we are donating
to Chinese relief efforts to support the people and communities impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.

Now turning to our business results. In calendar 2019, we generated solid operating cash flows, and at
the same time, we invested a company record in research and development dollars to fuel technology
innovation and product differentiation. Our EPS performance, the second best in the company's 40-year
history, was especially noteworthy given that memory spending declined significantly year-over-year in
2019. The impact of lower memory spending was partially mitigated by record revenue from our customer

support business group, highlighting the importance of our recurring spares and service opportunity to the
overall quality of earnings of the company.

In 2019, we also saw outstanding execution in our product organizations. We grew our revenue share of
WFE spend in memory and foundry logic, and we laid the foundation for additional gains as we recorded
our best ever performance in net penetration and defense application wins as measured by revenue
potential over the next 3 years. We are winning by focusing on high-volume manufacturing solutions for
emerging technology inflection challenges, including those associated with new scaling architectures, new
memory technologies and new materials. We are capitalizing on the learning from our installed base of
tools that today enable some of the industry's most critical etch and deposition applications.

For example, for the 3 most critical applications in 3D NAND, our Strata, ALTUS and Flex tools, each
process well over 1 million wafers per month in high-volume manufacturing, allowing us to partner early
and in a unique way with our customers on next-generation needs. In 2019, this led to the addition of
new products to our portfolio, such as the VECTOR DT, which is designed to address wafer stress problems
encountered during the high-volume production of 3D NAND stacks of 96 layers and above.

Similarly, we enhanced the capabilities of our Coronus product family to improve device yield at the wafer
edge by depositing encapsulating layers for bevel protection. These products expand our served share of
WFE spend but just as importantly, they exemplify our commitment to our customers' success.

In 2019, we improved to the #1 or #2 position at all of our largest customers that provide a competitive
ranking of their suppliers based on detailed quality, support and performance scorecards. In part, this
improvement is due to our investment in productivity-enhancing upgrades for our installed base. For
instance, Corvus wafer edge solutions have become key differentiators for our conductor and dielectric
etch systems in high-volume manufacturing and have been instrumental in helping our customers reduce
cost of ownership.

We announced in 2019 a Corvus-enabled self-maintaining etch tool that ran for 1 year in high-volume
manufacturing without human intervention. Multiple customers are now upgrading their installed base
tools to include this high value-added capability.

In 2019, we highlighted heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging as new areas of opportunity
to leverage our product portfolio and 3D learning to drive growth. In the December quarter, we built
on our growing momentum in this space with additional wins for our SABRE 3D electroplating system
at multiple advanced packaging customers. With these latest wins, we estimate that we have gained
more than 15 points of market share in the last 2 years, and we have firmly established ourselves as the
technology leader in the increasingly important through-silicon via market.

Another area of growth for the company has been in atomic layer deposition or ALD. Our ALD solutions
are gaining significant traction in the market by delivering best-in-class film properties, along with high
productivity and low defects. Due to the inherent advantages of higher film quality and [ comparability ],
our Striker ALD oxide systems are replacing older process alternatives, such as spin on dielectric
and SACVD for critical applications, pulling more WFE spending into our served market. Similarly, RC
scaling requirements are driving increased demand for our single-wafer Striker carbide and ALTUS ALD
metallization systems. When used for low-k carbide liner spacer applications, our Striker system has been
able to achieve 30% better RC properties versus competing batch tools.

For metallization, we closed out 2019 on a high note, with significant wins in logic foundry, for our ALTUS
systems as customers look to replace the conventional barrier fill sequence with an integrated ALD
approach to lower device resistance in a cost-effective way.

Across all products, we exited 2019 with approximately 61,000 chambers in our installed base. Our
installed base revenues grew year-over-year and reached record levels in 2019, with significant
contribution from our Reliant business, which also reached record levels.

Productivity upgrades and solutions grew more than 30% year-over-year, as we have worked to help
customers enhance the performance of their existing assets. Furthermore, we signed several new

multiyear customer support contracts. These multiyear contracts enable Lam to significantly reduce
customers' running costs, while generating a recurring revenue stream for Lam.

Now turning to WFE. We estimate 2019 WFE ended in the $46 billion to $47 billion range, slightly higher
than our prior mid-$40 billion estimate. The increase was driven predominantly by higher foundry logic
spending. For calendar 2020, assuming no material impact from coronavirus on our full year outlook, our
view calls for WFE spend in the mid- to high $50 billion range, supported by sustained strong spending in
Foundry and Logic, and significantly for Lam, improved spending in Memory led first by NAND. Overall, we
expect spending in Memory and foundry logic segments to be up year-on-year in 2020.

To wrap up, Lam delivered strong financial performance in calendar 2019. And as our March quarter
guidance suggests, we're in a great position to drive higher in 2020 with the improvement in Memory
spending. Lam's product pipeline is very strong, with more innovation on the way, and we look forward to
sharing more with you at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3.

Thanks. And now here's Doug.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in the middle of
what I know is a very busy earnings season.

We concluded calendar year 2019 with a strong December quarterly performance. Results ended up
better than we expected, primarily due to a little bit stronger NAND investment as well as an uptick in our
installed base business. Our installed base business delivered another record year and continued to be a
stable, profitable business for us. And as Tim mentioned, from an earnings per share perspective, it was
the second best year in our 40-year history.

The December quarter results came in over the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics, with diluted
earnings per share essentially at the high end of our guidance range. As Tim also noted, we're pleased
with our performance in calendar year 2019 and we delivered solid profitability levels within a challenging
memory environment.

As we discussed at our earnings call last quarter, there were continued strong investments in the Foundry
and Logic segments in the December quarter. We had the highest system revenue dollars for the Foundry
segment in our history, and the revenue concentration was at its highest level since the September 2016
quarter. Foundry spending continued its focus on the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes and it represented 36%
of our December quarter system revenue.

The Logic and Other segment grew in dollar terms and was essentially flat with the prior quarter intensity
level coming in at 12% of system revenues. It was the highest Logic and Other revenue level in dollar
terms in 2 years, driven by 10-nanometer, image sensors and other specialty markets.

For Memory, the combined segment decreased to 52% of system revenues from the September quarter,
which was at 64%. We had a decrease in the December quarter in the nonvolatile memory segment going
from 38% to 35%. However, from a dollar perspective, revenue in the segment actually increased.

The DRAM segment decreased from 26% to 17% of system revenue. NAND investment continues to be
focused on 64-, 96- and initial 128-layer devices. And DRAM spending continues to be primarily focused
on node transitions.

Revenues for the quarter were $2.584 billion, which was above the midpoint. In addition to the leading
edge foundry and logic strength I mentioned, we saw continued investments in the China region, with the
majority, again, coming from domestic Chinese customers. China geographic revenue came in at 29% of
total revenue in December.

Gross margin came in at 45.7%, 70 basis points above the midpoint. Strength in the December quarter
gross margin is related to customer and product mix as well as increased factory utilization levels relative
to the prior quarter.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

I'll remind you, as I always do, that actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business
volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and you should expect to see some variability quarter-
to-quarter.

Operating expenses for the December quarter came in at $481 million. Our variable compensation
spending was higher in the quarter as it's tied to the increased level of profitability. Spending in the
December quarter also increased due to the appreciation of the market during the quarter and the
resulting impact on the cost of our deferred compensation plan.

As I've mentioned in the past, we do hedge this to mitigate the exposure to the income statement.
However, because of the accounting rules, the offset to this expense shows up in other income and
expense. It's basically a neutral impact to earnings per share at the end of the day.

We continue to invest in our critical research and development programs, and you'll hear more about our
commitment to technology and productivity leadership at our upcoming Investors Day in March.

I'd also remind you that as we look ahead to the 2020 calendar year, we'll see the normal seasonal
spending increases related to the March quarter.

Operating income in the December quarter was $700 million and operating margin was 27.1%, essentially
at the midpoint of guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 12.5%.

I would like to highlight that the difference between the non-GAAP tax rate and the December quarter
GAAP tax rate, which was 23.5%, was related to the reversal of the tax benefit from the Altera stock-
based compensation case. I think you're seeing this from lots of companies in the technology space. You
should expect the fluctuations in the tax rate will occur quarter-to-quarter. And as we look into the rate for
the calendar year 2020, I expect it to be in the low-teens level.

Other income expense was up slightly from the prior quarter at a total of approximately $13 million in
expense. The main components of OI&E are interest income from our cash and investment balances offset
by interest expense related to the outstanding debt. You should expect that other income and expense will
fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on several market-related items, things like foreign exchange are what
I'm talking about.

Moving on to capital return. For the December quarter, a $167 million of cash was deployed in dividends
and $1 billion in share repurchase. As we've frequently done in the past, the share repurchases were done
through a structured share repurchase program that cover repurchases through the June 2020 quarter. We
remain on track with our commitment to capital return.

For calendar year 2019, we completed $3 billion of our current $5 billion buyback authorization. In total,
our capital return activities represented approximately 158% of free cash flow in 2019.

Diluted earnings per share was $4.01. Our diluted shares continue to decline, and we ended the December
quarter with diluted shares at approximately 150 million shares. This is the eighth consecutive quarter
where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5
million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you that the dilution schedule for the 2041
converts is available on our IR website for your reference.

Let me now move to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted
cash, decreased in the December quarter to $4.9 billion from $5.8 billion in the September quarter. The
decrease quarter-to-quarter was due to the share repurchase and dividend activity, offset by cash flows
from operations of $308 million.

And as I've mentioned before, when you see business levels grow, working capital levels generally
increase, which impacted our cash flow from operations in December. We concluded calendar year 2019
with the second highest level of free cash flow in the company's history at over $2.3 billion. I believe this
truly demonstrates the sustainability of our business through a lower industry spend period.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

DSO increased slightly due to the timing of collections to 72 days versus 69 days in the prior quarter.
Inventory turns improved to 3.7 turns from 3.2 in the September quarter. Both receivables and inventory
grew in dollars during December as business levels increased.

Noncash expenses included approximately $46 million for equity compensation, $49 million for
depreciation and $17 million for amortization. December quarter capital expenditures increased to $62
million from $39 million in the September quarter. Ending headcount as of the December quarter was flat
with the prior quarter at approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees. We expect that as revenue
levels are growing, we'll add headcount to support the increasing business.

So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2020 quarter. We're
expecting revenue of $2.800 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin of 46.5%, plus or minus 1
percentage point; operating margins of 28%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per
share of $4.55, plus or minus $0.40 based on a share count of approximately 149 million shares.

We see continued strength in Foundry and Logic spending going into the March quarter. And additionally,
we see NAND spending continue to increase going into 2020. The March quarter guidance reflects our
current view of the business environment, including our assessment with the potential impact from
the public health situation in China. We see business disruptions potentially with both customers and
suppliers, that are essentially extending the Lunar New Year holiday through February 9. Absent this
situation, our numbers would have been somewhat higher.

We also increased the revenue and EPS ranges to take into consideration the uncertainty of the impact
from these activities. We believe this is temporary, but the issue is developing day by day. I think we're
taking a prudent approach to what we're doing with the numbers.

So to conclude, we're well positioned heading into 2020. We're on a strong trajectory to outperform based
on our product portfolio as well as operational strategies. And that concludes my prepared remarks.
Operator, Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

My first question just is going to focus in on the domestic China market. Doug, you were kind enough to
tell us it was the majority of the China business in the December quarter. I'm wondering if you can help us
understand how much of a majority it was. And what was the split between sort of Memory and Logic? And
then as you look out to your WFE forecast growth of at least 20% in calendar year '20, how important is
the domestic China market? And how should we think about the Memory versus sort of the Logic Foundry
side of that?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, I'll answer and then I'll let Tim add on. Yes, John, I'm not going to get into the habit every quarter of
giving a precise quantification except to tell you, the majority in the December quarter was from domestic
China. And that's been the case the last couple of quarters. And the reason I've been mentioning that over
the last couple of quarters is it's different than the last several years have been where the majority has
actually come from the global multinationals.

Then your question relative to how we're looking into 2020 in China. I think 2019 probably finished with
WFE from the local China customers a little bit above $6 billion, something like that, and it's growing in
2020. And as we look into 2020, I think, John, probably it's up $2 billion to $3 billion is my best guess
from local China. And that spending is broad-based. It's NAND, it's DRAM, it's Foundry and Logic. So it's
not one or the other, it's a broad-based set of customer spending. Tim, you want to add anything?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

No, I think that pretty much covers it.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And then guys as my follow-on, just on WFE and kind of your share, Tim, as you talked about in your
prepared comments, you've done a nice job kind of gaining your share of WFE. Is 2020 a year where that
becomes a little bit more difficult with sort of the addition of EUV? Or how important is the EUV to your
growth projections this year? And as we think about EUV deployment, is that a good leading indicator for
your future business? Or how should we think about that?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Well, yes, I think that we've talked about EUV a number of times. And so I guess, maybe I'll just repeat
a few of the things I've said and maybe add a couple of comments. In general, what we've said is
that technology transitions themselves are very good for Lam. We have highlighted a number of times
that Lam's served market actually grows at each technology node within foundry logic, even with the
introduction of EUV. So really, what we want is we want the market and our customers to be able to keep
moving their technologies forward.

Specific to patterning, as you move from, say, 7- to 5-nanometer, even in the case of EUV, what you're
starting to see is the increased use of more high-quality hard masks moving away from spin on dielectric
towards deposition methods like PECVD, where Lam has a very strong position. And so in many cases, our
SAM is actually increasing because we're pulling in applications that before were actually done with older

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

processes and now they're coming into our more critical space. And so with that, we see SAM increase.
And therefore, even with EUV, we see a growing market for ourselves. Doug talked about highest dollars
from foundry logic. And that's just, I think, further evidence because we're seeing technology investments
right now at those EUV nodes.

Now as far as the leading indicator, sure, what we said is that EUV is, obviously, those shipments are signs
of these more complex technology nodes and again, our SAM grows where opportunity grows.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And then, John, the only thing I would add, as you think about wallet share of WFE going into 2020, I
think, our SAM and share in NAND is very good. And clearly, 2020, our view is going to be a stronger
investment period for the NAND industry as we've seen kind of pricing and profitability stabilize. So our
share of wallet, actually, in addition to the EUV commentary Tim had, is actually going to have a tailwind
from the fact that NAND spending, I think, will be stronger.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

That's right.

Operator

Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess first question on WFE. If you think about the roughly $8 billion to $10 billion increase year-on-year
into 2020, can you tell us how much of that is Memory versus foundry logic? Is that kind of a 80-20 split?
And then as part of that, are you including the material uplift in DRAM within that? Or is that something
that could be a source of further upside?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Great. C.J. great questions. I don't think we're going to give you the exact breakout, but I think
we've characterized it as -- I think maybe you can look back to what we said as we were exiting last
year. What we said was that we were seeing very strong spending in foundry logic, and that we were just
starting to see the early signs of improvement in NAND, and we felt that DRAM would come after the
NAND market had improved. And so I think what you're seeing in our outlook for 2020 is that starting to
play out, except for, again, sustained strong spending in Foundry and Logic. So maybe the emphasis on
sustained and a strong uptick in NAND spending, which, as Doug just commented, is a significant tailwind
for us in terms of our SAM as a percent of WFE.

Relative to DRAM, I think we characterized last year primarily as a technology investment year with
very little capacity additions. And I would say that, in general, our outlook this year is that, that doesn't
change much, at least until much later in the year. So I'd say primarily sustained strong Foundry and Logic
spending -- Foundry and Logic and a strong uptick in NAND.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great. And as a follow-up question on the service side. Thank you for providing the installed base
numbers. Very helpful. So up, I think, 12% in calendar '18, up 9% in calendar '19. Can you help us kind
of think about what the growth rate for service could look like? And is it fair to say that service in 2019
reached roughly mid-30s of total revenues?

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

So I'll take the last one. It wasn't quite that high, C.J., but it was comfortably above 30% in 2019. I'll give
you that much.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're -- I think that we're very confident. We've said that because of the growing installed base, the
overall customer support business grows every year. How it grows each year, I've talked a little bit about
the dynamic where depending on where you are in kind of utilization and spending and customers will
spend on different things. I highlighted a very strong year for us in 2019 on productivity upgrades, which
is one of the things customers do when they're looking to squeeze a little bit more out of the assets they
already have in their fabs, and we saw a lot of that last year. I think that as you transition now to a very
busy year and customers ramping aggressively, then you'll find yourself much more in these spares and
some of the value-added services part. But in general, given the dynamics of that market and our product
portfolio, we feel very confident about its ability to grow year-on-year with the installed base.

Operator

Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great job on the solid business execution. With the complexity of the manufacturing process, combined
with tighter specifications, maybe longer install and qual times, on average, from the time that you ship a
tool to the time that, that tool is put into full volume production, I think greenfield is around 6 months. Is
this lead time around the same time for conversion and incremental capacity expansion? And the reason
why I ask is, I just want to do a sanity check that for some of the memory shipment goodness that you're
seeing hopefully, this is going to be layering on the in sync with the demand pull for memory, which is
typically more kind of middle to kind of second half of the year weighted.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

I don't think we've really broken it out. In fact, I don't know that I could even really speak to a material
difference in lead times. I guess if I caught your question, it was -- does a conversion have approximately
the same lead time for the upgrade to take place and the product to be qual-ed. And if that was the
question, I would say that they're not dramatically different in terms of the cycle time.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. And Harlan, maybe I'm guessing what your question might be. I mean when we look at the way
spending occurred in the second half of '19 in NAND, and I'll remind you, we've been saying this for
a while. We exited the year, we believe the industry supply growth 30% year-on-year. Based on the
investments we saw occurring in the second half of '19, we believe that rate will decline, supply growth
will decline into the first half of '20, right? And so you're starting to see an uptick in investment that will
have a lag effect to it, and it won't immediately be producing output. I think that's inherently what you're
asking, right?

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Exactly. That's exactly right. And I appreciate the response. And actually, as a follow on to that. So you
guys had anticipated NAND bit supply growth exiting 2019 around 30% below the demand rate. I think
some of your customers in DRAM were saying bit supply kind of low to mid-teens, again, below kind of the
demand rate. So given the improving fundamentals in Memory this year, kind of extrapolating from your
customer equipment requirements this year, how do you guys see bit supply growth in NAND and DRAM
this year from kind of the depressed levels exiting last year?

Yes. So you've got it exactly right what we said. We exited the year well below the long-term demand
trend. And actually, even with the guidance we've just given, we actually see ourselves under growing
long-term demand this year in terms of bit supply growth, both in NAND and in DRAM.

Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Good job on results and guide. If I look at your top line growth historically, you outperformed WFE by 2x
or so. How should we think about your top line growth relative to WFE for this year?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Atif, the color I'd give you is, again, what I've already said is, I think it's an uptick in NAND investment.
Our SAM in NAND is really strong. Our share in NAND is really strong. And so to the extent that NAND
is driving an uptick in WFE, Lam will do really well. And you've seen that over the years, in times when
memory is spending more, we do real well; and when it's going the other way, we do less well. You should
expect the same thing. I'm not going to quantify it for you. Whether history is a good indicator, I'm not
completely sure. But I'll be very disappointed if we don't outperform this year.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Very helpful, Doug. And as a follow-up, your WFE number for this year is even bigger than what we were
thinking, $55 billion. Can you just talk about the opportunity in image sensor, advanced packaging, things
like that? I mean how big that number is in your WFE number for this year?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, we put that in our Logic and Other space. And what Tim indicated, as we expect Foundry and Logic
to grow 19% to 20%. And I don't know the exact image sensor number, so I can't answer your exact
question. It's a secular grower for sure. But in the grand scheme of how big Foundry and Logic is, it's
actually not all that big, but it is something we do really, really well in, in terms of the TSV aspect of image
sensors.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. All I would add is one of the reasons you've heard us talk a lot more about specialty technologies
and some of the products that we introduced in 2019, really focusing on heterogeneous integration and
advanced packaging and MRAM and the image sensors is because many of those items are somewhat
growing year-by-year from applications that are a little bit decoupled from the larger WFE cycle. And
so again, even last year as WFE was down, we were setting records and what we kind of refer to as our
specialty technologies business, which is primarily served by the Reliant tools. And so, yes, I think you can
continue to see us focus in those areas because they are places where our technology plays very well. And
as Doug said, we can -- by bringing the right technology and cost point, we can really gain quite a large
portion of that market.

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And congratulations on the strong and consistent execution. I have 2 questions as well. The first one, I'm
curious what goes into your WFE calculation just because it's such a strong outlook for this year? Is it
orders? Is it CapEx? Is it Memory pricing assumption, I'm just curious what goes into it? Then as part of
that, if you could also give us some color on how you think the shape of WFE looks like first half versus
second half?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I'll go through it, and then I'm sure Tim will have comments on top. I mean we go after this in a
couple of different ways. We talk to customers, first and foremost. Customers tell us, here's our plans,
here's what we think we're going to do kind of customer by customer, fab by fab. So that's the bottoms-up
approach to it. It doesn't mean it's exactly precisely correct, it changes. Customers' plans can change, but
that's one aspect of how we come at it.

The second aspect is actually a tops-down approach, which is we take a read on, okay, what is global GDP
going to look like this year? What does that mean for electronics demand? What does that mean for IC
unit and semi revenue growth? And what does that mean relative to wafers and technology? And then we
try to correlate the 2 approaches together. We don't always get it perfect, Vivek, but it's a pretty robust
process, and I think we do a decent job, but we don't always get it exactly right, but we do our best. I
don't know, Tim, anything?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, I think it stems, as Doug said, from pretty extensive conversations with customers. One of the
nice things about this business is that we have developed very deep relationships with customers, and
they're just as interested in having us deliver the technology they need on time. And so I think it's pretty
open sharing about when tools are needed, when the ramp is going to occur. So that factors quite a bit
into the calculation.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And anything on first half versus second half?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think, Vivek, it's going to be a little bit of a first half weighted year, really driven by Foundry and
Logic. I think Memory spending is going to be pretty steady through the year. But I think Foundry is
probably a little bit first half weighted.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And for my follow-up, your installed base has grown at a 10%, 11% annual base in the last 5
years, which is pretty remarkable given the volatility in WFE. My question is, how fast have your services
kind of grown annually during those 5 years? And how should we think about the installed base and
services growth for the next 2 to 3 years?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, I'll give you a little color. I mean the best indicator of how its growing is just chamber count because
that really is what drives the business opportunity. Having said that, we're doing a lot of innovative things
around advanced service offerings in different ways to deliver value to customers that drives our objective,

Vivek, at the end of the day to have dollars grow faster than just the growth in chamber count. And if you
come see us in March, we'll probably give you a little more color around what this business looks like.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And I think the only thing I'd add, I made comments about the productivity upgrades and solutions
part of that business. It's -- obviously, every customer is driving to reduce their running costs in their
fabs. And so between upgrades for existing tools as well as new really data-enabled services that we offer
to help recover tools more quickly with less labor and with a higher probability of first-time right. Those
-- that part of the business is actually growing very fast, and I think has the ability, just as it did this past
year, growing 30% year-on-year, the ability to outgrow the installed base. And so we're investing in that
area.

Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And congrats guys on the great results. Just 2 quick ones, either Tim or Doug. When you look at the
calendar year 2020, and like you mentioned, WFE is probably front-half loaded, mostly foundry logic
biased going towards Memory in the back half. Are there any nuances in gross margin we should worry
about? Or is there like one segment has a better gross margin profile than the other? And then I had a
follow-up.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

No, there's nothing specific to gross margin by segment that you should be thinking about. It varies with
customer mix. It varies with product mix and then overall business volumes is what, I think, I've said
every single quarter that I've been at the company, it's the same language. So there isn't anything specific
by segment.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it, Doug. And then just a follow-up on the OpEx. I understand March has the seasonality with
all the merit increase, et cetera, but how do we think about OpEx on a go-forward basis? It's like 18% of
sales a good bogey to use? Or is the $500 million plus run rate, quarterly run rate, the right metric?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

If you look at what we've done over the longer term, we've let spending grow at a rate less than the top
line has grown over the last, I don't know, since we brought the 2 companies together. And I think you're
going to see us thinking that same way as we see a stronger year in front of us. And again, come see us in
March, I'll give you an updated financial model as well.

All right. Next, we have a question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Doug, I had 2. First of all, China has been running about 30% of revenue for the past 3 quarters. Should
we expect it to be about 30% as a percent of revenue in March? And I assume within that, that it would
still be like the vast majority of it would be the domestic guys. Is that correct?

Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I'm not going to get into kind of telling you quarter-by-quarter what it is. Let me remind you what I
said earlier. I think it grows $2 billion to $3 billion off a base of 6-ish -- a little above $6 billion for the year.
It will be lumpy. Tim, you know how this goes. There's a project that takes tools, then it has to ramp it
for a while and digest it and something else kicks in. I'm not going to give you exact color on the March
guide, but I think it will be a good year for local China this year.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Great. Doug, and then I guess, this as a kind of a bigger picture question, but given what's going
on with export control, I mean, you're saying that domestic China is going to add maybe $2 billion to $3
billion to 2020 WFE. Do you think that there's any of this incremental stuff going on within China, where
customers are concerned about maybe someday down the road, they can't get access to tools? And so
maybe they're pulling in time lines of these [ sats ]?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I guess I'll take that one, Tim. But I mean, we've answered this a couple of times that we've seen no
indication that the China buys are pull-ins. There appear to be solid plans behind what they're trying to do.
And every tool we ship, they're trying to ramp as quickly as they can. So I really don't -- I don't think that
plays into it. Having said that, we are watching what's going on with the talk about regulatory controls.
But at this point, no details that we could even really comment on.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Joseph Lawrence Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wonder, back to the topic of this China sovereign business, if you could give us some color on the
number of customers, I think people tend to think about Memory, but just -- I'm not looking for specifics,
but how much of it is Memory versus Other stuff? And just an indication of the breadth that you're seeing?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So Doug made a comment about the demand being pretty broad-based. I mean we are seeing --
and again, you sort of think about what's great about our market right now is the breadth of driver -- end
market drivers. There's a lot of IoT and specialty technologies, whether it'd be automotive, power devices,
image sensors. You kind of see all of that be -- people in China trying to address that end demand. And
so it's not isolated to any one thing. Clearly, the uptick in Memory has outsized importance for Lam's
revenue. And obviously, we watch very closely what happens, especially in the NAND and DRAM areas. But
really, our outlook in the $2 billion to $3 billion increase that Doug talked about in 2020 is pretty broad-
based across a -- quite a number of customers.

Joseph Lawrence Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then you guys have talked about a kind of $14 billion -- or $70 billion 5-year WFE for
NAND, kind of keeping us on a historic supply growth trajectory. Is that still kind of the right ballpark? And
we see -- it would seem to be quite a bit lower than that right now. Is that still kind of the right framework
for thinking about what WFE ought to be if we stay in the historical demand context?

Yes. That's still the way we look at it. And our comment, you just said, we were quite a bit below that at
this point. That was part of our commentary that said, through last year, we were actually under-investing
for long-term demand. That long-term demand is what establishes our $70 billion 5-year investment. And
even this year, as we see a strong uptick in NAND, we still, as we said, expect ourselves to exit the year,
maybe slightly still below the long-term demand rate.

Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel.

J. Ho
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And congrats also. Maybe, Doug, first, in terms of the installed base business and the growth you're
seeing there and the sustainability of that growth. Can you just give a little bit of color of how you've seen
maybe over the last few years and going forward, how the business has kind of transitioned from, I guess,
the transactional break-and-fix type of business to more of the contract base, which gives you a better
visibility into the revenue and cash flow stream of that business?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Patrick, I'm actually going to redirect it to Tim because I think he'll give you a more comprehensive
answer than I would.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Doug can certainly add something there. But I think we have seen that transition, and it's not just
something that's happened to us. It's been a strategy we've been driving to try to make this business less
transactional, much more value-add and also much more long term. And I talked in my script about one
way in which we do that, you transition the transactional to longer term through multiyear contracts. Even
there, you're able to help the customer control their cost in a much more predictable way. And that gives
us better visibility going forward, makes the business a little less transactional. But I think the biggest
way that we've transitioned this business from transactional to strategic is really through our focus on new
products in the portfolio of services and upgrades that allow the customer to change the cost profile of
running their installed base.

And so in that way, you can make this much more strategic. I talked about the Corvus R technology,
the self-maintaining tool, where the system itself replaces some of its consumable parts rather than
having to have technicians go and do that work. When we engineer that type of new upgrade, you then
create for yourself an entire new SAM within your installed base. And now as customers recognize the
value of that automated replacement system, they go and they upgrade to all of those older tools that
are in the installed base, and it creates another source of ongoing revenue for us. And in the meantime,
we're looking for that next upgrade to engineer and offer to the customers. And so I think it's becoming
much more of a product and strategic refocused business. It just happens that its targeted market is the
installed base that we've already shipped.

J. Ho
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And maybe as my follow-up question, and maybe for Tim, since you talked about in
your prepared remarks about the ALD market and the market expansion opportunity there. On top of the
share gains you've made in that segment as well as the market growing, particularly in the foundry logic
space, do you see additional applications and foundry logic driving this growth? Or is there a opportunity
for it to expand to other segments like DRAM?

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Yes, it already is expanding into other markets. I mean the only difference being, again, with ALD, you're
essentially creating a deposition technology, a platform, and that's one thing that Lam is very good at is
we're creating high productivity platforms. And then we expand the portfolio of films that we can deposit,
and that creates more application opportunities for us. So I talked about oxides and carbides. There are
other films that are also being developed at the same time. And I think that, ultimately, every device type
reaches a point where it needs to do some level of atomic layer processing. And so long term, I think this
is just where the technology is going. That's why you see ALD starting to replace, as I said, some older
process alternatives for certain steps.

Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the results. I was curious on the NAND flash side. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit
about the amount of clean room space that you see across the industry today that's empty. And then how
do you think about just the industry's kind of views on filling it versus past cycles?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Joe, are you still there? Sorry, you broke off at the end I thought.

Joseph Michael Quatrochi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Okay. There's clean room space out there in the industry, for sure, across all of the customer base. And
so what I always say is, in fact, I think, I don't know, a quarter or 2 ago, we talked about the fact that we
were tracking double-digit number of new fabs in 2019. I think the number is probably about the same
in 2020, a lot of those being memory fabs. The thing to understand with our customers is building the
shell is, it's a cheap call option on the future, right? It doesn't mean they're going to equip it tomorrow,
but it does indicate to you a long-term intention. And then they buy equipment when they really need the
output. That's where the real money and capital gets deployed. But there's plenty of clean room space out
there.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I guess the only thing I'd add, I thought perhaps you were going to ask about the importance of
clean room space and I was going to be able to tell you. That's the -- one of the things that we focus
on, you might have understood in the past from past commentary that a benefit of some of our products
like the Strata, and why it's popular within the NAND market is, the number of wafers that we output
from that tool per square meter of fab space that's consumed is actually the best in the industry. That's
an important metric. Even when Doug says, there's lots of fab space, which I certainly agree with, how
they use it is always important to the customer. And so again, as we think through platform design and
launching new tools, what we call footprint density or throughput density is really one of the key metrics
that we focus on.

acceleration in the growth of your installed base this year with just a rebound in Memory demand, should
-- is it fair to us to think about accelerating year-over-year revenue growth for that business in 2020?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Joe, the way I generally think about it is, the chambers ship and then they monetize over a period of time
after they ship. And so the fact that you saw chambers grow in 2019, that's a good indicator of what's
going to drive growth in 2020. That's how I generally think about. There's a little bit of a lag to it after the
chamber count, which is why, historically, we've given you a chamber count number one time a year at the
end of the year.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

we deliver some leverage to the bottom line. That's still very much how we think about it.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

But your March quarter shows typical seasonal uptick. And I know we have to wait until March 3. But as

expect numbers from this, but is the message that you guys believe you're going to gain more share in
NAND relative to the Other markets in '20?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I'll take the first one and then I'll let Tim comment on the share. I don't really see, when I look at the
WFE, the color that we just gave you, a real recovery in NAND. I wouldn't describe it that way -- sorry,
in DRAM, in DRAM. Clearly, in NAND, yes, Foundry and Logic continues to be strong. DRAM is kind of a
push, plus or minus. And what we see happening is, there's still a little bit of inventory out in the channel.
It's got to get burned off. And at some point, you can't continue to sustain supply growth below where
demand growth is. And when we look at DRAM bit growth, we think supply growth in 2020 is below
demand growth.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And I think a little bit longer term and also relative to clearing the inventory, we've been very
encouraged by comments we've heard about what we understand are drivers for DRAM. The growth in the
server market, the introduction of 5G, where you're seeing pretty substantial step-up in terms of DRAM
content per handset. And so it's -- and I think Doug said this in the past, but it's even for DRAM, a little bit
more matter of when, not if. So I think it's just -- right now, we have a, as you said, maybe about a push
for the outlook that we have just given you.

Your comment about NAND. I guess when we think about share or share of total spend, one of the things
we've talked about is the strength for us in NAND, obviously, is that we are -- and our tools are key
enablers of building taller and taller NAND stacks. And as those stacks increase, our share of total WFE
continues to increase. And so given that year-on-year, we continue to see a greater portion of spend being
spent on taller NAND devices, our share of total spend will increase.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves

the virus that you guys are taking out of the Q1, just to get an idea?

somewhat business as usual and you have access to service the tools in the fab, you're able to deliver
tools here in the near term?

Timothy M. Archer

No. I think very specifically, I think, most people are aware, the travel restrictions have been placed
on travel in and out of Wuhan itself. And so obviously, we can't travel into that area, where there are
some customers located. But in general, I think that, as Doug said, we're moving through the Lunar New

Year, which now has been extended, and out of abundance of caution Lam has also implemented travel
restrictions for our people to kind of business-critical situations only. And I think from the standpoint of
the impact and the way we've looked at it is, there could be delays of a few weeks in our -- in supply chain
or shipments to customers. And we don't see that as any real change though to the demand picture that
we've outlined. And therefore, we're really talking about just hopefully seeing this normalize over the next
few weeks.

Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful color. And the longer-term question is your 2020 WFE forecast, I think, is higher than
probably what many of us were thinking. I guess as I look out to 2021, it sounds like DRAM is not part
of the 2020 forecast. Do you think 2021, WFE can continue to trend higher if that DRAM spending comes
back?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

You know we're not going to talk about -- I don't know what '21 is. Listen, when I think about it though
the long-term growth drivers are totally intact. We've been talking about this for years, right? You got data
exploding in society. You got cloud and hyperscale, the big seven, what have you, investing in more in
equipment this year, that's good. You've got 5G on the com line, that's good. You've got density growing

Our last question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.

Shek Ming Ho

Great. My first question is on the Memory spending this year. If things play out the way you think, are you
thinking that NAND CapEx will still be below that $70 billion run rate? I know you said that you weighted
below the 40% bit supply growth. I guess in a way, I'm trying to parse out that $8 billion to $10 billion
increase in WFE you guys are forecasting?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Sidney, we never give you segment by segment WFE numbers, and I'm not going to now. It is going
to grow this year. And as Tim described, we think bit growth in NAND is in the first half anyway, below
where long-term demand is, and probably exiting the year is getting closer to being in balance. But we still
think it's below where demand growth is. I'm going to leave it at that.

Shek Ming Ho

Okay. How about DRAM bit supply growth exiting the year, if there is, to your point, if there's DRAM CapEx
being pushed?

between Foundry and Logic and Memory through the next cycle, I think, versus maybe last 5 years,
Memory was averaging like close to 70% of sales?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

We've got nice trajectory relative to what's going on in Foundry and Logic, and we had a really strong
December quarter, record level in Foundry. I expect our share of WFE in both Foundry and Logic to
continue to be very strong. I'm not going to pinpoint exactly what it is versus Memory because we're very
strong in Memory as well. I feel really good about where we're positioned. I'll just put it that way.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

I mean I think the simplest way to think about it as a company, our objective is to improve our share,
revenue share of WFE across all segments.

Operator

All right. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.

Tina Correia
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
