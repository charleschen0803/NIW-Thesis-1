THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Mosaic Company's Second Quarter 2020
Earnings Fireside Chat. [Operator Instructions] After the company completes their prepared remarks,
the lines will be open to take your questions. Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President,
Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome to our second quarter and 2020 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc
O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President, and Chief Financial
Officer; and Rick McLellan, Senior Vice President, Commercial. We will host a prepared question-and-
answer session addressing the questions received last night, followed by a short live Q&A session, time
permitting.

All of our earnings materials released yesterday after market close are available on our website at
mosaicco.com. We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements
include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based
on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release
issued yesterday, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our second quarter press release and
performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday's Form 8-K filing as well as our commentary on the
quarter posted to our website, also contain information important on these non-GAAP measures.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'll start with very brief comments, then we'll get straight
on to your questions.

This was a very good quarter for Mosaic, and our momentum is increasing. The key points about our
performance are: our cash flow generation this quarter is the result of the past 5 years of work by our
team to transform our cost structure and strengthen our franchise; we're succeeding even earlier than we
expected; we've already achieved 5 of our 72021 cost targets.

Even with realized potash prices down $20 per tonne from the first quarter and realized phosphate
prices up just $13 per tonne in the quarter, we generated over $800 million in cash from operations. We
delivered adjusted EBITDA 25% higher than consensus expectations, even before our adjusted EBITDA
definition change. We paid down $500 million in short-term debt and structured payables in the quarter
while retaining cash on the balance sheet above $1 billion.

In potash, we continue to invest in the accelerated K3 project, hitting a major milestone of connecting the
K3 shafts to the K1 mill. We continue to reduce our brine management costs and we achieved the lowest
cash cost per tonne of production in over a decade.

Mosaic Fertilizantes had an excellent quarter, hitting both real-based cost targets and achieving
further cost benefits from the weakening real as well as realizing over 80% of our targeted full year
transformation benefits. Phosphates drove the cash cost of rock below the target and lower than last year
despite increasing distances from mining to beneficiation.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

And with all of these efforts, we've reaffirmed our commitment to you, to our shareholders, our
employees, our customers and our communities to act responsibly. We announced new aggressive broad-
based environmental, social and governance targets, and we will use these targets to drive performance
across the business.

We are continuing to transform. The quarter's accelerating earnings and cash flow clearly reflect our
efforts to date, and we are driving additional future savings. We expect to deliver another $700 million in
savings above the 2019 base as we continue to execute our strategy.

Mosaic is more competitive than ever before, and with fertilizer markets improving, we have significant
earnings leverage to the future.
Now we'll take your questions.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Question and Answer

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, I'm going to start with some questions we received on cost. Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs
asked: In the second quarter, Mosaic was ahead of its 2021 target on a number of its key cost KPIs. How
much incremental opportunities do you see on each key metric to further reduce costs? And if so, what
level of incremental capital spend would be necessary to achieve those outcomes?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks for your question, Adam. As we've said earlier, we have new targets that include $700 million of
additional improvements across the company, $200 million of those coming from our Brazil operation and
$500 million coming from our North American and administrative. Some of the areas where we believe
we can make big gains as we go forward, obviously, are in Brazil, where we continue to improve that
business; in North America, where automation is allowing us to drive efficiencies in both phosphates
and potash. And then, of course, our K3 operation, which, as we ramp it up, we'll eliminate a lot of cost
and improve our brine management cost. So as we look forward, we see a lot of opportunities still. And
importantly, in September, when we bring our -- all of this to our Analyst Day, we expect to be able to give
you more color and detail on what that's going to look like.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Chris Parkinson from Crédit Suisse asked: You're clearly comfortably ahead on numerous cost
initiatives, including your K3 shaft, brine inflow, phosphate rock costs in the U.S. and Brazil and
Fertilizantes platform. But would you take a step back, how are you thinking about your structural cost
base in a normalized environment? And how much more could actually be done, especially in phosphate?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thank you, Chris. It's important to keep in mind that these cost improvements certainly are
somewhat driven by high utilization. We've had a good quarter where we're able to use our assets fully
and we've had some benefits from exchange rate, particularly in Brazil, but also in Canada. Over the long
term, though, the real differences have been structural, and those are going to stay with us and those
are going to continue, and we're going to continue to improve those. So if we look at our major projects,
which include Esterhazy K3, next-gen mining and the Brazil transformation, those are not temporary
differences. Those are true structural changes that we'll be delivering value for the long term.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Michael Piken from Cleveland Research asked: You mentioned that you are on track to exceed your
$225 million in nonmarket growth in 2020. Which segments are exceeding your expectations and how
higher can this number go for 2020?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Michael, let me clarify. Our $225 million were actual items that we spent in 2019, but we did not expect to
repeat in 2020. And so on those, some of the key items, the Plant City idling, that's happened and now is
outside of our cost structure. Our Brazilian dams, we've completed the work now and that $80 million of
cost is now behind us. Equally, the ramp-up of Esterhazy, which has gotten better than we expected, we
now are delivering 1 million tonnes a year from the K3 project. So that benefit has already flowed through
to us. And then of our $50 million of transformation in Brazil that were part of that $225 million, we're

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

already at over $40 million. So we see that as pretty much complete, and ongoing savings will be above
and beyond that original $225 million we talked about.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, a large number of questions seeks a better understanding of our countervailing duty petition. Seth
Goldstein from Morningstar, Chris Parkinson from Crédit Suisse asked for an update on potential regulation
changes of the U.S. import duties on Morocco and Russian supply. And if the outcome is successful in
our favor, what should they expect in changes to their landed U.S. costs? In other words, what are the
potential outcomes in terms of leveling the playing field?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, gentlemen. Let me start by saying we believe in free and fair trade. However, the reason we
filed this petition in the first place was to address imbalances associated with unfair government subsidies
on imports and to highlight unequal requirements on environmental standards. We believe our competitors
benefit from access to artificially low rock costs and energy, while not having to meet adequate and
proper environmental standards. We also will say that what we have done is put this forward to the
Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission. They will judge on the merits, and as
such, determine what level of duties, if any, need to be put in place to create a fair trade situation. And
Clint, do you have anything to add to that?

Clint C. Freeland
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. No, Joc, I think you're right. We certainly are ahead of schedule on the realization of the $225 million
in nonmarket benefit this year. Keep in mind that the $80 million that we spent on dam remediation last
year was spread really through the second to fourth quarter. So we realized about $36 million in benefit in
the second quarter and should realize the balance throughout the rest of the year.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, John Roberts from UBS would like to know, can you review the basis for your phosphates
countervailing duty to position? And have you had any response from customers or competitors?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, John. Our basis for the petition is clearly laid out in the public documents. And I would ask that
you go to those. Also, the comments from any of our competitors or customers or the other concerned
groups is clearly laid out in those public documents. So I would suggest you go there. Our position is
clearly that the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission really are the ones that
will decide what are the merits of this case. Now clearly, as we talk to our customers, some are concerned
mostly about how they're going to get their supply. We believe that this has opened up new opportunities
for outside competitors to come in and make up some of that supply. But in the end, I think all people
understand why we'd put it forward. And we'll have to wait to see what the ITC says in terms of its merit.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we received several questions asking about trade flows and implications to other markets. Specifically,
Adam Samuelson and 7 others asked: over the next 6 to 12 months, how do we think about the net
impact of potential trade flow impacts of potential U.S. countervailing duties on Morocco and Russian
phosphate? Do you see risk of market share competition rising in other major import markets, notably
Brazil?

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Mike and Joel. Let's answer the last question first. No, we don't think this will impact global supply
and demand. All we will do is probably change trade flow. The current market and resulting pricing is
reflective of a tight market. And if anything, the countervailing duties only highlighted to people that this
market was tight. So what's causing the tight market? Favorable farm economics and lower supply, which
began to take shape well before we filed the petition. However, it is reasonable to assume that the trade
flows will be altered and some product will be shifted to other jurisdictions, including new suppliers coming
into the U.S. and the Moroccan and Russian suppliers focusing on other markets, which could be Brazil or
wherever.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein asked 2 more technical questions with respect to the petition, namely, if the
Mosaic trade complaint is upheld, will there be a retroactive benefit to Mosaic? And what is the time line
for final decision on the complaint?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

So look, thank you, Jonas. Let me first clarify. Whether duties are applied retroactively will depend upon
the level of imports from these 2 countries from the filing of the case until the DOC preliminary ruling. We
expect the case to be finalized in Q1 2021. And at that point, if there has been excessive imports, they will
look at assessing a retroactive duty.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, I'm now going to move on to questions about phosphate operations. Ben Isaacson from Scotia asked:
On the cash cost of mine rock in Florida falling to $36 per tonne from $40 year-over-year, how much of
that was due to transformational efforts versus favorable geology? And how much more wiggle room is
there to bring that down? And how sustainable are these cost improvements?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Ben. Clearly, our cost improvements are a combination of several factors. We've certainly
been running our assets at elevated utilization rates, and that's helped. But our efforts to centralize
mining operations, streamline processes and automate have also helped reduce our cost. As previously
mentioned, the establishment of a central control center for our mining and collapsing all of our mining
operations basically into one large operation, which should be -- begin operation by the end of the year,
will really further enhance cost savings. And as we introduce new management structures, incorporate
automation for certain mining functions and accelerate savings from adjustments to transportation, we
start to see real long-term improvements in our cost structure.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, PJ Juvekar from Citi also asked: With the recent rise of over $50 per tonne in DAP pricing, have you
ramped up your production at the mine? And what could be the benefit of better cost absorption from
higher tonnes in the third quarter?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks for the question, PJ. High utilization rates have a beneficial impact, but that's really only part of
the story, as we've mentioned. But I will say that as we look at Q3 going forward, we can expect those
tonnage, high tonnage and higher utilization rates to continue. So we do expect to see better costs
throughout the rest of the year, both structurally and because of high utilization.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we also have a question from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. With specialty percentage rose
to 48% of shipments and marked a new quarterly high in phosphate, coincident with MicroEssentials'
shipments to Fertilizantes being substantially above recent quarters, is this sustainable? Why or why not?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Adam. The sales of MicroEssentials and Aspire hit record highs and K-Mag came in close to
the record in quarter 2 2020. Among these growth, MicroEssentials' shipments to Brazil has been a major
driver. Now we believe the growth of MicroEssentials will continue over the next quarter, driven by Mosaic
Fertilizantes and also North America. I have to reemphasize the value that MicroEssentials brings to the
growers is showing positive returns for them on their investments. So these are bringing real value to
the growers and to our customers, the distributors, so we do believe that as more people start using
MicroEssentials, this is very sustainable, and they're going to see the benefit and they're going to keep
using that product.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, 3 analysts submitted multipart questions related to our potash operations. So first, Chris Parkinson
asked: The demand environment in potash appears to be modestly improving while spot prices are well
off their first half lows. Can you talk about your thought process for the second half of '21 operating rate
assumptions and how that may drive changes in your mine mix?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Chris. As you know, we've accelerated the development of K3 and this has an obvious impact
on costs, both now with declining brine management spending and in the future as the mine ramps up.
Beyond K3, we continue to see strong results from Belle Plaine, which recorded its lowest cost position
in more than a decade. As we move forward, we're going to take advantage of owning 2 of only 7 mines
in the world with annual production capacity of over 3 million tonnes, and with some of the lowest costs
in the industry. So as we look to the future, we intend to optimize the production coming from K3 and
from our Belle Plaine operation and only see running higher-cost mines like Colonsay, if the market really
requires it in the future.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, another question comes to you from Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. In potash, you lowered your cost
per tonne a fair bit, but how much of that was simply spreading fixed costs over a 20% larger volume? On
a fixed volume basis, what would your cost reduction be?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Good question, Jonas. There is no question that the larger volume helps spread out our costs. However,
we believe there are structural changes that are fundamentally changing our costs over the long term. We
think one area of clear savings is the accelerated reduction of brine management costs as we shift to K3.
K1 underground mining will be completed this year. Brine management accounted for $8 a tonne in Q2,
and that will continue to decline as we move into 2021 and will be eliminated completely by 2022. So as
you can see, a lot of our cost reduction is actually structural and should be with us for the long term.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Joc, PJ Juvekar from Citi asked: What kind of savings do you expect from sending K3 potash ore to the K1
mill? And what is the updated time line now to shut down K1 and K2?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, PJ. We expect to be sending potash to K1 and actually be shutting down our K1 shafts from
a production perspective early in 2021. That will start meaning we're only going to be operating 2 shafts.
And then by the end of 2022, only operating the one big K3 shaft. At that point, the project will be
complete, we'll eliminate brine inflow and that really will be the end of our K1 and K2 plant mines from a
production perspective.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Vincent Andrews is interested in how he should think about our potash shipments in the second
half of this year, given how strong shipments were in second quarter. Also, can we remind him of the
accounting for the Chinese contract shipments that were already in a bonded warehouse prior to contract
agreements?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Vincent. Yes, we did have strong shipments in quarter 1. And if I referred to our discussions
with Canpotex, I think they have a fairly full order book for Q3 and even going well into Q4. So I believe
the shipments internationally will be strong in the second half. And domestically, we're expecting a good
fall in North America. So we're expecting strong shipments there as well. So from our perspective, our
second half is looking pretty strong from a potash perspective. In terms of the shipments in the first half,
I'd just like to throw it over to Clint to explain a little bit about our China shipments to bonded warehouse
that we rev recced in the first half of the year. Clint, can you discuss that?

Clint C. Freeland
Senior VP & CFO

Sure, Joc. Vincent, so to start with, on a consolidated basis, we don't recognize revenue until that product
is sold to a third party. However, we do -- on a segment level basis, we do recognize a revenue when
Canpotex sells product to our distribution business in China. And when they sent that product to our
distribution business in China, the segment recognized revenue, but that was based on an estimate of
pricing since the contract had not been completed. Once the contract was completed and the price for
that transaction was set, that gave rise to the adjustment. But again, that's an adjustment on the Potash
segment only because we won't recognize revenue on that product on a consolidated basis until it's finally
sold to a third party.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks for that clarification, Clint.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, I'm now going to move on to questions about Mosaic Fertilizantes. We have 4 analysts, including John
Roberts from UBS and Mark Connelly from Stephens, asked similar questions about the timing of volumes
in Brazil. Brazilian farmers are having an outstanding year so far and have been widely reported to be
buying inputs well ahead of last year's schedule. How much do you think has been borrowed from the
third quarter? And are we likely to see an offsetting reduction in third quarter margin to reflect those lower
volumes next quarter? And specifically within the quarter, April and May were significantly higher than the
prior year month, while June appeared to be much closer to a year ago. Is that just timing? Or are the
trends decelerating into July?

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Great question. The strong volumes in the first half of the year did reflect some forward input purchases
as a result of generally favorable farm economics. But year-over-year demand is expected to be up slightly
to 37 million tonnes. And in that figure, we believe we are beginning to take market share as farmers
gravitate towards higher analysis products and high-value products such as our MicroEssentials.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Mark Connelly at Stephens asked, how did the dramatic improvement in costs in Brazil break out
between volume-driven cost improvement and operational structural cost change that should repeat with
normal volumes?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Mark. Let me start by saying last year, our operations were negatively impacted by the change
in regulations that required us to shut down a couple of operations for down improvements. That reduced
volume and impact of our raw materials access. This year, we're benefiting from running at full operations
rate. And this also has allowed us to have more access to our own rock supply. So overall, that has helped
a little bit. So about 1/3 of what those costs are probably volume related. The others are improvements to
our freight, our inventory management, our overall planning and, of course, structural changes to our cost
structures. I think overall, though, we're seeing long-term changes to how the Brazil business is running,
and we're starting to see full benefit of the $330 million or so of integration benefit that we announced at
the end of last year.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, PJ Juvekar has a question about currency. The Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar was down
significantly year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020. How did that volatility impact you? And what
specifically was the impact in the quarter on Mosaic Fertilizantes?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, PJ. I'd like to talk about 2 aspects of the Brazilian real that really has changed things. And
the first of those, of course, is the impact on farmer economics. I think that is actually the bigger
improvement, their ability to buy fertilizers and the continuous growth of the Brazilian agriculture segment
is largely driven by great economics for the farmer. And so that's the first place we want to talk about
where the Brazilian real has helped us.

In terms of our cost performance, you will see that we tend to put our targets in real based, so that allows
us to understand what's the real underlying improvement. Obviously, there was some positive impact.
I think we saw definite improvements in our overall cost because of the real. But I would say, we focus
more on what is the real-based cost because that tells us whether we're really improving the business or
just taking advantage of currency. Though in the back, you'll notice -- sorry, PJ, I'd also like to point out
that if you look at the back of our stuff, you'll see basically our sensitivities and a $0.10 move in the real
amounts to about $20 million a year unhedged. So if we think about us as being about 50% hedged, it's
fairly easy to do the reconciliation To last year's real costs.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we have another question from Ben Isaacson with respect to Mosaic Fertilizantes. Mosaic Fertilizantes
sales volumes have been notably higher year-over-year. Can you walk through the strategic strength of
this business and how it relates to your mix between commodity and MicroEssentials tonnes?

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Ben. Again, I've said this before, but I'll repeat. The volume growth really was a result of
improvement in farm economics in Brazil. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the real excellent
barter ratios and anticipation of a strong summer crop demand. So both commodity and performance
products have shown robust increases in quarter 2 of 2020 versus a year ago.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Chris Parkinson's asked for a COVID-19 update. His question is, Brazil is in the midst of a fairly
complex COVID-19 outbreak, which has periodically been affecting the ports and logistics system. Can you
give us an update on the demand environment as well as any logistical headwinds you foresee during the
peak fertilizer application season?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Chris. Look, let's start from our own operations in Brazil. And although we've had a number of
cases because of the high level of community transmission, we have not been impacted on our operations
to this point, and we've instituted a number of procedures to make sure we mitigate the spread. But
-- sorry. And then from an overall country logistics perspective, we believe that, in general, we have
been unaffected by COVID. Now obviously, there's going to be local places where that impacts us. But in
general, we've been able to work around that and kept the product moving to the end customer. And from
a demand perspective, despite COVID, we've continued to see strong demand, again, driven by favorable
foreign economics and we have got our product to our customers with relatively little impact.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

The last question we received on Mosaic Fertilizantes comes from Joel Jackson. Fertilizantes' second
quarter gross margin was more than double the results from the prior 2 years. How much of that gain was
market conditions versus foreign exchange tailwinds versus share gain in the market versus a pull-forward
of Q3 because of COVID-related logistics concerns?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Joel. I would summarize our results in the second quarter in Brazil as a couple of factors. First of
all, if we looked at the exchange rate, it's probably offset almost perfectly the change in pricing. So what
we see in actual results is almost solely the result of our own actions and the reversal of some of the down
costs that we saw last year.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we received a handful of questions on the balance sheet, primarily focused on uses of free cash flow.
John Roberts asked: What are the capital allocation priorities moving forward? And can you please discuss
your gross debt level, dividend and potential share repurchases?

And PJ Juvekar asked: Beyond paying down some debt, what could be uses of cash, especially with
improved free cash flow in the second half of 2020? Would buyback be approved use of cash over the
countervailing duty decision prevents you from buying back stock? Joc, can you talk about capital priorities
to address both of these questions?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thank you, gentlemen. Our capital priorities are unchanged, and they continue to be what we've said
in the past. Our first priority is to maintain the business. Next priority, maintain investment-grade metrics.

And to do that, we have to continue our normal capital plan as we've had. We expect to lower debt by
about $1 billion over the next few years, doing so when our bonds come due in the next couple of years.
And then continue some of the key projects like the Esterhazy acceleration, K3 acceleration, and then
what we have after that, returning capital to shareholders. All 3 of these are depending on future cash
flow generation, and capital allocation will not be impacted in any way by the countervailing duties.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

We've also had a couple of questions from a buy-side analyst, and they include: Can you describe what's
included in the $610 million of short-term debt that you indicated will be paid in 2020? And does Mosaic
still plan to keep about $1 billion cash balance and pay down its 2021 maturity?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks for the question. At the start of this year, we did increase our cash balance to $1 billion by, first
of all, taking out some money from our revolver and executing on some of our inventory financing debt.
Since that time, we paid down the revolver, and we will continue to pay down the rest of the $600 million
in short-term debt throughout the rest of this year.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Before we move on to market-related questions, Ben Isaacson asked about our tax rate outlook. Why is
your effective tax rate expected to be in the mid- to high 50s? And how should we think about this rate
under a Trump or Biden presidency?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Ben. Let me start by saying the first part of this is -- and the reason for the tax rate being
higher is our income mix between our 3 jurisdictions, Canada, Brazil and the U.S. The details of that, I'm
going to actually hand it over to Clint to explain why the negative earnings in the U.S. will create a higher
tax rate overall.

Clint C. Freeland
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Joc. And Ben, that's right, it really comes down to an earnings mix phenomenon for us. If
you recall, the tax rate is based on GAAP results by jurisdiction. And when you look at the United States,
not only is our Phosphates business incorporated into that, but also our corporate G&A, our interest
expense and so forth. So there are times when that pretax income in the U.S. turns negative, and that can
begin to skew the rate. When you then start to factor in things like some of the foreign currency moves
that we've seen and how it affects our mark-to-market and some of the notable items that we have on our
schedule, that begins to skew it.

And then as you've seen Brazil improve this year, that's our highest rate tax jurisdiction. So that begins to
influence that rate as well. So really the combination of all of those things that's resulting in an unusually
high tax rate for this year. And then I'd add 2 things. One, on a longer-term basis, we would expect that
effective tax rate to be somewhere in mid- to high 20s. But then I would also call your attention that our
cash tax rates and payments are much different than that. As a matter of fact, this year, we expect to end
up with a small cash tax refund, so very different than the effective tax rate in our financial statements.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Now let's move on to market-related questions. Mike Piken asked if you could comment on our summer fill
programs in the U.S. and where we see downstream inventories in the U.S. at this point.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Michael. I think we've had fairly successful fill programs in both phosphates and potash here
in the U.S. In recent discussions that we've had with our customers, suggest that they're probably in the
range of 60% full for the fall season. So there will be increased buying towards the fall season. But for the
most part, our customers are in reasonably healthy shape going into that fall.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Steve Byrne is looking for insight into future volumes. How are you trending in each of the segments
through the month of July on a year-over-year basis? Do you see volumes higher in the third quarter? And
any expectation for volumes for the rest of the year?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Steve. I would characterize Q3 as largely having our order books full for both phosphate and
potash. And so it will be a matter of delivery and revenue recognition that will determine where we are
for quarter 3. But we expect a reasonably good fall in the U.S. and global markets are running well. So for
both phosphates and potash, we expect relatively normal Q3 volumes in both. And then for the rest of the
year, we should also see a good stable volume.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Mark Connelly would like insight into grain and oilseed price implications. How important to Mosaic's
earnings outlook are higher grain and oilseed prices? If the current price of corn is sustained through 2020
and soybeans stay at or near their current prices, do you think there is any material room for higher P&K
prices in the market?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Mark. Clearly, oilseed and grain prices do have implications for us. But in general, the
farmers tend to work a lot more on their needs to plant. So what's a lot more important to us is planting
intentions, number of acres planted. And remember also, the grain and oilseeds are just a few of the
products that we fertilize. So it really depends on what does the whole global market look like and what is
the demand for P&K and what supply balance there as opposed to something on the grain and oilseed. It
has an indirect impact, but I would say, no direct impact on our pricing.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley wants to know about our market forecast. Given that the last 10
years of P&K shipments show some pattern lumpiness, potash more than phosphate, why not forecast
lumpiness going forward rather than just CAGRs?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Vincent. We tend to forecast on annual growth simply because some of the other factors that go
into the lumpiness of our business are impossible to forecast. And those are really inventory movements
globally, and of course, weather. You saw in 2019, the weather impacts in the U.S. made a fundamental
difference to the growth rate of both phosphates and potash on a global scale. So we really have to look at
it on averages, but recognize that there will be lumpiness as we go forward.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

I'm going to move on to some questions on phosphates. This one is from Ben Isaacson. The benchmark
MAP selling price fell by $16 to $314 per tonne, yet Mosaic's average finished product selling price fell by
almost 3x that amount or by $44 to $308 from $352. Why? How could we think this -- so how should we
think about this relationship going forward?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Ben. The answer here is simply that the average selling price in Fertilizantes is based on all the
components we sell, including urea and potash in the blends, both of which are down significantly. So
when you look at that relationship going forward, you have to take into account all 3 products that could
be in our blends that we sell.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Ben also asked DAP stripping margins have started to improve in July after remaining largely flat
throughout the second quarter. Are you seeing this flow through to the Phosphates segment margin?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Ben. Again, DAP stripping margin is -- we track that because that really is what do we get
after the cost of raw materials and transport as revenue. So of course, this flows directly into our margins.
An improvement in stripping margin really is almost directly related to our overall profitability.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Adam Samuelson would like to know, what does Mosaic see as the equilibrium prices of U.S. NOLA, DAP
and MAP versus key offshore benchmarks?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Adam. All I can really say there is, if you look at it historically, other than the last, say, 3 years
where there's been a real increase in imports, we have seen NOLA prices being similar to other global
prices. And I would expect that under a more fair trade market, that's what you would see is you would
see the NOLA price being equal to what the prices in other markets adjusted for the transport cost. And
that's exactly what we expect will happen after a countervailing duty case if they readjust that market.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Steve Byrne would like more insight into our global phosphate demand outlook and its relationship to
inventory swings. Specifically, what is your estimate of underlying global consumption of phosphate in '29?
And was it below the shipments of 71 million tonnes? Did it reflect channel inventory builds?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Steve. If we look at 2019, there was no question that there was a buildup of global inventory,
particularly in the U.S. I mean in the U.S., there was a poor season and the imports, in particular, kept
coming in. We shut down our Louisiana operation for a number of months last year. And still, the inventory
build in the U.S. was very high. Likewise, the Brazilian inventory was probably slightly above normal
coming into this year for maybe some of the same reasons. But what I will say is in the first and second
quarter of this year, we have largely cleared out all of that inventory and probably have moved from an
area of high inventory to a very low inventory in phosphates as we move into the third quarter of this
year.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, in a related question, he also asked: Are normalized inventory level is the reason for the increased
phosphate shipment forecast in 2021?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Steve. Yes. In terms of 2021, what we really see is the inventory levels should be pretty much
leveled off, and we expect normal growth in the market as per any other year. So that 2% type annual
growth in 2021.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Vincent Andrews would like our opinion on farmer economics. He asked, given the recent run-up in DAP
prices, are you all concerned about U.S. farmers deferring fall applications?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Vincent. Look, our experience has been -- and if you look even at the spring with the COVID
uncertainty, that farmers will put fertilizer on their fields according to their needs. And frankly, today,
with precision agriculture, they're more likely to put the right amount of fertilizers on every year. So and
phosphate prices, frankly, also are a very small piece of the overall cost of running a farm. So I don't
believe that most farmers will look at phosphate pricing and have it changed their application. But I'd also
highlight that phosphate prices are still very affordable when you look at where grain and oilseed prices
are. So as with most fall seasons, we would expect that weather will be the main arbitrator of demand.
And with expecting an early crop maturity this year, we expect we should have a good fall.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we have 3 questions related to China and phosphate. First, Vincent Andrews asked, what do you
anticipate will be the Chinese DAP exports in the second half of 2020? And what second half 2020 DAP
price does that assume? If DAP prices are higher or lower than your assumption, what would happen to
Chinese exports?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Vincent. Chinese exports over the first half of the year were lower by about 800,000 tonnes from
last year. Now our -- the base forecast calls for Chinese exports to end the year about 600,000 tonnes
lower. In other words, we expect that international pricing is a little higher. We'll incent a few extra tonnes
coming out of China in the second half. And if prices are higher than our expectations, there might be
a little bit more upside, but we don't see significant upside. And part of the reason for this is domestic
demand is coming in fairly strong as we move into fall. And I think the big issue there will be export
availability limitations. Now obviously, if our prices are lower than expectations, the volumes could be even
lower than what they are now.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Seth Goldstein and Steve Byrne both asked about production. Specifically, what is the status and
outlook for reduced phosphate production at specific facilities in China and Tunisia? And do you expect the
lower exports over the next several years?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Well, let me hit China first. There's been a well-known shift towards shutting down some of the higher
polluting plants, particularly along the Yangtze River, and we've seen some of these. Guizhou Phosphate is
shifting production to higher purified phos acid and food-grade phosphates. Some smaller plant shutdowns
throughout the year that have resulted in production declines in the first half of the year. In terms of
Chinese export volume over the next years, we maintain that Chinese exports will trend lower and we'll
establish a new normal. I mean we've now seen what we think is the bottoming of Chinese domestic
demand, and we're seeing a lowering of production. So with that, will have to come a lowering of exports
as they meet domestic demand. For Tunisia, it would appear that expectations for a plant resurgence of
production in 2020 were somewhat overstated. But it's also important to put Tunisia in context. They have
produced an average of about 750,000 tonnes of DAP and TSP over the last 5 years. Current protest will
certainly lead to shuttering of the rock production. The business plugged them for over a decade, so which
means we would expect them to stay about the same run rate as we go forward as well.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, the last section of questions relates to potash global markets. Steve Byrne and Seth Goldstein asked
about the impact of palm oil demand on potash. What is the typical lag between movements in palm oil
prices and changes in potash demand in Southeast Asia? And has the rebound in palm oil pricing resulted
in increased potash demand in Southeast Asia?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, gentlemen. The palm oil demand is important for potash. And what we have seen recently is
an improvement in palm oil prices. And we know that for production reasons, they will be adding potash
to their palm oil plantations. So we see that as a fairly direct relationship. I wouldn't say we see increased
demand, but we see demand that is getting back to its normal levels. In terms of a longer term, export
demand and domestic demand for biofuels is helping in terms of optimism for recovery. So all of these
things mean that we should see a better demand for potash in the Southeast Asia region, particularly
Malaysia and Indonesia.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joel Jackson and Ben Isaacson would both like to understand where global potash inventories stand in the
various regions, particularly in China.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, gentlemen. If we look at China, there's sort of a bifurcation of inventory. We know there's
about 3.5 million tonnes at the port. But we believe there's relatively low inventories as we move inland.
And so as we're now seeing a strong demand for NPKs in the domestic market, we do expect that the
movements out of the port to those NPK plants will start bringing down inventory levels, assuming that
the arrivals are about normal levels compared to last year.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Mark Connelly and Steve Byrne are both interested in potash demand growth. What is driving the
acceleration in potash demand in your forecast and other specific geographies?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks. I wouldn't say we're actually forecasting an acceleration of potash demand. Our potash demand
growth from a long-term trend is staying fairly steady at what we believe to be around 3%. And if you
take 2019 out of it, I think we still stay just on that trend.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

In a related question, if demand ends up toward the high end of your range, do you see increased supply
balance in the market? Or would you expect the market to tighten?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Well, I guess, this requires 2 things. One, the success of production ramp-ups on the new projects,
particularly, I guess, EuroChem's Volgakaliy and Usolskiy. But given the delays we've seen in recent years
on these ramp-ups, it would seem that the market should tighten actually if demand comes in at the high
end of our expectation.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

And the last related question, also, what is the bull case for potash pricing over a 3- to 5-year period?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks. There's a number of factors that could create a bull run in potash prices. And the first I've already
mentioned, which is slower ramp-up of the projects, particularly the ones in Russia and Belorussia. But
what we would really expect is probably a higher utilization rate of the North American assets over the
next, say, 3 to 5 years and a more modest rise in prices. That would suggest prices appreciate slightly to
where they were maybe in 2018, and utilization of assets goes up at the same time.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Another potash related question from Adam Samuelson and Ben Isaacson. They're both asking about
the disconnect between pricing trends between Brazilian MLP that rallied off-loads in the second quarter
versus U.S. and Southeast Asian MLP prices that have continued to be lower. Are strong Brazilian
economics enough to offset this weakness in other regions?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks. Brazilian farm economics are really outstanding at present, which is certainly helping to underpin
pricing in that market, and we expect that to continue. For the U.S. and Southeast Asian markets, I think
it's important that -- remember that this is a seasonally slow period for potash demand, and that will
impact prices. I'd also like to highlight that our summer fill program was extremely well received. And it is
typical of commodity markets to necessarily see first a rebound in demand and then prices following after
that.

We have now completed our presubmitted questions. And so now I would like to do is open it up to the
audience for live Q&A. Operator?

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. So I guess I wanted to just follow up on the affordability question, Joc, on phosphates. And on your
own kind of affordability metric, that you published, were now above long-term average. And just trying to
think about where you would see an upper limit to that? And especially, if you think about next year and
farmer income risks from government support programs in the U.S. or lack thereof, given kind of the big
farmer support payments that have been experienced both this year and last?

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Adam, and welcome. There's certainly a relationship between crop prices and how people feel
about the imports. But as you say, support payments from governments and whatnot have done a lot
to keep farmer incomes at least stable. And yes, while we're pushing phosphate and potash prices --
probably not potash so much, but certainly phosphates, a little bit closer to that ratio, two things on this,
I'd say is, first of all, you've got to look at December '21 prices. And if you look at December '21 prices, I
think we -- I think we'd be looking at, what, $3.60 for corn and $9 for bean. So they're going to see some
reasonable prices on there if they sold forward into that market. So they'd be incented to get a good crop
and use the fertilizer. But in terms of the direct relationship between the 2, I'd say you could easily go a
standard deviation above that ratio and not have it materially affect demand.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. I just wanted to hear whether or not you saw any impact on phosphate imports during the month of
July, following the countervailing duty petitions. And just ask for an update on your gypsum sales out of
your gypstacks in Brazil. Any update on that?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Thanks, Steve. First of all, yes, in July, I believe the imports were low in July. I have to get an exact
number and get somebody to get back to you on how much that was down. But our understanding --
and we did talk to a lot of customers, and our understanding is certainly the importers who are importing
either the OCP or the Russian products, definitely took a step back to understand what the risks might
be in terms of them picking up some sort of countervailing duty risk. So we did see a step back in July.
Whether they will come back into the market in the next couple of months, I don't know. What we have
seen, however, is new products coming in from places like Egypt and Australia and Mexico. So it does say
there is some change. I got to ask somebody to give me what was the second part of your question there,
Steve, I missed in my writing.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. So you already mentioned you expect Chinese DAP exports should be down, I guess, 600,000
tonnes or so and that you don't really expect a much on a year-on-year basis in terms of Tunisian
availability, which is fair. But there have been a few mines over the last couple of years that were kind
of in the process or the tail ends of the ramps in Morocco, obviously, Saudi, even Turkey and Egypt. Do
you believe that the phosphate market has really felt -- has already felt the full effects of these previous
ramps. And now we can just kind of isolate our thought process in terms of new supply on just the
Moroccans and Saudis. Just what's your kind of aggregate assessment of the SD over the next, let's say, 2
to 3 years?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Chris. I think materially, it is all about what's left of the Saudi ramp-up. And assuming they
reach their, I think, 2.7 million tonnes was their target for 2020, and there is some debottlenecking and
other projects that OCP is expecting to do. I mean those are still yet to come, but -- and maybe a little
bit of extra coming out. I saw Phosagro has been exporting or has been producing a little higher number.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

So there could be some new tonnes coming out of Phosagro. But for the rest of the world, I would say,
basically, the closures are more than offsetting any small ramp-ups that we've seen. And overall, it really
is now coming down to small increases from the Saudis and then whatever Morocco brings in, in the next
couple of years with a little bit of addition from possibly from Phosagro.

Operator

Thank you. No further question at this time.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Well, if there are no other questions, I'd like to, first of all, say thank you for the questions you brought in.
We had a very good set of presubmitted questions, which I thought was very healthy.

But to conclude our call, I'd like to just reiterate our key themes here. Mosaic generated strong results
despite low realized prices for our products. Our long-term transformation efforts are really starting to
deliver substantial structural cost savings, and we expect to drive additional savings in the years ahead.
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen as we paid down debt and generated strong cash flows.
Fertilizer markets continue to improve and prices are rising. We are navigating the COVID-19 situation
successfully, with minimal impacts to our business.

So in summary, Mosaic is more resilient and competitive than it has ever been, and we have built
significant earnings leverage for a rising price environment. So we are looking forward to continued
improvement and continued success on our journey towards being a very competitive company. So thank
you for joining the call. Have a great day and we hope to talk to you in person soon.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now
disconnect. Have a great day.
