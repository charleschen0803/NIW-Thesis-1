Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences Third Quarter 2021 Results Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations and
Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you very much, Diego. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With me on today's call
are Mike Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just
after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released third quarter 2021 financial results.
During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying
financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates,
assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and
expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation,
reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as
of the date of which they are made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after
today.

Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated
with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that
could cause these differences and important product safety information can be found in the press release,
our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the
company's website at edwards.com.

Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring
to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between
GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Mark. Let me begin by expressing appreciation for our global teams, who have been highly
engaged throughout the pandemic. We're also pleased that our supply chain remained resilient during
these challenging times to meet the needs of the patients we serve.

Turning to results, third quarter total company sales of $1.3 billion increased 14% on a constant currency
basis versus the year ago period. Strong mid-teens growth was driven by our innovative platforms,
although lower than our July expectations due to the significant impact COVID had on U.S. hospitals.
Although we experienced encouraging signs of patient confidence and continued willingness to seek
medical care in July, the Delta variant had a significant impact on hospital resources during the last 2
months of the third quarter, especially in the U.S.

Despite the pronounced impact of the Delta variant in the U.S. in Q3, we're encouraged by the recent
decline in hospital COVID admissions. We believe some procedures were unfortunately deferred in the
third quarter. And based on what we saw in Q2, we expect many of these patients who deferred treatment
in Q3 will be treated in the future. We continue to expect total company sales growth to be in the high
teens for the full year.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $558 million, up 14% on an underlying basis versus the year ago
period. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth in the third quarter.
Globally, our average selling price remains stable. In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew 12% on a year-over-
year basis, and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. Growth was broad-based across
both high- and low-volume centers. As you might expect, procedure volumes in Q3 were affected by
seasonality and varied by geography and even by hospital as patients and providers turn their focus again
to the pandemic. Our TAVR sales in July benefited from encouraging signs of continued recovery from the
pandemic. However, procedures were negatively impacted in the last 2 months of Q3 due to the significant
impact Delta had on hospital resources.

Outside the U.S., in the third quarter, our sales grew approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, and
we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by strong
international adoption of TAVR broadly in all regions. And despite the impact of Delta, the TAVR market
in Europe showed relative resilience with strong growth in procedure volumes. Growth was broad-based
across Europe and driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform. We were pleased
with the growth rate, considering that in Q3 of 2020, centers in Europe had already recovered from
pandemic lows. Longer term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth as we believe
global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low.

It's worth noting that recently published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic
Surgery now definitively recommend TAVR for patients over the age of 75. The acknowledgment by the
surgical society that TAVR is preferred for those over 75 is a significant development. We believe these
guidelines represent an important long-term opportunity. And although transcatheter valves have been
commercially available for over a decade in Europe, it remains clear that there is still a large unmet need
for this therapy.

Strong TAVR adoption continued in Q3 in Japan. As expected, we received reimbursement approval in Q3
for treatment of patients at low surgical risk. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR
therapy throughout this country, driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease
amongst this large elderly population. At the upcoming TCT meeting, there is a planned late-breaking
update on the economic outcomes of PARTNER III at 2 years.

In summary, based on October procedure trends, we expect Q4 growth for TAVR to be similar to Q3.
We continue to expect underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% in 2021. We remain as confident as
ever about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients
suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. The long-term potential reinforces
our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a low double-digit
compound annual growth rate.

Now turning to TMTT. We've made meaningful progress across all our platforms, with over 6,000 patients
treated to date. To transform treatment and unlock this significant long-term growth opportunity, we
remain focused on 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results
to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. This quarter, we progressed
on the enrollment of 5 pivotal trials across our portfolio to support therapies for patients suffering from
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We are gaining experience with the PASCAL PRECISION platform as part
of our CLASP trials and physician feedback continues to be positive.

We look forward to presenting randomized data from the CLASP IID pivotal trial next year and remain on
track for the U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. This important milestone will
mark a transition from large single-arm studies to significant pivotal trial results that support approval and
adoption and will be the first of several key data sets our CLASP trials.

We continue to treat patients with both of our mitral -- our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies
through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study of EVOQUE Eos. We are
ramping up enrollment with our novel EVOQUE Tricuspid Replacement therapy as part of the TRISCEND-II
pivotal trial. These pricing transfemoral therapies are critical for many patients without treatment options
today and exemplify the importance of a comprehensive portfolio.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

As we continue to expand our body of clinical evidence, we look forward to presenting meaningful data
at TCT and PCR London Valves next month. Presentations will include 6-month outcomes of EVOQUE
Tricuspid Replacement from our clinical trial experience in the TRISCEND study; in addition, 30-day
outcomes for mitral repair with PASCAL from our MiCLASP post-market clinical follow-up study of over 250
patients. We also anticipate several live case demonstrations of our differentiated therapies.

Turning to the financial performance in TMTT, despite the impact of Delta and summer seasonality, a
global sales of $22 million were driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe. As we expanded
commercially, we continue to experience high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes
for patients, and we remain committed to employing our high-touch clinical support model. We are
pleased with our level of site activation during the quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our previous
full year guidance of $80 million to $100 million and estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to
approximately $3 billion by 2025, and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to
transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease.

In Surgical Structural Heart, third quarter global sales were $217 million, up 6% on an underlying
basis versus the year ago period. Despite the Q3 resurgence in COVID cases, we are encouraged to
see continued SAVR procedure growth across most regions. We remain encouraged by the steady
global adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the
CONNECT RESILIA valve conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve. This advanced tissue treatment
is increasingly supported by a growing body of real-world evidence as demonstrated at the European
Association of Cardio-Thoracic Surgeons Annual Meeting earlier this year. Registry data confirmed excellent
real-world outcomes with INSPIRIS RESILIA in patients under the age of 60. As patients increase their
awareness of surgical valve choices, we believe that they are learning about the durability potential of
RESILIA and engaging with their physicians to choose this technology.

In summary, we have confidence that our full year 2021 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-teens
for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market growth and adoption of our premium technologies. We
continue to believe the Surgical Structural Heart market that we serve will grow mid-single digits through
2026.

In Critical Care, third quarter global sales were $213 million, up 17% on an underlying basis versus
the year ago period. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines, led primarily by strong
HemoSphere capital sales in the U.S. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the
ICU remained in demand due to the elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. and demand for products used
in high-risk surgery also grew year-over-year, in addition to demand for the ClearSight noninvasive finger
cuff used in elective procedures.

In summary, we continue to believe that Critical Care will grow revenue in the low double-digit range in
2021. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to
smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients.

And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. Today, I'll provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate
the rest of the year may unfold and some color on what to expect at the investor conference on December
8.

Total sales in the third quarter grew 14% on an underlying basis over the prior year. As indicated earlier,
this strong sales growth is lower than we expected in July before the U.S. Delta surge. Earnings in the
quarter of $0.54 met our expectations as COVID-related constrained spending more than offset lower-
than-expected sales. As Mike mentioned, based on the improving trends with the Delta variant and our
October procedure trends, we are projecting total Q4 sales of between $1.30 billion and $1.38 billion.

As it relates to each product line, we are forecasting fourth quarter TAVR sales of $850 million to $910
million, and still have the potential to reach underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% for the full year

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

2021. We are also maintaining our previous ranges for TMTT, Surgical Structural Heart and Critical Care.
We continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high end of $2.07 to
$2.27, with fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.53 to $0.59.

And now I'll cover additional details of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was
76.3%, up from 75.5% in the same period last year when we experienced substantial costs responding to
COVID. The improvement was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative
impact from foreign exchange. Like most companies, we are seeing signs of inflation generally in things
like some of the raw materials we use in production as well as shipping and logistics.

With that said, some of the extraordinary costs we incurred when COVID hit last year have lessened, and
the net result is no material impact to our gross profit margin performance or guidance for 2021. More
broadly, we are continuing our investments to ensure that our supply chain is strong and resilient, and
capable of delivering life-saving products for our patients. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross
profit margin to be between 76% and 77%.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $364 million or 27.8% of sales
compared to $307 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs
and increased commercial activities compared to the COVID-impacted prior year. We are planning a
sequential ramp-up of expenses in the fourth quarter as COVID-related restrictions continue to subside.
We still expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28%
to 29%.

Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 22% over the prior year to $238 million or
18.2% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter
innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. We are planning to increase these expenses in the
fourth quarter as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications
for TAVR and TMTT. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D expenses as a percentage of sales
to be 17% to 18%.

Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13% or 13.9%, excluding the impact of special
items. This rate included a 320 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation.
We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%,
including an estimated benefit of 4 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.

Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points or $8 million
compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximate $70 million positive
impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. Foreign exchange rates negatively
impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. And relative
to our July guidance, FX rates positively impacted our third quarter earnings per share by less than $0.01.

Free cash flow for the third quarter was $471 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities
of $532 million, less capital spending of $61 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $1.1 billion.
The strong cash flows are a reflection of our exceptional portfolio of patient-focused technologies that
are generating returns from previous investments, which allows us to fund future internal and external
opportunities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $3 billion in
cash and investments as of September 30.

Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were 632 million, and we continue to expect our
average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 million to 635 million
guidance range. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase program.

Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll make a quick comment about our outlook for 2022. It's
premature to offer detailed guidance today but we will provide 2022 financial guidance at our investor
conference on December 8. In general, in 2022, we're planning on less disruption from COVID as we
assume the resumption of more normalized sales and earnings growth. We will provide guidance for gross
profit and operating margins as well as more visibility into any potential impact from changes in corporate
tax rates.

And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Scott. So we are very pleased with our strong year-to-date performance despite the headwinds
associated with the pandemic. And as patients and clinicians increasingly choose transcatheter valve
therapy, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity.

We are committed to aggressively investing in our focused innovation strategy because we believe there is
a broad group of patients still suffering from structural heart disease and the pandemic's impact will wane.
We remain confident that the innovative therapies resulting from our investments will continue to drive
strong organic growth in the years to come.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks a lot, Mike. And as you heard from Scott earlier, our 2021 Investor Conference will take place on
Wednesday, December 8, here at our headquarters in Irvine, California. For those of you able to join us on
campus, the conference will be hosted with appropriate safety precautions and there will also be available
via webcast. Either way, we really hope you can be a part of it.

In addition to our 2022 financial guidance, you'll hear more about Edwards' focused innovation strategy
and our comprehensive and exciting product pipeline. For more information, please visit the Investor
Relations section of the Edwards website at ir.edwards.com.
So with that, we're ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Diego?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Maybe for the first one, Mike or Scott, perhaps. The Q4 guidance here, what is the underlying assumptions
here in terms of any further disruptions from -- in a future basis or perhaps even the flu season, where it
might be perhaps hard to differentiate respiratory symptoms between the traditional flu versus COVID? So
some commentary on Q4 assumptions will be helpful.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Vijay. Yes, like so many others, we really struggle with precisely projecting the pandemic.
Edwards' business is strong. All the fundamentals are in a great place, and we know that there are many
patients with structural heart disease, in particular, that are in need. And so we feel great about it from
that perspective, but the pandemic ends up having impact on hospitals and their ability to be able to
handle the volumes. And we find it very spotty. It's regional in nature.

And the good news is we're watching the Delta variant come down in the U.S., and that's where we felt
most of the impact. And so that's very good. Of course, there is a concern of will there be some kind
of a winter surge that is not apparent at this point. So those things are always possible. We have, by
and large, modeled the fact that we think things are going to get gradually better. We have taken into
account where we are in October. In October, we saw run rates that were similar to what we saw in the
last couple of months of Q3. And so that has also gone into our thinking. So I don't know if that answers
your question, Vijay.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

No, that's helpful, Mike. And just on the last comment around hospital capacity to handle volumes, I
guess labor shortage has been spoken about. On the one hand, when I think about the limited number
of TAVR centers and this issue of labor shortages, it feels like handling backlog or excess cases might
be a challenge for them. On the flip side, Mike, conscious addition, where patients are in and out pretty
quickly. These are highly profitable procedures. So should we perhaps be making a case for the hospitals
to incentivize perhaps to drive volumes? I'm curious how you balance these two?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, it's a great point, Vijay. And it is one of the pluses that's associated with TAVR that often there
isn't an ICU stay. But when -- we watch what happens with various hospitals and sometimes whether it's
for staffing reasons or just the fact that they're swamped with COVID patients, they will just put up the
stop sign and decide that they're just not going to do procedures, and whether they're elective or resource
consuming or not.

We're probably more impacted by the ICU capability, but it's not always the case. Sometimes it's just
broadly across the hospital. So I don't have one answer for all because it tends to be a little bit more
snowflakes with each hospital being a bit different, but hopefully, it provides you with a little bit of color.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. Mike, I realize it's a challenging time to make forecast. And so I won't ask you about forecast. I'm
just -- what I'm curious about and would love your views on, is just what we know now, like what are you
seeing out there now? How much better is it in the environment than it was a month ago? Just kind of
curious to see your kind of your net views on -- and I'm asking specifically from a TAVR perspective, kind
of how much improvement you're seeing? Where are we right now relative to where we were just a few
months ago?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bob. It's a really good question. You're probably stay close to our team that watch daily sales
each day and adjust their own feelings based on how things change almost on a daily basis. And things, it
gets tough. And I hate to get too granular about, the things are a little better today than they were even
earlier in the month. But I hate to get too granular on that, Bob.

In general, we tried to give you some information to let you know that October was not so dissimilar than
the end of Q3. So it's not -- we didn't want to send a signal that all of a sudden, October is back to the
kind of thing that we were experiencing in Q2. So we're not experiencing that kind of an environment yet.

But we're overall optimistic. I mean we talked to a lot of folks, anecdotally. Obviously, these -- the trends
that I mentioned of Delta improving is something we think is going to pay off, we think. Often that maybe
TAVR is a bit of a trailing indicator of what's happening with COVID, that the cases ultimately turn into ICU
stays and it probably affects our case load a little bit later. But that's a bit speculative on our part.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Bob, it's Scott. I'll just echo something that Mike said, which is if you just roll forward what things have
been trending like in October, the growth rate for Q4 and TAVR looks a lot like it did for Q3, which was,
call it, 14%. So like Mike said, it's moving around. Watching it carefully and trying not to overreact or
underreact to what the daily sales trends look like. But if you had to call it right now, that's sort of what
the trend looks like. And then for the full year, it gets you to something near the 20% underlying growth
rate that we talked about for all of 2021.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And then last quick question is just on the U.S. trial for PASCAL and when we'll
see those data. Is there a set time for that yet or just sometime early in 2022?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We don't have clarity on when the timing for that will be. We say it will be next year. We're sticking
with our date and our belief that we will have approval by the end of next year, but we really don't have
clarity on when it's going to be presented. That will be one that we hopefully will have a little bit more
visibility when we get to the investor conference, Bob and try and give you a sense for it at that time.

Operator

Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First one for me, earlier this year, we saw some competitive data that maybe looked a little more
competitive with SAPIEN 3. I know it's still early days and the European numbers look good this quarter,
but are you starting to see any shift in trends or reception to some of the newer valves in Europe recently?

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

The short answer is no. It's been very similar feeling that we've had throughout the year, that was the
case in the past. We continue to think that the top 2 competitors make up about 85% of the sales in
Europe. And all the rest, which is a full complement of competitors, make up the other 15%. So we really
haven't seen any significant shifts in that, if that's helpful.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, it is. And maybe one for Scott. This was another quarter where we saw the financial leverage
potential of the business. Where do you think -- you talked about spending more in the fourth quarter, but
where do you think we are maybe from a gross margin and operating expense perspective versus a no-
COVID environment? So maybe said another way, if you fast forward and there's no more COVID, does
gross margin have room to improve from here? And maybe how much impaired is the SG&A and R&D
versus what you would like to spend in an unrestrained environment?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. So we do think gross margin has room to improve from here as does operating margin. Keep in mind,
we're already starting from relatively strong margins compared to our industry. So our priority has been
investing aggressively on internal growth more so than on trying to expand margins. But I do think there's
going to be opportunity for those margins to gradually incrementally slowly expand over time. And it's
something that we try to think carefully about.

Short term, though, to your question about COVID, it's been remarkable. Our margins have remained
pretty stable despite the fact that sales are down relative to pre-COVID levels, because expenses are
down as well, largely driven by things that are happening out in the field. So travel, meetings, attendance
at various different societies and events, and so it's been kind of a natural hedge against the sales
headwinds that we've seen from COVID and we're benefiting from that.

To be honest, though, we'd like to see expenses go back up along with sales because it's an indication
that the environment is more normalized, that we're able to invest aggressively, that we can enroll our
clinical trials at the higher rates that we saw pre-COVID. And so that's sort of the way we're thinking about
margins overall.

Operator

Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to start, Mike, I was hoping to just learn a little bit about your updated thoughts on the backlog
that you mentioned in the second quarter earnings call. I assume with just the environment, that that's
peeled back a little bit. But one, just any kind of review of the referral channels and patients coming off
the sideline in 3Q? And should investors be thinking that, that 2Q phenomenon could reemerge in 2022 as
we move through this COVID surge?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Josh. You're on a key point, and we do talk about it quite a bit inside. It's -- we don't have
perfect visibility and perfect data. So much of what we rely on are anecdotal reports, where we spent a lot
of time with our customers and frontline clinical specialists to try and gain some kind of perspective. It's
tough for us to nail the timing and magnitude of this. But clearly, we feel like we got a small lift in Q2 from
patients that came into the system that had probably deferred care.

If we reflect back on the total pandemic, when things first stopped back in 2020, back in the March-
April time frame, it's difficult for us to say that we saw those patients come back into the system. But
differently, it felt like the last winter's patients did indeed, surely some of those, some small quantity
showed up and supplemented Q2. So that's not a giant number, but it's additive. And we speculate the
similar kind of thing might happen as a result of the patients that have deferred care during the Delta
variant.

During the Delta variant, and we're speculating again, we may indeed have had these patients that
actually saw their physician and got diagnosed, but that the actual treaters in regional hotspots weren't
there to provide the therapy. So we think there's some reason why this might come back exactly. When
it might come back is very difficult. But as COVID wanes, we're hoping that, indeed, we see a similar
phenomenon as we saw in Q2.

And then just one follow-up, and we get a lot of questions on low-risk penetration. I think the [ TBT ]
registry update was presented a couple of weeks ago. And I think for 2020, the update was about 28%
of patients received TAVR were low risk. That seems pretty low. It seems like we're still in early innings
of low-risk penetration, but just would love to get your thoughts in terms of where the TAVR market is in
terms of penetrating that low-risk opportunity.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Josh. I wish I could tell you the problem was low risk. We think there's an undertreatment
problem across all the risk spectrums, whether it's high risk, intermediate risk or low risk for surgery.
We're still -- I think early innings is a good way to characterize it. We still think that there are many
patients that should be receiving therapy that don't. It's for a variety of reasons. And in many cases,
they're just not aware of the option of TAVR being available to -- for them and being appropriate for them.

And so it's a key initiative for us. We've been making progress, but the progress has been slow and
steady, and we're not close. I don't know if I would put tremendous stock in that penetration number, in
general, we think penetration rates across the board are even worse than that. Yes.

Operator

Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with CrÃ©dit Suisse.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So just one on Europe and overseas TAVR, and then one follow-up, if I could, just on sort of general
market trends. The European or overseas numbers seem to be, I guess, less sequentially impacted by --
than the U.S. And I'm just there's been an awful lot of focus on staffing and challenges around the U.S.,
obviously, the surge. But do you see -- I'm curious if you see staffing in other regions being as much of an
issue it is in the U.S.? And whether you can sort of tease out the areas of strengths that drove what was
pretty good Q3 performance outside the U.S. despite the surge in everything that went on? Then I have
just one follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Matt. No, your observation was correct. We saw far more impact in the U.S. than we saw in
Europe. Our colleagues in Europe, by comparison, were pretty healthy growth rates. And you'll notice in
my comment that if you go back to Q3 of last year, it's not as though Europe was really doing poorly. They
actually had a growth quarter versus 2019. I think I ought to say high single-digit growth or something
last year.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

So this is growth on top of that growth, which is pretty significant considering it was -- this therapy was
introduced in Europe back in '07. So it's pretty mature. And here we are still growing even during a
pandemic. So they -- for whatever reason, the Delta variant didn't seem to impact the European centers
the same way it did in the U.S.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's great. And then if I could, I know, Scott, you had laid out some basic sort of bullet points of what
we can expect at the analyst meeting and investor meeting in December. But in past years, there's one
thing that seems to have come up year-over-year, which is great growth in, say, a given year for TAVR and
then sort of the issue of comps becomes kind of a conversation for the following year.

And I guess one of the things heading into '22, and I think you mentioned decreasing impact of COVID or
something like that and back to sort of normalized growth. I'd just be curious to hear whether you expect
comps to be potentially a little bit less of the conversation when you sort of frame out your expectations to
start '22, given the way this year has played out?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Well, I guess by definition, the comps are important just as we think about growth rates, but it sort of
ties back to Vijay's question earlier on, about when do we start seeing COVID more in the rearview mirror
and less in the windshield. And to the extent that, that lessens as we get to the end of the fourth quarter,
beginning of the first quarter, for example, then prospects for 2022 growth are going to be higher.

If COVID is playing a more meaningful role in certain regions or there are hotspots that are more
noticeable, then that's going to impact our growth overall. That's probably the biggest uncertainty that we
have going into 2022 because overall, we feel really positive about the growth prospects for TAVR in the
U.S., in Europe and Japan and in the rest of the world.

One of the things that we were talking about earlier with this low-risk penetration, while it's difficult to
calculate the actual penetration, remember the timing on low risk, where we have the data for low risk
with PARTNER III at ACC in 2019, we got approval in the third quarter of 2019, and shortly thereafter,
COVID became a factor and interrupted our growth for TAVR. So we haven't really had this period that's
uninterrupted from COVID for any extent of time since we got the low-risk approval. And it's one of the
reasons why we think they're just great growth opportunities longer term for TAVR.

Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

I had a question on PASCAL, shifting to mitral now. And I was just wondering, Mike, if you could talk
a little bit about the U.S. launch strategy. I know it's early, but you guys launched a premium price in
Europe. Curious about whether that's the plan for the U.S., if you can disclose that? And if it is, sort of
what we need to see from the data set that's going to be presented next year?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, thanks. Yes. No, as we indicated, we're looking forward to having PASCAL approved. And again,
it would be approved for DMR by the end of '22 in our views. We're already taking some of the initial steps
to build some capabilities, and we'll assemble a dedicated field team, and we'll be implementing our high-
touch model. And they're really -- we're going to focus on just getting excellent real-world outcomes.

We're going to take advantage of all the learnings that we've had from launching TAVR around the globe
and launching TMTT in Europe. In general, we do consider PASCAL a premium therapy, and would also

implement our premium pricing plan. That would be consistent with what we've done elsewhere in the
world. So hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we'd approach this.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Yes. No, that's very helpful. And then the follow-up question I have is as far as sort of target centers
initially. I mean is the plan to target existing TAVR centers and sort of leverage your TAVR superior
market share? Or will you go specifically to mitral centers? Sort of how do we think about the initial target
centers?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Danielle. It's a little early to say. This is going to be an interesting evolution. In some cases,
the same people that do TAVR will -- might do mitral cases and others, there's dedicated teams. It's a
little too early for us to say we're going to get into it. We'll have more to talk about when we're together at
the investor conference. But right now, I really don't have any specific color for you.

Operator

And our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley.

Cecilia E. Furlong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to ask Mike about Japan and what you've seen just throughout this year in terms of the centers
over there that are certified to perform TAVR, how that's trended? And then as you think about low-
risk reimbursement kind of the outlook, given the landscape of TAVR centers kind of near term and then
flowing into 2022 as well.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. So we were very pleased to get the low-risk reimbursement approval. That happened mid-
quarter, I want to say, sometime in the August time frame. The -- there are indeed new centers that get
added. Those get added on a pretty deliberate basis. And those new centers tend to be kind of slow to
ramp up. There are significant regulatory requirements that are necessary to fire up new centers.

But having said that, it's a dramatically undertreated disease in Japan. They have a very large elderly
population. And when we think about it in terms of, for example, TAVR per million, we say, boy, there's still
a long way to go. So we're very pleased with the growth rate. The growth rate in Japan was even higher
than our international growth. And the reimbursement is important. It's an important key. It's exciting to
be able to get that. And hopefully, that begins helping Japanese clinicians redefine the importance of TAVR
for their patients. And I think we've kind of taken it for granted that low risk was -- is already present in
other places around the world, and it just hasn't been in Japan until this last quarter.

Cecilia E. Furlong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask as well, just what you're seeing on the clinical enrollment landscape
given COVID, and if you could provide any updates either on early TAVR or X4 and when you expect to
kind of ramp enrollment there.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. Yes, you might recall us, Cecilia, that early on, we said that there was impact on our trial
enrollment. We're not experiencing that the same way during this flare-up of Delta. It doesn't make it
easier, but hospitals have done a nice job of adjusting and adapting. They have very committed teams.

And so whether it's our trials in TAVR, our trials in TMTT, it feels like we've done well. We basically feel that
our trials' timing have not been impacted by this latest surge.

Operator

And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just one for me on PASCAL. Mike, in Europe, it looks like your share has kind of been inching up. And
by our math, you've reached about 20% share in Europe after about 3 years. So my question is, what gets
you higher? I know that your goal is to be a market leader, so do you need the RCT data? And how are
physicians using PASCAL in Europe? Are they mostly using it for DMR? Or are they using it for both DMR
and FMR? I believe the label is broad. So kind of what gets your share? What do you think you need to get
that share up?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Larry. And as you might imagine, it's difficult to estimate shares. But frankly, we haven't
really gone into this thinking that that's our focus. Our focus has been to get outstanding clinical results.
And we focus on that both within our trials and within our commercial experience. And that's what we
push our team.

And when you ask me what's it going to take to get your share up it's going to be impressive clinical
results. And so that will show up two ways: one, in the day-to-day experiences of clinicians and patients;
and the other is when they actually get a chance to see some of our results. And you see more and more
data that is going to become available over time as you see clinical information. So even at the upcoming
TV -- or TCT, I think you'll see more information on some of our early clinical experience.

At this point, we're not even in every country in Europe. But our focus, just to underline the point, again,
is not on share. This is a really big opportunity. There are so many patients with mitral regurgitation, and
there's many that are just not indicated, not being well served today. That's where our focus is.

Operator

Our next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.

Adam Carl Maeder
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just one for me on the U.S. TAVR market and competition specifically. There's a new TAVR competitor that
recently entered the market. I know it's early here, but have you seen any impact in the marketplace?
And can you comment on how that new competitor is approaching the market? Anything from a pricing
standpoint? And then maybe just more broadly, how do you see the potential impact of this third player
going forward?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Adam. Yes, when we talked about our results, whether it was our global results or our U.S.
results, what we said, it was broad-based, but the procedure volume growth and the Edwards growth were
comparable. So we really didn't see anything that was noteworthy here in terms of talking about share. So
we mentioned before that we have a full complement of competitors in Europe, and so that may be some
kind of a leading indicator, but we just haven't seen anything in the data in the U.S.

Anthony Charles Petrone
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

One quick follow-up for Scott is just on the expectations on the Analyst Day. I just want to make sure, is
the company issuing top line guidance? Or is it just P&L guidance? And then a question on low risk. We
are seeing DTC advertising in other areas of med tech, albeit it's more in consumer health-facing markets.
But does DTC in low risk makes sense here to open up that opportunity as we move into a period of higher
vaccination and eventually antivirals?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Anthony. Relating to the investor conference, we're expecting to provide guidance for the top
line and the rest of the income statement. So typically, we talk about sales dollar ranges and underlying
growth rates based upon our forecast for how the year is going to end up when we get to December. And
we'll also talk about margins, gross margin, operating margins and whatever other financial metrics we've
got clarity enough on to guide to.

As it relates to DTC, I'll start and then Mike can offer perspective as well. We think that market activation
and inspiring more patients to come and to get treated is a really important part of the future and the
long-term growth of TAVR. And so we are already investing some resources around getting directly to
patients, to primary care physicians, to referring physicians, and we'll be doing more of that in the future.
It's not aimed specifically at a patient in a particular risk category. We're trying to get to all patients, who
have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, and we expect that's going to be an important driver of growth.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll just pile on there, Anthony. Thanks. It's a good question. If you go back historically, in the early
days of TAVR, we really counted on the physicians that did TAVR to educate their referring base and that's
the way that we counted on the word getting out. And I don't know, we were under the impression that,
that actually would be sufficient. But we've learned over the years, that's dramatically insufficient.

And so as Scott said, we've gone on a number of roads here to make sure that the referral base is indeed,
educated. We've made some good progress there. Although we're far from satisfied in terms of where we
are right now. But to be really specific, if we keep going all the way upstream to consumer, we do believe
that, that could be a valuable lever. We're specifically doing some experimenting in that regard and maybe
have some more specific things to share with you when you come to the investor conference.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Can we spend a minute on Critical Care? The last couple of quarters have been particularly strong. Is it
possible to tease out how much of that strength is just underlying? In other words, it will continue into
2022 and '23 or it's just sort of I want to call it one time in nature associated with the pandemic?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. It's a good question, Joanne. I mean if you were to ask our teams here, are you going to
keep growing at 17%, I think they'd say no, that's not realistic, that we got we got some help this quarter
by some large U.S. capital orders that really helped out. And that made a difference.

Now overall, are we pleased with what's going on in Critical Care? Is there more innovation than ever?
Are they sustaining a pretty healthy growth rate that are better than I think medtech averages? I think all

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

those are true, and we're very proud of that, and we're going to continue hitting it hard in that regard. But
in terms of being able to maintain these kind of growth rates that we did in this quarter, that's not likely.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then as a follow-up question, use of cash, can you remind us of your thinking on that topic?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure. I'll tackle that one, Joanne. Thanks for the question on use of cash. Really, our priorities have not
changed. Our first priority is to fund prospects for long-term organic growth that are generated internally,
and we want to make sure that we're fully funding those platforms. We supplement that with external
investments. And so we'll buy small-sized, early-stage companies, usually pre-revenue. Sometimes we
invest in options to acquire companies based upon certain milestones or targets being met.

And so beyond growth internally and externally, then we look to the balance sheet. And we've been a
consistent repurchaser of shares, as you know. We're going to continue to do that opportunistically. And
we think that's going to be an important way that we can give capital back to shareholders over time.

Operator

Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I'll follow up on Josh's low-risk penetration question. Look, if you look specifically at the low-risk patients,
what do you see from those patients in the third quarter versus the second quarter? And what do you
assume for these patients in the fourth quarter? Just curious how much that funnel has impacted in the
back half of the year due to COVID.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Pito. We've said this before, so I apologize for taking you through it again. But remember,
this characterization of patients by high risk, intermediate risk and low risk, was the characterization done
by FDA as a regulatory pathway for TAVR to help make sure that the oldest, sickest patients were treated
first at the highest risk to try and minimize the risks associated with the new therapy.

If you were to actually -- when you actually look at any patient, their key concern is not whether they're
at risk surviving surgery, it's what is their risk for survival, what is it like to live with TAVR versus live with
aortic stenosis. And that's the real question. So we spend less time and frankly, clinicians and patients
spend less time talking about whether they're low risk or intermediate. So we really don't differentiate in
that regard.

So having said that, what do we think how did patients behave in the third quarter. We -- as I tried to infer
before, we don't have perfect visibility there, but we think they were indeed seeing their doctor, they were
indeed getting diagnosed, they were indeed getting screened, but there were a number of cases where the
treating hospitals themselves just stopped taking patients, and that was the primary impact in the quarter.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Fair enough. And then Scott, a follow-up question for you. You aren't changing the TMTT guidance, that's a
pretty wide range. Just curious what would have to occur at the high end versus the low end of the range?

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Yes, it's a good question. And like TAVR and other businesses, a lot of this is going to depend upon how
much of a factor the Delta variant plays in the fourth quarter. There are a couple of different elements
to our TMTT business right now. One is our commercial position in Europe, where we're selling PASCAL
primarily. And then the other is clinical trial enrollment, where there is reimbursement in the U.S.

What we're really looking for is for there to be a normalization of patient flow in both Europe and the U.S.,
and that's really going to be an important determinant for where things go in the fourth quarter. But we're
expecting sequential growth in Q4, and that will contribute to where we end up in that range of $80 million
to $100 million in expected full year sales.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

I think we have time for one more question maybe.

Operator

And our final question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.

Christopher Thomas Pasquale
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

One quick one on TMTT and then one on TAVR. Mike, in your script, you said you made progress enrolling
the 5 TMTT pivotal trials in the quarter. I think that group of 5 includes CLASP IID. Could you just clarify,
has CLASP IID actually finished enrolling? Any details there would be great.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We really haven't gotten specific on that. So we really don't have specific comments. But as you
might imagine, we're committed to -- when we say that we believe that we're going to have IID approved
by late 2002 (sic) [ 2022 ], that naturally infers that we're close to having our enrollment completed and
then that will allow us to prepare for the PMA and go through that process. So a lot of that has to happen.
We'll get into a little more granularity when we're together at the investor conference.

Christopher Thomas Pasquale
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then there's a late-breaker at AHA, and looking at asymptomatic AS patients. It's not your trial.
So I understand that you're not fully in the weeds there. But curious if you know anything about it. And to
what extent that data could be instructive as we think about what we might see in the future from early
TAVR?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes, it's a good question. I don't have personal knowledge of that trial, and so I can't really comment
about it. The AHA are a strong organization and good partners, and I think they really care about patients
with AS. But I'm not sure precisely what trial that you're referring to, but you know how we feel about
asymptomatic patients. We feel like these are patients that should be treated. This idea of deferring
treatment, waiting for symptoms is an outdated thought process, and we're very committed to change
that through rigorous clinical trials.

Okay. Well, thanks all for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I will welcome any
additional questions by telephone.
