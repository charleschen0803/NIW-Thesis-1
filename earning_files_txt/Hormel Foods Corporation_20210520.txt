Jim Snee.

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Once again this quarter, I want to recognize the heroic
work of our production team members. This team deserves much of the credit for our record sales results
this quarter as they continued working to produce safe, high-quality food for millions of consumers and
customers. Our #1 priority has been to keep our team members safe And our cross-functional COVID-19
leadership team is ensuring we are on the leading edge of the country's vaccination efforts. To date, we
have fully vaccinated over 51% of our domestic workforce, which is well ahead of the country's vaccination
rate. We are encouraged by the rapid decline in cases in our communities.

From a top line perspective, our balanced business model has again proven to be a winning formula
as our team delivered record sales for the second quarter and first half. In total, sales for the quarter
increased 8% compared to last year, and sales increased over 5% for the first half of the year. A key
driver of our sales performance is the rebound in our foodservice business. As expected, our foodservice
team experienced a strong recovery and took numerous actions to properly position our organization to
capitalize on the industry recovery.

For the quarter, foodservice sales increased 28%. This reflects an increase of 1% over 2019 prepandemic
levels. This is a significant accomplishment especially knowing where the industry was just a few short
months ago.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, our foodservice teams have been doing their part to support the
industry. Within days of the crisis, we worked closely with our distributor and operator partners to assist
their businesses in many different ways, whether it was a rebate program to offset food costs, extending

payment leniency, helping adjust to the new takeout delivery and pickup environment or simply being
available to personally check in with a restauranteur to see how they are doing.

Our confidence in the industry recovery never wavered. We know these actions benefited our distributor
and operator partners and are playing a part in our outperformance of the broader industry trends.

During this difficult labor environment, our experienced and tenured direct sales force is helping operators
meet their accelerating demand with products that simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize
labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item.

Products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoked barbecue, Fontanini, authentic Italian
meats, Hormel Bacon 1, Fully Cooked Bacon, holy Guacamole and Jennie-O Turkey are uniquely positioned
to meet this need. The brightest spot in our foodservice portfolio has been our pizza toppings business.
Prior to the pandemic, we capitalized on the continued growth in this category, especially for premium
products and invested heavily in capacity to meet future demand.

We've also been investing in plant-based offerings and are seeing growth from our plant-based pepperoni
and crumbles products. We're excited to leverage our expertise in the pizza toppings category to drive
growth in plant-based toppings. With our new capacity expansion at work and with additional pepperoni
capacity set to open at the beginning of fiscal 2022, we are set up nicely to meet the consistent growth we
have seen in this space.

With the foodservice industry recovery well underway, we will continue to strengthen our relationships
with our valued partners, invest in our direct sales team and support the industry's return to growth with
innovative, convenience and flavorful product solutions.

In addition to foodservice growth, our retail and deli businesses also remained healthy with demand
elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Total retail sales this quarter were flat to last year as we
lapped the months when consumers were stocking their pantries in anticipation of the pandemic.

Sales finished up 16% compared to the second quarter of 2019, and we continue to see strength from
our leading brands such as SPAM, Applegate, Jennie-O, Black Label, Herdez and Wholly. As a reminder,
we experienced an immediate and sustained demand surge for our shelf-stable products in the Grocery
Products segment at the onset of the pandemic. The second wave of demand that impacted our perishable
and refrigerated items happened weeks later in the third fiscal quarter.

Sales in the deli channel increased 4% this quarter and are up 9% over prepandemic levels. Hormel
Gatherings party trays delivered strong growth as consumers started to spend more time with family and
friends and consequently, are purchasing more products to entertain their guests. The Columbus brand
remains a cornerstone for our deli business and is now benefiting from the opening of our new plant in
Omaha, which is providing much-needed capacity.

Columbus is a leader in charcuterie, and we now have the capacity to continue expanding distribution.
Across the retail and deli space, our consumer takeaway metrics continue to be positive according to IRI.
Many of our brands have made large gains in household penetration. Overall buy rates are improving, and
we are seeing an expansion in cross purchasing across our brands. E-commerce sales grew double digits
in the last 12 weeks according to IRI, and we are gaining share in important categories.

We will continue to increase our investment in this important channel. Throughout the quarter, our supply
chain continued to improve as we were able to increase production levels through a combination of gaining
efficiencies, increasing capacities and leveraging our strategic supply chain partners.

Another area we have made great strides is in our distribution network. Over the last year, we have
opened a new grocery product distribution center and in recent weeks, have opened a refrigerated
distribution center serving the West Coast. These strategic investments will reduce overall freight miles
and cost, improve our customer service levels, support growth for our value-added businesses and reduce
greenhouse emissions.

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

From a bottom line perspective, operating income showed a slight decline. We saw raw material and feed
prices rapidly increase throughout the quarter. We have taken pricing actions in many categories but did
not see the full benefit of these actions during the quarter. As we have previously discussed, in volatile
market conditions, pricing will lag the markets, which will shift profits to subsequent quarters.

Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were flat to last year. A higher tax rate negatively impact
earnings by $0.01 per share compared to last year.

Turning to the segments. Refrigerated Foods volume increased 3% and sales increased 17%, with growth
coming from almost every division. Value-added sales increased 18%, driven by a significant recovery in
the foodservice businesses. As anticipated, we saw a rapid increase in foodservice demand as the quarter
progressed. Almost all categories within foodservice grew sales, led by our pizza toppings portfolio and
brands such as Fontanini and Bacon 1. In fact, pepperoni, pizza toppings, Bacon 1 and Fontanini authentic
Italian meats all showed growth compared to the second quarter of 2019.

We also experienced a recovery in the premium breakfast portfolio with growth from our Old Smokehouse
brand. Additionally, we saw excellent growth from our premium prepared proteins, which include brands
such as Austin Blues, Fire Braised, Cafe H and Sadlers. These items are key to our pre strategy. Items
that are premarinated, precooked, presliced and fully prepared. As the industry recovery accelerates into
the summer and labor remains the predominant challenge for most operators, our line of products offer
convenient, safe, versatile and flavorful solutions.

Our retail and deli teams delivered a strong quarter on the top line, with growth coming from products
such as Black Label Bacon, Hormel Gatherings, Applegate, Lloyd's Barbecue, Hormel Pepperoni and
Columbus prepared food items. Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 32% due to higher
foodservice sales, higher retail fresh pork profitability and decreased operational expenses due to abating
COVID-19 cost pressures.

International delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth, with sales increasing 17%
and segment profit increasing 6%. The performance of the team in China remains impressive. Foodservice
volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels driven by growth from SKIPPY, pizza toppings and Bacon
items.

Retail demand for the SPAM and SKIPPY brands has also been outstanding. The company's innovative
offerings, including beef jerky, SKIPPY snacking items and 2 new SPAM varieties are providing additional
avenues for growth, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our China business.

Branded exports also grew, with growth coming from the SKIPPY and SPAM brands, higher foodservice
sales and improved margins on fresh pork items. In addition, our partners in the Philippines, South Korea
and Europe continued to experience elevated demand for shelf-stable products.

Grocery Products results were strong given the difficult comparison to last year due to the extremely high
levels of demand experienced at the onset of the pandemic. Even though volume declined 14%, sales
declined 8% and segment profit declined 23%, we are encouraged by the segment's performance as we
have seen sustained consumer demand for many of our brands compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Sales for center store brands such as SPAM, Hormel Chili, Completes and Mary Kitchen hash were all over
20% higher compared to our second quarter of 2019. We will continue to support our leading brands,
including Skippy, SPAM, Completes, Herdez, Wholly, Justin's and Hormel Chile. And we're resuming
promotional activity as inventory levels normalize.

Our MegaMex joint venture performed well as equity and earnings increased 26%. Both the Herdez and
Wholly brands grew as consumers looked for authentic and convenient Mexican products to enhance
their at-home eating occasions. The Herdez brand continues to outperform the salsa category. This brand
has grown households by 3 million since the start of the pandemic and has introduced industry-leading
innovation to the marketplace in recent years.

Following the highly successful performance of Herdez Guacamole Salsa, we continue to expand
distribution and grow share with 2 new product lines: Herdez Taqueria Street Sauces and Herdez Salsa

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

Cremosa. Recently, Herdez also entered the hot sauce market with the introduction of Herdez Avocado Hot
Sauce, another versatile offering that can enhance any meal.

The Wholly brand had a strong quarter as well as it continues to target consumers looking for convenient
solutions to enjoy avocado offerings. Our recent innovations, including Wholly smashed and Wholly
diced avocado products, solved for that consumer need. And as we saw across many of our refrigerated
foodservice businesses, demand for avocado products in the channel started to return during the quarter.

Jennie-O volume decreased 3% and sales increased 2%. A recovery in the foodservice business and higher
whole bird sales drove the sales increase. Foodservice volumes were up double digits compared to last
year. Demand for Jennie-O retail products such as lean ground turkey remained above pre-pandemic
levels.

Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 54% due to the impact from higher feed costs. Grain prices
continued to increase significantly during the quarter, while pricing action had yet to be fully reflected in
the marketplace. Jim Sheehan will provide further commentary on the actions we have taken to manage
higher corn and soybean meal costs.

Looking to the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year sales guidance range to $10.2 billion
to $10.8 billion and reaffirming our earnings per share guidance range of $1.70 to $1.82 per share. As
a reminder, this guidance range does not include the estimated impact of the pending acquisition of the
Planters snacks nuts business. Our diversified and balanced business model gives us confidence we can
perform well in many different economic scenarios and market conditions.

We have a very positive outlook on the foodservice business as we head into the second half of the year.
We are well positioned from an inventory and capacity standpoint to meet the demand from our distributor
partners and operators and are confident in our ability to gain share throughout the recovery. Additionally,
we are increasingly confident that K-12 schools and colleges and universities will open and operate in a
more traditional manner this fall. This should benefit both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store.

We continue to see elevated demand in the retail, deli and international channels. We expect to further
benefit from pricing actions, increased capacities on key product lines and continued improvements in our
supply chain. This year, we have seen rapid increases in key input costs across our businesses. And we
expect to operate in a high-cost environment for the remainder of the year.

Our experienced management team has a proven ability to navigate and grow our business in volatile and
inflationary market conditions. And once again, we will be leveraging our direct sales force to partner with
our customers to mutually grow our businesses. As a reminder, our operations were heavily impacted by
plant shutdowns, supply shortages and lower production throughput caused by the effects of the pandemic
in the back half of fiscal 2020. This ultimately led to lower levels of inventory, which negatively affected
the third and fourth quarters. Through the strategic actions we have taken to improve all facets of our
operations and based on our record first half performance, we expect to benefit from more normalized
operations in the back half of fiscal 2021.

I am confident in our ability to continue growing, and I'm looking forward to closing the acquisition
of Planters next month. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial
information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position and provide commentary
regarding key input cost markets.

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Record sales for the second quarter were $2.6 billion, an increase of 8%.
First half sales increased 5% to $5.1 billion, also a record. Pretax earnings increased 2% for the quarter
compared to last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42 per share, flat to last year.

Second quarter results reflected approximately $0.01 per share in incremental COVID-related costs
and $0.01 in higher tax expense. SG&A, excluding advertising, was 6.5% of sales, down slightly to last

year. Advertising spend for the quarter was $31 million. Operating margins for the quarter were 11.1%
compared to 12.1% last year.

Higher raw material and feed costs negatively impacted margins as pricing lagged input cost increases. We
have taken numerous pricing actions across the portfolio to protect profitability. The actions will take place
early in the third quarter with additional pricing actions likely. COVID-related expenses were $6 million.
The impact of COVID expenses continued to decline.

Net unallocated expenses decreased due to higher investment income. The effective tax rate for the
quarter was 22.1% compared to 20.6% last year. Excluding the impact from the Planters acquisition, we
estimate the full year tax rate to be between 20% and 21.5%.

We built inventory during the quarter in preparation for higher demand and to support continued growth
for the remainder of the year. Our strategic action to build inventory was the primary driver of lower
operating cash flow during the quarter. We paid our 371st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 17,
at an annual rate of $0.98, a 5% increase over the prior year. Share repurchases were minimal during the
quarter.

Capital expenditures were $45 million in the quarter. The company's target for capital expenditures in
2021 is $260 million. During the second quarter, we saw dramatic increases in pork and hog prices. USDA
composite cutout prices since January have increased more than $30 with all primals contributing to the
increase.

Key inputs such as bellies and trim increased 57% and 76%, respectively, during the quarter. Pork exports
also set an all-time record in March due to African swine fever outbreaks in China, Southeast Asia and
Europe. We anticipate strength in pork markets due to continued export demand and a food service
recovery domestically. USDA is now projecting pork production for the year to be slightly lower than 2020.

Industry operating efficiencies are expected to improve as COVID pressures abate. However, labor
availability, tighter hog supplies and reductions in the South herd support higher markets. Our balanced
approach to hog and pork procurement mitigated cost volatility during the quarter.

In high-cost and volatile environments, the strength of our leading brands and balanced approach to
procurement continues to be a competitive advantage. The guidance range assumes elevated and volatile
market conditions for the balance of the year with some moderation heading into the fall.

We expect hog prices in the USDA composite cutout to remain well above year-ago levels due to strong
domestic and export demand along with tighter hog supplies. We anticipate prices to peak during the
summer and gradually decline in the fall, consistent with the seasonal increase in harvest.

Belly prices are projected to remain higher than last year in historical averages. We anticipate markets
to stabilize near the current levels, but volatility due to low cold storage levels and strong demand in the
foodservice channel could cause inflationary pressure.

Pork trim prices are expected to moderate from the current levels, but labor shortages across the industry
remains a key risk to trim prices as limited boning capacity directly impacts trim supply and pricing. Due
to the higher beef harvest levels in the several months, beef prices are anticipated to be lower in the back
half of 2021.

In response to global supply and demand imbalances in corn and soybean deal, we have taken strategic
hedges to fully cover grain costs for the remainder of the year. The physicians also provide a benefit if
markets decline. These hedges, coupled with the previously announced pricing actions, are expected to
protect Jennie-O's profitability.

Turkey pulp placements and egg sales have declined. Inventory levels are lower compared to last year.
The tightening of supply has led to higher whole turkey and thigh meat markets. We have also recently
seen an increase in breast meat prices. A recovery in the foodservice industry remains the key driver for
higher prices for the support market.

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

We anticipate inflationary pressure on freight in the back half of the year. The tactical action to optimize
our distribution network with 2 new DCs, combined with improvements in loan efficiencies will help
mitigate a portion of the increase. We have attained the required regulatory approvals for the acquisition
of the Planters snack nut business. The scheduled close date is in June.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.

Peter Thomas Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Jim, I guess, just thinking about the guide and the move in sales relative to kind of keeping EPS flat.
If we were to just take the midpoint of the sales guide, it kind of implies that you'll see a relatively
decent acceleration in gross margins in the back half of the year, something in the magnitude of 60 to
70 basis points kind of versus what you did in the front half. A, I just wanted to see if that's kind of how
directionally you're thinking about it and just given all the headwinds you've called out, understanding
that the pricing actions that are coming through, what would drive kind of that sequential improvement in
gross margin?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Peter, thanks for the question. I mean, and really, what we're talking about here is the timing, the
volatility, the magnitude of the inflation that we're seeing. And so the pricing actions that we've taken
didn't happen all right at the beginning of the second quarter. And quite frankly, we're not done with
all the pricing actions that we need to take. So we've got a lot of activity on that front. And so just the
sequential action in our pricing is what will lead to that sequential improvement in margins.

And so as you think about Q3, you'll see improvement, but probably some slightly lower margins as
pricing hasn't quite caught up. Q4 really start to see more normalized margins as full pricing takes effect
across the board. And I think it's important to note that we've either taken or will take price across almost
all of our business.

Peter Thomas Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. Maybe just to clarify there, Jim, on the third quarter, is that lower margins sequentially
versus last year versus normal? And then just the second question, as we think about Jennie-O, obviously,
you've locked in some of the seat costs for the remainder of the year. Jim Sheehan, I think you've tossed
out a 9% operating margin bogey as a target maybe for this year. Is that time line kind of pushed out to
'22 or '23 at this point?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'll start on Q3. And I think your -- the first question is that's relative to last year. So slightly lower
margins to last year just as pricing hasn't fully caught up.

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

I'll touch on the JOTS issue, Peter. First of all, as we've talked about, their pricing is now in place to cover
that first ramp-up of grain costs. And as we talked about, we've protected the grain cost for the rest of the
year and with also having downside protection on that. So we're 100% covered on grain.

The other thing is that we talk about is what's happening in the markets. When you think about Jennie-
O, the fundamentals, which we keep pointing towards over the last few years are better. Hog sets and
our egg sets and fold placements are both down 3% to 4%. And you're starting to see that with the cold
storage levels continue to be at 26% below -- 26% below the 5-year average. What you're starting to see
now is some nice improvements in the commodity markets around Turkey.

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

For instance, yesterday, you saw breast meat at $2.11. The -- there are a lot of watchouts on JOTS, but
there's also a fair amount of upside and we're starting to see that upside come through. We've watched
these -- the fundamentals point towards better markets for probably a year now. They really haven't taken
place, but they do seem to be taking place as we go forward. As far as the 9%, yes, these -- the drastic
jump up in grain costs obviously delay that. So we look at the full year margin of 9%, that's really been
pushed out up there.

Operator

The next question today will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Jim, Sheehan, maybe continuing on some of the JOTS questions there. In your last response, you
referenced kind of a whole -- a bunch of -- some positives, but a bunch of watchouts, apart from grain
cost, I'd love to hear kind of the key things that are still on your mind is, is it reflective of demand growth
and kind of your performance in retail, shelf penetration? Just what are you kind of focused on there
besides the grain cost that you watch out?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

I'll start with a little bit on the watchouts. And I'll turn it over to Jim to talk about the performance.

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

I think as you look at the inflation that we've seen recently and as you look forward, obviously, you have
-- the grain is impacting inflation. For that, you've got the demand, though we know that demand is very
solid. Weather conditions look pretty good. Plating intentions seem to be maybe a little bit understated at
the USDA. So that looks okay. It looks good at this point. Obviously, in June, we'll have a better read of
that.

But as I would look at things, I think the other thing that's impacting inflation is labor availability. I mean
getting people back into their jobs will, I think, alleviate some of the labor pressure. From a COVID
standpoint, we're in really good shape, but it's getting new hires. It's getting people back to the job that
probably is a watch out for me, not only at JOTS but across the industry.

Jim?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And Adam, I would say more from a business perspective, I think our retail business has performed
well. Again, it's hard in the year-over-year environment. But if we go back to pre-pandemic, especially
on our lean ground turkey, very, very strong performance, pleased with distribution gains, household
penetration, the velocities that we're seeing.

And from a foodservice perspective, they're a little bit more exposed to the K-12 business, the school
business, which obviously didn't come back in full strength. We do expect to see that in the fall and then
spill over into 2022. So as we think about it from a retail and foodservice perspective, there is optimism
on the business front.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

All right. That color is really helpful. And then my second question was really just thinking about trajectory
of foodservice. As we go into the back half of the year, you kind of gave some color where the second
quarter was up versus '19 levels. How do you think the industry performed or, I guess, the relevant

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

categories for you on a similar metric and just areas where you think you're maybe gaining some outsized
share that's giving you some optimism?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean I think it's fair to say in a really broad based, we outperformed the industry here in the
second quarter. And that's not new, right? I mean, as even prepandemic, we talked about our foodservice
business typically growing at double the industry rate. And so we're confident that we've outgrown or
grown faster than the industry. For us, where we see future opportunities in a number of our segments,
we haven't seen lodging come back. We really haven't seen college and university fully come back, which
is a big part of our Hormel foodservice business.

I referenced K-12 for the Jennie-O foodservice business. So there's still a lot of dynamics at play. And
so even as these other segments, these other channels really start to reopen, those are going to have a
favorable impact on our foodservice business as well.

Operator

The next question today will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So I guess just given what we saw in Q2, foodservice now above where you were in 2019, grocery is still
very strong. So if you exit the pandemic, I mean, do you guys think now that you have a much higher
foodservice and grocery business going forward?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

I think, Rupesh, I mean we've always felt very confident in all of our business, obviously. We've talked a
lot about the strength of our business, in particular, in center of the store. And so we think it will continue
to be strong post pandemic. You're going to have some moving parts and some volatility in year-over-
year, quarter-to-quarter. But I want -- I believe once things settle down, we'll see our continued strength
in center of the store grocery business, continued strength in our refrigerated retail business. And then
we've always talked about our real competitive advantage in the foodservice space. And I think that's
playing out right now. It will continue to play out this year and into the future.

Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And then maybe one follow-up question. So as you look at grocery products, I was curious how you
guys are thinking about that segment for the balance of the year. And then as sales trends have turned
negative for other players as well, how would you characterize the current promotional backdrop?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. The biggest driver for us right now, Rupesh, is getting some of those Tier 2 and Tier 3 items back on
shelf. And that's really what retailers need as we want to provide more promotional activity in the back
half of the year and into '22. You can't just have one variety and have a promotion. So as our supply
chain has recovered and we've been able to focus on those varieties, we're seeing retailers being a lot
more willing to engage in promotional discussions, which will be very, very helpful for the business in the
balance of '21 into '22.

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

The only thing I'd add to that, Rupesh, is that remember, our fourth quarter in GP was significantly
constrained by capacity issues in our operations.

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

Operator

The next question will come from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You mentioned on the earnings call that more price is expected to flow through in the second half of the
year. Price/mix 11% this quarter, highest in years. I know you typically don't provide this. But just given
the magnitude of the price mix figure, could you help with some detail on how much mix really contributed
to that number in the second quarter? And then how much maybe pricing we should expect to really ramp
as we look at the second half of the year? I mean if you're putting up a limit now, I mean are we throwing
5% on top of that or some sizable number?

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's a great question, Tom. As you think about our business and that price mix, I mean, really a key
driver in the second quarter was our foodservice business which tends to track markets more closely
than the retail business. We have -- we did have some impact of retail pricing in the quarter. But again, it
wasn't for the entire quarter. But the big driver in the quarter was foodservice.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then in the prepared remarks, Jim Sheehan, you noted the magnitude of hog and pork price
increases. Last year, you saw some weaker hog pricing. You called out hedging losses. I know there'll
be more color in the 10-Q, but just any detail on hedging this quarter such as maybe gains that flowed
through?

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Tom. I appreciate the question. Remember, our accounting method is one that we do not mark-
to-market our positions, but we run them through the cost of goods at the time the product is sold.
So as you look at our -- the realized gains and losses are in the quarter, the unrealized are in other
comprehensive income. And those will be in the $45 million range of unrealized gains and losses. And that
would be for hogs, grain and our interest positions.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Just to confirm, not a factor this quarter, it was recognized...

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

It didn't give us much help this quarter. It was a pretty immaterial amount.

Operator

And the next question will come from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I guess a couple of clarity questions. Just on that, Jim, the $45 million, I guess those are hedging gains.
So those will flow through in a positive way to your P&L as you sell the product. But it's also -- there's also
higher input costs flowing through also. So they're kind of fighting against each other for the next couple
of quarters. Is that the way to think about it?

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean they're unrealized gains. They're gains based on the markets that close. What would be a
factor? Now we also, as I stated before, we also have our interest hedges in there, too. So those are
more related to the debt that we will be issuing and have a longer tail than obviously the grain or the hog
markets. So it's a mixture.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. I'll follow up on that. Regarding the 6% pricing in grocery in the quarter, can you give a little color
on what kind of product lines you raised the pricing on. Is that going to accelerate as well? Or is that kind
of like a new normal for a while because of actions you took in March?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Probably the biggest driver to pricing in the front part of the year, Rob, was the SKIPPY price increase
that we took earlier in the year. In GP, I mean, we still have additional pricing action to come whether it's
SPAM or Herdez, I mean, a number of different GP items. So we did have some in the first half, but there's
still more to come in the back half of the year.

Operator

The next question will come from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just wanted to go back to the share gains kind of broadly and maybe try to understand a little bit the
landscape at a high level. I guess just looking at in your foodservice growth versus 2019 and the strong
retail growth versus 2019. Assuming people aren't just eating more, there's clearly some momentum
there that it's coming from somewhere. And I suppose there's a chance there's maybe a permanent reset
of pantry inventory, but even that probably is small. So can you just give a sense of who you're gaining
share from? Are there smaller competitors that have -- suppliers that have gone out of business? Or just
how do you kind of understand how you're sourcing your share gains?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean it's a mix, again, depending on which category you're talking about. I mean in some cases,
we are in line with categories, so whether you think bacon or SPAM or peanut butter. I think we've seen
some outpacing in some of our meal offerings, as you mentioned. I think we've seen it in our Mexican
portfolio, which really is taking that share from competitors. So I think as you go across the portfolio,
Michael, it really is a mixed bag of where those share gains are coming from.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And just following up on the foodservice piece. You called out the boost it gave partly from the pass-
through pricing there. Can you give us a sense of how much pricing is passed through in your portfolio
versus just what requires a list increase?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

I mean the majority of the Foodservice business is, I'll call it, off a traditional price list. So that gets
adjusted on a weekly basis and we tend to see that pricing reflected in we've always said within 30
days. So a significant portion of our business is still done that way. We do have some other pricing
arrangements, obviously, with larger national accounts. But just think about it where the majority -- more
than the majority of the business is on a pass-through basis.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And on the retail side?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean, we've always said that's more of a 90-day price action in terms of having a discussion with
the customer getting accepted and then getting it implemented. Really the only difference there would be
retail fresh pork, which I mean, does play a role and still has a significant part of our portfolio. But it's --
that is priced on a weekly basis.

Operator

The next question will come from Eric Larson with Seaport Global Securities.

Eric Jon Larson
Seaport Research Partners

So the first question is, and I think Jim Sheehan kind of referred to some of this, but can you talk a little
bit about hog supplies. We're not going to see a huge increase in production this year. These high grain
prices probably are disincentive yet we have hog prices -- live prices well over $100, 100 weight right
now. Supply constraints on your biggest raw material, is that a possibility going forward here? And it looks
like grain prices could be high for a while. So how do you look at maybe the next couple of years, just not
just this year, but maybe next in terms of hog production in the U.S.? And what are farmers doing out
there?

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as we've talked about in the past, Eric, we do long-term contracts with our producers. And as you
are aware, these producers are large operators with a high level of capital and tend to keep their barns
filled. We also get a large portion of our production from a contracted facility, the Fremont facility, which
is made up of producers. They tend to like to keep their own plants full. So I'm very confident that we'll
have the supply that we need both short term and long term. We go through these cycles all the time. Hog
prices have increased rapidly. The prices have gone up a lot. You're right. Grain prices are high right now.
We'll see how the growing season -- what the results are from the growing season to see what impact it
has on prices. But these are long-term agreements and we're not having anybody get into negotiations
about taking down their volumes. So I'm highly confident.

Eric Jon Larson
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. Then my follow-up question is on your supply chain conversion and all your efforts that you've done
on that, which has been quite remarkable. And I think we even alluded to the benefits of your improved
supply chain in your -- in the press release. But I believe if we go back, I think at one point, you said that
supply chain was going to -- you have this number incorrect. So correct me if I'm wrong, but [ bought ]
$75 million of supply chain cost benefits, but that was a while back. Can you give us a quick update
on how the supply chain is helping you here? And it's got to be helping your cost structure. And then
obviously, it keeps you from having to price too aggressively as well. So can you share that dynamic with
us and give us a little update there?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. And it's a great question, Eric. And we have spent a lot of time and effort over the last 3-plus years
putting together our One Supply Chain. And it's really been our initiative to take this fragmented approach
throughout the supply chain and really capitalize on the efficiencies and take cost out. And so we've done
a lot of great work in our operations, in our logistics, as we mentioned, our -- some of the warehousing

15

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

initiatives that we still had going on. And you're right. Probably the first 2 years of supply chain and even
going into the pre-pandemic, we talked about our ability to have cost savings of $75 million.

Last year, obviously, was a bit of a disruption, but that didn't stop the good work that was happening
behind the scenes. And I think you see that play through when we talk about our ability to open up new
warehouses to help mitigate some of the cost pressure on GP and now on our refrigerated portfolio. So
-- and the other thing is for me personally, I can't imagine us having gone through the pandemic with a
fragmented supply chain, having one voice from the top, setting direction and making sure that the entire
team was aligned was very, very powerful and necessary for the organization. So I mean the benefits to
the organization have far outweighed the financial returns. And we are in a significantly better place today
as a result of our efforts on One Supply Chain.

Eric Jon Larson
Seaport Research Partners

Have a great memorial holiday.

Operator

And the next question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

This is Pooran on for Ben. I just had one quick question. What is the ramp in foodservice sales and the
corresponding capacity utilization improvement contributed to margin?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean I think there's -- obviously, they go hand-in-hand. And we've talked about some of coming
out of -- or, I should say, in the midst of the pandemic, the underutilized capacity, which, of course, led to
some of our increased COVID costs.

So there has been a benefit. But really, the big driver and the way you should think about the foodservice
business is the volume that we've been able to drive in the marketplace. And really, it's the reopening, the
reengagement with distributors and operators. And then I mentioned earlier with a number of different
segments that really haven't opened yet or hit their stride. So not only do we feel good about where we
are today, but the opportunities that are yet to come.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. Great. And maybe if I could just squeeze one more in.

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Go ahead.

Pooran Sharma
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Just regarding your price increases, do you think that you'll be able to hang on to some of these increases
after this period of cost inflation abates? And maybe you can just help us think through what will be easier
versus harder to achieve?

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. That's a great question, and it's something that we talk about a lot because nobody likes to be in the
midst of the inflationary period with all the market volatility. But it's not new to us, right? I mean we've

managed through multiple inflationary periods over the course of our business. And our management
team, our leadership has a well-established plan for how we take pricing, how we appropriately promote.
And really, to your point about how we work hard to maintain that pricing over time. So yes, we do believe
that we'll be able to do that as we've demonstrated in the past.

Operator

The next question will come from Antonio Hernandez with Barclays.

Antonio Hernández Vélez Leija
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

[ Reading ] the International segment, international payment sales were very good, good margins, not
that over increasing. Could you give us a little bit more guidance on what you're seeing there? Is there
any difference from expenses and cost point of view from the international segment and your domestic
segment?

James N. Sheehan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'd say the big issue -- the big difference between the international and domestic right now is the
whole ocean freight issue, including containers. That's creating some additional cost in the system.
Freight, we've been able -- freight's up a little bit domestically. We've been able to manage that as we've
improved our supply chain. But ocean containers freight availability goes back to this issue around labor.
That's created some, not only higher cost but also some shipping interruption. And I think that's probably
going to last for the rest of the year.

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. But the optimism that we have in our international segment, I mean it is broad-based, but certainly
with a high level of focus on the continued growth and the continued success that we're seeing in
China from both our retail and foodservice businesses. And I mentioned it in my remarks, but we're
really excited about the performance of SPAM. How we've been able to really gain distribution and the
acceptance of that brand and how we're launching innovative new flavors.

The Skippy business continues to be very, very strong. Nontraditional innovation with our Hormel Beef
jerky. And so we continue to expect growth coming out of that business and across all areas, other
multinational exports and partnerships.

Operator

This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over
to management for any closing remarks.

James P. Snee
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Well, thank you all for joining us today. Our strong performance this quarter once again demonstrated
the resilience of our entire team and the strength of our balanced portfolio. We know that we still have
work to do for the balance of the year, but we remain very optimistic about the future, and we look
forward to bringing the Planters business and the Planters team on board in June. Thanks again for joining
us.

Operator
The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now
disconnect.
