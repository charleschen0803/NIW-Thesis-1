KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the Kinder Morgan's quarterly earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. If you
have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you,
sir. You may begin.

Richard D. Kinder
Executive Chairman of the Board

Thank you, Missy. Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that KMI's earnings release today and
this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Before making any investment decision, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-
looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release
as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such
forward-looking statements.

With that out of the way, let me just say that like a broken record, each quarter, I open our call with
comments on the strong cash flow we're generating and how we're using and intend to use that cash
flow. Whether you look at our cash flow for the second quarter, for year-to-date, or our projections for the
full year, it's apparent that we continue to be a strong generator of cash flow. It's also apparent that we
continue to live comfortably within that cash flow.

The question investors should ask on a continuous basis is whether we are wise stewards of that cash.
We have said repeatedly that we would use our funds to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay a good and
growing dividend, invest in new projects or acquisitions when they met our relatively high return hurdle
rates and opportunistically repurchase our shares.

This quarter, we announced 2 fairly significant acquisitions. The first was our purchase of the Stagecoach
natural gas storage and pipeline assets in the Northeast for approximately $1.2 billion. These assets
expand our services to our customers by helping connect natural gas supply with Northeast demand areas.
The acquisition is immediately accretive to our shareholders, and I believe it will be an important and
profitable asset for KMI for many years to come.

Our second acquisition is to make an attractive platform investment in the rapidly growing renewable
natural gas market by purchasing Kinetrex for approximately $300 million. Steve will talk about this
acquisition in detail. We believe there is a bright future for this business and other related energy
transition businesses that we are exploring.

Now let me conclude with 2 important points. Both of these acquisitions meet our hurdle rates that I
referred to earlier, and both are being paid for with our internally generated cash. I believe both fit within
the long-term financial strategy that I speak to each quarter, and I can assure you that our Board looks at
all alternatives in a manner completely consistent with that financial strategy.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to make a couple of additional comments about the 2 acquisitions and then
turn it over to Kim and David.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2021

On the Stagecoach, storage and transportation assets drew $1.2 billion. We closed that transaction earlier
this month. It adds 41 Bcf of certificated and pretty flexible working gas storage capacity and 185 miles of
pipeline. We're excited about this transaction for several reasons. As we discussed on the first quarter call,
we think storage value is going to increase over time. Its value was certainly revealed during Winter Storm
Uri, and we've seen that start to show up in our commercial transactions.

Storage will also become more valuable as more intermittent renewable resources are added to the
grid. The Stagecoach assets are well interconnected with our Tennessee Gas Pipeline system as well as
other third-party systems in a part of the country that is constrained from an infrastructure standpoint,
and frankly, where it is difficult to get new infrastructure permitted and built. We're excited about this
transaction and believe it will pay off nicely for our shareholders.

The second transaction, which we announced at the end of last week, was accomplished by our newly
formed Energy Transition Ventures Group. We put that together in the first quarter of this year. We're
acquiring Kinetrex, a renewable natural gas business, subject to regulatory approval and a couple of other
closing conditions. At signing, Kinetrex had secured 3 new signed development projects that we will build
out over the next 18 months, resulting in a purchase price plus capital at a less than 6x EBITDA multiple
by the time we get to 2023.

With Kinetrex, we're picking up a rare platform investment in a highly fragmented market. It gives us
a nice head start on working on hundreds, if not thousands, of potential renewable natural gas project
candidates in the U.S.

A few more points on this deal. As several of you pointed out in your comments post announcement, the
value is dependent on RINs value. You don't make money on the gas sale, with an important exception
that I'll get to in a minute. Importantly, the particular RINs that this business generates are D3 RINs,
which can be used to satisfy other RINs obligations as well. D3s are for advanced biofuels, and promoting
more of those in the transportation fuel market has had bipartisan support and even more support from
the environmental community than conventional ethanol.

While there is some regulatory flexibility in EPA's hands, there is an underlying statutory framework, again
with bipartisan support, combined with widely acknowledged greenhouse gas benefits that further protects
the value of this category of RINs in particular.

Having said that, we believe we'll have the opportunity to mitigate our exposure to RINs pricing volatility.
Based on conversations with potential customers, not signed deals yet but conversations so far, there is
significant interest in renewable natural gas in the so-called "voluntary market." These are customers
who are outside of the transport fuel market who are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and we
believe would transact on a long-term fixed price basis.

There are also potential customers interested in sharing the risk and reward of the RINs value. So we will
look for appropriate ways to lock in the value of the environmental attributes on attractive terms.

When we talked about our Energy Transition Ventures Group in the past, we've talked about transacting on
attractive returns for our shareholders, not loss leaders and not doing things for show. This deal is a great
example of that. In the team's short existence so far, they've acted on an attractive opportunity, and they
continue to work on a number of other specific project opportunities. So very good progress in a short
period of time.

These 2 deals illustrate a couple of key points, broader points, about our business. The larger deal,
Stagecoach, is a further investment in our existing natural gas business, where we own the largest
transportation and storage network in the country. That reflects our view that our existing business will be
needed for decades to come. Hydrocarbons, and especially natural gas, have very stubborn advantages
and will play an essential role in meeting the growing need for energy around the world. That's something
we are well positioned for with our assets and especially considering our considerable connectivity with
export markets, especially in natural gas but also in refined products.

At the same time, we do see opportunities in the energy evolution, I'm putting emphasis on evolution, and
we're positioning ourselves there as well. We're doing this in our base business, where our gas delivery

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2021

capability provides the needed backup for renewables at far lower cost and longer duration than batteries.
We're doing it in responsibly sourced, that is low methane emissions, natural gas. We had our second such
transaction this quarter. We're doing it in our refined products businesses where we handle renewable
transportation fuels, and we are actively developing additional business in that part of our business as
well.

The Kinetrex transaction, while relatively small, positions us to develop a new business line in the
renewable energy space at attractive returns and with a bit of a head start. The takeaway from all of this
is that we continue to see strong long-term value in the assets and service offerings we have today while
also pivoting in an appropriate and value-creating way to the faster-growing parts of the energy business.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.

Kimberly Allen Dang
President & Director

Okay. Thanks, Steve. First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high
level about our forecast for the full year.

Starting with the natural gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or
approximately 1.5 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2020. And that was driven primarily
by LNG, Mexico exports, and power demand on TGP, the PHP in-service, higher industrial and LNG
demand on our Texas intrastate system, and then higher deliveries to our Elba Express LNG facility. These
increases were partially offset by lower volumes on CIG. And that's due to declines in Rockies production
and Fayetteville Express contract expirations.

Physical deliveries to LNG off of our pipeline averaged approximately 5 million dekatherms per day. That's
a huge increase versus the second quarter of 2020. LNG volumes also increased versus the first quarter
of this year by approximately 8%. Our market share of LNG export volumes is about 48%. Exports to
Mexico were up about 20% versus the second quarter of 2020. Our share of Mexico volumes is about
54%. Overall, deliveries to power plants were relatively flat. Deliveries to LDCs were down slightly, while
deliveries to industrial facilities were up 4%.

Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 12% in the quarter compared to the second quarter
of '20. For gathering volumes, though, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter.
So compared to the first quarter of this year, volumes were up about 6%. And here, we saw nice increases
in Hiland volumes, which were up about 10%; and the Haynesville volumes, reports were up about 13%.

In our products pipeline segment, refined products were up 37% for the quarter versus the second
quarter of '20. Volumes are also up about 17% versus the first quarter of this year. So we saw substantial
improvement both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Compared to the pre-pandemic levels, and
we're using the second quarter of 2019 as the reference point, road fuels, and that's gasoline and diesel
combined, are essentially flat, and jet fuel is still down about 26%.

Crude and condensate volumes were up 6% in the quarter versus the second quarter of '20, and
sequentially, they were up very slightly. In our Terminals business segment, our liquids utilization remains
high. If you exclude the tanks out of service or required inspections, approximately 98% of our tanks are
leased. Most of the revenue that we receive comes from fixed monthly charges we receive for tanks under
lease, but we do receive a marginal amount of revenue from throughput, and we saw throughput increase
significantly, about 22% in total on our liquids terminals, 26% if you're just looking at refined products.
But that still remains a little bit below 2019, up 6% on total liquids volumes, 5% when you're just looking
at gasoline and diesel.

We continue to experience some weakness in our marine tanker business. But as we said last quarter, we
expect that this market will improve, but it may take until late this year as the charter activity tends to lag
the underlying supply and demand fundamentals.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2021

On the bulk side, volumes increased by 23%, and that was driven by coal and steel. Mill utilization of our
largest steel customer exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Coal export economics improved for both met and
thermal coal.

In the CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 9%. CO2 volumes were down about 10% year-
over-year. Increased oil and NGL prices did offset some of the volume degradation. But if you compare to
our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes will exceed our budget by approximately 5%, and
that's driven primarily by some nice performance on SACROC. CO2 volumes, we also expect to exceed our
budget.

So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas volumes and demand from LNG and Mexico exports as well
as industrial demand on the Gulf Coast. We're seeing increased gathering volumes in the Bakken and the
Haynesville and nice recovery of refined products volumes. Crude oil volumes are above our expectations
in our CO2 segment, and we're getting some price help. We still experienced some weakness in our Jones
Act tankers, and the Eagle Ford remains highly competitive.

Now let me give you a very high-level update of our full year forecast. As we said in the release, we're
currently projecting full year DCF of $5.4 billion. That's above the high end of the range that we gave
you last quarter. The range we gave you last quarter was $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. The outperformance
versus the high end of the range is driven by our Stagecoach acquisition, higher commodity prices and
better refined products volumes.

And with that, I'll turn it over to David.

David Patrick Michels
VP & CFO

All right. Thanks, Kim. For the second quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share,
which is $1.08 annualized, and that's up 3% from the second quarter of 2020. This quarter, we generated
revenue of $3.15 billion, which is up $590 million from the second quarter of 2020. We also had higher
cost of sales with an increase there of $495 million. So netting those 2 together, gross margin was up $95
million.

This quarter, we also took an impairment of our South Texas gathering and processing assets of $1.6
billion. So with that impact, we generated a loss -- net loss of $757 million for the quarter.

Looking at adjusted earnings, which is before certain items, primarily the South Texas asset impairment
this quarter and the midstream goodwill impairment a year ago, we generated income of $516 million this
quarter, up $135 million from the second quarter of 2020.

Moving on to the segment EBDA and distributable cash flow performance. Natural gas -- our natural
gas segment was up $48 million for the quarter, and that was up primarily due to favorable margins in
our Texas Intrastate business; greater contributions from our PHP asset, which is now in service; and
increased volumes on our Bakken gas gathering systems. Partially offsetting those items were lower
volumes on our South Texas and KinderHawk gathering and processing assets and lower contributions
from FEP due to contract roll-offs.

Our product segment was up $66 million driven by a nice recovery in refined product volume. Terminals
was up $17 million, also driven by the nice refined product volume recovery, partially offset by lower
utilization of our Jones Act tankers. Our CO2 segment was down $5 million due to lower crude oil and CO2
volumes and some increased well work costs. Those are partially offset by higher realized crude oil and
NGL pricing.

Our G&A and corporate charges were lower by $7 million. This is where we benefited from our
organizational efficiency savings as well as some lower noncash pension expenses, partially offset by some
lower capitalized G&A costs. Our JV DD&A category was lower by $27 million primarily due to Ruby. And
that brings us to our adjusted EBITDA of $1.670 billion, which is 7% higher than the second quarter of
2020.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2021

Moving below EBITDA. Interest expense was $16 million favorable driven by our lower LIBOR rates
benefiting our interest rate swaps as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt.
And those are partially offset by lower capitalized interest expenses versus last year. Our cash taxes for
the quarter were unfavorable $40 million, mostly due to Citrus, our products Southeast pipeline and Texas
margin tax deferrals, which were taken in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, just timing. And for the full
year, our cash taxes are in line with our budget.

Our sustaining capital was unfavorable $51 million for the quarter driven by higher spend in our natural
gas, CO2 and Terminals segments, but that higher spend is in line with what we had budgeted for the
quarter. Our total DCF of $1.025 billion is up 2%, and our DCF per share of $0.45 per share is up $0.01
from last year.

On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 3.8x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down nicely from 4.6x at
year-end. Kim already mentioned that we updated our full year guidance, which now has DCF and EBITDA
above the top end of the range that we provided in the first quarter. For debt-to-EBITDA, we expect to end
the year at 4.0x. That includes the acquisitions of Stagecoach, which we closed on July 9; and Kinetrex,
which we expect to close in the third quarter.

As a reminder, that level -- that -- our year-end debt-to-EBITDA level has the benefits of the largely
nonrecurring EBITDA generated during Winter Storm Uri earlier in the year, and our longer-term leverage
target of around 4.5x has not changed.

On to reconciliation of our net debt. The net debt for the quarter ended at $30 billion, almost $30.2 billion,
down $1.847 billion from year-end and about $500 million down from Q1. Our net debt has now declined
by over $12 billion or about 30% since our peak levels.

To reconcile the change in the quarter in net debt, we generated $1.025 billion of DCF. We paid out
approximately $600 million of dividends. We spent approximately $100 million of growth capital and
contributions to our joint ventures. And we had $175 million of working capital source of cash flows,
primarily interest expense accrual. That explains the majority of the change for the quarter. For the
change year-to-date, we generated $3.354 billion of distributable cash flow. We spent $1.2 billion on
dividends. We've spent $300 million on growth CapEx and JV contributions. We received $413 million on
our partial interest sale of NGPL. And we have experienced a working capital use of approximately $425
million, and that explains the majority of the change for the year.

That completes the financial review, and I will turn it back to Steve.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'm going to resist the temptation to ask about CCUS and ask about 2 different questions. I was just
curious, I guess, with the RNG space. It seems like that's a very fragmented industry where Kinder,
historically, has played a role in fragmented industries in being a consolidator. Do you see a similar
opportunity set here? And I guess also, it seems like there is a good amount of competition from private
equity and those with very low cost of capital to go after these types of targets. So just wondering if you
could talk about the competitive landscape at this point.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Sure. It is a very fragmented market, as you point out. And that does create some -- I think, some good
open fields running for us. There aren't -- as I said, this is kind of a rare platform investment. We don't
generally comment on M&A just because it's very hard to project results there. It's something that we'd
be open to again if we can get the right returns. But we think we've got a lot of opportunity to build this
business organically.

And we think what we bring to the table in terms of competitive advantages, our existing network and our
existing footprint. And I would describe that just in terms of the obvious physical assets, the pipelines and
storage that we have, but also the customer access and customer contacts that we have that will enable
us, I think, in some decent-sized chunks to develop and originate some additional business really in both
categories: the voluntary market as well as the transport market.

We've got good project management expertise. We're actually looking at whether or not we can make
some of the equipment that's being deployed in these areas. And so we think we bring a lot to the table.
We're getting a good team as part of this acquisition. So we think we can expand this business, expand it
organically and do it in a way that the returns are attractive.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting to the Permian and gas takeaway. Just wondering
if you could update us there on thoughts. It seems the capacity is loose now with PHP online, Whistler
soon to be online. But if the Permian grows as some expect, there could be tightness in the next couple
of years, 2 to 3 years. But I guess, that timing really depends also on how much Mexican demand
materializes. It seems like the long-awaited demand started to show up here. So just wondering if you
could talk about those dynamics and, I guess, how you see Permian gas takeaway needs evolving over
time.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. So we agree generally with your projection there, that we do think that the Permian, as it continues
to fill up, and it is a very active area again, as you know, that there will be a need for another -- yet
another pipe to come out of there. And both our view of it as well as third-party views that we gather on
this, is that's probably mid-decade, which means that you have to start the commercial conversations a
couple of years or maybe a little more ahead of that.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2021

So it's still -- we had pretty active conversations in that arena before. We know who to talk to about
it. I wouldn't characterize those as super active right now, but we think they could as we get closer to
tightening up the Permian.

Operator

Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe I'll start off on the guidance side. I definitely appreciate the color that you just provided to Jeremy's
question. But with respect to the guidance, it seems like it's raised by a couple of hundred million, and
you sort of seem to -- indicating about exceeding or -- meeting or exceeding the top end of the range. I
was wondering if you can just sort of expand on the drivers on the change. I mean, obviously, there's the
Stagecoach acquisition, which you mentioned. There's the RNG acquisition as well, but it doesn't seem to
account for all of it.

Is it something related to better expectations in your refined products business? Is it on the natural gas
side? I'm just curious if you can give us a little bit of color on the elements involved in the guidance
update.

Kimberly Allen Dang
President & Director

Yes. The 2 primary factors other than the Stagecoach acquisition are improved refined product volumes
from what we previously expected. And as we said, on the product side of the business, road fuel is now
flat with 2019 compared to second quarter of this year versus second quarter of 2019. And then the other
primary driver is higher commodity prices. And I'm measuring -- those are the primary changes against
the high end of the guidance of $5.3 billion.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Great. And maybe as a follow-up question, last quarter, when you adjusted your guidance, you sort
of pulled forward the Ruby recontracting and sort of -- in fact, I've sort of been thinking about the last 3 or
4 years, you've kind of had like a recontracting trend in the natural gas segment that's essentially resulted
in lower contract ranges and so forth. It's been about $100 million to $200 million, about a year drag on
EBITDA.

Is that now substantially over? And so all the growth-related projects that you're talking about on the
Energy Venture side and so forth or any of the capital that you spend will, in fact, be additive to EBITDA
from this point going forward?

Just kind of curious if we're kind of done with the recontracting resets, if -- maybe there's a little bit left,
but is it substantially out of the way at this point?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. We do see it being lower post 2021. And we update that, as you know, every January, when we do
our investor conference. And we'll do that again. But it is -- we see it as being lower in terms of the rollout
post 2021.

And so the background there, as I think you know well, is that 10 years ago or a little bit more, we built a
number of pipelines that were kind of point-to-point pipelines. And they were built on the strength of long-
term contractual commitments in a very high-basis environment. And so as you get to the end of those
10- or 10-plus-year contracts and they start to roll off, they're rolling off into a more challenged-basis
environment for those particular pipes. And so that has had the effect of kind of masking or dampening,
however you want to see it, some of the, I think, strong underlying performance in our natural gas

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2021

pipeline segment. So that's what's been going on. And as I said, I think we see that as being lower from
here.

In terms of your broader question, it is -- we invest all of our capital on a return. Everyone -- each
one stands on its own from a return standpoint. We've been getting good returns. As we show in our
performance update there, very attractive returns on the capital that we've deployed.

In terms of the overall puts and takes, though, there are puts and takes across a diversified asset portfolio
like ours. And those puts and takes and the uncertainty around them in further out-periods are hard
enough to quantify or uncertain enough to quantify -- for me to give you a specific answer to your
question about base business then plus, right?

And so generally, what we do is give you the best view we can of the fundamental drivers underpinning
our business economically and commercially so that our investors can make their own -- come to their
own expectations about that future. But we don't guide beyond the current budget year or updates to the
guidance like we're giving you today. So we try to provide the transparency and -- particularly around the
roll-off issue in particular, but we don't guide beyond the current year.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just to clarify, so the roll-offs will continue for multiple years? Or are we approaching the other bit?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

There is still a couple of years to run, but they're very modest after you get through this year, quite
modest.

Operator

Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse.

Spiro Michael Dounis
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

We'd like to start off with gas macro, if we could. Would appreciate your all -- thoughts on the
environment here and what that could mean for the near and medium term. Specifically, just curious
how sustainable you think this price environment is. I'm sure you're all talking to your producers. And so
curious what they're saying about their plans and activity for growth on the gas-directed side of things.
And is there something incremental you could be doing here on the LNG side as well to capture even more
of that market and more of that growth?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Sure. I mean, overall, on gas, the macro look on gas is we remain, as others do, bullish on U.S. natural
gas. And I think we see between now and 20 years from now, updated third-party analysis, see growth
in that market of about 23 Bcf or almost 24%, a pretty nice long runway. And a lot of that is driven by
exports. There's some industrial in there as well, but exports are a part of that picture.

And for our business, we've tried to distinguish ourselves with our customers as a storage provider and
a transport provider and a good operating partner to be able to capture as much of that business as we
can. We have a very good share of that business moving through our pipes today, and we look to expand
it. And the map of where those facilities are coming in is lined up very nicely with our natural gas pipeline
footprint.

And just to put a little more context on it. As we look at -- and this is a different time frame now, 2020 to
2030, the growth that we see in natural gas happening over that 10-year period, 80% of that is Texas and
Louisiana, and a lot of that is the export market. And our assets are very well positioned for that. In terms

of the current natural gas pricing and the sustainability of it and how our producers are responding to that,
I'll ask Tom to comment about.

Thomas A. Martin
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes. I mean, it's hard to predict the future. But I mean, I do think that given that demand growth seems
pretty clear that we're certainly going to have a tight market, at least for the intermediate term. What
we're seeing and hearing on the producer side is a measured response. I mean, definitely, we're seeing
an increase in activity. The rig growth has been certainly visible. But I think there's also a strong financial
discipline that we're seeing in the producer community that's, I think, going to make the supply-side
response a bit more delayed relative to what we're seeing on the demand side.

So I do anticipate a fairly tight supply-demand balance here for the next couple of years at least. And I
think that means a higher-price environment.

Spiro Michael Dounis
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could just go back to Kinetrex quickly. It sounds like the path forward,
or at least the base case, is it's organic growth and not necessarily M&A, although I'm sure that remains
an opportunity for you. And so as we're thinking about the returns on organic growth, I think the press
release cited a less than 6x fully capitalized return on this project plus the M&A. And so I think a lot of us
took that to mean that organically, you can do even better than that. And so are we reading through it the
right way? Are these 3- to 4x-return-type projects, at some point, do those get competed away? I'm just
curious how you're thinking about that component.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. I don't want to get into specific returns. It is at least a potentially competitive environment out there.
But the returns that we're seeing are attractive for how we look at other deployments of capital in the
expansion context, and we make appropriate adjustment to those return hurdles based on the level of
exposure to things like RINs, okay? So we need to do better where there's more RINs exposure. And
if we got secured firm long-term fixed prices, we can look at that a bit differently. But they are good
compensatory returns, and we are happy to invest in these opportunities.

Next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.

Keith T. Stanley
Wolfe Research, LLC

Sorry to beat a dead horse on Kinetrex. Are there any -- I just want to confirm, are there any fixed-price
contracts in place today for the RNG sales? And then I guess bigger picture, can you talk a little more
about the revenue streams for the business? You mentioned the RINs. Can you benefit from the low-
carbon fuel standard? Just other attributes in trying to better understand the business. And then last part
to that is just I'm assuming most of the EBITDA from this business that you're buying is from RNG sales,
and the existing LNG business is pretty small. Is that fair?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

I'm going to ask Anthony to answer.

Anthony B. Ashley
VP & Treasurer of Kinder Morgan GP Inc

Yes. On the last part of that, I think currently, right now, about 60% is on the RNG side of the business
and the remaining piece on LNG. Once the 3 development plans are in service, it's closer to 90% RNG at

that point in time. LNG is not decreasing over that point in time. It's just obviously the RNG component is
increasing.

And then sorry, remind me, Keith, on your...

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Growth of fuel.

Anthony B. Ashley
VP & Treasurer of Kinder Morgan GP Inc

Yes. So in order to capitalize on LCFS, you need to establish a pathway. We haven't established a pathway
for these specific facilities. They are under contract locally with a transportation provider and generating
the RINs. You would have to sell that environmental attribute into California, establish the pathway. And
quite frankly, the California market is really dominated from an RNG standpoint by really the dairy side of
the industry because the carbon intensity scores are much lower. And so there's a much greater benefit for
the RNG, for LCFS as a result of that. So I would think of it as terms of landfill is the market for it is really
is outside of the California market.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

And then fixed price, you're variable today.

Anthony B. Ashley
VP & Treasurer of Kinder Morgan GP Inc

Yes. So there's a certain part of the LNG offtake, which is take-or-pay currently. The RNG that's going to
be sold into the CNG market with the 3 development plans is effectively at an index price.

Keith T. Stanley
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. That was very good color. Second question, I know the first was long-winded there, so you
positioned it pretty well that Stagecoach adds to the core gas pipeline business and Kinetrex gives you this
platform for growth in a new and exciting area. Strategically, I mean, would you be open to maybe looking
to selling down some of, call it, your less core businesses, whether that's refined products pipelines and
terminals, crude or other areas with less scale as sort of a source of funds to continue this strategy, where
you're putting money into the core gas business and into some of the energy ventures?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

We like the portfolio of assets that we have today. Having said that, I mean, we say what we always say,
"Everything is for sale at the right valuation." If someone can make more of a particular investment that
we have than we can, then we'll consider that. If -- we did a bit of a sell-down on NGPL. We continue to
operate it and continue to like our position in that asset, but we got good value there. And so we do look
at those things.

But I think we've done a good job, particularly in John Schlosser, the Terminals business, kind of pruning
assets to stay focused on the things that we really do well over the years, our kind of our hub positions
and the like. And so there's not a have to sell on anything, and we like the portfolio that we have today.
But at the right price, we would transact.

I think it may have been pre-pandemic when you last discussed possible incremental investment in
SACROC expansion that might be more chunky type of CapEx. Is the municipal approvals you noted sort
of a precursor to that type of expansion that you had discussed back then? Or can you sort of remind us
the potential size and scope of this project?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. So what we did that was talked about in the release today is we aggregated some rights to do further
development. We did it in a place that is geographically adjacent to the SACROC unit, and we got approval
to incorporate it into the unit. And there's advantage to that in that we think we have good insight into the
geology by buying up the rights we entered in a fairly cost-effective way.

And we have good facilities at SACROC that let us do economic expansions there. So it's a nice opportunity
for us, and we continue to look at that as well as additional incremental investments within the unit --
within the existing unit along the way.

Jesse, anything you want to add?

Jesse Arenivas
VP, President of CO2 & President of Energy Transition Ventures

No.

Steven J. Kean

Okay.

Tristan James Richardson
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And in an earlier question, you talked about the gas macro, but curious maybe on the midstream side. I
mean, obviously, Kim noted that the Eagle Ford remains competitive, but clearly seeing improved activity
at Hiland. Does the view on midstream accelerate into the second half based on what you're hearing from
customers?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

You kind of need to look asset by asset. I mean you're right. We've got some good performance happening
on Hiland. We're expecting to see some incremental performance based on the gas price dynamics that
Tom mentioned in the Haynesville as well. That's come slower than what we expected, but I think it's
coming.

And then just overall, on the broader picture, natural gas, midstream infrastructure, our pipeline network
and our storage network continues to attract good value. Coming out of the winter storm, for example,
not just in Texas, but really along our system, we've successfully transacted for incremental and also
attractive, that is increasing renewal rates, particularly on our storage assets, especially in Texas, but also
elsewhere on our system. It was a bit of a, I think, a wake-up call to the market generally that there is
real value in having that delivery flexibility and real value in holding firm transport capacity. So I think just
overall, we are seeing uplift, if you will, in that area.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 21, 2021

I guess I will ask one on CCUS since no one has yet. The way I understand it, the most near-term
opportunity is taking CO2 from Permian processing plants and putting it into your existing CO2
infrastructure for EOR. Can you give some sense of just the timing of this potential opportunity? Basically,
how long does it take to install the equipment and physically connect one of these plants? And what is the
sense of urgency that you're hearing on this from processors?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start, and then I'll ask Jesse to comment more specifically on the deal front. You made the right
point in your opening on the question, which is that the near-term opportunity really is along existing
infrastructure and primarily processing and also ethanol plants because the CO2 stream is pure -- or fairly
pure there. And so it still needs to be compressed and get it into the pipe, et cetera.

The other thing about it is the pipe itself, right? The CO2 moves most efficiently in a liquid state, which
means high pressure. So that's 1,800 to 2,200 psi. And what that means is you're not going to repurpose
a lot of gas pipe or oil pipe for that, for example, when you tend to operate in, call it, 600 psi to maybe
1,450 on the newer gas pipes. And so that has been a barrier, right? If you've got to build new heavy-wall
pipe in order to get it to a place where you can sequester it, that's a barrier. EOR is a valuable application
of that CO2. And so that does make that the near-term opportunity.

So having said that, I'll ask Jesse to comment on timing and current deal activity.

Jesse Arenivas
VP, President of CO2 & President of Energy Transition Ventures

So in the Permian, there are several operators that we are in discussions with currently. Timing, you're
probably looking at 12 to 18 months if it goes into EOR. So EOR permits are in place and you can go in,
albeit at a lower credit.

If it's sequestration, you're looking at much longer horizons because you'll need a Class 6 well permit,
which currently, the EPA has authority over. And there's only a couple of these in place throughout the
United States. So that's probably more of a 3- to 5-year time frame. Obtaining one, that's current today.
But in EOR, that could be taken, I would suspect within the next 12 to 18 months.

Jean Ann Salisbury
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Great. And can you comment on the sense of urgency any further or...

Jesse Arenivas
VP, President of CO2 & President of Energy Transition Ventures

Yes. There's a lot of interest. Obviously, the credits were clarified earlier in the year. So the rules of
engagement are there, and the economic decisions are being made. So there is a lot of interest. The --
moving into the FID stage and order and equipment, like I said, it's probably a good year to 18 months
away.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Actually, 2 of them and totally unrelated from each other. First of all, I know you addressed the potential
need for Permian takeaway. But how are you guys thinking about the need for Haynesville incremental
takeaway and whether you think the Haynesville is starting to get tight from basically taking it out of the
basin and either to the Southeast or straight down in the Gulf? That's question one.

Question 2 is a follow-up one. Somebody earlier asked a little bit about the asset mix and asset disposals.
And Steve, I think you made the comment about everything for a price. Well, it's -- where does Elba fit
into that? Because it seems like the infrastructure funds market where others are paying pretty healthy
multiples minority stakes in LNG -- contracted LNG facilities. So just curious, is there anything that would
keep Elba kind of off that table or your stake? Or do you kind of view that as super core to the business?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Well, I'll start with Elba and I'll let Tom comment on Haynesville. So you may recall -- actually, I think,
it predates you covering us, but we did sell down an interest in Elba when we were post contract but
still developing it. And we did that. It was an attractive valuation for us, and it helped share the capital
burden. And so we've kind of done that move, if you will, already.

And in terms of its -- how it fits in the overall portfolio, it is kind of integrated with our broader system.
We have the Elba Express pipeline, which we have opportunities on as well. We have the potential to do
more at Elba in terms of storage and the like. And it's interconnected with our SNG system. And so it fits
nicely within the portfolio of assets we have.

Also, as you know, I mean, it's under a long-term contract with Shell, which is an attractive credit and
sort of risk profile for us, long -- very long-term contract with Shell. And so it fits very well, and we did a
partial sell-down earlier, as I mentioned.

Tom, on the Haynesville takeaway need.

Thomas A. Martin
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes. So I think given the increase in gas prices and the activity that we're seeing in the Haynesville, I think
there's a real possibility that there will be additional Haynesville takeaway necessary. I think -- to my point
that I made earlier, I think producers are really wanting to have sustainable prices at these higher levels
before. And they're, I think, living within their means, managing their balance sheet appropriately. so I
don't think the activity is definitely increasing. But I think if we see sustained gas prices and additional
activity in the Haynesville, there will be 3 to 5 years, probably closer to the 3-year time frame, there may
be a need for additional capacity out of that market.

Rebecca Gill Followill
U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division

Okay. I can already tell. Been in your shoes. And the other side is, it's kind of a variation on what Tristan
asked is -- so CO2, we've got oil prices now back close to $70, which is probably pretty attractive
economics, I assume, for that business. Are you anticipating maybe ramping CapEx back up in that
business? Is there any way to kind of stem some of the more significant declines that we've seen of late as
you backed off on spending?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. So we'll continue to look at that like we always have, Becca, which is we'll look at it on an individual
project basis, and we make our assumptions around crude pipe. It does uncover the potential for more
projects to become economic. And we've got a couple that we're working on right now at both SACROC
and Yates that are incremental. And so we'll continue to look for those.

We've also seen -- it's true. We are experiencing year-over-year declines in that production. But we are
5% above our plan, and that is better performance from some of our SACROC developments as well as a
lesser decline rate than what we expected on some previous developments. And so doing well versus our
plan and continuing to invest opportunistically as we always have.

Rebecca Gill Followill
U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then let me take one more and while he's looking for that number, is just what commodity price
is assumed in guidance now?

David Patrick Michels
VP & CFO

$70 and $350, $70 on crude and $350 on gas for the back half of the year.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

For the balance of the year.

David Patrick Michels
VP & CFO

Okay. And on your questions with regard to the certain items, legal and environmental reserves, that's
exactly what it is, just additional legal and environmental reserves. In the first quarter, it was mostly
some legal reserves with regard to a dispute that we had -- that we have outstanding. We're getting a
little closer to settlement, so we took a reserve there. And we also took some reserve for incremental
environmental impact estimates that -- cost estimates that we have.

In the second quarter, in this current quarter, it was related to a rate case reserve item that we've
adjusted with -- now that we have more information. And these things are hard to call and come up
sporadically. So I don't think that these are -- this is something that you'd anticipate recurring on a
regular basis, but they come up sporadically.

Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just have one question. Historically, you guys have included debt repayments at your equity investment
in your CapEx. And as we look to 2022 and try to think about and calculate free cash flow generation, with
the Ruby pipeline debt coming due in first half of next year, how should we be thinking about that?

David Patrick Michels

Yes. That's right, Christine. We typically do, and we've done that in the years past where we had large
known debt maturities coming due where we knew we were going to be making a contribution for our
share of that maturing debt at unconsolidated JVs.

I think with the ongoing conversations that we're having with our partner at Ruby, I think the
determination of what we're going to put in the budget is to be determined. But if we plan to fund our
share of it, it will be part of the use of cash that we'd expect for next year.

Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Piper Sandler.

Pearce Wheless Hammond
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

You have a great slide in your deck, Slide 24, that details the current estimated U.S. carbon capture cost
with ethanol on the low end and on the high-end natural gas and then a comparison with the 45Q tax
credit. That's a helpful slide. My first question is, are you hearing anything in Washington about maybe
boosting the 45Q above that $50 a ton for non-EOR?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. There is some discussion around that because I think people are excited about incenting that activity,
and I think people believe that part of the solution here on greenhouse gas emissions is going to have to
involve continued use of hydrocarbons and also carbon capture, carbon capture just generally. And so I
think there is interest in doing that and expanding that.

As Jesse pointed out, we just did get the final regs on the 45Q. And so that's out there and available to us
to use today, but I think it will continue to be a part of the conversation. Now predicting where that will
come out, I will not even venture a guess.

Next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.

Michael Jacob Blum
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Wondering just in light of the acquisitions you've made this quarter both on the LNG transition side and
obviously Stagecoach, just how you're thinking about where buybacks kind of fit into the mix in terms of
capital allocation. And clearly, this quarter, it seems like you prioritized acquisition. So I just want to get
your thoughts on all that.

Richard D. Kinder
Executive Chairman of the Board

Well, we've said repeatedly that we think we're good stewards of the cash flow we're producing. And we've
said repeatedly we want to maintain a strong balance sheet. We will look for acquisitions if they meet our
targeted returns. In this case, both of these did and we believe are very strategic to us.

We intend to continue to pay a good dividend or raising the dividend. And then we'll look opportunistically
at the opportunity to repurchase shares. And we're looking at all those in concert. And so it just depends
on what the opportunities are.

Michael Jacob Blum
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then I guess my other question is on Stagecoach. So you made some interesting points
about why you think storage rates are going to increase over time. My question is, what is your ability
going to be to capture that in that asset? What does the contract position look like roughly so that as rates
do go higher, you're able to capture that?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. So there's -- the average contract life on that asset is about 3 years. It's kind of split right now. About
50% of that is with the utilities and end users. The other 50% is predominantly producers but include
some marketing firms as well. And so that's the general contractual time frame.

But look, we can look at doing short-term transactions and other things. A combination of TGP and that
asset unlocks some other potential commercial opportunities, which are incremental to what Stagecoach
could have done on a stand-alone basis. And the rates within -- the rates for Stagecoach services are
market-based rates as well.

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just want to touch on carbon sequestration real quick. If Texas Railroad Commission is successful in, say,
the next year or so getting primacy, just wondering how you think that might impact the time lines of
Classics wells, such as what happened with Wyoming in North Dakota. And just do you think that the
wells -- there's a greater chance that's offshore or onshore just given offshore being more costly but
having benefits, such as the rights with space, pours, what have you? So just wondering your thoughts on
sequestration development.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. So it will shorten up the time frame if the Texas Railroad Commission is in charge of it. And now
there's a process, as you kind of alluded to there. The -- so the Texas legislature in this last session did
what it needed to do to set the railroad commission up to go seek primacy, but then they have to go put
their plan together and put that on file, which could be this fall. And then I don't know how long it will take
the EPA necessarily to act.

But once it acts and the railroad commission has control of it, I think they're going to process them very
quickly. Jesse made the point earlier, the permitting process itself is today, at the EPA is just very slow.
Now I would think that they are going to want to, as a public policy matter, speed it up anyway, right? But
it's 5 or 6 years right now. That doesn't work. And so whether it's the EPA speeding itself up in order to
enable more of this for its own policy objectives or whether it's the railroad commission getting control of
it, it will get sped up.

In terms of onshore versus offshore, we're obviously onshore-focused in the opportunity that we have and
given what our footprint of the existing pipeline network is, which is a very important consideration for the
reasons I said earlier.

But Jesse, do you have any other comments on onshore versus offshore?

Jesse Arenivas
VP, President of CO2 & President of Energy Transition Ventures

Yes. I agree the surface ownership price is important, but we -- there are opportunities onshore as well
where you have common ownership. So looking at both, but more cost-effective to do onshore at this
point.

Jesse Arenivas
