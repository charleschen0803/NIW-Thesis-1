AMGEN INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Presentation

Operator

This is Erica, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter 2021 Financial
Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now
begin.

Arvind Sood
Vice President of Investor Relations

Erica, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our Q2 call.

I think the 3 key themes for this quarter are great execution in a challenging environment, pipeline
advancement and smart and strategic business development. Lots to cover, so let's jump right in.

Slides are up. Quick reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation, and some
of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO,
Bob Bradway. Bob?

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President

Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Through the first 6
months of the year, Amgen has continued to execute well, driving demand for our current products
globally while also paving the way for growth from future products.

Total revenues in the second quarter increased 5% over the prior year and 11% over the prior quarter. We
achieved this growth despite the lingering effects of COVID-19 and increased competition in many of our
therapeutic categories.

We continue to see strong volume-driven growth from Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY and a number
of our oncology biosimilar -- or excuse me, oncology medicines as well, all of which address significant
health challenges.

We also saw strong growth in the quarter from our biosimilars, supporting our commitment to deliver
value to health care systems around the world. We generated volume growth of 22% outside the United
States, and we're particularly encouraged by our progress in the Asia Pacific region where 2 notable
approvals in the second quarter should provide additional growth moving forward.

In China, our partner, BeiGene, secured approval for KYPROLIS, which joins BLINCYTO and XGEVA in our
oncology collaboration there. And in Japan, the approval of Aimovig for migraine marks another important
milestone for us in that market. In the U.S., we're excited by the strong launch of LUMAKRAS, which is
providing hope to lung cancer patients in need of new treatment options. We're very pleased with the
enthusiasm LUMAKRAS has generated in the oncology community.

We're also excited that the FDA granted priority review to tezepelumab, further confirming our belief that
it offers significant advantages over currently available treatment alternatives for people with severe
asthma, a debilitating disease that affects millions worldwide.

We've long sought to complement our internal innovation efforts with the best available external
innovation. And in the first half of this year, we've executed on several compelling business development
transactions, which fits squarely in our stated areas of interest.

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

The acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics and our partnership with Kyowa Kirin, for example, have added
2 potential first-in-class Phase III-ready assets in cancer and inflammation, 2 therapeutic categories where
there remains high unmet need.

The acquisition of Teneobio, which Dave will address in a moment, will significantly strengthen our protein
engineering capabilities across therapeutic areas. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us
to take advantage of additional business development opportunities like these as they arise.

All the work we do is focused on advancing our mission to serve patients and to do so in a way that helps
to address the many challenges facing society. You may have seen our recently announced plans to invest
approximately $1 billion to build 2 new manufacturing facilities, 1 in North Carolina and the other in Ohio,
to meet the demand for our medicines. Both facilities will utilize cutting-edge technologies to be much
more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional plants, supporting our goal of achieving carbon
neutrality by 2027. Both plants will also draw from very diverse talent pools as we, along with a number
of other large companies that are part of the OneTen Coalition, look to collectively hire 1 million black
Americans into well-paying jobs over the next 10 years. You can learn more about our commitment to
good corporate citizenship by reading our ESG report, which can be found in the responsibility section of
amgen.com.

Finally, before I turn things over to Murdo, let me thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued
commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering strong performance across all aspects of
our business.

Murdo, over to you.

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Thank you, Bob. Second quarter product sales increased 3% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8% driven
by double-digit growth across a number of our products, including Prolia, Repatha and our biosimilar
products MVASI and KANJINTI. Our ex-U.S. business grew 18%, with volume growth of 22% year-over-
year.

We continue to see gradual recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Q2 when compared
to Q1 2021. Patient visits and lab test procedure trends continue to improve but remain below pre-
COVID-19 levels. We remain focused on customer execution. Overall, U.S. field activity improved quarter-
over-quarter, reaching 80% of pre-COVID levels. Face-to-face customer interactions are increasing and
accounted for 60% of activity during the second quarter.

Over the course of the pandemic, the cumulative decline in diagnoses has suppressed the volume of new
patients starting treatment, which we expect will continue to impact our business during the second half of
the year.

Now let me review some product details, beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia
increased 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by volume growth. In the second quarter, osteoporosis
diagnosis rates remained at approximately 90% of prepandemic levels. We remain focused on driving
patient growth and are optimistic about Prolia's strength in the second half of the year.

EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year driven by 32% volume growth. In the U.S., sales nearly
doubled year-over-year as we saw an acceleration in demand trends driven by new and continuing
patients. We believe EVENITY's unique bone-building attributes will continue to drive revenue growth.

Moving to Repatha, which has reached more than 1 million patients since launch. Repatha sales increased
43% year-over-year driven by 49% volume growth, and we maintained U.S. and global share leadership
in the PCSK9 class.

In the U.S., total volumes grew 37% year-over-year. And outside the U.S., volumes grew 66% year-over-
year. The volume growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from an
increase in Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and entering the coverage gap. Looking forward,

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

we expect some ongoing reduction in global net selling price on a sequential basis. Overall, we're confident
in our ability to grow Repatha to help more patients at risk of developing a heart attack or stroke.

Now on to Aimovig, which grew 24% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined
16%. Volumes grew 11% but were more than offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to
estimated sales deductions.

In the U.S., Aimovig TRx volume grew 7% year-on-year, and the brand maintained total prescription share
leadership among subcutaneous CGRPs. Looking ahead, we see continued rebate pressure as oral CGRPs
compete for share in the market.

To date, more than 0.5 million patients worldwide have been prescribed Aimovig, and we believe Aimovig
has significant potential to help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine given the clinical data
that will be published soon showing Aimovig superiority versus topiramate.

Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales were $534 million in the quarter, with 5% volume
growth, more than offset by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling
price. In the U.S., Otezla maintained first-line share leadership in psoriasis. New-to-brand prescription
volumes grew 10% year-over-year even as patient visits to dermatologists remained 15% below
prepandemic levels.

The number of new patients who started treatment with Otezla in Q2 was near prepandemic levels, but
those gains were largely offset by a lower percentage of 90-day prescription fills and lower prescription
refill rates for Otezla. We expect that pandemic recovery in the dermatology segment will progress over
the coming quarters.

Looking forward, we're preparing for the anticipated approval of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication
in the U.S. later this year and for the launch of Otezla in China.

Enbrel sales decreased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net selling prices and unfavorable
changes to estimated sales deductions. On a year-over-year basis, volumes declined 1%, supported by
Enbrel's long track record of efficacy and safety.

Turning to biosimilars. Q2 sales were $567 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially
offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe for
AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI. For the remainder of the year, we expect worldwide
biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition.

Longer term, growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products in new markets and
launches of additional biosimilar molecules, such as AMGEVITA in the U.S. and biosimilars for SOLIRIS,
STELARA and EYLEA.

In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting G-CSF, with 52% volume share in the
quarter. Sales declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower net selling price and lower volume. This was
partially offset by a $75 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in reimbursement mix.

Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 35% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. We
expect this trend will continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition.

KYPROLIS sales increased 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by volume growth and net selling price.
Moving forward, we expect growth from KYPROLIS use in combination with CD38 antibodies, including
DARZALEX and SARCLISA.

I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on our recent launch of LUMAKRAS, which is off to a strong
start with unaided brand awareness increasing 20 points since launch. KRAS testing in patients with
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer now stands at 70%, and 46 of the top 50 testing labs now identify
KRAS G12C as actionable in their laboratories. We're very pleased with the positive reaction from the
oncology community, and we'll be working closely with them to ensure access for patients who can benefit
from this breakthrough medicine.

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Overall, I'm pleased with our Q2 execution given the sustained impact of COVID-19 on our business. We
closely monitor the course of the pandemic and its impact on patients and physician behavior during the
second half of the year. We'll maintain our focus on execution to ensure our medicines continue to reach
the patients they can benefit.

And with that, I will turn it over to Dave.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone.

We made several important advances in R&D last quarter, and I will begin with our acquisition of Teneobio,
which will strengthen Amgen's leadership in developing engineered protein-based medicines to treat
patients with serious illnesses. There are 3 important components to the acquisition. First, Teneobio's core
antibody technology will enable the development of multispecific biologics directed against targets and a
wide range of diseases across our key therapeutic areas. Teneobio's antibody platform offers capabilities
complementary to our XenoMouse. It is genetically modified to express human IgG molecules comprising
only a heavy chain. A small single chain antigen binding VH domains from these molecules are soluble and
stable and can be easily strung together like beads on a string to generate multispecific molecules.

In addition, Teneobio also brings a novel lower affinity CD3 engaging technology that complements our
BiTE platform. The availability of a second CD3 engager will allow us to broaden our bispecifics capabilities
and enable customization of the T-cell engaging domain, depending on the disease and target.

Finally, we are acquiring clinical and preclinical oncology programs directed against high-value targets of
interest, which we specifically selected based on our own discovery efforts and target validation. These
include a Phase I bispecific antibody for prostate cancer that complements acapatamab, AMG 160, also
targeting PSMA, and AMG 509 targeting STEAP1, which was recently granted fast-track designation by the
FDA.

Turning to oncology. We continue to advance LUMAKRAS registration around the globe, with regulatory
reviews and progress in multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan. Feedback from the medical
community on the LUMAKRAS launch in the U.S. has been overwhelmingly positive, and I've heard
personally from oncologists who are excited to have LUMAKRAS available and are heavily screening their
patients for KRAS G12C mutations. I'm pleased to report that more than 2,000 patients have received
LUMAKRAS across more than 1,000 sites and 900 investigators or treating physicians, including to our
global early access programs.

In the LUMAKRAS development program, we continue to advance our broad-based combination efforts.
Initial data from our Vectibix combination in colorectal cancer have been accepted for presentation at
ESMO in September and the MEK and oral EGFR combination abstracts will be submitted to a medical
meeting in the fourth quarter.

To expand our LUMAKRAS experience with SHIP2 inhibition, along with our ongoing collaboration with
Revolution Medicines, we have also entered into a collaboration with Novartis for a SHIP2 combination
trial.

Updates from our monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer study, including additional biomarker analyses
as well as data in patients with stable brain metastases, have been accepted for presentation at the World
Congress on Lung Cancer (sic) [ World Conference on Lung Cancer ]. Recall that we are also investigating
LUMAKRAS in patients with active brain metastases. We also plan on initiating a Phase II first-line non-
small cell lung cancer study in patients with PD-L1 negative and/or STK 11 mutant tumors in the third
quarter.

In the bemarituzumab program, we are having good discussions with regulators on the Phase III gastric
cancer development path and plan to initiate a registrational program by year-end. This will include 2
Phase III trials: one investigating utility of bemarituzumab in combination with chemotherapy; and the
other evaluating the addition of bemarituzumab to chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor. We are

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

also planning a potentially pivotal Phase II study with Tarlatamab, AMG 757, our half-life extended BiTE
molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to discussing next steps with
regulators in the coming weeks.

I'm also pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in the castrate-resistant prostate cancer
expansion cohort for acapatamab or AMG 160.

In inflammation, continuing our leadership in dermatology, we are working closely with Kyowa Kirin to
advance AMG 451, also known as KHK4083, a first-in-class OX-40 antibody into Phase III for atopic
dermatitis. We look forward to the presentation of the Phase II atopic dermatitis data at the annual
meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology at the end of September as well as
initiating discussions with regulators on our Phase III development plans in the coming months.

In addition, the FDA accepted the Otezla supplemental filing for mild-to-moderate psoriasis.

Finally, we and our partners, AstraZeneca, were very pleased that the FDA granted tezepelumab priority
review for the treatment of asthma, reflecting significant unmet medical need.

In closing, I would like to thank the entire organization for continuing to advance important medicines for
our patients. Peter?

Peter H. Griffith
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave, and good day, everyone. I will briefly walk through our second quarter financial results
before discussing 2021 guidance.

The second quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 8%, increased
investment in both internal and external innovation and delivered 4% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS
growth.

As stated earlier, Q2 revenues at $6.5 billion increased 5% year-over-year. Other revenues at $412 million
increased 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID-19 antibody therapy to Lilly.
We continue to expect full year 2021 other revenues to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.

Second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% year-over-year as we continue to make
investments to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. We expect full year operating expenses,
including approximately $200 million of operating expenses related to the Rodeo, Five Prime and Teneobio
acquisitions, and also to the Kyowa Kirin collaboration on an absolute basis to increase about 6% to 7%
over last year, while delivering a full year operating margin of roughly 50%.

On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 4.1 percentage points on a
year-over-year basis to 16.9% driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibody shipments to
Lilly as well as profit share and royalties. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent
of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Our cost of sales has increased as products with royalties and product
share -- profit share payments have increased.

As a reminder, a few of our products subject to royalties, our Aimovig and biosimilars, such as MVASI and
KANJINTI. Those subject to profit sharing arrangements are EVENITY and tezepelumab upon approval and
launch.

Non-GAAP R&D spend increased 11% year-over-year due to investments in bema, acquired in Q2 as
part of the Five Prime acquisition, and increased investments in discovery research. For the full year, we
continue to expect non-GAAP R&D spend will increase as we progress our innovative early and late-stage
pipeline programs. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to decline.

Non-GAAP other income and expenses were favorable by $146 million on a year-over-year basis due
primarily to our portion of BeiGene's results, which we record one quarter in arrears. Q1 BeiGene results
reflect the upfront payment BeiGene received in connection with the collaboration agreement. We expect

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

our Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP other income and expense to be more in range with our Q1 and expect full year
net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.

Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. We are excited by our pipeline. This innovation
is augmented and balanced by the business development that we have announced this year. Based
on underlying market dynamics and our investment plans, we are reaffirming our 2020 revenue
guidance range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion and our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $16 to $17,
notwithstanding absorbing the roughly $200 million of operating expenses mentioned above related to
business development activities, including Five Prime, Rodeo, Teneobio and the Kyowa Kirin collaboration.
These ranges reflect uncertainty continuing in the second half of the year related to emerging variants.
Patient visits and lab test procedure trends in the United States continue to improve but still remain below
pre-COVID-19 levels.

Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 13.5% to 14.5%. Our capital expenditure
guidance remains unchanged at $900 million, and our capital expenditures continue to reflect our
investments in our manufacturing and related facilities, including improving their environmental footprints,
investments in digital technologies throughout our business and increasing ESG investments.

We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper range of $3 billion to $5 billion.

This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A.

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President
Okay. Erica, let's open the lines for questions. Maybe you could remind our callers the procedure and our
desire for them to ask one question so that we have the opportunity to get to everybody who has a desire
to ask a question of us. And I feel sure our callers would like to know that it's Arvind's birthday today. So
bear that in mind when you ask questions of us here this afternoon. Okay, Erica, open them up.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen and Company.

Unknown Analyst

This is Gabe on for Yaron, and congratulations on the quarter. My question is focused on the LUMAKRAS
study in first-line lung cancer in patients with low PD-L1 and/or STK11. Could you just kind of talk about
the -- I guess, your benchmarks for historical comparisons in the STK11 and G12C co-mutants and what
you would use as your reference there? And any updates on your discussions with regulators in the past?
You mentioned that there could be a need for head-to-head studies in the future and what those could
look like, what the comparison arms would be.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Thanks, Gabe. Yes. So as we mentioned, as you pointed out, this study in first-line non-small cell
lung cancer will be conducted in patients who are either a PD-L1 negative or STK11 mutant. These are
populations of patients, of course, who -- of patients who don't typically benefit from checkpoint inhibitors
where there's really, we think, a lot of residual unmet medical need. In fact, STK11 mutational status may
help confer resistance to checkpoint inhibition. So that is the population that we're targeting.

Whether this can be potentially registration-enabling or not, I think it's too early to speculate. The FDA has
generally been clear that in first-line lung cancer, they wish to see randomized trials. So one would have to
anticipate having a pretty spectacular efficacy readout to lead to registration based on a single-arm Phase
II trial. Obviously, if we saw compelling data, we would have the appropriate conversations going forward.

Operator

Your next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.

Umer Raffat
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just really wanted to focus on Arvind's age today.

Arvind Sood
Vice President of Investor Relations

You and me both. All right. What can we do for you?

Umer Raffat
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congratulations. My question today was on KRAS and really around whether there's any -- a, if you could
just remind us what the plan for the interim is for the ongoing Phase III study as well as whether there's
any primary analysis limited to PD-L1 negative subset in particular. I'm quite intrigued that the first-line
Phase II trial is limited to PD-L1 negative or STK11.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. In terms of the Phase III trial, I think the best way to think about that, Umer, is that we expect data
in the first half of next year. And given the general rapidity of progression of patients historically in second
and third-line lung cancer to standard therapy, the utility of an interim analysis may not be particularly
useful, meaning the primary analysis often falls very quickly after an interim analysis. So of course, we'll
take a look at that to get a better sense in the second half of the year of the event rates, but I would
really point to the primary analysis in the first half of next year as the major event.

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

And then in first line, as I said, the -- we think that there is significant unmet medical need in the PD-L1
negative, STK11 mutant and/or STK11 mutant population given the relative refractoriness of those tumors
to currently available treatments. And so we're very much looking forward to getting that study launch
shortly and seeing the data readout. We'll provide guidance on time lines as soon as enrollment is really
underway.

Operator

Your next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.

Jay Olson
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Happy birthday, Arvind. I'm curious about the combination data of LUMAKRAS with Vectibix. Will that be
in colorectal cancer only? Or should we expect to see combination data in non-small cell lung cancer? And
related to that, can you comment on the potential for that combination data to drive incremental use of
Vectibix?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Thanks, Jay. Given the regimen that we're studying, you can expect that most of the patients that have
been enrolled on that particular combination of LUMAKRAS and Vectibix will have colorectal cancer given
the backbone of Vectibix here, although the trial is open across malignancies for treating physicians to
enroll patients if they feel that regimen may be appropriate.

In terms of driving the uptake of Vectibix, I don't want to speculate on that. Our job here is really to
generate these combination data and see if we think we can really drive things forward, particularly in
colorectal cancer.

Operator

Your next question is from Salim Syed with Mizuho.

Salim Qader Syed
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And I'll add my happy birthday, Arvind. Me and you, we're both 30. So I just wanted to focus on the
tax petition, if I can. So it seems like this notice of deficiency was not just for 1 year, but it was for 3
years, 2010, 2011 and 2012. So I'm just curious if there's pattern here and how you guys are doing
the accounting and is triggering these notice of deficiencies? And I guess the underlying question here,
should we be expecting a notice of deficiency or ease for 2013 through '20? And then just curious what
the interest rate is that the IRS would impose here.

Peter H. Griffith
Executive VP & CFO

Salim, thank you. It's Peter. And on your question around the IRS matter, the dispute, look, these notices
are related to a transfer pricing dispute with the IRS regarding the allocation of the profits between the
U.S. and the territory of Puerto Rico. So you can see we have a difference of opinion on the value of the
significant risks and the complexity we undertake with activities performed at our Puerto Rico facility. We
strongly believe the IRS' position is without merit, and we have appropriate tax reserves, and this dispute
will take several years to resolve.

I would like to note, Salim, that Puerto Rico is our flagship manufacturing facility, responsible for the
majority of Amgen's global manufacturing. We're proud of our Puerto Rico operations, very proud of them
and our colleagues there. We've had a major manufacturing presence in Puerto Rico for about 30 years.

Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.

Terence C. Flynn
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe another one for Peter. I was just wondering if you can comment on margins longer term. I noticed
you called out that royalty and profit splits are going to be increasing here given some of the newer
products you're launching. But how should we think about that 50% operating margin this year and the
cadence on the forward?

Peter H. Griffith
Executive VP & CFO

Terence, thank you. And as always, we don't give long-term margin guidance. But what I'd -- and I'd
really like to say, our North Star around this, we always pause and think about our objective is to grow our
after-tax cash flows for the enterprise versus targeting specific operating margin or OpEx growth rates.
So we're going to continue to make prudent investments that lead to that objective. So I would just note,
we're continuing to invest in internal and external innovation. You've seen the fruits of that in the second
quarter, the launches of new products, broader digitalization efforts.

Secondly, we highlighted our expectation that R&D expenses are going to grow year-over-year as we
increase our spend on AMG 160 and 757 in dose expansion. We're going to rapidly advance those assets in
prostate and small cell lung cancer. We have 3 biosimilars in Phase III, 3 inflam assets in Phase II.

Third, I'll just note, Terence, that we're absorbing the upfront costs related to the acquisition of Rodeo as
well as the cost of the Five Prime acquisition, our recent collaboration with Kyowa Kirin and our recently
announced acquisition of Teneobio, which we do expect to close in the second half of 2021.

We also plan to rapidly progress these Phase III-ready molecules in development of bema and KHK4083.
We began seeing higher manufacturing costs in Q2. Those were related to the Lilly COVID antibody efforts,
and that adds to the OpEx build for the rest of the year, too. But on a year-over-year basis, remember,
we're comparing a depressed spend in Q2 and Q3 2020 due to COVID. So at the end of the day, there's
any number of financial metrics that we expect to be measured on by our investors and the analysts. And
we take pride in knowing that we want to end up really in the top of the group in terms of our operating
efficiency. So that's very important to us. So you can rest assured that we'll continue to stay focused on
that.

Dave, I was wondering if you could just comment on the IL-2 mutein. I know we're going to see some of

looking at UC. Just maybe broadly on the profile and what you think you need to generate out of Phase IIb

AMGEN INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Yes. Thanks, Matt. And I'm glad you brought up AMG 592, our IL-2 mutein. Just to remind everyone,
this is a molecule designed to enhance the number and function of T regulatory cells, some of the key
modulatory cells in the immune system. In many autoimmune diseases, the T regulatory axis is out of
whack.

As you mentioned, we anticipate sharing Phase Ib data in lupus at a medical meeting towards the end
of the year, and we look forward to being able to share those data with you. In addition, a Phase II trial
in lupus is actively enrolling now. And then finally, as you mentioned, Matt, we are launching a study in
ulcerative colitis, another autoimmune disorder in which there's quite a bit of evidence of dysregulation of
the T reg axis. So I think it's really the Phase II readouts here that will be critical as we accrue those data.
As always, we'll look to make sure that we are adding something to what is standardly available.

In lupus, there remains very large residual unmet medical need. There was an approval within the last
day or 2, of course, but only the second drug in 40 years and a very large patient population there still
requiring active medicines. Ulcerative colitis, particularly for long-term remission, is also an area with
substantial unmet medical need. So it's full speed ahead in the IL-2 mutein program, and we'll look
forward to sharing these data with you.

Your next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.

Geoffrey Christopher Meacham
BofA Securities, Research Division

Happy birthday, Arvind. Commercial question on Otezla for Murdo. So when you look at the growth in the
first half of this year, how much of a factor was COVID versus, say, competition or pricing? And do you
think any of these headwinds could impact the upcoming launch when you look at the mild-to-moderate
disease population?

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Yes. Thanks, Geoff. I would say throughout the course of last year, we saw a slowdown in the number of
bio naive psoriasis patients moving into the market just based on COVID disruption to patient visits. And
given that Otezla is an early option in the treatment of psoriasis, we were impacted by that, I would say,
more than the biologics, which tend to gain growth from Otezla and from each other. So that slowdown
in the new patient diagnosis last year compounds into our growth rate this year. The good news on
quarter is we saw new patient trends tick up. So we did see 10% growth in new patient -- new-to-brand
prescriptions in the quarter. However, this was somewhat offset by an increase in the number of patients
that switched away from Otezla to another treatment. And we think that, that was pent-up treatment
decision-making that didn't happen because patients weren't going to see their dermatologist last year.

There were some price reductions, mostly related to our co-pay programs, but that's usually a good
indication of new patients starting. So overall, I would say it's primarily COVID impact. With respect to
other products coming in, I'm not sure how to answer that. What I can say is we continue to like our share
position. Our share has held in the share of bio naive psoriasis patients, and we continue to feel optimistic
about the growth of Otezla, given the pending indication in mild-to-moderate patients, which should come,
hopefully by the end of this year. Teams continue to execute well. Our field execution, as I mentioned in
my opening remarks, is improving, and we're very focused on making sure we continue to grow Otezla
over the long haul.

Let's start with the immunology theme here. You guys are developing both STELARA and HUMIRA
for 2023, 2024's biosimilars. And given you're going to be in both sides of the innovator of biosimilar
world, I was wondering if you had a thought about kind of like the long-term trajectory of pricing in the
immunology market that is without giving specific numbers? Do you kind of -- should we begin to see
something along the lines of what we see with diabetes with an ongoing gradual price decreases? So like
how do you think about this market longer term?

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President

Great. Murdo, do you want to answer Ronny?

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Sure. Thanks for the question, Ronny. I'm hesitant to go out too far. What we are seeing, of course, in
inflammation right now is a lot of new entrants, a lot of new mechanisms and a lot of competition, which
is increasing the gross to nets that new entrants have to pay to secure access. We're also seeing increased
management by the large national PBMs of national formularies as to which mechanisms get placed in a
preferred status versus being held in reserve after patients fail in earlier lines of therapy. So if we take
rheumatoid arthritis for -- as an example, I do see TNFs continuing to entrench themselves in that first-
line position and novel mechanisms are likely to be in second and perhaps even third line after patients
have failed to have resolution of their RA symptoms or improve their -- the progression of their disease.

In the biosimilar dynamics, I think we're seeing now the increase in interest from both payers and PBMs
and providers given some of the trends that we're seeing with the early biosimilars in the inflammation
category. And I do think that interest in biosimilars will increase, and I think that biosimilar penetration of
parent molecule or originator molecule will accelerate with new entrants. So we're expecting that to be the
condition on the ground by the time we launch AMGEVITA in the U.S.

But overall, I would just come back to the strength that we have as a company given our portfolio of
innovator and originator molecules enhanced with the presence of our biosimilar portfolio. And I think that
affords us an opportunity to serve many patients across a host of autoimmune diseases as well as serve
providers, payers and PBMs with a lot of value to deliver to the health care system.

I'll continue with the biosimilar vein, specifically on denosumab. What are you thinking in terms of the first
biosimilar coming in for denosumab? And then would you expect the erosion trajectory for branded Prolia
and XGEVA to be similar to, for example, Neulasta or to the erosion of the oncology biologics? Or would
you expect it to be more gradual or fast? Just wondering what you think the trajectory will look like.

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Thanks, Geoffrey, for the question. I would say it's, again, hard to project into the future as to how health
care systems, payers and providers will change in their adoption of biosimilars. But I think given that
denosumab is a Part B product, the oncology biosimilar curves would be a close approximation of what
we've [ provided for ].

We had a 2 parter for David. On KRAS, you have upcoming data for MEK plus or minus EGFR. And just
wanted to understand in the context for how to interpret that data, what is good data? And is the goal to
significantly increase response rate in PFS beyond LUMAKRAS alone? Maybe just help us rightsize how to
think about that study.

And you also announced that you expanded a combination with the Novartis SHIP2. Is that just
diversifying and spreading it around? Or how to think about SHIP2 if you have done a second collaboration
there?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me start with the second part first. You're exactly right. That's simply diversifying
our experience. We're moving forward, as I noted, with both Revolution Medicines combination as well as
this new collaboration with Novartis, and we'll look forward to both data sets.

In terms of the MEK or EGFR combinations, as I've said before, in terms of response rate, it's going
to vary by line of therapy and indication in terms of what sort of increments that you want to see. But
generally, 10%, 20%, 30% relative improvement in response rates and progression-free survival certainly
beyond first-line is typically what we would want to see. And those are the rough sort of benchmarks that
we'll use.

Now on these first cohorts, of course, the critical thing upfront is safety and determining appropriate doses
and then moving into expansion cohorts for efficacy. Thanks again.

Your next question is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.

Alethia Rene Young
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Happy birthday to one of the best in the IR games. Cheers to you, Arvind. I wanted to get a little bit
of flavor on the Repatha. And I know you're seeing very nice volume growth, but like continued kind of
pricing pressure or discounting pressure. Do you think we're kind of hitting a stabilization point? I know
you talked about a little bit of sequential acceleration, but just if you can give us some flavor on how to
think about when that might start to rightsize and stabilize and see real growth from the volume that
you're generating?

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Yes. Thanks, Alethia. We're quite happy with the performance of Repatha and its ability now to really treat
a large number of patients. We've reached 1 million patients now with Repatha. So quite a milestone.

The overall dynamic that is dragging price down is really a U.S. Part D patient dynamic as patients enter
into the coverage gap or as we sometimes refer to, the doughnut hole. And as we expand our percentage
or share of business in the Part D or Medicare Part D business and segment of the market, we will see
some net negative price drag quarter-over-quarter. Now it's not going to be as precipitous as the price
changes that we've made historically. So our volume's outpacing that, and we will see that drop to the net
sales line. So overall good evolution.

We're also seeing nice growth on Repatha ex U.S. where price is relatively stable year-on-year. So that
part of the mix is helping bolster price evolution over time as well. But some slight drag will continue. But
again, it's a good sign because it means we're expanding that Medicare pool of patients much more rapidly
than we did historically.

Maybe just would love to get a perspective on which combinations you're most excited about currently
for LUMAKRAS, whether it's more in line with previously with the oral and antibody MEK inhibitors or the
MTOR inhibitor maybe? Or with the Novartis collaboration, does the SHIP2 now take the top seat?

And then just one quick question on the biosimilar pipeline. When do you see is the earliest that you might
be able to launch your similar, EYLEA, it's ABP 938? And congrats on the birthday, Arvind.

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Maybe I'll start with the question on combinations. Of course, the ones we like the best are the
ones that work, and that's what we're testing right now. It would actually -- all of these combinations
have been selected off for one or another reason or both. One, most importantly, biologic plausibility. So
reason to believe in either additive or synergistic effects; and then two, if combining molecules are part
of a background regimen. And so we think we're really covering the waterfront in terms of indications of
interest with relevant combinations here.

And at this point, Kennen, I think it's really an empirical matter of generating the data. And of course, I
will share that as we've outlined.

Your next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays.

Carter Lewis Gould
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I'll pass on my happy birthday wishes to Arvind, too. I wanted to ask on your OX-40 program. I know it's
moving into Phase III next year. Just wanted to see any further color on the population or dosing you're
looking to move forward with in the Phase III? And if the lingering uncertainty over the JAKs is in any way
changed or, I guess, evolved your underlying assumptions around that market would be helpful.

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Thanks, Carter. We're very enthusiastic about this molecule. Atopic dermatitis is a disease,
widespread prevalence, actually global populations. Despite existing therapies, we think there is a very
large amount of residual unmet medical need. Patients often cycle through therapies given the novel
mechanism of action you're targeting the OX-40 pathway, we think there is quite a big opportunity to have
a real impact in this field.

As I mentioned, we'll be presenting the Phase IIb data at the end of September at one of the major
European dermatology meetings. And I think there, you'll get a sense of our thoughts on dosing and what
things may look like going forward. And of course, as we have discussions with regulators, we'll outline
our plans on the Phase III program, which will, in all likelihood, be a suite of studies. Let me ask Murdo to
comment a little further here.

Murdo Gordon
Executive VP of Global Commercial Operations

Yes. And Carter, we obviously pay close attention to the JAK safety concerns as raised on the Xeljanz data
and applied some reduction in JAK penetration assumptions to the AD market when we were evaluating

the attractiveness of the OX-40 asset. And I think that was one of the drivers here. We -- the biologics
still have a large role to play. We think, initially, the OX-40 asset will establish perhaps a second line
opportunity in the market, and we can expand from there. But the portion of the market that we think will
be addressed by JAKs is probably smaller than was once considered.

currently before you move forward?

therapy here. So -- and I think you can see -- you can expect to see data from both of those sometime

And then maybe more specifically, on renal, how are you thinking about your longer-term strategy or
prioritization for investing in the franchise be it through internal or external innovation?

Robert A. Bradway
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. So Ally, I'll just repeat what I've said many times before, which is that our business development
efforts are focused in the areas where we have ongoing strong research presence and/or commercial
presence. So you're right, we've been active in oncology and in the immunology area. We continue to look
for opportunities in both those spaces as well as in general medicine. And to the extent that we see things
that we think we can add value to in nephrology or bone health or in the migraine area, we'll look there as
well. So we have active efforts underway, and we look, again, across the marketplace actively and with a
focus on how we can earn a return from our shareholder -- for our shareholders from the assets that we

Dane Vincent Leone
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And I'll add my congratulations to Arvind. Hope you have a fun birthday tonight after the call, so I'll
keep it brief. My question is on Tarlatamab. Question for me here is what you guys think you need to
see as you're planning for this Phase II study? Obviously, initial data seemed encouraging from the first
52 patients you had earlier this year. But where do you want to think about positioning this drug in the
different lines of small cell lung cancer now? And what have you maybe seen as the dose escalation
studies progressed since maybe we've seen the last data update that has you thinking about a pivotal
study now?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Thanks, Dane. I think to take the last part of your question first, what we've seen are ongoing
response rate consistent with -- response rates consistent with the data that you saw from the later
cohorts that we presented a month or 2 ago. And in addition, we've actually been impressed with duration
of response. Most of these patients are third line plus, which, as you know, is a very aggressive disease
in small cell lung cancer. And durable responses here are vanishingly rare. So that, I think, is, in addition,
what really gives us encouragement here.

As we discuss potential registrational path with the FDA in the coming weeks, I think we'll focus on the
patient population. But I think the initial foray is likely to be those later lines of therapy.

We are moving forward in our development program now and are actively investigating earlier lines of
therapy as well. That is clearly the end game that we're pointing for with Tarlatamab given the sort of
activity that we're seeing in the clinic right now.

Michael Werner Schmidt
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I have one more on LUMAKRAS. And Arvind, congrats from me as well. So I guess should -- hypothetically,
should the efficacy safety profile of the LUMAKRAS PD-1 inhibitor combinations turn out to be insufficient,
which, I guess, could be possible, what are other likely avenues to possibly enable access to a broad first-
line KRAS non-small cell lung cancer indication? Should we think about potential chemo combinations? Or
are there others that are logical come to mind?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. Thanks, Michael. I think you're exactly right. It would be chemotherapy combinations, number one.
And then going into biomarker selected populations, as we've discussed in terms of our planned upcoming
first-line study, which we'll be launching shortly. And so should checkpoint inhibitor combinations not be
feasible, I would expect that we would piece together other routes to first line to find patients who are
most likely to benefit.

Happy birthday, Arvind. Digging a little more on the disclosed notice of deficiency today. I think last year,
you also received an RAR and modified RAR related to 2013 through 2015 and are also under investigation
for 2016 through 2018 by the IRS. It just seems like there's all related to issues around profit allocation
in Puerto Rico. So I was wondering if you could just kind of like walk through the next steps in terms of
the tax court petition? Can the petition to be heard in the tax court fail? And if it does go to court and the
decision goes against you, does that sort of establish precedence for the other years as well? And based
on the IRS calculation methodology for 2010, for 2012, have you run that same calculation to establish
what an upper bound of liability for 2013 through now would be?

Peter H. Griffith
Executive VP & CFO

Brian, thanks for the question. Look, we filed a petition with the U.S. tax court, in this case, could take
several years to resolve. The IRS is also proposing significant adjustments to 2013 to '15 related to the
similar issues, as you know. We disagree -- strongly disagree with the proposed adjustments. We're
pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office on that. The IRS, as you noted, they're
currently auditing years 2016 through '18. And so yes, we're sure they'll take the same position for the
other periods under audit, and we believe that we have adequate reserves for that.

This is Andrew Galler, on for Tim. I just wanted to ask one question on teze. So given your partner,
AstraZeneca, officially discontinued atopic dermatitis last week, can you just have any impact on your
competitive positioning, especially in eosinophilic asthma compared to Dupi given the high coincidence of
these atopic conditions?

David M. Reese
Executive Vice President of Research & Development

Yes. I mean I think the short answer there is no, and we remain extremely bullish about tezepelumab
given its activity across a range of patients with asthma regardless of eosinophil count. As we mentioned,
we were granted priority review by the FDA, clearly an acknowledgement of the potential fit of this
medicine with a large residual unmet medical need. So that doesn't really give us pause at all, Tim.
