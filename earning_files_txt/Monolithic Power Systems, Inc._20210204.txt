Presentation

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Welcome, everyone, to the MPS Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this
webinar is being recorded and will be archived for 1 year on our Investor Relations page at
www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this
webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO.

In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that
involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current
views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release
published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are
identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings,
including our Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020, and Form 10-Q filed on November 6, 2020, both of
which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided
on today's call.

We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income,
interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-
GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a
substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table
that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures
is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q4
2019, Q3 2020 and Q4 2020 earnings releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our
website.

I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be
available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier
today.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Thanks, Gen. For the full year 2020, MPS achieved record revenue, $844.5 million, growing 34.5% from
prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized
by more first-tier companies for our superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer support.
As we see more high-quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to successfully invest in our
infrastructure and capabilities that support that growth. Here are a few highlights which we achieved in
2020.

Brought online a new 12-inch fab 1 year ahead of schedule, allowing for qualified parts to be shipped in
Q4 of this year. We will continue to invest in the capacity and diversity of our supply chain with plans to
bring up a new 8-inch fab in 2021.

Began volume shipments of 48-volt QSMod technology for AI applications, proving the commercial viability
of our leading-edge system solutions in this critically important market.

Designed and integrated power management solution for autonomous driving vehicles. Shipments began
to ramp in Q3 of 2020.

Launched our ESG website, aggregating all of our environmental, social and governance values, policies
and practices into one easily accessed location. Customers, employees, shareholders are now able to fully
appreciate MPS' commitment to sustainability, transparency of our business practices and our ongoing

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

While 2020 was very successful in terms of our financial performance, product development and new
customer acquisition, supply chain capacity constraints [ from that year ] limited our ability to fulfill all of
our customers' demand. This is a result of demand increases during the year and industry-wide capacity
constraints. We can take some solace in having recognized this issue in 2019, which propelled us to bring
up our second 12-inch fab. Maintaining our ability to meet strong demand while delivering high-quality
products to our customers has represented an extraordinary challenge that continues into 2021. Despite
these challenges, we will continue to execute on our strategic plan.

Turning back to full year 2020 revenue by market segment compared with 2019, communications revenue,
up 67.9%; and consumer revenue, up 34.2%; computing and storage, up 33.8%; automotive, up 20.7%;
and industrial, up 20.3%, demonstrating just how broad-based our revenue improvement was.

Communications revenue grew $57.5 million to $142.3 million. This improvement was primarily due to an
infrastructure sales ramp. Communications revenue represented 16.9% of our 2020 revenue compared
with 13.5% in 2019.

Consumer revenue grew $56.2 million to $220.4 million, reversing 2 consecutive years of sales declines.
This growth reflected higher game console sales along with increased sales of wearables and home
appliances. Consumer revenue represented 26.1% of MPS' full year 2020 revenue compared with 26.2%
in 2019.

Full year 2020 computing and storage revenue grew $64.0 million over the prior year to $253.2 million.
This 33.8% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for cloud computing and storage
applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.0% of MPS' total revenue in 2020 compared
with 30.1% in 2019.

Automotive revenue grew $18.7 million to $109.0 million in 2020. This growth primarily represented
increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products. Automotive revenue
represented 12.9% of MPS' full year 2020 revenue compared with 14.4% in 2019.

Industrial revenue grew $20.2 million to $119.6 million in 2020. This growth primarily reflected higher
sales for applications in power sources. Industrial revenue represented 14.2% of MPS' full year 2020
revenue compared to 15.8% in 2019.

Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $233.0 million, 10.2% lower than
revenue generated in the third quarter of 2020 but 39.8% higher than the comparable quarter of 2019. By
market segment, revenue for consumer grew 69.7% year-over-year, automotive grew 63.1%, industrial
grew 38.8%, communications grew 35.6%, and computing and storage grew 11.1%.

Fourth quarter 2020 GAAP gross margin was 55.3%, 20 basis points higher than both third quarter 2020
and the fourth quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $40.0 million compared to $60.0 million
reported in the third quarter of 2020 and $30.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth
quarter 2020 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, 20 basis points higher than both the third quarter of
2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP operating income was $66.3 million compared to
$84.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $50.8 million reported in the fourth quarter 2019.

Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $88.9 million in the fourth
quarter compared with $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $61.2 million in the fourth quarter
of 2019. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2020 operating expenses were $63.6 million, up from the $59.1
million we spent in the third quarter of 2020 and up from the $41.8 million reported in the fourth quarter
of 2019. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2020 litigation expenses were $1.5 million
compared with a $1.8 million expense in Q3 2020 and a $991,000 expense in Q4 2019.

The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are
stock compensation and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter
2020 stock compensation expense, including $686,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $23.0 million
compared with $23.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2020.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $42.9 million or $0.90 per fully
diluted share compared with $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020 and $0.70 per share in the
fourth quarter of 2019. Q4 2020 non-GAAP net income was $62.5 million or $1.31 per fully diluted share
compared with $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2020 and $1.04 per share in the fourth quarter of
2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2020 were 47.6 million.

Now let's look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and investments
totaled $598.0 million compared with $554.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020. For the
quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $79.6 million compared with Q3 2020 operating cash
flow of $77.4 million. Fourth quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $11.5 million.

Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $66.8 million or 26 days of sales outstanding
compared with the $93.5 million or 33 days reported at the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the
$52.7 million or 29 days reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the
fourth quarter of 2020 were $157.1 million, up from $148.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020.

Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice and as you can see from the webinar video, days
of inventory rose to 137 days at the end of Q4 2020 from the 116 days at the end of the third quarter of
2020. Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue.
We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better
economic match. On this basis, again, you can see days of inventory increased to 132 days at the end of
the fourth quarter of 2020 from 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020.

I would like to turn to our Q1 2021 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2021 revenue in the range of $236
million to $248 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%;
non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%; total stock-based compensation expense
of $27.0 million to $29.0 million, including approximately $800,000 that would be charged to cost of
goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $89.0 million and $93.0 million; non-GAAP R&D
and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $62.8 million to $64.8 million. This estimate excludes stock
compensation and litigation expenses; litigation expenses to be in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7
million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.4 million to $1.8 million before foreign exchange
gains or losses; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.3 million to 48.3 million shares. Finally, we are
pleased to announce a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share from $0.50 per share for
shareholders of record as of March 31, 2021.

In conclusion, our performance in 2020 validated our strategy to grow through diversification and
sustainability. We will continue to execute this strategy and invest in our future.
I will now open the phone lines for questions.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Question and Answer

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question is from Matt Ramsay from Cowen.

Matthew D. Ramsay
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

My first question is around the supply that you guys are bringing online. You talked about a couple of
different efforts and -- you have done over the last few quarters to add supply. And I guess, Michael, I
wonder if you might characterize it as -- anyway, one, how much supply can you bring online in, say, the
immediate term versus over the next couple of years to support what revenue levels? And two, do you feel
like there's now a situation where your own supply is expanding to support your share gains where the
rest of the industry might be tightening a bit? And how does that play into your thoughts about revenue
growth? And then I have a follow-up.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we said that in a couple of quarters ago, we're building a capacity to $2 billion capability. And so
that's our long-term strategy. We will do that anyway. Like I mean -- just a reason -- from last year, we're
pulling a little faster. Like we can anticipate this goes up and down, okay, and as we plan for our long-
term futures and -- but in recent years, obviously, with pulling in and increased capacities, okay, as we
started in early last year. And we're a little bit ahead of the game -- ahead of the market demands. And
from looking near future, we'll continue to do so and we're still facing delinquent.

Matthew D. Ramsay
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. No. That makes sense in the long term. I guess for my follow-up question, it's a more near-term-
oriented one. Bernie, if you might give some color as how you're expecting -- I mean the guidance was
well above consensus for the March quarter. Maybe you could talk about it by segment, what you're
expecting the trends to be as you move from December into March.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Sure. I think that we saw in 2020 that revenue in both automotive and industrial were probably most
heavily impacted because of the COVID pandemic. So what we saw in the second half of the year is that
both of those 2 markets showed marked improvement and have significant momentum as we go into
2021. But really, we're broad-based. So a lot of the trends that we saw that we benefited from in 2020
will continue on. Possibly, the only exception is communications, which had a strong 3 quarters that will be
difficult to compare against.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Tore Svanberg from Stifel.

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations on the execution. So far, I think you're the only company that I've seen actually increasing
your inventory days. So congratulations on that, too. Last quarter, you talked about the size of the
delinquencies you had in '19. Could you give us a ballpark for where they stand right now?

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I think we -- last quarter -- we talked about in the last couple of quarters, we have continued facing
delinquencies. And this quarter and the last quarter were relatively similar. And 2 quarters ago, we're
facing quite a bit more.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. And I think that that's a reflection of continued strong demand in the face of industry-wide capacity
constraints. So we've actually had to manage at this level now for about the last 3 to 4 quarters. And
I'm not saying that we're getting good at it, but we certainly believe we have it as well under control as
possible, a good handle on it so that we're escalating shipments only based on the needs of the end user
as opposed to anyone building inventory in either the channel or on customer shelves.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

The reason we can meet most of our customers' demand is due to -- we added capacity at the beginning
of last year. And now we can fulfill most of it.

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Very good. And as my follow-up on capacity, you talked about the second 12-inch, also new 8-inch. I
know you typically don't name your foundries on these calls, but could you at least talk about sort of the
geographical aspect to where your foundry partners are at this point?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Now we try to diversify outside of China, as we're speaking. In these fabs, okay, what could be -- we're
still exploring and at the beginning of engagement with both fab -- with the fab within China and outside
of China.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Guys, can you hear me?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, loud and clear.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So congratulations on the growth, especially impressive, not only relative to the analog group but the
diversity of it. As you look at 2020 as a whole, other than the year-over-year in comps, which I know
is difficult, you talked a little bit about you expect it to be diverse. But if you just said what some of the
idiosyncratic drivers, company-specific things in 2020 would be just kind of by end market, obviously not
customer-specific.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Sure. I think that in the computing, we had seen in 2018 and 2019 a run-up in notebooks. And really in
2020, it was increased demand in the data center both in terms of powering servers as well as storage. In
the consumer market, we benefited from the "once every 3 year" refresh of the gaming console. And also,
we saw a nice uptick both in home appliances as well as wearables or mobility. And then when we look at
industrial and automotive, as I said earlier, both of those seem to be handicapped at the beginning of the
year, where we have design wins but we can't guarantee what the market circumstance is going to be. So
the unit sales on some of the new products we're introducing were a little limited but certainly showed a
lot of strength in the second half of the year.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And actually, Bernie, forgive me if I misspoke. I was actually talking more about 2021, what those --
similar sort of story but '21, more looking forward than back?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I think it's a repeat of same between '20 to '21.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

I'd say the only thing in the first half that gives us a little pause aside from the communications
comparable is that there's probably going to be some softness in the first half of the year related to
computing on the -- at the data center. But outside of that, Michael is exactly right.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Well, maybe that's a good...

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

The softness, it's not going down and I'd say -- but still going not as strong, okay? But the demand is still
slightly more than we expected, yes?

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it. And then I guess as my real follow-up. A lot of companies are questioning the sustainability of this
demand. And I know crystal balls are always foggy. But you guys would grow, if I just annualize your first
quarter guidance, 15%. I know seasonality might not be the best framework, but there seems to be an
active debate amongst investors on is -- are things just too hot and there's got to be a stumble because
there's excess ordering, inventory is going to build, et cetera, et cetera. How are you guys viewing that
kind of supply versus demand balance and the trust in the quality of the orders?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, if you look at it in the past 3 or 4 years, okay, I mean we grow something like in -- from 17%
to 25% in the levels. And 2019, right, we grow only 8%, like I mean -- and -- but our design in all
these opportunities is still there. Like I mean -- and we just shifted to -- from '19 to '20. And so again,
automotive, industrial in the first half of the year wasn't there, but the catch-up in the second half of the
year. And in the computing communications -- and what else am I missing?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Consumer.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Consumers, okay, in the beginning, okay, is stronger than -- a little bit stronger than normal. And
I would say that it's probably even out from 2019. And this year, we can see that we never forecast a
macroeconomic condition but we do see the product. And we're facing shortages on Amazons, on these
Best Buys and we believe -- and these all are real.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer.

Richard Ewing Schafer
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Let me add my congratulations on the execution, guys. I'm sure it wasn't easy out there this quarter
especially. A couple of questions. Just -- I guess I'd like to ask about a couple of your growth pillars,
maybe start with auto. I think it grew about 50% last year, with SAAR down about 15%. So just optically,
it looks like you guys could do something around 50% growth this year. I mean maybe you could talk
about what leads that growth? I mean is it ADAS, body control? Do you -- does BMS kick in at all and kind
of add -- give a little more wind to the sales this year?

And I guess second part of that question, I'm just curious -- are you worried at all about indirect supply
constraints potentially limiting your upside here?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

All right. Let me talk about your second part first. And again -- and growth overall for MPS is limited by
our capacities and utilization of total capacity. As you know, we have a few thousand, 4,000 parts. And it's
inconceivable we can utilize entire capacities.

For the auto growth, yes, okay, we -- as Bernie said earlier, we have ADAS and start to ramp, like I mean
in the last quarter or so. And we have more customer start to ramp that can -- these are the very high-
end product, and we are very pleased with other products in autos and like I mean -- and we talk about it
in the past, like from lighting to liftgates to -- what are these...

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Pulse...

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. All the other pulse power modules and then we end up in auto. And now -- and we see start to
ramp. We -- just at the beginning, we see all these products start to ramp and -- but these are still at the
beginning.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

And Rick, just one more point is that I think we've read that the auto industry is suffering from its own
capacity issues or being able to have a stable supply chain. As I look at our Q1 numbers, that is not
directly impacting our demand or our ability to ship.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We are so small in a market presence in auto industry, but all these initial ramp and -- it changes the
needles in a revenue stream.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Richard Ewing Schafer
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And that's kind of what I was asking about. I'm just worried if those secondary supply constraints
could end up hurt if somebody else can't ship.

Maybe my second question, Michael, just on cloud server, if you could talk about how that data center
ramp looks like for QSMod this year. I mean is Ice Lake still a needle mover? Or is it really more Sapphire
Rapids later this year where you kind of maybe potentially see a step function in revenues as that starts to
pick up?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I can't relate those acronyms. These are names with that. I know the 13.5. Like I mean...

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

VR14.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. VR13.5 in the start -- is mostly -- is ramping now, okay, as we see the revenue growth. The VR14s, I
think that, that will be a next year story.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Alex Vecchi from William Blair.

Alessandra Maria Elena Vecchi
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Congratulations on the impressive quarter from me as well. Maybe, Bernie, just on a more housekeeping
question. Your guidance for gross margin at the midpoint is looking flat quarter-over-quarter. Is that due
to end market mix? Or are you seeing any increasing manufacturing costs weighing on margins? And then
how should we think about sort of that resumption back to the 10 to 20 basis points going forward?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Okay. We -- obviously, now you see the consumer segment growth, too, and we have some -- which
-- and slightly or even with the lower gross margin. On the other hand, yes, the manufacturing cost is
going up.

Alessandra Maria Elena Vecchi
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just on your inventory days, you guys have talked in the past about the
180, 200 a day target. You've made some improvements this quarter. How do we think about getting back
to an ideal inventory level in terms of timing?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, it's -- the demand keep coming as is now, like -- it would be difficult, okay? I mean we think it's
about the end of the year we hope we can go back to 180 to 200 days of inventory.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Yes. I think if you look at whether it's the inventory that we hold on our books or particularly in the
channel, it's very lean right now. And then we've already discussed delinquencies. So we have a lot of
catch-up to do before we really can get the model to the 180- to 200-day goal.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham.

Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I offer my congratulations as well. Just wanted to follow up on Alex' question on the delinquencies and
your ability to catch up with some of those delinquencies. I mean how much of the ability to meet those
delinquencies is going to come from the new 12-inch fab that you brought online in the fourth quarter of
last year? Are you able to qualify more parts and other high-volume runners on that fab? Or just kind of
curious your ability to actually get -- to secure more wafer capacity from your 5 foundry partners in this
very tight environment. I guess a lot of companies are saying that they think supply constraints -- supply
is going to remain constrained all year, which makes it sound like being able to get back to 180 to 200
days delinquencies is a pretty tall order in calendar '21.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. It's a great question, and thanks for allowing us the opportunity to give a little more context here.
With the new fab, I mean we were very pleased to report as one of our highlights that we were able to
qualify parts and be able to inventory and ship them but that process of qualifying more parts so that it
can be meaningful as far as both deliveries and addressing our delinquencies is ongoing, and it's going to
require an investment both in the 12-inch capability as well as this new fab that we're bringing up in 2021.
So just because we've qualified a few parts and we've got the process started, it still takes about 9 to 12
months before you have the full capability up.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We -- in 2020, we increased our capacity by 25 -- it's [ probably about far more ] here. My rough
calculation is about 20% to 25% increase last year.

Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

And I guess my follow-up question was just on the comm space. Obviously, you had 3 very strong
quarters in 2020. And then one of your large customers was -- you were no longer able to ship. I believe
you may now have a license to resume shipments to that customer. And I'm just wondering if that's the
case, do you have now perhaps a better outlook than you might have 90 days ago for the comms business
in 2021?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Absolutely. We have a more clear -- and customer start to place -- are placing orders now.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. And I think there's 2 forms. There's -- you identified one customer in particular. And I think we
might see that begin to ramp in the second half of this year. But I think more broadly, other opportunities
are starting to come on not just with the top tier but some of the second-tier customers in the 5G and
infrastructure area.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from William Stein from Truist.

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Michael, I'm wondering if you can update us on the longer-term transition to selling more modules. I know
that's something that is, from a long-term perspective, potentially very accretive to growth and margin. I
think we're still pretty early in that process. But any movement in the quarter that you'd like to highlight?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I think that the results are very good in the middle of this high demand. And actually, Bernie can tell you
what is the ramps. Like what is the increase? I mean and...

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. We had revenue doubled in 2020. And we exited the year where it continued to increase sequentially
each quarter. And it's interesting because we thought that it would have more narrow applications
particularly in industrial, but in fact, it's proven to be very broad-based and also is sustainable. What I
mean by that last point is that we thought that if people want unit volumes, they might be more likely to
go to components and just buy silicon. And in fact, we're seeing a lot of people that are going into volume
shipments with the modules as well.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. It's all across our product line. So that's why I don't have total numbers for the modules that are --
roughly, it's like $30 million, $40 million now. So like I mean compared a year ago and like -- as Bernie
said, it's half of that.

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then one other thing I'd like to ask about is your MPS NOW service. Did you see any change in
that in the quarter? I know that's something that seemed to come online sort of just in time for the work-
from-home, COVID situation that I think was very helpful for you. Any change in that? And any anticipated
change if we hopefully are able to return to offices in the next quarter or 2?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Okay. This is -- it's a great help. Again, we set it up, okay, just at the beginning -- just right before
pandemic. Like I mean all these softwares, videos, everything with -- and also the banks, okay, the
working banks, we just set it up. We turned along when the pandemic happened and it received enormous
praise from our customers. And in terms of how many new customers, that's we're really, really careful
about. We increased a few thousand percent from the videos or from the virtual bench.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan from Rosenblatt.

Kevin Garrigan
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one from me. You alluded a little to this earlier, but in your
automotive segment, you've expanded into several other features of the automobile side, kind of
infotainment, right? Can you give us -- or can you talk a little bit about some of your design wins

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

there? Are you kind of seeing more design wins? And the ones you already have, how are kind of those
progressing?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well -- okay. I think it's -- I should answer Rick Schafer's question more precisely. The battery -- BMS is
not -- we don't have a clear design win in the auto side, okay? And -- but to answer your question, there's
a -- we have pretty much across the board and -- from the body controls to ADAS and to lightings and
to LIDARs and also to all the sensors. And we have pretty much across the board. But our content, we
expanded from $150, $140 and essentially doubled it and -- but everything is at the beginning. But MPS
revenue is so small. So we just -- but you see the -- a net change.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. On the dollar content -- I just want to go back to that because it's an important part, is this is not just
unit sales but some of the new applications that we're bringing on. We go from having $10 of available
content to upwards of $40 or $50 for a complete system. So we're getting both the unit as well as the ASP
expansion.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. When I'm talking about revenue small, it's compared to the market opportunity. As we said, we
addressed the $6 billion market segment. And now all MPS' product became -- it's a total -- that's a total
spend. And we only have over $100-some million in revenues.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

$110 million, yes.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, $110 million. And most of the new products and ramping store from last year, second half of the year.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

A couple of quick follow-ups. Just 2 quick ones. First, you mentioned in answering a prior question about
your ability to ship to the formerly banned product -- or banned customer. Is that just in the comm space?
Or is that ban some of why your computing and storage segment also went down sequentially in the
fourth quarter?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

So again, we don't generally talk about individual customers, but since this one has gotten so much
visibility, we actually have 3 primary lines of business with them. One is in the consumer, one is in the
data center and the other is in infrastructure.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Infrastructure meaning comms, right?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got you. Okay. And is there any difference in what you're able to ship going forward out of those 3 things?
Are you able to ship all of them? Or is it just not the 5G stuff but the other 2?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, in our products -- again, the building blocks, it came in -- particularly came in -- these are from a
comm business and also -- what's the...

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Data center?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

The data centers, okay, and the shared same product. And we don't know exactly what they -- how they
divide it. But consumer device, consumer device more in the chargers and in the -- that we know -- so
okay, that is pretty much -- it continues, yes.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got you. And then the last question, a little bit more housekeeping-wise. Bernie, what are you thinking
about tax rate for 2021?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. So on a non-GAAP basis, we've historically used 7.5%, and now we've moved to 10%, which
represents that there is certain stock comp that is not as deductible as it was in prior years. And then
looking ahead, we're not going to try to outguess what the Biden administration is going to do, but I think
that we need to be sensitive of the fact that there may be increases both in the domestic rate as well as a
higher tax rate on any international profit.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We don't know at this point.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

[Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
