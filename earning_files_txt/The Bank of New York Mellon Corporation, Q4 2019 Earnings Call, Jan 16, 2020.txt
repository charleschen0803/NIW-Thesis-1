THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon.
[Operator Instructions]

Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You
may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.

I will now turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon's Global Head of Investor Relations. Please
go ahead.

Magda Palczynska
Global Head of Investor Relations

Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the fourth quarter of 2019. The earnings press
release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website
at bnymellon.com.

Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon's Interim CEO, will lead the call. Then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO, will take
you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session.
[Operator Instructions]

Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual
results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result
of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release,
the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website.
Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 16, 2020, and will not be
updated.

With that, I will hand over to Todd.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Thank you, Magda, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly highlight the fourth quarter and the full year
financial results and then focus most of my comments highlighting the progress we made in 2019 as well
as outlining our priorities for 2020. Mike will then go through the financials in much more detail.

For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.52. This includes
a positive impact of $0.50 per share from notable items, which Mike will discuss. For the full year, on an
adjusted basis, EPS of $4.02 on revenues of $15.7 billion. Full year expenses were down slightly as we
identified and implemented efficiencies to more than offset the increase in technology investments. What
that means is we actually delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of real productivity, and we had solid
operating margins of approximately 32%.

We generated over $5 billion of capital in 2019, returning more than 100% of earnings to shareholders
through dividends and buybacks, while, at the same time, maintaining a strong capital position, investing
for growth and achieving a solid return on tangible common equity of greater than 20%.

This year was not without its challenges, however, and notably, those included interest rate cuts in the
U.S. and while some equity markets hit new highs, client activity levels were constrained in many of our
business.

Despite this, fees in Investment Services were resilient and we saw some modest organic revenue growth.
We also delivered strong operating margins and capital returns for our shareholders. We built a solid
foundation in 2019, including substantial investment in technology and talent, while operations executed

a significant number of strategic programs in 2019 that will drive efficiency, reduce risk and enhance the
client experience.

Looking at our progress across our business portfolio. Let's start with Asset Servicing. We're taking action
to ensure we consistently provide excellent service quality. The pipeline is growing, and we announced
important new wins in 2019 across different geographies in both Asset Owner and Asset Manager
segments. We created some exciting partnerships with leading front-office system providers, namely
Aladdin, Bloomberg and, most recently, SimCorp, and these will provide our clients with open architecture
that gives them choice and flexibility. While still early, these partnerships are strengthening our offering
and are helping us win new business.

We enhanced our capabilities in alternatives and ETFs, which have strong growth prospects, and we're
expanding the range of data and analytical applications available to our clients where our strong position
in data management, accounting, performance and distribution analytics position us to deepen our
relationships. We've made good progress in monitoring and measuring client relationships and improving
the quality of work and services we provide day in and day out for our clients. This is already driving
improved client satisfaction and lower attrition rates.

In Pershing, we are seeing fee growth coming through and are excited about the future for this business.
The industry is evolving, and we are confident that our market leadership and strategy will position us well
going forward.

We ended the year with the strongest pipeline in many years with both institutional broker-dealers and in
the RIA space. We continue to onboard these new clients each quarter and to build the future pipeline.

Across the industry, consolidation is helping make Pershing's open architecture increasingly attractive to
our clients. We're accelerating investments in the advisory segment, strengthening market leadership in
the Broker-Dealer segment and continuing the development of front-end technology, including integration
with third-party providers to deliver state-of-the-art experiences and analytics to advisers and their
investors. All of these are making us an even better partner to our clients.

In Clearance and Collateral Management, where we are the clear leader, we delivered strong financial
performance in 2019. We saw organic fee growth over the course of the year driven by existing clients and
new business as well as clients onboarded in 2018 who increased their business with us.

We see continued growth opportunity in this business from structural and regulatory changes, the
provision of services to bilateral repos and from modernizing our platform to give our clients the ability to
seamlessly move their collateral globally.

We're enhancing our platform to allow clients to have access to more real-time data and self-service tools.
We also continue to automate manual processes to reduce risk and improve operational efficiencies, and
we are improving the client experience by introducing new digitally enhanced capabilities.

In Issuer Services, we're building out capabilities, which is broadening our relationships. We gained
market share in Corporate Trust and drove new business across a number of our key products, such as
structured and muni debt as well as insurance-linked securities.

Our ongoing rollout of a new loan servicing platform is enabling us to be more responsive to our clients
and deliver them more functionality. We're investing in automating capabilities and digitizing workflow
tools to offer clients simplified access to services and data to help them minimize risk, increase control and
gain efficiency.

Our Treasury Service business has scale and reputation for excellent service and relationship coverage,
which are the result of the investments we've made in talent and our product offering. With over $2 trillion
of institutional payments per day, we are very meaningful partners to our clients.

In 2019, we successfully refocused on higher-margin businesses such as liquidity and payments. Our
deposit initiative grew high-quality, stable balances by around 18% in 2019.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Our technology investments in Treasury Services have been centered on advancements in real-time
solutions and operational efficiency to increase straight-through processing rates, both of which further
enhance the client experience.

In Asset Management, the financial results were negatively impacted by outflows over the last year.
Performance, however, has been solid across many of the larger strategies, including equities and
multiasset classes. That, combined with the investment in new products across the platform, is helping to
improve the pipeline. We have seen improved performance in Newton, Walter Scott and Alcentra, and we
continue to believe that there is an important role for active strategies, including LDI going forward.

Our Wealth Management business will benefit over the long term from our increased investments as
well as strong leadership. We are expanding our sales force, strengthening our banking and investment
product set and delivering digital tools that benefit both our advisers and clients and create a leading
experience.

So overarching all of our businesses is our consistent investment in technology. Our technology priorities
center on improving quality, developing innovative products and services and enhancing efficiency for our
clients which, in turn, creates cost savings for us as well as for them.

We are transforming our infrastructure and expanding our data and analytics solutions and the use of
APIs to continue to create an open platform. We're deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning
to simplify processes and proactively deliver additional insights to clients, such as improved analytics to
increase distribution of their own products.

We're embracing partnerships. In November, for example, we hosted a well-received inaugural Fintech
Connect conference. We recently announced new collaborations with a number of fintechs to expand our
capabilities, including one this week that will enable us to deliver a new suite of oversight and contingent
net asset value calculation solutions for clients. This is just the beginning.

In operations, we have numerous initiatives in place across the businesses that are already yielding
efficiencies that we are able to reinvest to support new business initiatives and further efficiency and
automation efforts. For example, in corporate action elections, increased automation has significantly
reduced the number of transactions that we process manually while offering our clients best-in-class cutoff
times.

In the payments space, we continue to enhance our straight-through processing rate. We reached a
record 97% in the month of December. That's up from 94% a year ago. And in fund accounting, we've
deployed self-service capabilities for reporting and we've automated over 2,000 client reports; one of the
recently announced partnerships enabling us to launch an AI-based reconciliation and data control solution
into better serving our clients' complex data needs. Other partnerships are helping us do things such as
reimagine the billing process and employ AI to resolve client inquiries faster.

Across the company, we've been disciplined about the investments we're making and are focused on
driving efficiency in our technology spend. As an example, we're simplifying our infrastructure, and we're
reducing the number of applications, which are now down 10% over the past 18 months or so. In the next
12 months, it will be reduced by another 10% plus, so a total reduction of 20% plus in applications over a
2- to 3-year period.

So to summarize 2019, while we have more work to do, we're on the right path. We're beginning to see
the benefits of the investments made over recent years, and we'll continue to invest. And we've made
progress on a host of initiatives while maintaining strong operating margins and capital returns.

As we look to 2020, our priorities are unchanged. They are centered on: one, driving sustainable revenue
growth through a strong performance culture focused on improving service quality as well as fostering
faster innovation; two, improving every aspect that we can within our operations. Maintaining our
investment in technology is key to this. Our overall technology spend for 2020 is expected to exceed
the $3 billion we spent in 2019. Three, we're continuing to drive efficiency throughout the organization
through automation as well as good expense discipline; and four, ensuring we continue to deliver strong
capital returns to shareholders.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

In closing, we are confident in our plans and our ability to execute on them while always looking for
opportunities to improve. We have a great team and a great foundation, and we're excited about the
future prospects for the firm.

With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to review the financial results in more detail.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Let me run through the details of the results for the quarter.
All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.

Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document. In the final quarter of 2019, net earnings of
$1.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.52 in both the current and prior year quarters included a number
of notable items. The notable items in the fourth quarter of 2018 were costs related to severance, the
relocation of our corporate headquarters and litigation expenses, partially offset by some tax adjustments,
reducing our earnings by $0.16 per share. And in the fourth quarter of 2019, we benefited by $0.50 per
share from the gain on the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by severance, net of security
losses and litigation expenses.

Total revenue was $4.8 billion. Fee revenue increased 26%, with nearly all of that from the gain on the
sale of the equity investment. Underlying that, Investment Services fees were up, foreign exchange and
other trading was down, and most other line items were relatively flat. Net interest revenue declined 8%
to $815 million.

Expenses were down slightly, but excluding the notable items were up 2%, with the increase driven by
technology. We generated $1.4 billion in net income applicable to common shareholders or $934 million
excluding the notable items. We continue to have a strong return on tangible common equity and maintain
a solid pretax margin.

In terms of shareholder capital returns, we repurchased approximately 22 million shares for just over $1
billion and paid $286 million in dividends in the fourth quarter. We have reduced the number of shares
outstanding by a little over 6% since the beginning of 2019. For the full year of 2019, we returned $4.4
billion to common shareholders, which is over 100% of earnings, through $3.3 billion of share repurchases
and approximately $1.1 billion in dividends.

Moving now to capital and liquidity on Page 6. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong. All of our key
ratios were strengthened since the third quarter. Common Equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion at the
end of the year, and our CET1 ratio was 11.5% under the advanced approach.

Our average LCR in the fourth quarter was 120%, and our SLR was 6.1%. Including the impact of the
recent change to the rule, our SLR would have been approximately 120 basis points higher.

Turning to Page 7. My comments on the balance sheet will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest
revenue was $815 million, up almost 2% versus the lease-adjusted net interest revenue in the third
quarter.

As we have mentioned previously, we have been focused on growing and optimizing our deposit base for
the last 18 months or so. For example, we've been working with Wealth Management clients to convert
their cash from off-balance-sheet investments to on-balance-sheet deposits. Our sales teams have been
focused on attracting additional client deposits in other businesses, and we've been targeting escrow and
other opportunities while being disciplined about pricing. All of these initiatives and some of the macro
factors contributed to the result. The activity that drove the outperformance versus our expectations came
in the last few weeks of the year and some of it was episodic.

Now as you look at the drivers, both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits increased across
our businesses. Some of the noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits related to some targeted
activity, including episodic corporate actions and other activities, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Margin and nonmargin loans in our securities portfolio balance increased modestly. The loan balances were
driven by increased client demand.

The yield on interest-earning assets continued to decline as expected due to the decline in short-
term rates as the Fed cut rates at the end of the third quarter and again in October. The increase in
intermediate and long-term interest rates was helpful, but the overall yield on the securities portfolio loans
and other interest-earning assets declined as short-term rates had a bigger impact sequentially. We also
made minor adjustments to our securities portfolio that should modestly enhance the yield going forward.
The reduction in asset yields was partially offset by lower deposit rates and other funding costs.

Lastly, at the end of December, we did benefit modestly from higher spreads and activity levels in our
cleared repo business and from the money we deployed in reverse repo at year-end. Although repo rates
over year-end ultimately normalized, we were able to lock in some trades and reverse repos of between
3% and 4%. We don't expect year-end pricing to repeat again in Q1.

All of this activity resulted in our net interest margin remaining flat at 109 basis points versus the
lease-adjusted NIM in the third quarter. As we've said in the past, we're focused on driving higher net
interest revenue, and we will continue to take advantage of low-risk opportunities even if they're not NIM
accretive.

Page 8 gives some more detail about the drivers of the net interest revenue increase versus the third
quarter. You can see how the increased client deposit volumes, higher interest-earning assets and lower
funding costs benefited our net interest revenue. This more than offset the decline in interest-earning
asset yields.

Page 9 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $3 billion were down slightly. The
decrease is mostly due to the impact of expenses associated with the relocation of our headquarters in the
fourth quarter of 2018 and lower litigation. And excluding notable items, expenses were up 2% primarily
reflecting the continued investments in technology.

Turning to Page 10. Total Investment Services revenue was down 2%. Assets under custody and/or
administration increased 12% year-over-year to $37.1 trillion primarily reflecting higher market values
and client inflows. Although the higher market levels were a bigger driver, we did see good organic AUC/A
growth throughout the course of the year.

Within Asset Servicing, revenue was down 3% to $1.4 billion primarily reflecting lower net interest
revenue and volatility impacting foreign exchange revenue, partially offset by the impact of higher equity
markets. Asset Servicing fees in this business were up slightly. Foreign exchange and other trading
revenue was down 7% due to lower foreign exchange volatility and volumes. The pipeline continues to
remain healthy. Dialogue with clients remains active, and we're not seeing an acceleration in pricing
pressure.

In Pershing, total revenue was up 2% to $570 million. Clearing fees were up 6%, reflecting growth in
client assets and accounts for new business onboarded and from existing clients, which was partially offset
by lower net interest revenue.

Issuer Services was down 6% to $415 million on lower Depositary Receipts revenue, which was partially
offset by higher client activity in Corporate Trust. The decline in Depositary Receipts revenue was due to
the timing of fees and cross-border settlement activity as well as lower net interest revenue.

Treasury Services revenue was flat at $329 million as higher client activity and payment fees were offset
by lower net interest revenue. Fees were up 6%. Sequentially, Treasury Services revenue was up 5%,
driven by higher net interest revenue.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 1% to $280 million, reflecting growth in collateral
management and clearance volumes, which were mostly offset by lower net interest revenue. Average tri-
party collateral management balances were up 12%.

Page 11 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our
Investment Services business.

Now turning to Page 12 for Investment Management. Total Investment Management revenue was up 1%.
Asset Management revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $688 million primarily reflecting higher market
values and the impact of hedging activities, partially offset by the cumulative AUM outflows since the
fourth quarter of 2018. Performance fees of $48 million were down from the fourth quarter of 2018, which
was one of our stronger quarters in a while. We had outflows of $13 billion in the quarter, and overall
assets under management of $1.9 trillion were up 11% year-over-year due to higher markets and the
favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by net outflows.

The sequential market impact is negative due to lower U.K. fixed income market values, which more than
offset the impact of the increased equity market values on managed assets.

Wealth Management revenue is down 5% year-over-year to $287 million primarily reflecting lower interest
revenue, partially offset by slightly higher fees that benefited from higher market values, and client assets
grew 11% year-on-year.

Turning to our Other segment on Page 13. Total revenue increased, reflecting the previously referenced
gain on sale of the equity investment, partially offset by the net securities losses that were due to a small
portfolio revaluation.

Now before we open it to questions, I'll spend just a few minutes on how we're thinking about the
first quarter in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, net interest rate in the fourth quarter was better than we
expected, in part due to some episodic balances. So at this point in the quarter, both interest-bearing and
noninterest-bearing deposit volumes are lower than the elevated levels in December. We expect that the
yields on our securities portfolio will continue to grind down with lower reinvestment yields, and therefore,
we expect net interest revenue to be down a little less than 5% sequentially in the first quarter.

We expect that net interest revenue would stabilize later in the year if the forward curves remain stable
and steepen a little, the mix of deposits is going to change significantly and as the impact of lower
rates on the balance sheet become more fully incorporated into the results. And just a reminder that
approximately 30% of the securities portfolio reprices each quarter.

We will continue to actively focus on growing deposits, optimizing the mix between on- and off-balance-
sheet offerings and being disciplined about pricing. The Fed actions to increase excess reserves should
be helpful as they've been historically correlated to the level of our deposits. Just keep in mind that the
relationship may not hold in the short run or in any given quarter.

We would expect that investment in other income would be between $25 million to $35 million per quarter
for the year.

With regard to expenses, Todd spoke about the importance of consistently investing in technology. We
expect that the level of technology investment will be up from 2019. We can calibrate the pace of that
investment if we need to. This will lead our overall expenses for the full year of 2020 to increase by up
to 2% year-on-year excluding the notable items. Included is approximately 50 basis point impact from
accounting related to higher pension expense.

Now keep in mind that the charge we took in the fourth quarter for severance reflects the actions that
will take place over the year so we won't see the full run rate impact until 2021. And note that in the
first quarter, staff expenses will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation
expense for the retirement-eligible employees, the impact of which will be similar to last year and will
affect sequential expense growth.

At this point, we currently expect the full year 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 21%.

And lastly, on the regulatory front, we are quickly entering this year's CCAR process and are awaiting
next steps in the capital reform proposals. We continue to be encouraged by the direction of the proposals
being discussed, but we'll all see the final outcome and impact when they are complete.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Just -- maybe just back on the expense real quick. If you -- I didn't see it in the press release, the
bifurcation between severance and litigation in the fourth quarter. And then as we think about the expense
trajectory into 2020 and even '21, can you just talk about the investments in technology and how you
expect that to reduce the structural cost base over the next couple of years?

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

You want to take...

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Brian, it's Mike. So on the first piece, we didn't disclose the exact number and the split between
the 2. I think you can get a pretty good sense of the magnitude of the severance by looking at the staff
expense and the difference versus the third quarter. So that will probably give you a good sense of the
magnitude there. The bigger piece by far was severance in the number.

As you sort of think about overall expenses, as both Todd and I mentioned, we would expect to invest
even more this year than we did in 2019. And really, it's across a range of items, both continuing to build
out our -- the infrastructure that is important for operating our businesses. We're building new capabilities,
and you're seeing some of those get announced and released even over the last couple of weeks. And
then there's a large chunk that's going into sort of the efficiency agenda on the cost side, as you've sort of
suggested there.

And I think working with Lester Owens, our Head of Operations, we've got a very long list of those
programs that we're just clicking down the list and executing. And as you can imagine, the benefits of
those continue to come in the P&L over a period of time. So we'll get some of them in 2020, and we'll get
some of them as we sort of exit '20 into '21.

And I'll just sort of reinforce what Todd said in his remarks. You can see the benefits of those investments
and efficiency agenda coming through the P&L already as we've sort of increased the technology spend
significantly in '19 and overall expenses are down, and that's a result of that focus.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then on clearing, just on the actual clearing service fees of $421 million, just
given the way the markets have moved in DARTS and the online brokerage industry at least have been
pretty strong, if you want to just -- I would have expected that line to be a little bit stronger in the fourth
quarter on a sequential basis, so if there's anything that you can call out what maybe depressed that?

And then maybe longer term, you talked about within Pershing and the RIA strategy. Maybe what are your
expectations of potentially picking up market share given the industry consolidation that's upon us here?

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Look, I'll take some of it. In terms of the -- yes, why don't I take the second piece. In terms of the
industry consolidation and how we kind of look at that, I mean we're a little different because Pershing is

11

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

more B2B and we serve broker-dealers and corporate IRAs. And we've also kind of differentiated ourselves
because we provide a choice, whether that's related to the open investment platform that we've got or the
ability to integrate best-in-class kind of front-office system. So our clients have the choice as far as that
goes, and I think that will, in the long term, be the preference.

Right now, the desire for choice seems to make it more of an opportunity. What I mean by that is just
the consolidation probably, as we look at it, makes it more of an opportunity. There's a lot of interest in
alternative providers, and that just puts us in a better position.

As to the revenue growth, I think we're seeing some pretty decent positives there as we have won some
meaningful new business that we are implementing. Mike, I don't know if you have any...

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I would just -- yes, Brian, on our revenue stream, we're not a commission-based revenue
stream. And so most of the revenue that we see come through the clearing services fee line is not based
on number of transactions that are getting executed. It's actually a very small piece of the puzzle there.
So you won't see the same correlation between transaction activity and our revenue stream as you might
with some of the online brokers.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

But we've got a pretty strong pipeline there. We continue to win new business. We are differentiated on
the institutional side with some of our capabilities. And we're investing on the adviser side, both in the
sales as well as -- the sales team, the branding as well as the technology that we're deploying. So we feel
pretty good about the business.

Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to ask a couple, first on expenses. You guys guided to an expense growth of 2% or less. So
is the expectation that you're going to be able to deliver operating leverage and, therefore, you expect
there to be a revenue growth picture that's going to be at least 2%, maybe a little greater? And can you
help us understand why there's such a big delay on the severance benefit?

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Brennan. I'll take the start of that, and then Mike can provide a little more color. In terms
of the environment, delivering positive operating leverage is really going to be driven by revenue mix as
much as anything right now as we continue to make investments in the technology that we think will have
longer-term benefits to us. So I think it would be -- it's certainly not impossible but challenged in the very
near term. I don't know, Mike if you had...

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look -- and I do think though, Brennan, once you sort of get through the NIR stabilization, we feel
very confident still sort of in sort of the model where a little bit of revenue growth drives a significant
amount of earnings growth. And so we think that's still -- we feel very confident that that still holds. And
once NIR stabilized, which, as I mentioned, we think is -- under the assumptions I sort of gave you, we
think that happens later this year, then you should start to see some of that come back into the picture.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Great. That's fair. And on that point, Mike, there were some encouraging signs here on the noninterest-
bearing deposits. Can you talk a little bit, give us a little more color on trends there in that line this
quarter? And how sustainable should we -- I know you -- I think you said that they're down from
December levels, which is probably pretty seasonally typical, but like with the interest rates coming down
in the market, should -- is that -- are those trends now like more durable, some stability there and maybe
even some growth? And do you have some deposit efforts specifically intended to help support growth in
that line as well?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, I think I'll start on the last piece and sort of try to make sure I hit all your points. But we've
been -- as I said in my script, we've been sort of focused on this for a while now, and that includes going
after opportunities where there's noninterest-bearing deposits. And part of the episodic activity that we
saw in the fourth quarter was very targeted activity that we go after related to escrow, as an example,
where there's some significant sort of transactions there. It's hard to predict when they're going to come
and how they're going to come, but it's not -- but it's an intentional act on our part to go out and target
those opportunities.

As you sort of think about the path forward, I think the macro environment certainly should be helpful,
and we're encouraged by sort of the level of dialogue and the activity we're seeing. And we'll have to let it
play out a little bit longer to sort of call a sustainable trend, I think.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Yes. You guys have picked up on the correlation to the Fed's balance sheet and the impact that it's
likely to have on us. So that could be somewhat of a positive. And then the rest of it is going to be also
rate-driven. So if there's a change in the rate environment, it would -- it could potentially move in that
category as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Todd, at the beginning you highlighted a variety of areas that should be able to deliver growth. I wondered
if you could give us a sense as to what is the most important 1 or 2 areas that you're looking for to deliver
growth this year? And I'm asking the question in part to understand the context for the investment spend
and where it's most critical for you.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Okay. Well, I think the investment spend is kind of coming across the board. So we're spending -- Mike
talked a little bit about just building stronger and stronger infrastructure for resiliency which just provides
an increase in the quality of our services. We are investing in integrating third-party capabilities, which
I think is a bit of a differentiator. We are investing in improving operations, and we're starting to see the
positive feedback from that in the scorecards that our clients keep on us. The most important thing is to
retain business, and by providing great service and covering -- and increasingly better capabilities around
that service, it's difficult for clients to leave.

In terms of initiatives that might drive future revenues, there are really kind of 3 areas -- 3 or 4 areas
where I'm most focused. One is the things that we've talked about in the Clearing and Collateral
Management. So we are building an interoperable tri-party system, which we think will make our clients
much more effective in managing their collateral globally. And as a result, we can pick up some of the
global market share and also provide some of those services to what have traditionally been in the bilat

space. That's a -- that's probably another year or 2 before I think that really -- that kicks in, but we're
starting to see some of the benefits from that now.

One of our other focus areas is around data and analytics. And I think this is going to be an increasingly
competitive advantage for us. As we build -- we currently with the -- under Eagle have approximately $24
trillion of assets under management. Eagle is the digital brand name of our data and analytics capability.
As we've built on that platform what we call a data vault, we think we've got an exciting capability where
we will see growth this year and will provide the ability to do -- for our clients to do deep analysis around
the structured data that's on our platform.

We're investing in our Wealth Management platform. That's more long term as well. And we've already
talked a little bit about the investments that we're making at Pershing. So I'd say those 4 are -- in terms
of business growth are where my key focus is.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, I think I'd echo what Todd said on the bigger priorities. But I think the good part is that each of
the -- we really do feel that each of the businesses still have some opportunity to grow. Some of them
require bigger investment, some of them require smaller investment. And so I think we're focused really
on each of them to make sure we get -- we take advantage of those opportunities.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then Mike, for you specifically, or Todd can chime in too, but on the capital, you highlighted that
the SLR under the new will be up I think to what, 7.3% or 7.2% or something like that. I know I've asked
on this call many times about pref and what your intentions are there. Now that we have the final rule
set in, maybe you could speak to what opportunities you have to become a little bit more capital-efficient
there. And I'm not sure if it has to wait until the CCAR given where the SLR came in.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Look, I think that's a large, Betsy, sort of one piece of the puzzle in terms of the rules that are sort of
being discussed and contemplated. And so I think we really do need to look at all of the rules that are still
a work in process around stress capital buffer and all the related pieces of it before we have a complete
picture on how we're going to optimize the capital stack.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And is it better to…

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

It's too early.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. And is it better to do a call of the pref? Or is it better to utilize the full capital stack you have in
increasing the balance sheet size, for example, for sponsored repo?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Well, for sponsored repo, that doesn't have any impact on the size of our balance sheet. And so to take
advantage of opportunities like that, we don't need to -- we don't need capital to do that.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So if you can build on...

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

So I think -- look, I think we're going to look at all of the options to figure out what our opportunity is
on the revenue side to sort of grow and keep the balance sheet where it is or grow the balance sheet,
and we're going to look at sort of our opportunities given sort of the new capital rules. And I think you'll
hear more from us on that as CCAR and stress capital stuff comes into focus hopefully over the next few
months.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Yes. It's a little bit challenging because we just don't know exactly what the rules are going to be. We do
lots of different things and we obviously follow all the discussions, but at this point, we just don't have
enough precision to say what the actual impact is going to be to us.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. All right. Do you think you're going to get that at CCAR rule set or you have to wait for...

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Who knows? I think that's the honest answer. I think the -- I think we're all going to find out when the
rules come out on CCAR how much of it's clear. And then we'll see as they finalize the notice of rule -- the
NPRs that they've got out there, so.

Thomas P. Gibbons

They've got a lot to get done in a short period of time.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

So just a couple of follow-ups. So one, I guess on expenses. Mike, maybe just to clarify. The base of what
you guys are talking about 2020 expense growth is about $10.8 billion, kind of the core number that you
reported in 2019?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Yes, it's what's in the press release on Page 3.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Yes. And then when you talk about the tech spend, you guys had $3 billion or so in 2019. I just want to
make sure. Is that all running through the income statement? And again, it sounded like that was a 10%

15

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

growth in 2019. How much of a growth rate do you guys expect to see there for 2020? Basically, just kind
of trying to get a flavor for how much you need to range in your -- in savings to keep the overall expenses
below the 2% range.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think most of it's running through the P&L already, Alex, so -- for 2019. So most of it's going
through the P&L. So I think we're not -- I don't think we've given you the exact percentage increase that's
going to go up, but we're continuing to deliver consistent sort of efficiency gains as we go. And as you and
I and others have sort of talked about over time, like we still think there's a long road ahead of efficiencies
that we can generate through these investments we're making. So we feel pretty confident that we're
going to be able to get at those over the next couple of years.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Right. And my second question around the Asset Management business. So when I look at the flow
dynamics, fixed income, LDI was a little light this quarter again, despite what has been a really strong
trend in the industry. And then cash management also I think, had some outflows. Can you provide a little
bit of color kind of what's been driving that? And then the market performance, also a sizably negative
number, which obviously is surprising given what the markets had done. And also maybe kind of help flesh
out what's driven both the flows and the market delta this quarter.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, I think on LDI, it isn't a -- it's not going to be a straight line sort of up as you sort of think
about flows in that business. And there's been lots happening in sort of the U.K. pension market that sort
of made people sort of make sure they were sort of thinking about sort of how to manage their liabilities
in the right way. And we feel really good still about the pipeline and the unfunded commitments that we've
got in that business in the U.K. Plus they've been continuing to invest in bringing their capabilities outside
of that -- of their core market.

So I think we still feel good about the LDI space. We feel good about what they're doing. Performance
has been good. And so we don't really have any concerns in the LDI space really at all. And as you know,
just more broadly, about our Asset Management business, it's largely an institutional set of clients. And so
you're going to have some chunky, chunky flows from time to time for various reasons as you sort of look
at any given quarter. And so there's nothing underneath the fixed income side that I would sort of point to
that is a core issue or a core trend that we're concerned about.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Well then, you also had a question around market. And I think one of the things to keep in mind, we have
a fairly substantial exposure to the U.K., where there were -- I mean the currency impacts and the equity
impacts are a little bit different than they would have been domestically. So that's one thing I would throw
in there. In terms of the cash, I would say that's a little disappointing, and I think we need to work to do a
little better there.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Quick question on the deposit optimization that you talked about. Just trying to get a sense of how far
along you are in that process. It sounds like you did that over the course of 2019. Or is it like there's still a
long runway to deposit optimization from here?

Look, I think Brian, it's a -- we're continuing to optimize. So I think the -- this is a dialogue that is a
very granular conversation with clients, and it's a client-by-client sort of dialogue. And so I think we've
made some progress, but we've got more to go to continue to make sure that we're optimizing sort of the
pricing and footprint we've got there, so...

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then separately, is there any way to kind of give an update on how the Aladdin offering is
moving forward? Still some concern across the industry whether or not proprietary versus third-party
solutions is the way it's moving. Do you have any update there?

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Sure. We've been building on a number of partnerships over the past 6 to 9 months, and I'd say they're
really coming in 2 flavors. The first is where -- one of the ones that you're referring to, is where we've
connected with some of the leading order management systems, Aladdin, Bloomberg and SimCorp. Many
of our mutual clients already have signed up, and many are in the process of signing up. So we've got a
very high success rate where we've got common clients.

The other thing that is doing for us is it's opening doors for other conversations where we see our clients
able to gain efficiencies because of this. So I think it's got -- right now, the benefits that we're seeing is
it's initiating discussions, opening doors and giving us more opportunities to bid on new business. And
secondly, it's strengthening the relationships with the businesses that we've already got. Because it is
integrated, it is single sign-on, the client is able to look down into their custody activity near real time. It's
the -- I think there's the real benefits to our clients that are paying off.

And I mentioned that there were really -- as we think through the partnerships, they're really coming in
2 flavors. The other type is everything that we are doing with fintechs. And so we've announced quite
a few. Just this week, we announced one, where we're working with a fintech to provide independent
alternative NAVs for funds. So this provides both an oversight function as well as -- and it enhances the
control. And in addition, it serves as a contingency if there were a problem in construction of the NAV. So
we've partnered with them. So some of our clients have actually looked to use them, but they found the
implementation would have been too difficult. And so by partnering with them, implementing, we gain
scale from doing that as well as providing it as a service rather than just as a piece of software. So we're
pretty excited. That's already attracted quite a bit of attention this week.

Thomas P. Gibbons

Let me take that piece. It's so difficult, Robert, for us to be able to identify any single particular incident
on a day-to-day basis or even -- but if you just look back at historical trends and you look at the balance
sheet and -- you look at the Fed's balance sheet and you look at our balance sheet related to deposits,
you'll see that there is a correlation. But depicting why that took place, whether it was a money market

determine. We're still out of it. Is there anything to add to that, Mike?

And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan Chase.

Vivek Juneja
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Which businesses need the most tech catch-up? If you can aim at -- talking from a business standpoint.
I know you're spending in a lot of different areas, a lot of businesses, but where do you think you need
to do so more either from a competitive standpoint or a business need? Can you give some sense of --
because you've got obviously a lot of businesses.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Yes. I actually think we are in pretty good shape. What we're trying to do, Vivek, is kind of get ahead of
the game. And if you think about some of the things that we're going to -- I just walked through a whole
list of partnerships and kind of differentiating capabilities and this willingness to integrate with best in
class, we're not always going to be able to deliver the best application. And we want to provide our clients
flexibility. So that holds when we look at Pershing. It holds when we look at Asset Servicing. We've made
some very good investments in our Corporate Trust business, and we're able -- we're starting to gain
back market share. We had lost a little market share over the years. We continue -- I like where we are in
Wealth Management. I think we can continue to do better there. So I think we're -- I think this is a matter
of trying to break out, not cash out.

Vivek Juneja
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Is there room to improve the efficiency of tech spend? What we hear from others is they're trying
to flatten it, shift the mix of what they're spending on. We're hearing that from competitors and peers of
yours. Is there room for you to do that? And if not, when can we start to see that flatten out?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Vivek, it's Mike. I think Todd highlighted a little bit of that in his scripts, where we are as focused
about driving efficiency in our technology spend as we are anywhere else in the company. And we reduced
the number of apps by 10%. There's another 10% coming, so it's over a 20% reduction of our apps.
And as we sort of make these investments in the underlying infrastructure and application, it makes the
next set of investments we want to make that much more efficient, cheaper, faster. And so it's something
you're already seeing in the spend that we're making.

Vivek Juneja
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So do you have a range or something on the operating margin where you think you can get to with all of
this tech spend as we look out a year or 2?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, we haven't given you a view on go-forward operating margins, Vivek. But as I said earlier, I
think as we sort of get through to -- through the short term and medium term on net interest revenue, we

18

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

do feel confident that the model still holds, where we'll be able to deliver for a little bit of revenue growth
a pretty significant amount of earnings growth. And I think that implies expansion in operating margin
at that point. So I think I would just sort of model it that way. I think the guide we gave you a while ago
now, at Investor Day a couple of years ago is probably a good way to think about it still.

Vivek Juneja
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

One last one for you, Mike. Your reverse repo yields fell pretty sharply, the one that -- the way you have it
on the balance sheet, the lowest level we've seen in 5 quarters. How should we think about that? Is that --
that drop?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. The Fed reduced rates and the September -- the peak in reverse repo spread in September didn't
happen again, those 2 drivers.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

I know you like to do the arithmetic there, Vivek. But we look at that -- since it's no way but down, the
size matters, the spread matters and then the overall rate matters. But ultimately, we're generating a
spread that's been no way but down, and that spread has been reasonably consistent. But in the third
quarter, we saw the spike with an unusual activity in the repo market.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

You mentioned retiring apps. You've retired 10%, 10% more to go. What's the total number of apps that
you have? And I don't think this is completely related, but what percent of apps on desktops are web-
based versus having old versions of code support them?

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

I'm going to turn this one over to Mike, Mike. But in terms of the -- we don't disclose the total number of
apps. I don't believe we've disclosed total number of apps that we've got, but we've obviously got a pretty
careful inventory of those apps. And part of what we're doing in our resiliency build-out in infrastructure
investment is also making ourselves more efficient by really the sunsetting of some of those applications.
And so I'm pleased that we're down 10%, probably closer to 12% now, and we've got another 10% or
so that we'd probably take out over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. So I can't really get into the
specifics of where those apps are in terms of web-based.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I'm not -- I think that I'm not sure that's the right way to think about it. Not all modern apps are
web-based apps. But I think you should assume that many of the tools that our folks are using are
continued -- are always getting better and we're always investing in those. And that gets -- we have --
every weekend of the year, there's something that's being rolled out across our product suite to either
internal folks or external folks, and that improves the way they work, so I think that...

Microsoft Office 365. And one of the things that we're also doing is our operations -- we get over 1 million
client e-mail inquiries each year. And we are developing AI around making that much more productive and
responsive in responding to it. So we're continuing to invest a lot in productivity, and the infrastructure
build that we have -- that we're making, I think, will help us do that as well.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then just one follow-up. So just generally speaking, you said you're spending more in technology.
What was that, $3 billion going up to what number? I'm not sure if you said that, if you are willing to do
so. And where -- when do you think that turns? Like if you -- if we think of it going down the J-curve,
when do you come up the other side with these investments? Is that like a year or 3 years or 5 years?

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Let me make one comment and Mike might get you more of the details. As we've really picked up the
tech spend over the past 3 years, I would say the rate has come down slightly, although the total amount
continues to go up because it's now a little bit of a bigger base. But the rate of growth has probably come
down. I don't know, Mike, if you want to simulate the J-curve is, meaning think through how quickly we
amortize infrastructure...

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I mean look, Mike, I think the way we think about the tech spend is it's not a we're shooting to
spend a certain number. What we're doing each year is looking at how much can we actually execute,
what are the business cases, how do we think about like the return we're going to get on them and, most
importantly, like can we successfully sort of execute it and do we have people in place to do it. And I think
that's driving -- and that's going to be the constraint that we've got in most years, is making sure that we
can execute it well.

And I think right now, we feel it's important to continue to make those investments because that's what's
going to differentiate us going forward. And keeping in mind that we've got to deliver bottom line -- on
bottom line as well, and so we're trying to find the balance there to make sure that we're doing the right
thing by all of our stakeholders. And so that's the way we sort of go about how much we're going to spend
in any given year.

Thomas P. Gibbons
Interim CEO & Director

Yes. So the -- so it's a really good plan. So as we look out to next year, I don't want to predict this. If
there's not an ROI on the spend, we'll bring it down. But right now, we believe there is.

Michael P. Santomassimo
