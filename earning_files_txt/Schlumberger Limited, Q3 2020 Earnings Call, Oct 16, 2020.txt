Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, N.D. Maduemezia.
Please go ahead.

Ndubuisi D. Maduemezia
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Third Quarter 2020
Earnings Call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board
meeting held earlier this week.

Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial
Officer. For today's agenda, Olivier will start the call with his perspective on the quarter and our updated
view of the industry macro. After which, Stephane will give more detail on our financial results. Then we
will open for questions.

Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we'll be making today
are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ
materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our
other SEC filings.

Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation
to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release.

With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Thank you, N.D. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for joining us on the call today. In my
opening remarks, I would like to focus my commentary on 3 parts: First, our third quarter operational and
financial performance; next, progress with the implementation of our strategy; and third, our updated
view on the near-term business outlook. After this, Stephane will provide greater details on our financial
results.

In the third quarter, we had an opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have
taken over the last few months and set a marker of outperformance through top line resilience, margin
expansion and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record.

In an ongoing activity trough, our third quarter sequential performance was exceptionally strong. Yet
again, we continued to maintain benchmarks of safety and service quality in our operations. Sequential
margins expansion rebounded by more than 300 basis points for both IBT and EBITDA, and free cash flow
was solidly positive. The strength of our margin expansion and free cash flow performance is even more
impactful in the context of a slight top line decline and exceptional items during the quarter.

I would like to thank the entire Schlumberger team for this remarkable performance and for their
excellence in execution. These results represent a defining step in the reset of our earnings power at the
trough of the cycle and set the stage for our long-term outperformance.

Starting with operations. In the third quarter, we maintained benchmark integrity performance with year-
over-year improvement at 30% in HSE incident frequency and 34% in reliability. Operational integrity
remains an area of strength for Schlumberger and the foundation of our performance strategy. Our
consistent service delivery earned several letters of commendation from our customers and is the basis

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

of multiple new contract awards recorded in the quarter. Financially, we posted higher sequential pretax
operating margins, more than 20% EBITDA growth and positive free cash flow despite the severance
payments and reduced working capital release versus the prior quarter. These results clearly set us on the
path to our intermediate goal of restoring 2019 EBITDA margins before the end of 2021.

Now let me turn to our strategy. First, our restructuring program is progressing well, and we are on track
to realize most of our permanent structural cost savings as we exit this year.

We also began the transition to a leaner, customer-aligned structure comprised of divisions and basins,
designed to support the basin-specific innovation that will solidify Schlumberger's position as the
performance partner of choice.

Next, in North America, we achieved key milestones on our scale-to-fit strategy with 2 transactions
that advance the high-grading of our portfolio while lowering capital intensity and volatility, the Liberty
transaction and the low-flow divestiture. The closing of these transactions will not only enhance our
EBITDA margin at the global level, but will further support lower capital intensity and an accelerated path
to our financial goals for North America.

Looking ahead at the benefits of the strategy execution. We are set to significantly improve the company's
future operating leverage. And as the market activity recovers from the current trough, we have the
potential to restore EBITDA to the 2000 mark -- 2019 mark of $6.6 billion by recovering only half of the
year-on-year revenue decline.

Our performance strategy also focus on horizon of growth which includes digital and production recovery.
The industry is rapidly embracing digital enablement and shifting capital investment towards maximizing
production recovery from existing assets. While these 2 industry shifts converge, in essence, we have
digital intersect with production and recovery, Schlumberger has a unique opportunity to deploy the full
power of our industry digital platform and domain expertise spanning reservoir and production for the
benefit of our customer.

The best example of this was the application of our Agora edge AI and IoT solutions in our APS project in
Ecuador. By connecting field equipment to the cloud and running predictive AI at the edge, we boosted
production 30% on Agora-connected wells while significantly reducing field crew visits to these wells, and
as such, cutting HSE exposure and environmental impacts. This created revenue and margin on an APS
project where we capture the value directly, and is just an example of what is possible at scale when we
use the power of the industry digital platform to blend hardware and software to enable people, wherever
they are located, to make performance impacts with digital.

In addition, we continued to expand the reach of our digital platform, as demonstrated by the IBM-Red
Hat OpenShift agreement, further enabling adoption of our platform around the world, and particularly
with NOCs.

In the quarter, we have also secured notable subsea and artificial lift contracts in the Gulf of Mexico and
in the Middle East which will result in a growth of our installed base and greater exposure to production
recovery CapEx and OpEx, a strong platform for the future.

Finally, we continued to develop our New Energy portfolio. We've progressed in hydrogen technology
venture, Genvia, and the creation of a geothermal project development company which complements our
low-heat geothermal venture, Celsius Energy. These exciting venture represents a mix of new, unique
opportunities for Schlumberger to create a differentiated market position through the energy transition.
In parallel, we continue to develop avenues to contribute to the decarbonization of oil and gas operations,
leveraging our technology, expertise and execution platform to reduce our environmental impact while
helping our customers reach their environmental goals.

Let me take a few moments now to talk about the outlook. In the short to midterm horizon, the market
uncertainties persist as the economic recovery remains fragile. The pace of demand recovery could
possibly slow or pause as a result of a second wave of pandemic outbreaks or heightened pandemic
control measures. Similarly to the third quarter, we also face risk of lingering COVID-19 operational

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

disruption internationally as we enter the winter season. In this context, we will continue to focus on what
we can control and react promptly if necessary.

Now absent of a pause in demand recovery or higher COVID-19 disruption, the fourth quarter activity
will likely extend the trends experienced as we close the third quarter with the continuation of a modest
activity uptake in North America and the stabilization towards a steady activity internationally, albeit with
visible seasonal variations, the combination of which resulting into an about flat outlook overall for the
quarter.

Looking out further, the prevailing uncertainties make it much too early to call. However directionally,
and absent of a slowdown in the pace of economic recovery, we anticipate overall activity to consolidate
gradually during 2021. In line with the most IEA -- most recent IEA projections, we see that the conditions
still exists to rebalance demand and supply with improving demand recovery supported by economic
stimulus measures and continued supply discipline from the major producer, ultimately resulting into a
visible activity rebound.

North America land is expected to continue its subdued recovery in frac and drilling activity towards
production maintenance levels. Internationally, as demand recovers, the pull on short-cycle supply will
result in an activity inflection, this being anticipated by most operators currently evaluating options to
restore activity.

Having shared our view on the outlook, let me now hand over to Stephane, who will talk more about our
financial results. Stephane?

Stephane Biguet
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.16. This represents an increase of
$0.11 sequentially and a decrease of $0.27 when compared to the same quarter of last year.

During the quarter, we recorded $350 million of pretax restructuring charges. These charges primarily
relate to facility exit costs as we continue to rationalize our real estate footprint. As a result of these
charges, our pretax operating income will increase by approximately $15 million per quarter going forward
due to reduced lease and depreciation expenses.

Overall, our third quarter revenue of $5.3 billion decreased 2% sequentially. Pretax segment operating
margins increased 355 basis points to 10.9%. More importantly, company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins
increased 371 basis points to 19.4%. As a reminder, our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin was
20.2%. In other words, we are well on our way to restoring our precrisis EBITDA margins of 2019 despite
the severe revenue reduction we have experienced. This will be achieved through the combination of our
restructuring actions and the high-grading of our portfolio.

As a reminder, our restructuring program will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed costs on an annual
basis. We have achieved more than 80% of these cash savings as of the end of the third quarter. We
expect to complete most of the remaining actions as we exit the fourth quarter.

As it relates to the high-grading of our portfolio, we achieved 2 significant milestones this quarter with
the signing of an agreement to divest our North American low-flow artificial lift business in a cash
transaction, followed by an agreement to contribute our OneStim pressure pumping business to Liberty
Oilfield Services in exchange for a 37% equity interest in Liberty. We received antitrust clearance for both
transactions, and we anticipate each of the closings to occur before the end of the year. It is worth noting
that both transactions will be accretive to our earnings in 2021.

Let me now go through the third quarter results for each segment.

Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1 billion decreased 4% sequentially, while margins
decreased 90 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were primarily due to lower sales of WesternGeco
multiclient seismic licenses in North America offshore.

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Drilling revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 12% sequentially while margins were essentially flat at 9.5%.
The revenue decrease was driven by an activity decline in U.S. land, where the rig count dropped
significantly, combined with COVID disruptions and customer budget adjustments in several international
GeoMarkets. Despite the revenue drop, margins were resilient as a result of cost-reduction measures.

Production revenue of $1.8 billion increased 12% sequentially and margins increased 11 percentage
points to 12.6%. These increases were largely the result of a resumption of activity in our APS projects
in Ecuador, following last quarter's production interruption caused by a major landslide. OneStim also
increased on higher fleet utilization while profitability improved across each of our Completions, Artificial
Lift and Well Services product lines due to cost-reduction measures.

Cameron revenue of $1 billion decreased 5%, while margins decreased by 162 basis points to 6.3% on
lower OneSubsea revenue in Asia and Europe as well as lower Surface System equipment sales in North
America.

Now turning to our liquidity. I was again very pleased with our cash flow generation. During the quarter,
we generated $479 million of cash flow from operations and $226 million of free cash flow despite making
$273 million of severance payments. This performance confirms that our cash flow generation capabilities
remain intact. As a result, we will generate excess cash once our restructuring efforts are complete and
therefore be in a position to deleverage the balance sheet.

We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $3.8 billion. Our net debt at the end of the
quarter was $13.9 billion, an increase of $149 million compared to last quarter, but down almost $0.5
billion when compared to the same time last year. During the quarter, we spent $200 million on CapEx and
invested $28 million in APS project. Our total capital spend for 2020, including APS and multiclient, is still
expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. This represents a 45% decrease as compared to 2019, mostly
coming from lower CapEx in North America and reduced investments in APS projects.

We took further steps to strengthen the balance sheet during the quarter. We issued $500 million of
1.4% notes due 2025. The proceeds will be used to repay 2.2% notes that mature in November. We also
issued $350 million of 2.65% notes due 2030. The proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper
borrowings. Finally, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $10.8 billion.

Before I conclude, and just as a reminder, due to our corporate reorganization, we will report our results
on the basis of the 4 new divisions starting in the fourth quarter. We are working to provide historical
restated financial information based upon the new division structure and expect to publish this in
November.

I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director
Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready to open the call for the questions.

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.

James Carlyle West
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Olivier, first, just a statement from me. I really appreciate you clearly stating the goal of returns above
your cost of capital, or value creation as we see it, because most of the industry has lacked that progress
in the last decade or so. So thank you for stating that as a clear goal of Schlumberger.

The first question I have for you is you've taken several defining steps towards the reinvention of
Schlumberger so far, using this crisis to your somewhat advantage. Could you talk maybe about the steps
taken? And then what we should expect going forward?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Great question, James. So thanks again. Indeed, we are set to continue to execute our strategy for
improving our return above cost of capital. That's the foundation, okay. And we'll do that in several ways,
cash flow, margins and discipline on capital, obviously.

So you have seen that we have not wasted a crisis, as we could say, taking the opportunity to restructure
our organization to reset to the new -- what we expect the new normal. And I think we have done that in
anticipating that the market will be structurally smaller, albeit it will be defined by new attributes. One of
them is the basin attributes, where we believe regionalization will become more critical, hence the creation
of our basin structure to support our clients in their basin to outperform in every basin. And that's the fit-
for-basin strategy that is in light there.

The second, obviously, transition is digital. I think digital is happening everywhere, in the office, in
operation, in all aspect of our workflows. And we believe that this is a transformative step that we are
ready to support.

And last, I will say at very high level, I believe that production recovery will become more critical going
forward as the mature asset will have to be -- the return on mature asset will have to be improved. And at
the same time, energy transition from gas technology up to midstream as well as transition to new energy.

I think this will give us -- the digital, the production recovery, the energy transition, starting with gas, will
give us the element of growth that will then leverage our new operating platform with the division basin as
you have seen restructured to give us the opportunity to much expand our margins and reach and exceed
our return above cost of capital. That's what we are set to achieving, James.

James Carlyle West
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Exactly. Very good, Olivier. And then on the margin expansion comment, you're sticking to the getting
back to '19 EBITDA margins by the end of '21. What needs to happen to drive that? Do we need market
growth? Is it the cost-outs you've already taken? What are the kind of key things we should be looking for
to ensure that, that happens?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

I think there are 3 elements. I think the first and foremost and the one that have the most impact to date
in our quarter results is the restructuring we have done when we adjusted our permanent structure and
variable costs to the new normal and to the new level of activity as we foresee. And I think this has a
significant amplifying impact on our return to margin expansion.

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

So the second factor is a continuation of our strategies in North America that aims at high-grading our
portfolio and taking step to make sure that we retain and continue to invest in a portfolio where we
believe we can differentiate and create return above our threshold.

And third is the leverage of our international footprint. So when you combine the [ commercial ] and
structural adjustments that we have done to lift our -- and reset our earnings power, the action we have
taken to enhance significantly our margins in North America, our play in North America, and international
mix leverage, all of this will combine to elevate and gradually build our EBITDA margin to the 20% of --
EBITDA of 2019. And we don't need much growth to achieve this.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Angeline Sedita.

Angeline Marie Sedita
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Nice quarter. So a little bit to James' question around the 2019 EBITDA margins. And if you -- would you
say, number one, that digital is further accretive to that 20% margin and the return to that 20% margin
that you saw in 2019? And do you think those margins are as normalized for Schlumberger this cycle? Or
could it be better?

And then finally on that is, you said in your remarks, $6.6 billion in EBITDA on half the revenue, that's
certainly above consensus estimates for '21 and '22. Can you give us further color there and a time line?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Okay. A comprehensive question, Angie. Thank you.

So first on digital, is it accretive? Absolutely. It's accretive today, it's accretive tomorrow, I think it will be
accretive in the future, at a step that is certainly pulling our margins up. And I think what we are looking
for to accelerate is our growth CAGR so that it is accretive not in the future at the larger scale. So digital is
and will be accretive on the way forward. Absolutely.

The second question you asked is on the EBITDA of 2019, if I understand correctly, what you asked for,
Angie, to reiterate. So yes, I think we are clear on our ability to deliver this EBITDA margin improvement
to 20%-above in the short term. And the mix is -- the mix we need, as I said and commented with James,
is very clear. It's a combination of international, our restructuring and the international exposure that we
have that are greatly accretive to this.

Finally, you asked a question about when and how we will go beyond this. Our mid-cycle margin ambition
is above that level. We are at a trough, at operating already very close to this 2019. Having operated -- or
reset of our margins, our expectation is continuing to grow and expand, again, building our international
franchise, building and accelerating our digital and being the full proof of this, but also continue to execute
on our capital discipline, capital stewardship that will high-grade our portfolio and will resolve some of the
still outstanding underperforming business units.

So you combine growth internationally, the power of digital and our discipline on capital stewardship and
addressing our underperforming contract, you have the recipe to expand the margin beyond this 20%.
And you can make the math. I think we would expect indeed that with half the revenue coming back from
2019, we will expect to be in a position to reach or exceed this dollar EBITDA contribution.

So I think when is this happening? Sometime in the future. Not 2021, clearly. 2022 will be the beginning
of a cycle of international expansion, that's very likely. And after that, there will be some time, but we
believe this is in sight, and that's what we are working towards.

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Okay. Wonderful. That was a very good answer. So one more on Liberty. Maybe you could talk about
the transaction in a little bit more detail, the magnitude of the accretion opportunity, the access to the
customer and well site without having frac. And the determination of when you'll exit Liberty. Are you a
medium-term owner or a long-term owner of those shares?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

I'll let Stephane answer some, and I will answer on the customer engagement. Please, Stephane, on the
transaction.

Stephane Biguet
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Angie, we are actually progressing quite well on our integration planning. The good news, we
are identifying through this process additional synergies and opportunities for our technology collaboration
that makes this combination even more compelling than we initially contemplated.

So we are quite happy with partnering with Liberty. We believe there's quite a lot of upside potential in
the combined company as the company -- as the synergies are realized and the market starts to recover.
So we will benefit from the North American unconventional recovery as our equity stake will continue to
appreciate. And we will also leverage our technology alliance with Liberty.

So it is premature in that context to talk about monetization, considering where we stand in the cycle, but
will of course remain an option over the longer term. We have not set a time line for this. We have not set
a target price. But it will always remain an option.

In terms of accretion, we've stated it will be accretive from day 1. So going into 2021, it will be positive,
for sure, on our EPS, EBITDA and margins overall.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Yes, I can only reinforce that I think our value proposition, the value proposition of Liberty on the market
with our existing customer, I think, is undoubtful very strong with this platform, as you pure-play -- the
largest pure-play frac company. But we are putting in place the contract and service level agreements
across both companies to cross-license technology and to create pull-through so that we can extend the
Liberty workflow and the value proposition of well site, and we can pull them on some of the contract we
have on well construction, over contract to where we participate across and around the frac operation. So
clearly, for both the -- beneficiary on both.

Operator

Next, we will go to the line of David Anderson with Barclays.

John David Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And so digital, you've talked about digital being a core part of Schlumberger's growth strategy, and
you stated the goal to double the revenue in the medium term. Curious kind of where acquisitions fit in
that part of the goal. I ask because back in the '90s, of course, Petrel And ECLIPSE were crucial to your
success that followed the 2000s and still a big part of your offering. But more recently, you've announced
kind of partnerships and venture-backed companies you're involved in. I'd just like to understand a little
bit more about your digital growth strategy as you build this business out.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Yes. Good question, Dave. Thank you. I think, first and foremost, our strategy will evolve around a digital
platform, establishing a digital platform for industry, both from the -- in the geosound subsurface side,
building on our desktop offering today and building up on our market strength and establishing with what

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

we did OSDU, an open-platform formation with data ecosystem shared with the industry and offering
DELFI as the foundation for this. So we believe that this transition to the cloud will cement our desktop
leadership position we have today and expand and create growth opportunity with new transition similar
to the Chevron, similar to the Suncor, similar to the Woodside transition that we are doing with the DELFI
core expanding into the cloud. So this alone is a growth avenue.

The second one is digital operation, as I will call it. And I think it extends DELFI to the Drilling or to the
Production space. But also we have expanding -- we have been extending and using the concept of digital
platform to also introduce what we call Agora, a gateway and a platform that offers opportunity to plug AI
or edge application on equipment. And I think you have seen 2 examples of which we described into the
press release earlier today. And I think this is another expansion. So that's the second axis of expanding
beyond the core beyond geosounds and expanding to operation.

And the third, I think, is the domain of AI and of offering services for our customer to extract more from
their workflow across, and using an element of our platform, not necessarily the application, but using the
platform as a basis for creating value to their own IP, to their own integration capability, and where we act
as a system integrator and we act as a support for their workflow.

So these are the avenue of growth. So we'll continue to make a partnership as a basis for building these
platform stacks. And we will, and when as appropriate, we believe that we have -- if we believe we have
gaps into our of erring in operation or in geosounds or in AI, we will make bolt-on acquisition, as we'll call
it, to supplement or to complement this so that we better respond to this and expand in new energy or
expand into the gas midstream, for example, using the same platform.

John David Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So Olivier, I think one of the struggles for investors is taking digital from a conceptual idea into real-life
practice. And you mentioned Agora several times in the release today. And I was wondering if you could
talk about 2 things. If you can talk about Agora and the IBM Red Hat agreement, kind of 2 separate things
there.

Agora being more edge computing-driven. Maybe you could just talk about kind of what is the best
application? Where do you see that fitting in terms of your business? Like what's the most obvious
application of where you can really make a difference?

And secondarily, on the IBM Red Hat, you've targeted NOCs as being the customer. So what is that
bringing to the NOC customer?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Okay. So first, Agora. Simply said, Agora brings us the ability to bring, on every piece of equipment on the
platform, on the rig, an ability to connect this piece of equipment to the cloud and to our platform; and
yet offering at this point, at this edge, an open platform where partners can provide and can plug their
application, AI application typically, that will add value to this data feed.

The perfect example is what you have seen on the PETRONAS application, where we have not been
developing this video spacing analysis tool. One of our partners have just deployed their video tool on
to our platform and connected to the camera, and we serve as a gateway back to the cloud. So we just
provide a platform that our customer are licensing and are installing on their equipment. And then their
own partners, our partners, are creating value with AI routines or AI application at the edge that connects
to the cloud. That's what people like in a secure way.

Red Hat OpenShift, simply said, is an ability to provide multiplicity of options for cloud deployment for
our customers that offer hybrid cloud deployments on-premise and public and address the concern that
some of our customers in some country were facing that they cannot export their data to the public cloud

It's about 50% of the market today, 50% of the country that don't have or do not prefer to use public
cloud for their hosting their data that we're unlocking through this. So we are unlocking a significant part

Next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So Olivier, I just wanted to congratulate you and your team on a very fast pivot through an extremely
difficult situation. I know you highlighted digital way back when you first joined in September and then
reiterated it in January, and it sounds like it's already paying dividends for you. So kudos on that quick
pivot.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Thank you.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

My question for you, Olivier, is we've seen a lot of recent commentary out of the major oil companies
about their shift of budget, from intensive fossil fuel dynamics to more green, renewables and so on and
so forth, with BP probably being the most radical in that process. Trying to connect the dots here, but it
seems like with the clean energy business that you established back in the spring, it set Schlumberger
up to be very well positioned in line with the potential future spending plans of some of your existing
customers. So I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more insights on how you view
potentially the clean energy business evolving over time.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

No, great question, Kurt. I think, obviously, we see it's not only a trend that we want to capture with our
existing customers. I think, obviously, some of our customer segments are transitioning into a different
role as a energy company and want to add to that portfolio beyond oil and gas, including some technology
and some renewables in which we also have interest.

And I think at large, what we have realized is that we have a technology platform, we have an ability to
deploy at scale technology, we have a subsurface knowledge. When you combine all of this, we believe
that we have market position that we can take, develop into the new energy business, be it on renewable,
be it on the energy storage or be it on hydrogen. And I think this is where we are developing our venture
today. We are developing it in geothermal, both low heat and deep geothermal. That's very adjacent to
our business because it exploits our subsurface knowledge; our drilling, well construction; and our ability
to manage heat flows from subsurface to surface and provide digital platform to control it. So that's where
we're heading.

The hydrogen is very, very interesting for us because it's a huge opportunity, particularly led by EU with
are Green Deal. And there are 2 avenue there. One avenue is the green hydrogen or electrolyzer, where
we believe we, with our new venture, Genvia, are in a position to create differentiated offering in the
market to provide the market with higher efficiency and more versatile electrolyzer that can feed this 40-
gigawatt capacity that EU is planning for 2030.

And finally, I think we will continue to also look into CCS, which is, again, close to our core. But not CCS
application for oil and gas, but CCS application to decarbonize the hard-to-abate sector, ammonia or

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

SMR for hydrogen production through gas, and these are the sector that are outside of our oil and gas
customer, that's where we believe we can add value.

And when you combine all of this, this is a very exciting future on the -- with new energy, and we are
taking position today for the long run.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's great. I appreciate that insight. My follow-up question would be, Olivier, you mentioned the
prospect for short-cycle projects to accelerate, especially in the international markets when heading out
into 2022. And I know you don't want to get pinned down to any kind of specifics. But I'm just kind of
curious, how you would think about the magnitude of rebound. And again, you don't have to get too
specific here. But just wondering how sharp of a rebound you would expect, and maybe what geographic
regions you would think would lead the way.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Yes. I think what we see is that, clearly, I think the level of investment that's currently going into
international is not sustainable, I think for 2 reason. I think that the demand/supply will rebalance and will
create a pull on supply worldwide. And I think this will be pulling on international as well as the U.S. North
America. The North America have suffered from a setback that is creating a gap in the future supply. So I
think the commission have set -- can you hear me?

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

There's a lot of feedback.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Yes. I think the feedback is gone. Thank you.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's better. That's better.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Okay. So I think short cycle is set to come back first, and then long cycle. The timing of this and the
magnitude, I think, will depend on the -- obviously, on the demand -- oil demand pace, recovery pace. But
what we can say is that customers are already engaging and are asking us to be ready for mobilization, be
it in short or midterm, to make sure that we're not getting in the wrong direction to cut capacity beyond
what they will need in the short to midterm. So I would expect the low-cost producer country on the core
of OPEC+ to be the first to react and to rebound when the market will be there. So that includes Middle
East, that includes Russia, obviously.

Beyond that, I think we are -- we will see short-cycle everywhere. China will continue to be executing on
their energy strategy, so I don't expect this to be slowing down. And then we will see gradually infield
drilling. We will see the shallow water coming back. And there's a lot of FID ready to be approved that will
then accelerate back to the border. So I think there will be a sequence in this, but short-cycle will come
back, both onshore and offshore, and will come back certainly some time in 2021 and clearly in 2022.

Operator

Next, we will go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Olivier, I want to come back to the renewables question. You highlight several interesting initiatives. Do
you have an aspiration for renewables to be a certain percentage of revenues by, pick your year, 2025,
2030?

And just given your scale, what does this mean for CapEx spend, R&D spend? And overall, how do you
think about balancing a desire to see -- what I believe would be your desire to see a measurable portion
of your revenue stream becoming levered to renewables while also continuing to drive improved financial
performance?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. I think it's too early to quote a number. I think it's something that we are working and
then we are continuing to develop our strategy. But I think I will not call it renewable, I think it's more
than renewable. And it's not -- it intersects renewable, but I think it's the technology approach we have.
And it's not necessarily -- don't expect us to buy wind farms and go after capital projects. So that's not
our intent. Our intent is to continue to play and build on our strengths, strengths being our technology,
being a technology partner for a renewable company, being technology partner for some of our current
existing customer and being a technology partner for addressing a new economy, such as hydrogen
economy. I think this is where we want to be.

Obviously, I want to be -- this to be meaningful. I want to be at scale in the next decade for sure, because
I think at that time, we want to be in a position where we believe we will be diversifying our portfolio and
building and leveraging the growth that is existing in these to make sure that we are having a diversified
portfolio, but still a technology portfolio and a service and technology offering with solution to this market.

So again, it's a long-term ambition with short-term investments that are helping us to create market
position that are unique and that will gradually being reinforced. And we will take a bigger position on the
one we believe have the most potential in the coming years.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got you. And I just want to circle back on the 20% EBITDA margin target for next year. You did about
19% in 3Q, and what I imagine is likely close to 20% ex the to-be-divested businesses. It just seems that
20% is easily achievable, if not beatable, next year. But what am I missing? Is there still some concern
around pricing as contracts roll into next year? Is there some concern that maybe customer spending
abroad won't lift that much over the course of '21? So why shouldn't we consider the 20% EBITDA margin
a relatively low bar, just given your 3Q performance?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

No, it's -- first, it's -- the way we define it is a full year target we are taking. It will happen before the
end of 2021. We believe the trajectory of the year with a gradual recovery will give us the opportunity to
create a full year target that will be set at this level, or exceed.

Do we anticipate and fear more pricing? No. I think the pricing has been -- the pricing pressure has been
with us for the last 6 years. I think -- as I commented before, I think we have been giving away and the
industry at large have been under pressure for this. The industry now is realizing that there's so much we
can give, and we are working more collaboratively with our customers to find solution to eliminate waste.

Now obviously, large integrated contract are still competitively priced, but we see that through
performance, through technology and through smart engagement and alignment with our customer, we're
able to offset those pricing and competitive pressure and realize margin resilience.

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

So pricing is and will remain with us in these years to come, possible headwinds, but mostly on large
integrated contract. And I believe that when activity will come back, we'll get opportunity to get back
pricing in the right market.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.

Sean Christopher Meakim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Olivier, I think the energy transition topic naturally kind of begs the question about the outlook for
international E&P spending in the coming cycle. I appreciate the earlier comments on the cadence of
how work will come back, say, next year. But what's also going to be different in this cycle is that your
customers have additional calls on their cash flow that are being prioritized before upstream spending,
right? IOCs are diverting more capital towards renewables, that's the plan. Independents have a first
call on their cash to their balance sheets. I'm just curious how those factors influence your expectation
around the international spending cycle, and specifically offshore, as IOCs control most of the, specifically
deepwater, acreage globally.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Yes. That's a correct assumption. And I think we believe that what will happen is that the market will
consolidate around basins position, that each of the major and large independent will concentrate on their
basin plays and other strengths. I believe that we have to be smart about aligning with our customers
in those key basins, be it around their core assets, such as Exxon in Guyana, such as some other IOCs
in Brazil or in East Africa. We will make sure that we align ourselves with those so that we maximize
the uptake of market position in those basins and continue to execute our fit-for-basin and engage with
customer to make sure we maximize those position. So that's the first thing we want to do.

Next, I will comment that the national company are part of the mix, and I think the deepwater is indeed
more a domain where international company dominate. And I think we have there a very strong position.
But from shallow to land, there is a lot of activity that is pulled, both short and long cycle, by national
company. And the -- in Middle East, most of the -- most of the offshore activity, if not all of the offshore
activity, is led by national company and is growing fairly well and has been more resilient than the
land activity. So we will hold on those position and make sure that we continue, as we have seen some
contracts have been awarded in this domain, continue to pose for this.

So we understand that the market will be structurally different than what we could have anticipated
5 years ago, but we believe that the position around key basins, of strength from our customers and
aligning ourselves with this will provide us the opportunity to capture most of this international growth
coming back.

Sean Christopher Meakim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Understood. I appreciate that. And then I want to touch on Reservoir Characterization as well. And
that segment has experienced a lot of volatility in its margins the last couple of quarters, much more than
we've seen historically. I'm just curious how you'd characterize the gravitational center for those margins
once the business has cost reductions impact it, et cetera. What do you -- how do you think that business
looks like on a full year basis once we get it through these near-term challenges?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

I think I will -- the comment I will offer on this is that this market is a market where the exploration
market sits. And the exploration market is set from discretionary spend and it includes the multi-client
sales that historically have been a little bit of a swing that depends on the season and depends also on
the exploration discretionary budget that is available for our customers to invest in future exploration

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

acreage. So that has left a little bit of variability. The variability has been bigger in recent times because
the proportionate scale of exploration has reduced. Hence, when exploration campaign comes back, which
happens every other season, and when the discretionary spend on exploration through multi-clients, they
combine to create a strong -- very strong quarter.

And -- but at the base, the related testing, wireline and digital are still performing very well. Software
was growing this quarter, one of the very few product line that did grow quarter-on-quarter and did grow,
as an example. So expect this to be the consequence of most of the exposure we have on discretionary
exploration spend and the exploration campaign variability that we see quarter-on-quarter. This is the
most of the rationale for this more than any core issue we will have in any of the product line that are
there.

Now commenting on the future, we will not comment anymore on Reservoir Characterization as we'll
comment on the new divisions that we are setting in place. And this will be -- part of it will be in digital,
part of it will be in the reservoir performance division. So you will get more detail on this in the coming
months.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Voie with Wells Fargo.

Christopher F. Voie
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

First question, just a little bit of a clarification, sorry if I missed this. But I believe your opening remarks
on the outlook suggested flat quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. Is it fair to assume that, that
applies at the EBITDA line, so just north of $1 billion?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

That's a fair assumption. I think we have some favorable and unfavorable play that we believe will balance
out, and the ambition will be indeed to maintain roughly the -- both the margins and the dollar, on an
about flat.

Christopher F. Voie
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, I wonder if you could just give a little more detail on the
progression for the cost savings. I guess you were exiting about 80% in the third quarter. It should be
almost done in the fourth quarter. That's maybe $60-ish million incremental. Should we think there's much
left in 2021 from that? And is that international? Or I imagine that's mostly international basis, but is
there any progress there in North America as well?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

Stephane?

Stephane Biguet
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'll take this, Chris. There is -- yes, we were above -- quite a bit above 80%. So there is a bit left.
There will be still a bit left going into Q1. It is mostly on the international, the tail end of it. And North
America is mostly complete. So you will see a bit more push from this in Q4, but some remainder are
going into the first half next year. Does this answer your question?

Christopher F. Voie
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

So the cost-saving -- sorry. And just to finish up on that restructuring. So the cost-save -- the cost of
those savings is pretty light compared to expectations in the third quarter, around [ $273 million ]. Do you
think those costs would be higher in the fourth quarter? I think expectations are near $1 billion for the
second half. So will the cost of savings be much higher in the fourth quarter?

Stephane Biguet
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's not an exact science there, to be honest. There is -- the cash outlays, they get spread out. It
could be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. However, the cash flow from operations traditionally in
the fourth quarter also increases. So I think we could very well end up with free cash flow, including
severance, still quite positive. And if everything goes well, it could even be higher even in Q3, even though
we have higher severance potentially.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons Energy.

William Andrew Herbert
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

At this point, based upon the dialogue that you're having with your international customers, of course,
international on a pro forma basis is going to be 80% of revenues once we consummate OneStim, but you
mentioned strong customer engagement with regard to the dialogue that you're having for international.
At this point, do you think international revenues in 2021 are up year-over-year?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

I think the way you look at -- we look at it, Bill, is to look at the current level of activity. And we use more
or less the second half of this year as a baseline because I think the reset for international oil company
are happening in the second quarter; for independent, that happen in the second and the third; and
for national company, that's happening in the third. So the reset of activity has happened in the last 6
months. Now we believe that we have stabilized, and we have seen it in the last few weeks. And we don't
believe that -- aside from seasonal impact, we don't believe that there will be a structural adjustment in
the short term. And that's our baseline. So from that baseline, we will anticipate this to be -- to get an
upside, okay, from that baseline and to gradually recover from that baseline [ of work ].

Now to compare it year-on-year, including the first quarter of this year up to the mix international second
quarter, including the significant effort in Middle East to increase supply early Q2, I don't think it's realistic.
We have to take a baseline of the second half of this year and project forward. And from that base, build
back a recovery.

William Andrew Herbert
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Fair. But the COVID-related disruptions that you witnessed in Q3, I would assume, hopefully, are not going
to be as acute in 2021.

But moving on, with regard to -- yes, with regard to your high-grading of your portfolio, we have
announced OneStim and low-flow. I'm just curious in terms of what are the most tangible high-grading
opportunities remaining in your portfolio?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

I think we'll continue to focus on each and every business line we have operating in North America. We
have already made effort to rationalize and to make sure that we operate in the basin of North America,
where we believe we can sustain a differentiation and participate fully going forward. We have made
a choice to accelerate some technology access and fit-for-basin in some part of our portfolio to high-

17

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

grade their performance. So I will say that all of our portfolio, the entire business line, I would say, has
opportunity to improve their returns by tuning. And I think what we have done on structural reset is
lifting.

And the business line have improved this quarter beyond OneStim. The performance of North America
business line this quarter have improved. So we have a way to go to further improve this and to target
our recovery of margin in North America. And I will say that we do that on both the growth for the market
where we have strong alignment, well construction, the production recovery, the digital. We do that on the
bottom line, where we continue to use technology access or restructuring to make sure that we execute
with the return we desire in this North America. So we'll continue to gradually improve the performance.
That's our goal.

William Andrew Herbert
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

What I meant by high-grading, though, was the -- was additional disposition opportunities in your
portfolio.

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

I will not comment on that. I think we continue to look at every portfolio, and we look at it from the light
of does it bring us the growth and accretive return opportunity in the long run? Or do we have a better
way to monetize and to be [ occasionally ] opportunistic about this portfolio? So this is true for those
portfolio there and as well as in other market. But we'll continue to look at it, and we will be disciplined to
making the right decision for the shareholder here.

Operator

We have time for one final question, and that will be from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.

Connor Joseph Lynagh
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I was wondering, maybe a higher level one to close it out here. So we're about to get to look at your new
reporting structure. And I know that digital and integration is probably the one that you have the most
excitement about growing and improving earnings from. But if we remove that from the equation, when
we take a look at what you guys are doing in, say, the third quarter in the reservoir performance, well
construction, production systems, et cetera, where would you sort of point us to in the near term? And by
near term, I mean over the next 12 to 18 months here. Where would you see the greatest opportunities
for improvement in earnings? And would you say that, that is more driven by costs? Or more driven by
select growth opportunities in those portfolios?

Olivier Le Peuch
CEO & Director

No, setting aside D&I, which have both a margin expansion opportunity and growth on the back of
digital, indeed, I think we can look at it from well construction, where we believe that our market
position will benefit from the return of meters drilled worldwide. And efficiency, efficiency of our platform,
efficiency of our integration capability that we have formed by pulling this well construction. So this has
an opportunity to solidify our market leadership position and expand and get the benefit of scale, the
reservoir performance, where we combine our subsurface and our unique service that exploit both in
exploration, in development and in production intervention, the power of our service connected to the
reservoir and to the unique domain knowledge.

So I think here, we have unique technology differentiation and unique domain knowledge, that when a
market will need to extract and be more efficient on existing assets, to find the next tieback opportunity or
to exploit an existing asset to the next life extension, we have fantastic reservoir performance technology.

SCHLUMBERGER LIMITED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

And last is production system. I think here, this is a story of growth. This is a story of expanding horizon
beyond what we have today, which is from -- and beyond and into the midstream. This is a story of
addressing the gas market opportunity and connecting the well to the subsea, to the surface; and creating
unique integration, integrated production system with digital as a unique element. So recovery through
production system and reservoir performance is what we want to propose to the market.

So thank you, everyone, for having attended this call. So before we end this call, I would like to leave you
with 4 key takeaways.

Third quarter was another quarter of operational and financial outperformance made possible by discipline
in execution. We made significant progress on the execution of our strategy, with key milestones in
restructuring, North America strategy and expanding the reach of our digital platform.

The reset of our earnings power is progressing very well. We anticipate significantly improved operational
leverage when we put the trough behind us and activity rebounds, providing us with the platform to
materially expand our EBITDA margins and earnings.

The quarter was another strong free cash flow performance in the cycle trough, a meaningful step closer
to our double-digit free cash flow ambition that will support our priority on deleveraging our balance sheet.

Lastly, the deployment of our new customer-focused organization and our fit-for-basin approach provide
us with a great platform to capitalize on the market recovery and deliver on this path.

In conclusion, we are executing our performance strategy and are determined to continue taking bold
actions to secure resilience and reposition ourself as clear leaders, both in performance measured by our
customers and returns measured by our shareholders. Thank you.
