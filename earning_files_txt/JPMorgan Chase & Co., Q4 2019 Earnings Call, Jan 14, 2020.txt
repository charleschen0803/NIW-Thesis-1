JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 14, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call.
This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and
Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which as always, is
available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.

Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.5 billion, EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $29.2 billion
with a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Underlying performance continues to be strong.

Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across consumer and wholesale, with average balances
up 7% year-on-year. We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots, as average
loans across the company were up 3% year-on-year, excluding the impact of Home Lending loan sales
from prior quarters.

Client investment assets in Consumer & Business Banking were up 27%, and Asset & Wealth Management
AUM was up 19%, reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year as well as organic
growth. We ranked #1 for the full year in global IBCs with 9% wallet share, and gross IB revenue in the
Commercial Bank was a record $2.7 billion.

In CIB markets, we were up 56% year-on-year compared to a weak fourth quarter last year. However,
it's important to note the quarter was very strong in absolute terms, in fact, a record fourth quarter. And
credit performance continues to be strong across the company.

On to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4
billion or 9% year-on-year, with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates, largely offset
by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII. Noninterest revenue was up $2.6 billion
or 21% on higher revenue in CIB markets and AWM and continued strong performance in Home Lending
and auto. Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 4% on volume and revenue-related costs. Credit remained
favorable with credit costs of $1.4 billion, down $121 million or 8% year-on-year, reflecting modest net
reserve releases and net charge-offs in line with expectations.

Turning to the full year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $36.4 billion and EPS of $2.72
and revenue of $118.7 billion, all records; and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 19%.
Revenue was up $7.2 billion or 6% year-on-year, with net interest income of $2.1 billion or 4% on balance
sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates partially offset by higher deposit pay
rates. Noninterest revenue was up $5.1 billion or 9%, driven by growth across consumer and higher CIB
markets revenue.

And expenses of $65.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued investments as well as
volume and revenue-related costs partially offset by lower FDIC charges. Revenue growth and our
continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year.

And on credit, performance remained strong throughout 2019. Credit costs were $5.6 billion. In consumer,
credit costs were up $210 million, reflecting an increasing CAR due to balance growth, largely offset by
lower credit costs in Home Lending. And in Wholesale, we were up $504 million, largely due to reserve
releases and higher recoveries, both in 2018.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 14, 2020

Moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%,
up slightly versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter,
including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. And while on the
topic of capital, it's worth noting, given the actions we have taken, we fully expect it will remain in the
3.5% G-SIB bucket.

Before we move into the business results, I'll spend a moment talking about CECL on Page 5. As you
know, the transition to CECL is effective on January 1, and therefore, there is no impact to our 2019
financials. On the page is the CECL adoption impact, an overall net increase to the allowance for credit
losses of $4.3 billion, which is at the lower end of the range we've provided. This was driven by an
increase in consumer of $5.7 billion, mostly coming from Cards partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale
of $1.4 billion.

In Cards, the increase is a result of moving to lifetime loss coverage versus a shorter loss emergence
period under the incurred model. Whereas in Wholesale, modeling changes, like using specific
macroeconomic forecast versus through-the-cycle loss rates under-incurred, result in a decrease,
especially given the forecasted credit environment. Recognition of the allowance increase has resulted in
a $2.7 billion after-tax decrease to retained earnings, as you can see on the page. Also important to note,
we have elected to use the transition approach to recognize the impact on capital.

And now turning to businesses, we'll start with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6. In the fourth
quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31%, with accelerating deposit growth
of 5%, client investment assets up 27% and total loans down 6%. For the full year, results in CCB were
strong with $16.6 billion of net income, up 12%, and an ROE of 31% on revenue of $55.9 billion, up 7%.
Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, up 3% year-on-year.

In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was down 2%, driven by deposit margin compression, largely
offset by strong deposit growth and higher noninterest revenue on the increase in client investment assets
as well as account and transaction growth.

Home Lending revenue was down 5%, driven by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 17%,
reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue, predominantly offset by higher net production
revenue, reflecting a 94% increase in origination.

And in Cards, Merchant Services & Auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher Card NII on loan growth as
well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 10%, reflecting a
strong and confident consumer during the holiday season.

Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 1% -- 2%, driven by revenue-related costs from higher volumes as
well as continued investments in the business, including market expansion, largely offset by expense
efficiencies.

On credit. This quarter, CCB had a net reserve release of $150 million. This included a release in Home
Lending purchased credit impaired portfolio of $250 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and
home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in Card of $100 million, driven by growth. Net
charge-offs were $1.4 billion, largely driven by Card and consistent with expectations.

Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7. For the fourth quarter, CIB reported net
income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year. For the
full year, CIB delivered record revenue of $38 billion and an ROE of 14%.

In Investment Banking, IB fees reached an all-time record for the full year. We maintained our #1 rank in
global IB fees and grew share to its highest level in a decade. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 billion
was up 6% year-on-year, outperforming the market which was flat.

Advisory fees were down 3% following a record performance last year. On a sequential quarter basis,
fees were up meaningfully as we benefited from the closing of some large transactions. And for the year,
ranked #2 in gained share.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 14, 2020

Debt underwriting fees were up 11% year-on-year due to higher bond issuance activity as clients
accelerate their funding to take advantage of attractive pricing conditions to strengthen their balance
sheets. And for the year, we maintained our #1 rank overall. We were #1 for [ reinvest ] positions in both
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.

Equity underwriting fees were up 10% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance in the U.S. and Latin
America. The new issuance market continued to be active, and for the year, we ranked #1 in equity
underwriting as well as IPOs. Our overall pipeline continues to be healthy as strategic dialogue with clients
is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for
debt issuance.

Moving to markets. Total revenue was $5 billion, up 56% year-on-year, driven by record fourth quarter
revenue in both Fixed Income and Equity Markets. Fixed Income Markets was up 86%, benefiting from
a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year, but also reflecting strength across
businesses, notably in securitized products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows.
Equity Markets was 15%, driven by strength across cash and primes.

Treasury Services revenue was $1.2 billion, down 3% year-on-year, primarily due to deposit margin
compression which was largely offset by organic growth; while Security Services revenue was $1.1 billion,
up 3%. Expenses of $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal-, volume- and
revenue-related expenses as well as continued investments.

Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $938
million and an ROE of 16% for the fourth quarter; and for the year, $3.9 billion of net income and an ROE
of 17%. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year, with lower deposit NII on lower
margins, largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on a strategic investment. Gross Investment
Banking revenues were $634 million, up 5% year-on-year, driven by increased large deal activity.

Full year IB revenue was a record $2.7 billion, up 10%, on strong activity across segments with record
results for both Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. Expenses of $882 million were up 4% year-
on-year, driven by continued investments in banker coverage and technology.

Deposit balances were up 8% year-on-year as we continued to see strong client flows. Loan balances were
up 1% year-on-year. C&I loans were up 2%, driven by growth in specialized industries and expansion
markets partially offset by the runoff in our tax-exempt portfolio. CRE loans were up 1%, where we
continued to see higher originations in commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment, offset
by declines in real estate banking as we remained selective given where we are in the cycle.

Finally, credit costs were $110 million with an NCO rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by a single name
which was reserved for in prior quarters. Underlying credit performance continues to be strong.

Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of
$785 million, with pretax margin of 28% and ROE of 29% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, AWM
generated net income of $2.8 billion with both pretax margin and ROE of 26%. Revenue of $3.7 billion for
the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuations and average market
levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression.

Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 1% year-on-year. And for the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of
$14 billion, driven by Fixed Income and multi-asset. And we had net liquidity inflows of $37 billion. AUM
of $2.4 trillion and overall client assets of $3.2 trillion, both records, were up 19% and 18%, respectively,
driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into long-term and liquidity products.
Deposits were up 8% year-on-year, driven by growth in interest-bearing products. And finally, we had
record loan balances, up 8%, with strength in both Wholesale and Mortgage Lending.

Now on to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $361 million. Revenue was a loss of
$228 million for the current quarter, driven by approximately $190 million of net markdowns on certain
legacy private equity investments. Sequentially, revenue was down $920 million due to lower rates, the
benefit recorded in the prior quarter related to loan sales as well as the PE losses I just mentioned. Year-

on-year revenue was down also primarily driven by lower rates. Expenses of $343 million were down $165
million year-on-year due to the timing of our contributions to the foundation in the prior year.

And turning to Page 11 for the outlook. At Investor Day, as always, we'll give you more information on
the full year outlook. However for now, I'll provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. We
expect NII to be approximately $14 billion, market-dependent; adjusted expenses to be about $17 billion.
And as a reminder, the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation
adjustments, and as a result, is currently estimated to be approximately 17%, with the managed tax rate
about 500 to 700 basis points higher.

So to wrap up, 2019 was a year of record financial performance across revenue, net income and EPS. Our
outlook heading into 2020 is constructive, underpinned by the strength of the U.S. consumer. And despite
expected slower global growth and the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, we remain well positioned as
we continue to build on our scale and benefit from the diversification of our business model.
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Jen, I was wondering. On terms of the NII outlook, you talked about the $14 billion level, obviously
getting to a point of stability. Can you help us -- outside of day count, can you help us understand just
where we are in terms of repricing of the balance sheet? What happens if rates generally stay flat from
here, just in terms of the rate side of the equation, if we hold volume aside?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. As we look at rates paid, on the retail side, we didn't, obviously, have reprice on the way up, and
so there's little to do on the way down. In fact there, from a rates paid perspective, we continued in the
fourth quarter to see rates paid tick up a little bit on migration from savings to CDs.

And then on the Wholesale side, we did see rates paid come down as you would expect, and we did see
betas accelerate after the second cut. So there, we saw more of a decline in CIB than we did in CB or
AWM, as you might expect. Importantly though, as we always say on the Wholesale side, we price client-
by-client. And so we're not going to lose any valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta.

And then I would just say in terms of the outlook, with the Fed on hold, the implieds do still have 1 cut
later in 2020. And based on the latest implieds, we'll give you more detail at Investor Day as we always
do. But I would say NII for the full year of 2020, flat is slightly down, as the headwinds from rates will be
offset with balance growth.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes, got it. And just one question on just the volume side of things. Ex the mortgage loans sales last
year, you were still in that like 3% core growth. And obviously, you talk a lot about the environment and
how there's been some settling out, but at a lower level. Just what's the status of just Corporate and
Commercial customers now that we're closer to Phase 1 getting finalized, UMCA's (sic) [ USMCA's ] on the
table? What's the backdrop of just economic activity as you guys see it?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So the fourth quarter definitely, I would say, stabilized. Things trade certainly stabilized. Things,
broadly speaking, stopped getting worse. And so we saw sentiment improve a bit, which I think
contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter. And then, certainly, there are some puts
and takes. I mean, the U.S. consumer remains in very strong shape, both from a credit perspective,
sentiment, spending. Obviously, labor market is very strong. And the Fed and the ECB on hold. And then
capital spending still a bit soft, but sentiment is at least certainly better than it was 6 months ago. So we
have a, broadly speaking, constructive outlook headed in -- as we're heading into 2020 here.

Operator

Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 14, 2020

I have a question on credit and CECL. And you guys have been pretty clear that your business decisions
are based on economic outcome -- or economic outcomes and not accounting outcomes. And -- but CECL
does materially change the way in which timing -- the -- changed the timing in which earnings accrete to
book value and capital, obviously, with the higher upfront hit. But you guys have also been shifting your
loan book pretty materially towards cards, which have a much higher loss content than your total book.

So I guess a twofold question. One is, how do we think about provisioning in this context? Should we
think provisioning is going to be well above charge-offs as your reserve ratio moves up? Because I would
think your ALLL ratio, post-CECL adoption, which I think is about 1.8%, 1.9%, it should move up as cards,
which have a much higher loss content than that, continue to grow in the mix. So just how do we think
about provisioning in the context of the mix shift and CECL's adoption?

And then I guess secondly, if there is a change in the macro environment and the credit environment does
get worse and CECL, that inflection, goes through your reserves and your provisioning, is there a point
where CECL actually does change the way you think about pricing and underwriting in that environment?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So I'll start with the provisioning. So look, I think it's fair to say under CECL, you could have
incremental volatility given that reserves are more dependent on specific macroeconomic forecasts. But
there, that would depend, of course, on our ability to have foresight into the timing and extent of those
downturns. In cards specifically, as you say, in any one period of growth or a downturn, you could see an
increase in reserve expense that we're taking, life of loan versus the next 9 or 12 months, so that's true.

And then on the Wholesale side, you could see some differences, of course, because there are modeling
differences between specific macroeconomic forecasts and through-the-cycle. Having said that, we
continue [ to think that ] incremental volatility would be material for us. And of course, net charge-offs are
not changing.

And then from a pricing perspective, we don't foresee in the near term any pricing changes. The cash
flows with the customer have not changed. And so we don't see any. But it is true, as you rightly point
out, that there is an increased cost of equity in the sense that we're taking reserves upfront versus
through time. So over time, you could see that, but we're not expecting it in the near term.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. I guess on the provisioning side, my question is more just on an ongoing basis as the mix changes
more towards higher-loss-content lending, which obviously has higher margins and higher profitability
through the -- over the course of a loan, in theory. But like in that context, I would -- is it fair to say
your provisioning levels also could be materially above your charge-offs? Because I would think that your
reserve ratios, your ALLL ratios, do have to move up as that mix changes on your balance sheet.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

They could be, of course. So that's just timing. Particularly on the card side, it's just timing. But it's
difficult to know, again, because it relies on our ability to have perfect foresight into the timing and extent
of a downturn.

Operator

Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So I was hoping to get a little bit more [ credit ] on what happened in the quarter to produce such stellar
results. Understand that obviously the fourth quarter '18 comp was light, but $3.4 billion is still a pretty

heavy number for a fourth quarter for JPMorgan. So any color you could provide would be very helpful,
Jennifer.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So you're talking about markets, Erika?

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Markets, thank you.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Okay, sure. So there -- at Goldman in early December, I did say we expected to be up meaningfully.
I would say the performance was broad-based. In rates, we call out securitized products -- I'm sorry, in
Fixed Income, we call out securitized products and rates, which were bright spots. But broadly speaking,
obviously, Equity's had a very strong quarter as well. So it's really across the franchise. And we saw very
strong client flow and we had success monetizing those flows. So just a very healthy environment for us
and really strong performance.

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. My follow-up question is that a quarter ago and 2 quarters ago, the revenue backdrop for banks in
general -- or the outlook was starting to deteriorate. And I think management had got -- gave us some
color that you'll continue to invest your efficiencies and initiatives no matter what the changes are in the
revenue environment, but you could cut back on certain expenses if revenue environment was changing.
That being said, your revenue production seems to always outperform to the upside. So as you think
about 2020, is the best way to think about expenses just that 55% overhead ratio?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

So look, on the efficiency ratio, I would say that like we run the company with great discipline, whether
it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle. But because
the efficiency ratio is an outcome, not an input, and it's about expenses and revenue, we're not going to
give a target for any 1 year. We think about operating leverage over time. And as we always say, we're not
going to change the way we run the company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds.

And on expenses, I would just say that at Investor Day last year, Marianne told you that we expected the
cost curve to flatten post-2019. In 2019, adjusted expenses were up 3%. 2020, we expect them to be up
less than that.

Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Is Jamie on the call?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

He is.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 14, 2020

I'm sorry?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, he is. Yes.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. So just a question for Jamie. Because in the first paragraph, you mentioned easing trade issues
toughed market activity. And I know this is a very simple question, but can you talk about the connection
between easing trade issues and better trading? And you said that was better toward the end of the year.
Is this something that you expect to remain? Or is this a one-off quarter?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

That's a really hard question to answer, Mike. Obviously, trade caused a lot of consternation, that has
eased off a little bit. I don't think it's going completely go away because you still have potential ongoing
trade issues with China and Europe and stuff like that. But I think because that sentiment got better,
trading got better. So the question, how long that continues? We don't know.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then, Jennifer, you mentioned expense growth was 3%, it should be less than that this year. You guys
had also mentioned that your technology spending might be leveling off. So as that levels off, maybe you
see paybacks from prior investment. Any sense of where tech spending will be this year versus the prior
year and how you think about that? And I know we'll get more at Investor Day.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, of course. So I think you can think about tech spending on a fully loaded basis being in line with
what I described for the company. And we continue to realize efficiencies from investments in tech, but as
you well know, we continuously invest in tech. And so there's a fair amount of velocity in the investment
portfolio there as investments roll off. And we're investing in new technology and innovation. So you can
think about tech spending as being broadly in line with how I described the company in terms of trend.

Operator

Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Two questions. One on asset growth. In the last couple of years, fourth quarter, you have to go through
this exercise of trying to squeeze down to hit the G-SIB target. And then in addition, this year, I think
you sold some residential mortgage loans to investors, or at least the investors are taking the risk of it.
And then you're requesting to have regulatory capital reflect that transfer of risk to an investor pool while
you're keeping the customer relationship.

When I see these things, I'm wondering how you're thinking about how much room you have for asset
growth as we go into 2020. And is there an opportunity to potentially do more of this residential mortgage
loan trade to free up space for growth? Maybe you could speak to that.

Jennifer A. Piepszak

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 14, 2020

Sure. So I mean we're bound by standardized capital. And so of course, that is a consideration for us and
one of the reasons that we're looking to structure loan sales as you described in the mortgage business.
So we think that there's more we can do there.

And then on G-SIB, we remain hopeful that we will see the refinements there and recalibration that the
Fed has been talking about for some time because that will become increasingly difficult. So both are at
the margin constraints for us. But broadly speaking, I wouldn't say that we're constrained given where we
are on our capital ratios.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And as I think about CECL, appreciate the commentary you had earlier on the call. I'm just wondering a
couple of things. One, why do you think you ended up towards the low end of your $4 billion to $6 billion
increase in reserves that you outlined earlier? And what kind of estimates you have for the economic
outlook, you've got the assumption for the economic outlook in the reasonable supportable period, et
cetera? And so I'm just trying to understand what kind of forecast you have in your model, so that I
understand what's embedded in your scenarios and in your ALLR ratio.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So we -- I think we ended up at the low end as we, through the year, continued to get more
certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like. And so I think that's really
what's driving it. Obviously portfolio mix as well continued to be very strong in terms of performance of
the portfolio.

And then on the estimates for the economic outlook. As you rightly say, there is the reasonable and
supportable period, which for us, is 2 years. And so we do use multiple weighted scenarios there. So we
weigh multiple scenarios with the one most likely getting the greatest weight, and that's where you end
up with what looks like a reasonably benign outlook for the reasonable and supportable period, which also
obviously would contribute to us hitting the low end of the range.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Hey Jen, are we going to disclose some of those variables over time?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

That's a great point, Jamie, I should have said that. Yes, we -- I mean there will be more disclosure about
CECL in the Q for the first quarter.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Which means all the banks will be showing these ridiculous forecasting going forward. And the difference
is we'll spend time talking about that as opposed to the actual business.

Jennifer A. Piepszak

Right.

James Dimon

Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.

Matthew D. O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Two quick follow-ups to some themes that have been talked about. I guess first on expenses. The full year
outlook, it was pretty clear, less than 3% growth. But the first quarter seems a little bit higher than maybe
I would have thought, up 4% year-over-year. And I don't know if that's just rounding and I'm getting too
obsessed over $100 million here or there or if you're upfronting some investment spend. And if so, what
that's for.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So the first quarter tend to be a bit higher for us, if you look through history. And so -- but there,
you can think about it comparing it year-over-year, we have volume and revenue-related expenses
increasing, a bit of an increase on investment, but both are being partially offset by expense efficiencies.

Matthew D. O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then the other follow-up question is just on capital allocation. Obviously, it's a good problem
to have, but the ratios keep going up, the capital generation keeps going up, the stock keeps going up.
You're obviously buying back a lot of stock. The goal is to get the dividend, I think, higher over time.
But maybe just talk about how you think about buying back stock at these levels. If there's other, call it,
creative uses of capital. Like I always think about all the money you spend on technology, does it make
sense to buy technology versus do it organic? So just maybe address some of those things.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So on that ratio, just remind you that, of course, we have our capital distribution plan approved
once a year. And so since our last CCAR filing, we have realized some RWA efficiency and we've outearned
relative to the assumptions in the CCAR filing. And so that's part of the reason why we've seen the ratios
load up there.

On stock buybacks, as you rightly point out, our first priority is always going to be to invest for organic
growth, and so we are always looking to do that first and foremost. And then to have a competitive
and sustainable dividend. And only then, to distribute excess capital to shareholders through buybacks.
And we have said that it makes sense to continue to do that at or above 2x tangible book, which is
about where we are now. We will obviously, when distributing excess capital, always be looking at
the alternatives. But at 17% ROTCE and 2% or 3% dividend payout ratio, there is a high bar to the
alternatives.

Operator

Our next question comes from...

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

And yes, you're absolutely right about acquisitions. We did do InstaMed this year, which hooks up
electronic -- system that hooks up providers and consumers of health care, while, I think the numbers are
like 80% or 90% is still done by check. So if there are opportunities like that, we absolutely would be on
the hunt for them.

Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.

Gerard S. Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Jennifer, a question on credit. You obviously put up some real good numbers once again on credit quality
and I noticed that you had a nice material decline in the Wholesale nonperforming assets quarter-to-
quarter. Can you give us any color on what brought that down? And could you tie in also any concerns that
you may have about the energy portfolio? I know it's not material, but there is some concerns out there
about energy credits.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So on Wholesale nonperforming loans, in the CIB, that was some name-specific upgrades that we
had in the CIB. And then in the Commercial Bank, that was related to charge-offs taken in the quarter.
And then on energy, really nothing there, statically, I would say. Like any sector, we have upgrades and
downgrades and this quarter was no exception. But I wouldn't say anything thematically in our portfolio
that we're concerned about.

Gerard S. Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Very good. And then I don't know if I heard you correctly on the last answer to the stock repurchase
program. I understand, of course, it's driven by your CCAR results. But if the price of the stock, and it's
a good problem to have, gets to a level that you consider to be too high, I think you may have said 2x
tangible book value, what then happens? If the price of it gets to a point where you guys think it's just too
high to buy it back, what do you do with the excess capital at that point? And have you given that -- and
again, it's a good problem to have, I understand that. But have you given any thought to that?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. We give a lot of thought to it. And I agree, it is a high-class problem. And so we've said that
at or above 2x tangible book makes sense. If it continues to go up, we're going to continue to look
at alternatives, most importantly, within the company, in terms of how we should really think about
the returns on buying our stock back at a higher level versus perhaps thinking about the returns a bit
differently in terms of organic growth.

Jamie, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

No, said it all.

Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Jennifer, wanted to start with a question on capital. Quarles indicated in a recent interview that he
plans to implement the bulk of the SCB in 2020 CCAR. He also alluded to the possibility of deploying a
countercyclical buffer as part of that. I'm just wondering if the countercyclical buffer is actually deployed
or incorporated within the test. Is that something that's underwritten as part of your 12% CET1 target?
And are you anticipating changes to the G-SIB coefficient calculations that you alluded to earlier in the call
as part of the coming cycle as well?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Steven. So you touched on a number of things that are all important. And I think what's most
important to us is that we end up with a cohesive framework across all of them. The comments from the
Vice Chair have been constructive, in the sense that he always reiterates that he thinks the level of capital
in the system is about right. And so we'll have a firmer view when we see a final rule. As you say, we do
expect to see something in 2020 based upon the comments that we have heard, just like you have. And
we expect that our 12% target will not be impacted because we do constructively hear the Vice Chair say
over and over that the amount of capital in the system is about right. And then -- but we can't have a
certain view until we see the final rule.

And then on G-SIB, we remain hopeful that we're going to see the refinements that the Fed has been
talking about, perhaps not full recalibration until Basel IV, which is what the Vice Chair recently said. But
certainly, there are a number of refinements that we've been talking about, and the Fed has been talking
about, for years. And that we remain hopeful that we'll see them very soon.

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

And just one final one for me. We saw really strong FIC results as well as really strong institutional deposit
growth, and I was hoping you could speak to what impact the Fed balance sheet growth is actually having
on all of your different businesses, or how that's manifesting. Because it seems to be providing a pretty
nice tailwind, whether it's some increased activity as well as some benefit in terms of deposit growth that
you're seeing across the overall franchise, but institutional, in particular.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So you're absolutely right. On the Wholesale side, the Fed balance sheet expansion was for sure a
tailwind for us. Although I would say the more meaningful portion of our deposit growth on the Wholesale
side in the quarter was from strong organic growth and client acquisition. [Audio Gap] [ Pension ] was a
tailwind. And elsewhere, I would say obviously, it was the right thing to do and provided stability in the
[ retail ] markets throughout the quarter.

Operator

Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

A quick question on the deposit cost. Could you just break down maybe by segment where the big drivers
were, that saw -- you saw have the big reduction in deposit costs, linked quarter? Was that in security
services? Was it wealth management?

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 14, 2020

Chief Financial Officer

Sure, sure, Brian. So I'll start with retail, where we saw rates paid tick up a bit, and that's on migration
from savings to CDs. We have seen CD pricing come off its peak, but continued migration from savings to
CDs.

And then on the Wholesale side, you see bigger declines in rates paid in Treasury Services for sure, and
then a little bit less so in the Commercial Bank and AWM. And again, as we always say, these are name-
specific, client-by-client decisions. And while we feel good about where we are, these are decisions we
make client-by-client, and we're certainly careful and have a lot of discipline, not going to lose valuable
relationships over a few ticks of beta.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And then a separate question. In the Commercial Bank, I mean, you've seen loans come down quarter-on-
quarter for end-of-period and generally modest growth year-over-year. I mean what's the sentiment now
in the middle market and the corporate client? Is that a sentiment issue? Is it just a timing issue there for
seeing better loan growth?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So there are obviously some puts and takes, which I'll run through. But broadly speaking, I would
say what we're seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand. And in C&I,
we feel good about the growth that we're seeing in the areas where we're focused in specialized industries
and market expansion. But of course, that's offset partly by the tax-exempt portfolio that's running off.
And then in CRE, good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunities there,
given the rate environment. And then that is offset by real estate banking, where we are very disciplined,
given where we are in the cycle.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I would just add. When capital expenditures come down, all things being equal, we're seeing that -- but all
things being equal, you're going to see a reduction in some lendings as companies need less money to pay
off receivables and inventory and plant and equipment.

Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

A quick question on open APIs and what the big picture is here and how it impacts you and the rest of
the banking industry. Meaning, there's concerns over data security and things like that, but JPMorgan
has some -- plenty of agreements with some of the bigger providers. So I'm just curious to get your big-
picture thoughts on what level of concern should we have with the good and the bad?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean there, I would say, Glenn, our customers' data privacy and security is of utmost importance
to us. And we think, over time, the best way for us to do that as securely as we can is to have third-party
apps only access data through our APIs. And so we are working name-by-name to get those agreements
in place. And we hope through time, that is exclusively the only way that third parties can access our
customers' data. We think that's the most secure way to do it.

But very importantly, is that, that data is the data the customer agrees to give them, on the basis they
agreed to give it to them. There's not unlimited access to customer data. And the customer will have the
ability to turn it off. As opposed to today, if you gave your bank passcode to someone, they're taking the
data every day, maybe even every minute, and you don't even know about it because you forgot.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Great point. And we're going to make it super easy for our customers to be able to do that.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So you will give them the tools to control that?

Jennifer A. Piepszak

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

That is the full intent.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And then just curious if you've seen any follow-on impacts, that you've seen some repricing on parts of
the illiquid markets, and for specifically some of the unprofitable parts of those companies. And is that just
the repricing, and everybody that owns them will take some hits? A little bit slower progress on banking
front, and that's it? Or is there anything bigger there to worry about with what's going on in the illiquid
side?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Are you talking about the private companies?

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes, I am. Sorry.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, this -- there are a lot of private companies. They -- a lot of them do well, some don't. Some will
fail. Some have access to capital now and they won't have access to capital in a downturn. But it's not a
systemic issue. It's just the capital markets, there are a lot of private companies. And so I don't think it's
that big a deal. You just have an adjustment in access to capital, and that will happen periodically.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 14, 2020

Jennifer, you were kind of foreshadowing lower tax rate as you kind of move into the first quarter, and
then the tax rate here in the fourth quarter was a little bit lower than what we expected. Is there anything
that's permanent here? Or are there some things that are just kind of rolling through these 2 quarters?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. There -- I wouldn't say there's anything permanent there. The first quarter is typically lower for us,
Marty. You can think about full year '20 as being 20%, plus or minus. And of course, that would depend on
any nonrecurring items we might have or any change in regulation. But 20%, plus or minus. And then of
course the managed tax rate is typically 500 to 700 basis points higher than that.

Marlin Lacey Mosby
Vining Sparks IBG, LP, Research Division

And then a bigger question. When we came into 2018, the net interest margin was around 2.5%. And then
now as we're coming out of 2019, the net interest margin has fallen below 2.4%. So interest rates went
up 100 basis points and then down 75, and we've netted negative 10 basis points. So I was just curious,
in that half, it's either the way the Fed kind of inflected very quickly that created a little bit more pressure
in the net between deposit pricing and loan pricing? Or do we think that this is probably just some of
the competition that came in after the tax reform? And maybe this is just the evidence of some of that
competition with the increased profitability that we got from the benefit from the taxes?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So there, I would say, Marty, on the sort of the last several hikes, there was some catch-up there
because we know we had some lags on reprice in the rising rate environment. So if you're just looking at
the last few hikes, the betas would certainly be higher than what we're seeing in terms of the first 3 eases
here. But broadly speaking on NIM, I mean, we don't -- NIM is an outcome for us, not an input. And as
we think about looking forward, certainly, the environment is very competitive. It always has been. And
NII, the outlook for 2020 is, at this point, based upon the implieds, flat to slightly down, and we do expect
balance sheet growth.

well. Geographically though, is there much more weighting there on the U.S. versus Europe and APAC?

Jennifer A. Piepszak

geographic breakdown, but it was largely broad-based.

Andrew Lim

Alison Elizabeth Williams

So I had a similar question, just circling back to trading and the CIB more broadly. So obviously, the bank
has gained share. But can you speak to future opportunities and runway?

And maybe this is more of a question for Investor Day, but specifically, businesses like cash management,
transaction banking and corporate clients in general, you're a leader in the U.S. Anecdotally, we hear U.S.
banks have been making gains in Europe. Can you speak at all to that opportunity?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So as you said, we'll give you more color at Investor Day. For the Treasury Services business, we
feel really good about where we're positioned. But I think going forward, there will obviously be some
rate headwinds there which we think can be offset by organic growth. But given the investments that we
have made there, Jamie mentioned InstaMed earlier, we feel really good about the capabilities that we're
adding and what we're seeing in terms of organic growth there. But we can talk to you more about that at
