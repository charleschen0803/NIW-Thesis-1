Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Entergy's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings
Release and Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to David Borde, Vice President, Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.

David Borde
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We will begin today with comments from
Entergy's Chairman and CEO, Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh, our CFO, will review results. [Operator
Instructions]

In today's call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ
materially from these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, which are set forth in our
earnings release, our slide presentation and our SEC filings. Entergy does not assume any obligation to
update these forward-looking statements.

Management will also discuss non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP
measures are included in today's press release and slide presentation, both of which can be found on the
Investor Relations section of our website.

And now I will turn the call over to Leo.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn to my remarks, I would like to give you an
update on the winter storms we experienced last week. Severe weather conditions affected most of the
country, including our service area. In order to balance the system, MISO directed us to conduct rolling
power outages.

Our system is back to normal operations. Our thoughts are with all of our customers and communities
who were impacted by the weather. Our employees once again demonstrated their dedication by working
around the clock in difficult conditions to quickly restore service where needed. As always, I am grateful
and humbled by their commitment.

We're still working through our numbers, but our preliminary assessment of the cost is approximately
$125 million to $140 million associated with mobilizing crews and restoring power and approximately $400
million of incremental fuel costs. We have fuel recovery mechanisms in all of our jurisdictions, and we will
work with our regulators to recover these costs in a manner that mitigates the impacts on customer bills.

I will now turn to our discussion on 2020. Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful
year. Our adjusted earnings per share is $5.66. That's in the top half of our guidance range. We achieved
these results by overcoming revenue challenges with our flexible spending program. We just set a goal to
reduce 2020 cost by $100 million, and we exceeded that target by approximately 50%.

Underlying our strong performance was the foundation that we have built over the last several years.
We've become a resilient organization prepared to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders even in
extraordinary times. It's what our stakeholders expect from us, and that's what it takes to be the premier
utility.

Challenges are a natural part of doing business. No company is immune, and Entergy is no exception. As
2020 proved, the test of sustainability is less about challenges and more about how we are able to achieve
our goals regardless of the circumstances. Because of this solid foundation and our proven track record,

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

we are confident in our continued success in 2021 and beyond. As such, we are initiating 2021 guidance
and affirming our longer-term outlooks, all in line with what we shared at Analyst Day last September.

In 2020, we brought online 4 large generation resources that are cleaner and more efficient than our older
assets, providing customer savings and environmental benefits that will help us meet our sustainability
commitments. These assets also give us dispatch flexibility that is important for system reliability.

Renewable energy is also a key part of our strategy to achieve our sustainability goals. Our clean energy
efforts have escalated over the past few years. We now have more than 500 megawatts of renewable
resources in operation. These resources come in many forms, small and large, owned and contracted.

And some are innovative solutions like the New Orleans Residential Rooftop Project, where we own the
solar systems that are installed at low-income customers' homes. Those customers get a fixed credit on
their bill, providing economic benefits to those who need it and renewable energy for all customers.

We have approximately 450 megawatts of solar projects currently being installed. We have another 880
megawatts of solar resources either in regulatory review or RFPs, and we plan to solicit another 800
megawatts of solar this year. This is only the beginning, and we will continue to grow the number of
renewable energy facilities across our region.

Almost half of our capital was for distribution and utility support investments that are closest to the
customer experience. A portion of these costs is for our advanced meter project. We have now completed
the installation of 70% of the 3 million advanced meters we are deploying across our service area. This
is an exciting milestone as we enter the final phase of our 3-year journey. Advanced meters help our
customers better manage their energy usage and bills, and it lays the foundation for new technological
capabilities over time.

With billions of real-time data points available, we'll be able to gain new insights that will drive
fundamental change in the way we serve our customers while consuming the least amount of energy
resources. We invested $800 million in our transmission infrastructure excluding storms. Our transmission
investments benefit our system and our customers as they reduce congestion, strengthen service
reliability, enhance system efficiency and resiliency and support economic development in our jurisdictions
by enabling service to new customers.

We completed several important projects, some of which proved critical during the active storm season.
These new structures, built to modern standards, withstood the record winds from Hurricane Laura and
were critical to restoring power following that storm. These projects are all part of our plan to improve the
resiliency of our infrastructure and provide a higher level of service to our customers.

In 2020, we continued to work collaboratively with our regulators for the benefit of customers. In the
face of difficult times due to COVID-19, we collaborated to find solutions. Early on, we suspended
disconnects and worked to set up payment plans for customers who couldn't pay their bills. In all our
jurisdictions, we received accounting orders that deferred costs associated with COVID-19, including bad
debt expense from accounts that we don't expect to collect as a result of the pandemic. We also work
with our commissions on rate recovery mechanisms that give us the opportunity to recover costs that are
benefiting our customers.

The Public Utility Commission of Texas finalized the new generation rider, which provides for full and timely
recovery of capital costs associated with new generation. A more timely recovery helps us create value for
our stakeholders in Texas and ensures that the communities we serve remain economically competitive.
The Texas commission approved the use of this rider earlier this year for recovery of the Montgomery
County Power Station.

The City Council of New Orleans approved the unanimous settlement that resolved Entergy New Orleans
rate case and FRP filing. We will make the first of 3 annual FRP filings later this year. We also had annual
FRP rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. We plan to submit filings in Louisiana and Texas in
the first quarter of this year and in New Orleans in the second quarter to request recovery of 2020 storm
costs.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

As we have done in the past, we will seek to securitize these costs. With current low interest rates,
this will result in significantly lower cost to customers as compared to typical recovery. Louisiana's and
Arkansas' FRPs expire with the 2020 filings, and we've requested renewal of both. Discussions are
ongoing, and we will provide updates as we get them.

In spite of the positive outcomes in 2020, the Arkansas commission's order for our 2021 FRP rate
change fell short of our expectations. We believe the order incorrectly applies the law and results in an
unreasonable outcome. We requested a rehearing on the commission's order, and we expect to receive
their decision on our request and the FRP extension by March 15. You should note that our guidance and
outlooks today reflect the commission's December order and extension of the FRP.

Our leadership in sustainability and environmental stewardship has been a long-standing hallmark of who
we are and has led to measurable, undeniable results. For the past 2 decades, our emissions rate has
been well below the sector average. Our utility CO2 emissions rate has decreased nearly 40% since 2000.
And today, we operate one of the cleanest large-scale power generation fleets in the nation. Our fleet
is one of the cleanest as we have not only set meaningful reduction targets, but we continue to exceed
them.

The most recent example is our Environment 2020 goal, where we committed to maintain carbon dioxide
emissions through 2020 at 20% below year 2000 levels. Our actual 2020 emissions were 27% below 2000
levels, beating our reduction goal by 33%.

Looking ahead, our business plan supports our 2030 commitment to reduce our utility carbon emissions
rate by 50% below year 2000 levels. Achieving this objective calls for continued transformation of our
portfolio. To that end, by 2030, we anticipate that our generation portfolio will include at least 5 gigawatts
of renewables with potential for more. During that time frame, we also plan to deactivate approximately 4
gigawatts of legacy gas, along with the remainder of our coal assets. Going forward, we will not build any
large-scale generation that isn't hydrogen-capable.

As we transform our portfolio, we will work with our regulators to do so within a framework that balances
reliability, affordability and environmental stewardship while enriching the economies of the communities
we serve. To support our longer-term net zero goal, we're exploring emerging technologies through a
partnership with Mitsubishi Power.

We will develop innovative solutions that include large-scale battery storage, carbon capture and
sequestration and hydrogen-based strategies. While we are not relying on hydrogen to meet our 2030
commitment, we believe it will be a part of creating a carbon-free future.

Hydrogen is an important technology that will allow utilities to adopt much greater levels of renewables to
meet growing sustainability needs. Hydrogen storage, transportation and utilization attributes will allow us
to leverage today's pipeline and generation technologies in a manner that supports a highly reliable and
fuel-diverse electric grid.

In the Gulf South, we have a distinct locational advantage, and we are uniquely positioned given the
existing hydrogen infrastructure in Texas and Louisiana. Existing infrastructure today in our service
territory includes more than 3.5 billion cubic feet of hydrogen capacity; 2 of the 3 hydrogen salt caverns
operating in the United States; and more than 1,100 miles of hydrogen pipelines, which is 60% of
the United States infrastructure. In addition, 2 of the largest hydrogen producers in the world are our
customers.

We also have more than 860 miles of CO2 pipelines in our service area, which would facilitate carbon
capture and sequestration. These are just a few of the advantages for our service area, which presents us
with unique opportunities.

To advance our work on hydrogen, we are working on a few projects that I'd like to share. Orange County
Power Station was selected in Entergy Texas' request for proposals. That facility will have the capability
upon commercial operation to utilize up to 30% hydrogen. Longer term, the turbines can be configured to
operate on up to 100% hydrogen at modest incremental cost.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

The facility is conveniently located near existing hydrogen pipeline infrastructure that can be connected to
the plant to utilize hydrogen when feasible and economic. We own a storage facility with 3 caverns. We are
evaluating converting one of these caverns to hydrogen. We are taking advantage of the existing hydrogen
pipeline infrastructure in the Texas industrial corridor near the Orange County Power Station, and we are
developing a 4-phase plan to support access to hydrogen fuel across our fleet of hydrogen-capable plants.

We are also in the very early stages of developing a green hydrogen demonstration plant, Montgomery
County Hydrogen Innovation Center. This project will teach us important lessons about electrolysis
operations and ultimately lay the groundwork for future full-scale projects. We're excited about these
projects in our collaboration with Mitsubishi as we lead our industry to make hydrogen a reality that will
create green jobs in the Gulf South region. We'll provide updates on these initiatives as we have new
developments.

Being the premier utility means doing our part to create a more sustainable future for our customers,
our communities and the world, a goal we continuously strive for in everything we do. In 2020, we were
once again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index. We are the only electric utility
to receive this honor 19 years in a row, and we are very proud of this recognition as DJSI is one of the
most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We earned perfect scores in the areas
of climate strategy, water-related risks, materiality, environmental reporting, social reporting and policy
influence.

This past year, our employees demonstrated once again why Entergy is best in class in storm response.
During a storm season, unlike any other in our history, our commitment to health, safety and
preparedness is one of our proudest achievements. Our teams worked around the clock to safely restore
service, to rebuild infrastructure and to help our communities recover while following virus prevention
protocols.

For our employees' extraordinary efforts, we received broad support from local, state and federal officials.
We also received 5 emergency response awards from EEI. This marks the 23rd consecutive year EEI has
recognized Entergy employees for their emergency response.

2020 was another successful year for our company. Everything we accomplished gives me confidence
in our ability to meet our goals and commitments going forward. We've proven that we are a resilient
company prepared to respond to adversity and deliver on our mission to create sustainable value for our
stakeholders. It's what our stakeholders expect from us, and that's what it takes to be the premier utility.

Despite obstacles imposed by the pandemic, mild weather and storms, our employees found ways to
connect, innovate, drive growth and build toward the future, all while meeting our financial commitments.
The fundamentals of our company are strong, and the drivers that uniquely position us to be the premier
utility remain firmly in place. We consistently meet or exceed our guidance expectations. We have line of
sight on 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth. And by the end of the year, we expect the same for our dividend
growth rate subject to Board approval.

And as we mature in our continuous improvement efforts, we aspire to permanently reduce O&M costs and
redeploy those resources for the benefit of our stakeholders. I am as excited as ever about our future. I
will now turn the call over to Drew to review our financial performance.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting strong results for 2020. As Leo
mentioned, we successfully managed lower revenues by lowering our O&M expense by approximately
$150 million, which exceeded our $100 million cost-reduction target for the year. Our results today are a
validation of the strong, resilient company we are. As a result, we are confident in our continued success
going forward and are initiating our guidance and affirming our longer-term outlooks.

I'll begin with a review of results for the full year and then provide an overview of guidance for 2021.
Starting on Slide 6. Entergy adjusted EPS for 2020 was $5.66, $0.26 higher than 2019 and the top half of
our guidance range.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

Moving to Slide 7. There were many drivers that are straightforward and laid out in the release, but
the key area of focus for us in 2020 was O&M. We offset the negative impact of storms, COVID-19 and
unfavorable weather with approximately $150 million of cost reductions. And to do this, we identified a
number of cost-cutting measures early in the year and deliberately executed on our plan.

Slide 8 lists some of the actions taken. We are proud of what we've accomplished, yet we are not
surprised. Our employees have built the culture, processes and resources to successfully deliver on our
commitments to all of our stakeholders, even during extraordinary times, and that's been important this
year more than ever. Our results further strengthen our confidence in our success going forward as we
affirm our earnings expectations from '21 through '23.

The results for EWC summarized on Slide 9 are generally in line with our expectations, and we continue to
make good progress on our exit of that business.

Full year operating cash flow, shown on Slide 10, was approximately $2.7 billion. As you would expect,
storm costs were a large driver as were lower collections due to COVID-19. Decreased collections for fuel
and purchased power costs and unfavorable weather also affected the metric. Lower unprotected excess
ADIT returned to customers partly offset the decrease.

Our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 11. Our parent debt to total debt
is 21.6% and our FFO to debt is 10.3%. As we mentioned last quarter, our FFO to debt is temporarily
lower in part due to the financial impacts from the storms. We expect the metric to return to target levels
as we receive storm securitization proceeds next year.

As you know, we have strong precedence for storm cost recovery, and we have planned to submit initial
filings over the next few weeks. We'll also pursue off-balance sheet treatment in Louisiana and Texas. We
remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade profile and is supporting credit targets, including
at or above 15% for FFO to debt next year and below 25% for parent debt to total debt.

Moving to Slide 12. With the resiliency we've demonstrated in 2020, we are confident in our continued
success in 2021 and beyond. Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range is $5.80 to $6.10. And our current
plan puts us firmly at the $5.95 midpoint. This and our 2022 and 2023 outlook ranges remain the same as
the outlooks we presented at Analyst Day.

We continue to target a 5% to 7% annual growth rate for adjusting -- for adjusted earnings per share. We
also expect to grow our dividend commensurate with our EPS growth rate starting in the fourth quarter of
this year subject to final Board approval.

On Slide 11 -- excuse me, on Slide 13, I'm going backwards, we've outlined a few of the key drivers
for 2021 earnings growth. We also include more detailed assumptions in the appendix of the webcast
presentation. Beginning with the top line of full year of 2020 rate activity, following significant investments
to benefit customers will contribute to 2021's growth. We will also make annual FRP filings during the year.

We project utility O&M a little under $2.7 billion, in line with our disclosures from Analyst Day.
Depreciation expense is expected to increase, and net interest is expected to decrease due to lower
AFUDC as new plants came online in 2020. We also anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be
higher.

Our guidance and outlooks reflect the December APSC order in Arkansas and assume an FRP extension
in both Arkansas and Louisiana. In Arkansas, we are reprioritizing our O&M and capital investments to
more closely align with the ordered recovery structure. To the extent the order is reversed, we will plan to
readjust our O&M and capital to deliver the customer benefits that those investments would produce.

While we continue to monitor risks, we have already identified flexible spending levers in the event
needed. And we are also exploring permanent upside opportunities through solar investments and further
continuous improvement.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

As Leo mentioned, 2020 was a strong year for our company. We exceeded our $100 million cost reduction
target and delivered on our commitments to each of our 4 key stakeholders in the midst of unprecedented
times. Looking ahead, the fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong.

Our guidance and outlooks remain the same as we presented at Analyst Day and provide clear line of sight
to the 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth rate. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. And
our solid strategic, operational and financial plans will upgrade the service level that we provide to our
customers.

Our proven and disciplined flexible spending program helps us adapt to financial headwinds or tailwinds
so we can meet our financial commitments. And in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect to grow our
dividend commensurate with our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate. We have significant opportunities ahead, and
we are well positioned to be the premier utility.

Before turning the call over to Q&A, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank David Borde for
his great work as Vice President of Investor Relations. He's built solid relationships with all of you, and the
good news is he will not go far. He will work with Rod to help bring our vision of the future utility to life.
And for the next few weeks, he will reach out to many of you to introduce Bill Abler, who is taking over
leadership of the Investor Relations team.

Bill has a strong commercial background in both commodities and utilities, and he will be an excellent
representative for us with you. And as you know, both David and Bill are backed by a very strong team
with disciplined processes, so you should not expect any change in the level of service you will see from us
there.
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Ryan John Karnish
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is actually Ryan on for Jeremy. Just wanted to kind of start off with kind of the order in Arkansas,
and you guys were very clear about reaffirming the guidance and potential offsets with capital and O&M.
I just want to kind of dig a little bit more on kind of what some of those offsets you're thinking about
in Arkansas to kind of offset this potential negative order. And then if you kind of get a positive kind of
outcome on the rehearing, should we be thinking about maybe top end of the range for 2021?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

This is Drew. I'll take that, and then Rod can provide any other framework elements, as needed. But --
so we are adjusting -- as I mentioned in my comments, we are adjusting our O&M and capital to prepare
for or respond to, I guess, the order that we got in December. And you can see that in some of our
capital disclosures. There is some other just normal timing capital elements moving around in some of
the jurisdictions, but the main thing is in Arkansas. That's the primary thing that we are taking action to
adjust with.

In terms of potential upside, as I also said in my remarks, to the extent that we're able to get the order
reversed, we would anticipate putting most, if not all, it depends on what the order would say, back into
our capital plan so that our customers could benefit from the capital and O&M that we are planning to
deploy in Arkansas. So that's what's going on there.

Ryan John Karnish
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Makes sense. And then just -- I mean as a follow-up, any -- obviously, the stock price has kind of
been at depressed levels recently. Just wondering if you could kind of -- any thoughts on what's kind of
required to kind of get the stock moving or kind of reassure market confidence? And then if it kind of stays
at depressed levels, would you think about any type of transaction that maybe sell down some of your
utilities to maybe offset some of the equity needs going forward?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Well, I'll start, and I'll let Drew talk about the last part of that, Ryan. But the best thing we can do is
continue, as we have over the last several years, to continue to execute to meet our commitments to
our customers and to meet our commitments to all of you, which just means being disciplined about our
capital and O&M spend, about where it is and what level it is, continue to improve the level of service that
our customers receive from us; and continue to hit or exceed the numbers that we committed to all of
you, and that's what we intend to do.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

And then I'll just talk about M&A and sales of possible portions of utilities. Certainly, of course, we are
always open to anything that would be value-creating for our stakeholders, which is always our #1 rule in
M&A anyway, is that we would want to make sure that we're creating value for our stakeholders. Our other
considerations are execution and distraction from the things that we are doing to further create value for
our stakeholders already underway.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

And the second one is probably the one that makes it perhaps a little bit challenging for us in the sense of
trying to do that for equity raises because we would likely require approval from regulatory commissions
in order to do any sort of M&A activity at the opcos. And so while we might be able to find good value, if
we were counting on that for an equity raise and we had to go through the regulatory process, that would
create a lot of uncertainty in that equity rate. So it's probably not the best path for us. But certainly, if
there is value-creation opportunity out there, then we would be looking at it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to, I guess, step back and talk about the impact to the system from just really
unprecedented weather impacts that you all noted. As you think about sort of lessons learned from Texas
and just from your other utility businesses, I know you're spending a lot on sort of making your system
more resilient.

But are the lessons learned sort of resulting in potential for further either acceleration of spending or
changes to plans, whether it be generation plans, renewables plans, et cetera? Or is this just sort of
consistent with your overall focus on resiliency in these recent data points just kind of reaffirm sort of the
existing approach that you're taking?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Well, I guess, I'll start out and let the others chime in. But Stephen, certainly, every event that occurs has
unique attributes that allow us to have lessons that we learn. And so whether it's the hurricanes or tropical
storms, Harvey is different than Laura, for example, in terms of what the impact it had on reasonably
similar areas of our service territory. And what we've experienced, obviously, we're still in the process of
getting the lessons learned about the events that we saw last week.

So we always -- I wouldn't say that it's inconsistent with the plans we have for resiliency. But certainly,
every time we go through any kind of event, we will learn something that we will apply to the next events.
So there are things we learned in Katrina that have really served us well for every event that occurred
after that, both in terms of what we do to our system and how our capital shapes up, but also as well as
our processes and our operations and our interactions with the industry, et cetera.

So there will be lessons learned and they will direct our activities potentially differently. I wouldn't say that
it's going to create an incremental capital spend or anything like that, potentially redirection of it. Now it
could provide some incremental capital spend.

If in working with our regulators, they determine -- we jointly determine that there are things that we
need to do more quickly than we otherwise would have done. But I wouldn't say right now that there's
some anticipation of a change in the size of the capital plan going forward because of these events might
be a change in direction for some things just to prioritize differently.

But everything is a learning experience, and we'll continue to do that. And as I said, the events last week,
we're still unpacking everything there.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's helpful. Maybe just one last for me, just on nuclear operations. Just curious, more broadly, how are
you feeling in terms of operational progress, performance, just trends and any recent developments there?
Or is it sort of fairly consistent with prior messaging there?

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

In the majority, it's consistent with where we've been. I would say that we continue to work with Grand
Gulf. We have some work to continue to do there to get that plant into the space where we want it to be,
but majority of it is on track.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. And the Grand Gulf work, is that sort of just general operational improvements? How would
you sort of highlight the work needed there?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

In the equipment reliability space, for the most part. As you know, we've gone through a couple of major
outages with big equipment modifications. The most recent equipment modification, the turbine control
system, we've had some issues coming out of that outage with some of the equipment associated with
that modification. So we're going to continue to work through those -- get those knocked out and get the
plant up to the level of excellence that we desire.

Operator

Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a couple of questions here. Firstly, just on the cost savings. You presented $150 million that was --
$150 million in savings that was obviously executed in 2020. That was well in excess of your original $100
million, right? So just curious to the level of recurring cost savings you think you can take it to '21 and
sort of continue on that momentum.

And can you find sort of incremental opportunities, especially on the corporate side, i.e., we've seen
several peers generate significant cost savings from, for instance, real estate optimization? So wondering
if this is also a potential leverage you guys go through COVID and the learning curves there.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Shar, this is Drew. So most of the savings that we saw in 2020, I would characterize as more onetime
in nature. They're part of our flexible spending efforts. And those are typically looking for ways to take
action to manage to the outcomes in that particular year. And so we would not necessarily see those as
recurring. But this year, we've identified new ones that we would be able to use to manage this year, if
needed.

And we had continued on, last year, after we said that we got to $100 million, looking for more in the
event that we needed it. And it turns out, as you know, that we need all of it.

There -- having said that, there were some things that were identified as potential continuous
improvement elements and sort of fit into those other buckets, although they were relatively small, I
would think, in the 20% range. And those are now accounted for in our outlooks as part of our O&M
expectations.

And there are other things that we are looking at. We are driving our continuous improvement efforts
forward. Things like real estate optimization are in the spotlight for us as we think about how we manage
our workforce of the future. And that's an easy one to consider as we go forward. So those things are part
of what we're looking at, and some of those expectations are now getting baked into our outlooks.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just maybe a timing on when you'll update around that -- on the additional levers?

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think they're just part of our ongoing process. And so we don't have anything today. We don't have
any specific timetable that we're working towards. It's just an ongoing element.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just on Arkansas. It's good that you're confirming or reaffirming that depending on
whatever outlook happens in the FRP order that you're comfortable with the plan, midpoint of guidance,
it's embedded there. It sounds like you're obviously shifting or optimizing CapEx and O&M away from
Arkansas. So I'm kind of curious, what -- have you had any dialogue with the commission around sort of
that strategic move? And I'm wondering where are you redeploying the capital spend.

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

Shar, it's Rod. The conversation, as you know, with the stakeholders is ongoing. And we won't
comment specifically about any aspect of the give and take. But it is known in Arkansas that one of the
consequences of us not having clarity around the FRP and the extension is just that we would have to
revisit how we deploy capital in Arkansas. And those conversations have been ongoing since the December
order, and it's part of the motivation why we're working to various avenues to turn that conversation
around.

But they are aware of our point of view around the capital plan. We're not talking about specific puts and
takes. That said, our point of view that we shared with you earlier about why we thought the FRP provided
us the best opportunity to create sustainable value for customers has played out during the pendency of
the FRP and why we feel so adamant about the propriety of the extension. So I think that message will
resonate.

There's more to come in terms of how it plays out, but that's about all I can speak to it. But you're raising
a great point. We're all motivated to create value.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

And the question about where it's going, at this point, it's not really going anywhere. To the extent that we
are optimistic that we can get some reversal of December order, we are waiting to see if we would want to
put that capital back in place.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. Dave Borde, congrats on sort of the new leadership position. And Rod, make sure you work
them really hard.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

I don't think you have to worry about that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Can you -- sorry if I missed this, but have you quantified in terms of financially what impacts, if any, do
sort of last week's event have for you?

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So this is Drew. So Leo, in his remarks, mentioned some of the cost elements, up to $140 million in
terms of restoration costs and an incremental $400 million in terms of fuel costs. The -- I'll give you a little
bit color. And there will be more specific numbers in the K, which we'll file in a couple of days.

But the -- but on the fuel costs, I think it's -- all in, it's about $500 million. I would say about $100 million
is kind of what we would normally have expected. And that gets you to the $400 million that Leo was
talking about. Of the $500 million, about $200 million of it is in Louisiana, and that is about 90% to 95%
ELL and the rest in New Orleans. About $150 million is in Texas. And these are all round numbers. As I
mentioned, you'll have specific ones later.

There is a positive deferred fuel balance in Texas of about $90 million that will help offset that and then in
the neighborhood of $100 million in Arkansas and around $50 million in Mississippi. So that's kind of how
that would all break down.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. That's super helpful. So it's essentially $400 million increment to what you may have
otherwise expected on a normal basis?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, in February, and I'm talking about the month of February, really.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then just quickly, can you sort of -- so the slide here says the Arkansas FRP
extension first quarter, right? Just can you remind us what the data is of that final order? And then
in terms of -- like what to look for, could that get extended? Just any color around when we may get
resolution on that front?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

Yes. This is Rod. March 15 is the date that the commission has set for itself to issue the order for both the
2021 FRP and the renewal of the FRP extension.

Operator

Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So this was a helpful update. And just the Louisiana FRP extension, I think you've continued settlement
talks there. Could you just maybe give color on your confidence in being able to settle that case?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

Steve, I can -- it's Rod. But I can tell you that the conversations in Louisiana are going perhaps consistent
with our expectations, it slowed only by the -- by certainly the storms and occasionally COVID. But the
types of issues that we've been working through with our stakeholders and the regulators have been
consistent with expectations. We're targeting the resolution of the Louisiana renewal by the end of March.
And that said, we'll be monitoring that progress as we have others. But March is our target to resolve that,
all things being equal.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. And then separate, different question. Just Drew, on your financing plans, is there -- I might
have missed it, but is there any update or changes in your equity issuance plans for the 3-year period?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

No. No new changes from what we described at Analyst Day. We have made some progress. We got the
at-the-market program up and running in January. And then we will have the proxy filing coming up,
where we'll have a request to get the authorization to issue preferred equity. So that should be coming up
soon. But those are the only 2 things that are noteworthy since our last disclosure.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then just on the at-the-market, is there like a time line for that part of the financing you're
targeting? Or...

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

No. There's no time line. We don't have any additional information there.

Operator

Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Mizuho.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I guess, if I heard you correctly, in Arkansas, your guidance is essentially contingent on an FRP extension.
Are you expecting that to come through a negotiation or through a final Arkansas Public Service
Commission rate order?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

The answer, without being sounding trite, is yes. So whatever progress we're able to make to date and
through the 15th, which is only 2.5 to 3 weeks away, will incorporate whatever progress we make.
The assumptions we're making in our guidance and outlook assume the December order and FRP
presumptively with a December order. But it's our confidence and our ability to manage to expectations
with whatever would be the likely or reasonable components of an Arkansas order. And so that's really the
commitment we're making today that our outlooks are tied to those 2 primary assumptions.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Right. But would your guidance hold if the FRP were not renewed?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

If the FRP was not renewed, then we would likely have to see what the circumstances were. Obviously, we
have the ability, if needed to, for instance, file a rate case or take some other remedial action. And so from
a planning standpoint, we're contemplating all of those scenarios. But it's too early for us to know which
levers we'd ultimately pull, but our commitment is to manage to those likely outcomes.

Operator

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

But if I can, let me come back to the planning scenario we talked about a second ago. So you're talking
about cost reductions, CapEx levers and also a series of flow charts, if you will, around what you could do.
Can you elaborate a little bit on all these levers? Like if you were to pursue this out, would you file a rate
case later this year in Arkansas? Or is litigious an appeal strategy the first way to go?

How quickly, when you think about the different scenarios, would you pursue one over another? And how
quickly could we come back with a cost savings program and CapEx program to preserve at least the
integrity of returns, I suppose?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Julien, I appreciate the question. I guess we're in the midst of discussions and these orders, and we're
only a couple of weeks out from resolution. So I think it'd be best for us to just defer commentary around
all of that until we get the outcome since it's pretty prompt.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. Understood. But to be clear about this, it sounds like you've got contingencies already running on
both cost and CapEx levers as it stands today.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

Correct.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then a second quick question, if I can, just probably related. On the subject of bill impacts and how
you think about cumulative bill impacts, how do you think about the total trajectory? Knowing what you
know about storms and otherwise as well as the pace of CapEx and sales trajectory in '21 onwards, are
you anticipating at this point in time across your service territories?

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

So make sure I -- we get to everything that is in there. So you're correct, right, we've made adjustments
to our plan to anticipate what we think is the likely outcomes in the FRP renewals or any regulatory
process going forward. So that is incorporated in the -- in our thinking, and obviously, in our outlooks
based on what we told you today.

And certainly, from a bill impact standpoint, we're obviously going to work through all of these processes,
whether it be the storms from last year or the storms from last week and try to make recovery work for --
keep the company in the right space as it relates to our credit profile and earnings as well as to keep our
customer bills mitigated as much as we possibly can, which is what we've always done.

So the tools that we talked about, whether it be securitization or normal ways that we handle fuel cost
recovery or some of the options that we've taken to those in previous times, all that will be on the table to
where we can make it as minimal an impact on customers as we possibly can while we continue to meet,
for example, our credit and earnings commitments.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

Could we get maybe an update on where you are on arrears? And do you have any incremental bad debt
since you updated last quarter?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Jonathan, this is Drew. So as of the end of the year, we had recorded bad debt expense of $112
million. Our normal bad debt expense in any given year is about $25 million. So -- and that incremental
$87 million was recorded as a regulatory asset because we have orders in each of our jurisdictions that
would allow us to recover those costs.

The arrears is -- typically runs about the higher than the bad debt expense. And so that number is pretty
consistent. We've seen it begin to level off, but we need to see where it goes with this latest round of
storms and a little bit of backtracking on disconnects because of the storms. And we never did get off of
disconnects in Arkansas or New Orleans. So those 2 jurisdictions are -- have continued on for a little bit
longer. But that's kind of where we stand right now.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

So just to be clear I understand that. So the arrears number is more like something in the 300s and...

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

Correct.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And of which you reserved or written off for future recovery, 13 -- 1/2 -- 1/3 roughly.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

That's correct.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then just if I may, on the quarter, and just -- and understanding that the numbers are a little
better on the full year. It looked like you had $0.23 of tax-related benefit for the year, but you were sort
of shooting for $0.15 when you last updated guidance on Q3. And so there would be a sort of $0.08
incremental help versus what you were expecting and maybe another $0.07 or so of P&L. Am I reading
that right? Or is there a better way to think about that?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

No. That's correct. There are some details in the appendix, which talk about those things for 2020 and
show where they are in the fourth quarter. Most of that is in the fourth quarter. It was related to just
annual true-ups that happen to work out in our direction. There was a small item that we found, which is
an opportunity for us, but that's consistent with what we've been doing for a long, long time.

Obviously, the big item we adjusted out, which we committed to you all we would do. And so going
forward, any of those annual true-ups, they might break for us. They might break against us. We have to
manage within that. We do expect to find some small items going forward, but we're not counting on it.

If you look at our tax rate for 2021, it's at 22%. And I think -- we're not disclosing it, but in our plan, we
actually have it drifting back up to around 24%, 24.5% beyond that. We've had it lower for the last few
years, as you know, because we had all the AFUDC from the projects, all -- pretty much all of which went
online in 2020. So that positive tax effect isn't as strong going forward.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

But fair to say that it sort of helped you $0.15 or so in Q4?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

It did. We also weren't planning the $0.16 regulatory provision from the Arkansas order, so it kind of
balanced out.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

For sure. Yes. Got it. And then I may have missed it. I just want to make sure -- I obviously noticed your
CapEx down here for '21, $300-odd million. The best part of it, it's near 9%. Is most of that sort of dialing
back in Arkansas? Or are there some other things going on?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

That is primarily Arkansas. There -- yes, we've taken some capital out of '21 and '22. We put a little bit
back in '23 in Arkansas. There were some other timing elements in some of the other jurisdictions, but the
main impact is Arkansas.

Operator

Our next question comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just real quick follow-up, and I think I know the answer. You reiterated the -- your ranges, I guess,
through 2023 as well as the midpoint. And I think in relation to Steve's question, Drew, it doesn't
sound like your financing plan has changed. Has there been any change, I guess, in the cadence of that
financing? I mean we've looked at it as fairly ratable. But just kind of given where the FFO metrics are,
should we assume that maybe some of that equity is a little bit more front-end loaded or still ratable?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

No. We haven't -- we don't have any additional information to provide on timing other than what we said
previously. We do expect to issue some equity this year and then we have the $2.5 billion by 2024. But
outside of that, we don't have any other timing or amount items that we would disclose right now.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. And the $1 billion ATM that you were mentioning, I think you guys put that in place in December.
That was part of that original financing plan, too, just to clarify?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

That's correct. It's one of the tools that we were putting in place with the other being the authorization
request for preferred equity.

ENTERGY CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 24, 2021

I just wanted to follow up on some of the bad debt items. Can you remind us exactly what in your 2021
earnings guidance is around bad debt assumption and if there's any incremental off of initial assumption
from the events from last week? Appreciate the $400 million of incremental fuel cost number, but curious
if you've adjusted any of your bad debt assumptions on that regard.

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

We have not adjusted our bad debt assumptions for that. Right now, I believe it's probably fairly normal,
around the $25 million amount that I was talking about earlier. Obviously, we'll be monitoring that closely
and seeing where all the COVID arrears actually fall out. We have an estimate, as we were discussing
earlier there, of about 1/3.

Ultimately, we would expect to be able to recover those costs through the regulatory process, but we don't
have exact numbers yet. This is -- that part's a little bit uncharted territory. We'll see where it comes out.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Are there any regulatory approaches or tools that you have or any potential political responses to help
mitigate that potential incremental bad debt expense?

Andrew S. Marsh
Executive VP & CFO

I don't know about regulatory tools. I mean we have the orders that are already in place. We are working
closely with customers to try and mitigate the impact on customers. We've done a number of things to put
new deferred payment plans in place. We've been working hard with our customers. We've renegotiated
thousands of plans with our customers already to try and help them out.

We've invented new ways to get LIHEAP funding to our customers and other community tools that are
available. We've actually worked with some of our retail regulators to do some of that in New Orleans and
other jurisdictions. So there are a number of things we have underway to try to mitigate the impact, and
we are trying to work hard and communicate very closely with our customers to make sure that they know
where we are and with our retail regulators at the same time.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And if I could just squeeze in one last question, in terms of -- what's the regulatory approach to
enable a path forward for Louisiana and some of your other jurisdictions to fuel LDCs with hydrogen in
light of your hydrogen strategies that you highlighted?

Roderick K. West
Group President of Utility Operations

Well, from a regulatory process standpoint, it would be the same process we use to -- with our resource
planning. So whether it's an RFP process, recovery of those -- of the investments we make for those
resources would go through our existing recovery mechanisms.

But to the extent that there are some nuances where the current mechanisms don't account for some
of the really forward-looking aspects of the hydrogen or any new technology, we'll be talking with our
regulators about closing whatever those gaps are. But we have an existing process thus far with the IRP
and the riders and what have you.

Leo P. Denault
Chairman & CEO

And I'll just remind you, Ryan, that the LDCs are a very small piece of our overall business. I think the
rate base is only about $200 million or so overall.
