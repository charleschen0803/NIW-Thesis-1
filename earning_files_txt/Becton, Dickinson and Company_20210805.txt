Operator

Hello, and welcome to BD's Third Fiscal Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At the request of BD, today's call is
being recorded. It will be available for replay through August 12, 2021, on the Investors page of bd.com
website or by phone at (855) 859-2056 for domestic calls and area code (404) 537-3406 for international
calls using the confirmation number 9447085. [Operator Instructions]

Beginning today's call is Ms. Kristen Stewart, Senior Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Ms.
Stewart, you may begin.

Kristen Marie Stewart
Senior Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations

Hi. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via webcast
at bd.com.

This morning, BD released its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. You can find the press release
along with the accompanying presentation on the Investor Relations website at investors.bd.com.

Leading this morning's call is Tom Polen, BD's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; as well as
Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer.

Following the prepared remarks, Tom and Chris will be joined for Q&A by our 3 segment presidents:
Alberto Mas, President of the Medical segment; Simon Campion, President of Interventional segment; and
Dave Hickey, President of the Life Sciences segment.

During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and it is possible actual results could differ
from our expectations. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause such differences can be
found in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10 and subsequent Form 10-
Qs.

We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures regarding our performance. Reconciliations to GAAP
measures that include the details of purchase accounting and other adjustments can be found in our
earnings release and its related financial schedules. There are also in the appendix of the Investor
Relations presentation slides available on the bd.com website.

Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus the relevant period.
Revenue percent changes are on an FX-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. When we refer to the
base revenues, we're referring to our total revenues less our COVID diagnostic testing revenues, which
include COVID-related revenues from Veritor, BD MAX and swabs. When we refer to base margins, we are
adjusting for estimated COVID diagnostic testing profitability and the related profit we have reinvested
back into our business. When we refer to any given period referring to fiscal period, it must be noted as a
calendar period.

Finally, when we refer to NewCo during today's call, we're referring to the planned spinout of our Diabetes
Care business into an independently public traded company following the effective trade date of the spin,
which was announced on the second quarter earnings call. RemainCo refers to BD post separation. As a
reminder, this transaction is subject to market, regulatory and other conditions, including final approval by
BD's Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that will be filed with the
SEC.

With that, I'm very pleased to turn it over to Tom. Tom?

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Thank you, Kristen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide
highlights of the quarter and discuss the continued strong progress we have made on our BD 2025
strategy. I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review and outlook. After our prepared remarks,
Chris and I will then open the call up for Q&A.

But first, I want to comment on the other announcement we made this morning, regarding Chris' intention
to retire from BD and join the Board of our Diabetes spin-off. On behalf of the Board of Directors, the
leadership team and the company, I want to express my gratitude to Chris for his leadership and service
to BD. I'm confident the CFO transition ahead will be seamless, and his leadership and experience will
make him an excellent director for NewCo's Board.

Now let's jump into our results. We were very pleased with our third quarter performance, powered by
strong growth and momentum in our base business across all 3 segments. Revenues totaled $4.9 billion,
and our adjusted EPS was $2.74, both ahead of our expectations. Total revenues were up 26.9% on
a reported basis and up 22% on a currency-neutral basis. Results included COVID diagnostic testing
revenues of $300 million, which contributed 4.8% to growth. Excluding COVID testing revenues, our
base business revenues were up 17.6%, better than we expected across most business units. The
strong growth reflected the anniversary of the initial COVID wave and the temporary halting of elective
procedures and its impact on medical device utilization in the year ago quarter.

But Q3's result also reflects the continued momentum driven by the successful execution of our BD 2025
strategy. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues, base business revenues in Q3 fiscal '21 increased 3.9%
relative to our pre-pandemic third quarter fiscal 2019 on a currency-neutral basis, which includes the
impact of the Alaris ship hold. If you exclude the U.S. infusion systems business, our total revenues would
have increased 6.6% relative to our prepandemic third quarter fiscal 2019.

Our Pharmaceutical Systems and Urology and Critical Care franchises continue to be standout performers,
where revenues are up 17% and 11%, respectively, over 2019 levels. Bioscience revenues were up
9%. Surgery and Peripheral Intervention revenues are both up 8%. Elsewhere, we see opportunities
for improvement ahead in fiscal '22 and beyond. For example, our MDS revenues are up about 2%
versus 2019 levels, reflecting the continued impact of COVID as well as the impact of China volume-
based purchasing. As hospital utilization improves, we should see further improvements here. Also, as
I mentioned, Medication Management Solutions revenues are impacted by the Alaris ship hold, and we
expect our revenues to improve once we receive our 510(k) clearance for our BD Alaris system.

While I'm pleased with how we are accelerating our revenue performance and profile, I'm equally pleased
with the process we're making in improving our working capital and cash flows. Cash flow performance
has been a key focus for us since I became CEO, and that is evident in our working capital metrics. Year-
to-date, cash flows from operations totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 80% from the prior year period.
This improvement in our cash flows allowed us to advance our more balanced capital allocation strategy
this quarter, which included the repurchase of $1 billion in BD stock at an average price of approximately
$242. This marks the first time we have repurchased shares since 2017 and the largest amount we have
repurchased since 2012. Even with this repurchase activity, we ended the third quarter with nearly $3.2
billion in cash and an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.4x.

Overall, I'm really pleased with our performance in the quarter, particularly with the continued positive
momentum in our base business. This gives us the confidence to raise our base revenue assumption. We
now expect our base business to grow approximately 7.5% to 8% on an FX-neutral basis. This is higher
than our previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth. We continue to expect COVID diagnostic testing
revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with more revenues coming from international markets than we
previously anticipated.

We now expect currency-neutral revenue growth overall of approximately 14%. Our positive base business
momentum and a lower tax rate allows us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 while continuing
to reinvest in our business and overcome lower COVID testing profits, including a provision for excess
and obsolete COVID testing inventory. We now expect our full year adjusted EPS range to be $12.85 to
$12.95. Chris will provide you further details on our financial outlook later in the call.

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Next, I want to provide an update on our BD Alaris pump remediation, which remains my #1 priority. Last
week, we announced to our customers a positive step in our remediation efforts. Working with the FDA,
we are now initiating remediation of existing Alaris system devices in the field by updating the software to
version 12.1.2 following submission of the 510(k), which includes this software version. This new software
version is intended to remediate the issues identified in the February 4, 2020, recall notice and provide
programming, operational and cybersecurity updates to affected devices. However, the software update
has not been reviewed or cleared by the FDA.

To address the question on Alaris clearance timing, we remain confident in our submission and the process
we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA. As Chris will later discuss, we believe it is
responsible to not definitively predict the FDA clearance in our FY '22 outlook. We believe this is a prudent
approach given the inherent difficulty in predicting FDA clearance time lines.

Next, I want to update you on our BD 2025 strategy of grow, simplify and empower. First, I'd like to
focus on our growth pillar. We continue to strengthen our market leadership positions in our durable
core business while purposely investing in new innovations that help accelerate and shape irreversible
trends that we see transforming global health now and in the decade ahead. I've spoken about these 3
innovation and growth focuses before. And we've been purposely shifting more of our R&D and tuck-in
M&A investments into these spaces, which are growing over 6%.

Through this, we aim to lift our weighted average market growth rate and performance over time. And this
year, we've launched several innovative products and solutions across the continuum of care, across our
business units and across the globe. And after completing our strategic portfolio review last month, I can
share with you that our pipeline is very deep and wide across our businesses. It's been further enhanced
by our acquisitions over the past 18 months. And you'll hear much more about our innovation pipeline at
our Investor Day on November 12.

But let me highlight a few of our organic innovations that we're advancing in the near term. In our Life
Sciences business, I'm pleased that we will start shipping our BD MAX and BD Veritor combination flu
COVID assays this month, in time for the upcoming respiratory season. Our BD Veritor combination test
can detect and distinguish between COVID, flu A and flu B in a single rapid test with a digital readout. We
see the combination test becoming the standard of care moving forward, advancing our strategy to enable
better outcomes in nonacute settings.

Another innovation area I'd like to highlight is our Biosciences business. Biosciences has been a strong
performer this year, and we expect the unit to deliver high single-digit growth for the full year. In June,
we launched our new e-commerce site, bdbiosciences.com, which is an entirely new and innovative digital
marketplace designed to provide a best-in-class online purchasing experience for our flow cytometry
customers. Early feedback has been outstanding, and we're already seeing excellent traction and early
adoption.

We also have an exciting wave of new product introductions this summer, with the launch of our
FACSymphony A5 SE, which is our first BD spectral analyzer, and provides an even higher cellular
parameter analysis. We've launched our FACSymphony A1 as well, which offers high-end technology and a
cost-effective bench top design.

In addition to these launches, we have a healthy innovation pipeline of modular, scalable new instruments
and next-generation dyes that will allow our customers to fully leverage our complete and integrated
solution suite of instruments, reagents, informatics, single-cell multiomics and scientific support services.
Our products and solutions are being used to uncover new insights on the immune system and develop
treatments for many related chronic diseases. You can hear more about our Life Sciences strategy from
Dave Hickey, our Executive Vice President of BD Life Sciences; and Puneet Sarin, our Worldwide President
of BD Biosciences, at the upcoming UBS Genomics 2.0 and MedTech Innovation Summit on Wednesday,
August 11.

Next, let's turn to our inorganic innovations that we've added to our portfolio. As you know, we continue
to be focused on tuck-in M&A as a means of adding innovative products and solutions that leverage our
core market leadership positions and advance us into higher-growth adjacencies. Year-to-date, we've

6

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

completed 7 tuck-in acquisitions. While at the same -- at the time of the acquisitions, these individual
deals were not meaningful from a revenue perspective. As we integrate these transactions into our
portfolio, we expect them to strengthen our growth profile.

Our 3 most recent transactions, Velano Vascular, Tepha, Inc. and ZebraSci are good examples of our
M&A strategy. Let me begin with Velano Vascular, which is being added to our MDS business. Velano
has an innovative needle-free technology that enables high-quality blood draws from existing peripheral
IV catheter lines, eliminating the need for multiple needle sticks. This technology will help customers
transform the patient experience through the vision of a 1-stick hospital stay. Velano's PIVO device will
be integrated into our sales team's bag of broader catheter solutions initially in the U.S. This is a great
example of how we're expanding and strengthening our base business.

The second transaction is Tepha, Inc., a leading manufacturer of a proprietary resorbable biopolymer
technology. Over the past several years, through our long-standing relationship, we've been
commercializing this platform via our Phasix resorbable hernia mesh platform. The acquisition benefits are
twofold. First, it provides us with a vertical integration strategy for our current Phasix platform. But more
importantly, it provides us with exciting new opportunities to expand our horizon into new high-growth
areas of tissue repair, reconstruction and regeneration.

Lastly, we acquired ZebraSci, a pharmaceutical services company. This acquisition provides the
opportunity to expand our Pharmaceutical Systems business beyond injectable device design and
manufacturing to include best-in-class testing for drug device combination products. ZebraSci allows us
to further engage and collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies and particularly smaller companies,
where a large amount of the pipeline is, to support the transition of their molecules into prefilled
combination devices.

Next, I want to update you on our Simplify initiatives, which are advancing well. Through Project Recode,
we are optimizing our portfolio, optimizing our plant network and simplifying our business processes.
Project Recode remains on track to achieve $300 million of cumulative savings by the end of FY '24.
We are also continuing the rollout of our BD production system, which is a standardized BD approach
to driving the next level of lean processes and continuous improvements across our plants. The BD
production system is already helping to drive improvements in quality and reductions in our inventory
days. We also continue to advance Inspire Quality, our quality, regulatory and risk mitigation program.

The last pillar of our BD 2025 strategy is empower, which represents the changes in our culture and
capabilities that we're driving to empower our strategy. In Q3, we completed our Voice of Associates
survey with over 86% participation. And what stood out was that our associates said we're making strong
progress with improvements in 95% of the metrics since our last survey in 2018. And most notable were
improvements in our focus areas of growth mindset, strong teams, quality and excitement about the
future of BD.

We're also advancing our 2030 sustainability strategy, which addresses a range of challenges in our
industry while helping to make a difference on relevant issues that affect society and the planet. Our
strategy will ensure we remain focused on shared value creation, meaning how we address unmet societal
needs through business models and initiatives that also contribute to the commercial success of BD.

Next, I want to provide a brief update on the progress of our proposed diabetes spin-off, which remains on
track for the first half of calendar 2022. We are making steady progress with our separation activities. We
recently announced that 2 directors from BD's Board will be appointed as future directors of the Diabetes
NewCo. Retired Lieutenant General David Melcher will serve as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.
And Dr. Claire Pomeroy will serve as a director. Their appointments will be effective upon the completion of
the spin, at which point they will transition from the BD Board to the Board of NewCo. Lieutenant General
Melcher brings extensive experience in spin-offs, having served as the CEO of Exelis following its spin-
off from ITT. And under his leadership, Exelis spun off its mission systems business as a separate public
company.

Dr. Pomeroy brings broad experience in health care delivery, administration, medical research and public
health. I'm confident their combined experience, along with future planned board members, will help to

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

set NewCo well on its path to becoming a successful independent publicly traded company focused on
growth.

While continuing to evaluate additional Board members, we are also continuing to build a new Diabetes
Care leadership team through a combination of current BD leaders and new hires, including Dev Kurdikar,
who will be NewCo's CEO; Jake Elguicze, who will be CFO, and most recently, Jeff Mann. Jeff Mann
joined our Diabetes Care organization and will be General Counsel and Head of Corporate Development
for NewCo. Jeff brings more than 2 decades of experience in M&A and transactions, securities law and
corporate governance. Most recently, he served as General Counsel and Secretary of Cantel Medical group.

We are also progressing with the Form 10, which will have the carve-out financials, and we expect it to be
publicly available around the end of the calendar year.

Before turning it over to Chris, I will leave you with some key thoughts. First, our base business
momentum and our recovery from COVID continues, and it is broad-based. We expect that momentum to
carry into fiscal '22 and beyond. As Chris will share with you, today's results underscore our confidence
in strong mid-single-digit top line growth for our base business next year. Second, we are executing well
against our innovation-driven growth strategy, which includes our internal R&D as well as advancing our
tuck-in M&A strategy. And third, I'm proud of the substantial progress in advancing our BD 2025 strategy
and how that will unleash our growth potential in the years to come. We'll deliver innovations for our
customers, empower our associates and create value for you, our shareholders.

I've been with BD for 20 years, and I've never been more excited. We just completed our annual strategic
review process, as I said, and the road ahead is looking more exciting than it did a year ago. We look
forward to sharing our BD 2025 strategy in greater detail at our November 12 Investor Day. We hope you
can join us.

With that, let me turn it over to Chris to review our financials and our outlook.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Thanks, Tom. I'm also very pleased with our overall performance in the quarter, particularly with the base
business, which showed continued strong momentum. Third quarter revenues of $4.9 billion increased
26.9% on a reported basis and 22% on a currency-neutral basis and were ahead of our expectations.
Our current quarter results also include $300 million in COVID diagnostic testing revenues, compared
to $98 million in the prior year period. Excluding COVID diagnostic revenues in both periods, our base
business revenues increased 17.6%. Our base business reflects continued strong performance as the
market continues to recover from the COVID pandemic, the impact from which was most acute in Q3 of
last year.

The BD Medical segment revenues totaled $2.4 billion and were up 7.7% versus the prior year. MDS
revenues increased 24%, reflecting a strong recovery in the U.S., led by strong growth in catheters and
vascular care devices. Additionally, worldwide revenues included $18 million from COVID vaccination
devices. In MMS, the double-digit increase in our dispensing revenues was more than offset by the
expected declines in our infusion solutions.

As you may recall, when the pandemic started, we saw a higher level of demand for infusion pumps and
sets globally. Diabetes Care benefited from an easy comparison to the prior year, the timing of sales and
slightly better-than-expected market demand. Pharm Systems continued to deliver strong growth with
revenues up 12%, driven by demand for our prefilled devices.

BD Life Sciences revenues totaled $1.4 billion and were up 43%. This included the $300 million in COVID
diagnostic testing revenues, $212 million related to our BD Veritor system, with the remaining $88 million
from BD MAX collection, transport and swabs. Year-to-date, COVID diagnostic testing revenues were over
$1.6 billion. Despite lower average selling prices, driven in part by geographic mix, we are still on track to
deliver on our target of total worldwide revenues of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year.

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Excluding COVID diagnostic testing revenues, our Life Sciences segment grew revenues 27%, driven by
strong performances in both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences. IDS revenues increased
49%. Excluding COVID diagnostic testing, IDS revenues increased 27%, driven by strong double-digit
performance across specimen management and microbiology. Biosciences increased 27%, driven by both
research and clinical solutions. We continue to see strong demand for research reagents and instruments
as lab activity is returning to normal levels. We also continue to see steady demand for research reagents
globally, fueled by COVID research activities related to vaccines and variants, especially from academic
research and biopharma companies.

BD Interventional sales totaled nearly $1.1 billion and were up nearly 35%, reflecting the COVID
anniversary impact on elective procedures. Surgery revenues increased 68%, and Peripheral Intervention
increased 32%. Both businesses saw the greatest recovery in the U.S. and Western Europe, which
experienced the greatest impact on elective procedure volumes in the prior year quarter. We saw
sequential improvement in both surgery and peripheral intervention. However, in the last several weeks,
we are seeing some impact from the COVID delta variant on elective surgeries in certain U.S. states.
Urology and Critical Care revenues were up approximately 14%, driven by continued growth in our
PureWick and Targeted Temperature Management franchises.

Now turning to our P&L. As we expected and have communicated, our gross margins this year are being
negatively impacted by COVID-related expenses, manufacturing variances and FX headwinds, which are
more acute in the second half of the year. Also, as expected, our gross margin declined sequentially.
Our gross margin was 51.5%. However, this included a net negative 90 basis point impact from COVID
testing and reinvestments. The 90 basis point impact includes a negative 140 basis point impact from
an inventory provision related to COVID testing. Adjusting for the net impact of COVID testing and
reinvestments, our underlying base business gross margin was 52.4%. On a sequential basis, our base
business gross margin declined from our second quarter rate of 53.7% due to 3 factors: 70 basis points
of incremental FX headwinds; 40 basis points from inflationary pressures, including higher raw material
costs and inbound freight as these costs roll through our inventory; and 20 basis points of other expenses,
including Alaris quality remediation.

Now turning to SSG&A. Our total SSG&A spending increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis to $1.2
billion or 25.2% of revenues. As a reminder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we implemented several
cost-containment measures in response to the COVID pandemic. In addition, we are continuing to see
higher shipping costs. This quarter also included higher expenses related to our COVID profit reinvestment
initiatives. As a reminder, the COVID testing reinvestments we made in FY '21 will not reoccur.

Our R&D spending totaled $321 million, an increase of 31.1% on a currency-neutral basis. The higher
R&D reflects the timing of project spending, including a higher spending related to the BD Innovation and
Growth Fund. Our R&D spending was 6.6% of revenues, which is higher than our long-term target of 6%.

On a currency-neutral basis, our operating income increased 26.5% as compared to our revenue growth
of 22%. Our operating margin of 19.8% was slightly below our guidance of below 20%. The inventory
provision related to COVID testing I referenced earlier negatively impacted operating margins by
approximately 150 basis points.

Interest and other expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $98 million. The adjusted tax rate was
5.8%, lower than we previously expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter. The lower
tax rate essentially offsets the impact from the COVID diagnostic inventory provision in the quarter.

The average diluted share count used to calculate our EPS in the quarter was 291.9 million. We
repurchased a total of 4.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion at an average price of approximately
$242. Our adjusted EPS increased 24.5% over the prior year to $2.74 on a reported basis and were up
25.9% on a currency-neutral basis.

Now I'd like to turn to guidance for the balance of the fiscal year. Our guidance continues to assume no
major widespread hospital restrictions on elective procedures related to the COVID pandemic. However,
we did start to see some impact on elective procedures from the COVID delta variant in the last 1 to 2
weeks in certain U.S. states and have assumed some continuation of this in our guidance. That said, given

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

the continued positive momentum of the base business, we are pleased to be able to cover this and still
raise our currency-neutral revenue growth to about 14%, up from our previous range of 10% to 12%. Our
revised revenue range would incorporate a base business currency-neutral growth assumption of 7.5% to
8%.

Further, we reaffirm our previously communicated COVID diagnostic test revenue range of $1.8 billion to
$1.9 billion. We now expect a favorable 250 to 300 basis point impact from currency. This brings our total
reported revenue growth to approximately 16.5% to 17.5%. For the full year, we now expect our fiscal
2021 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $12.85 to $12.95. This higher guidance reflects the positive base
business momentum and a lower tax rate. These benefits allow us to continue to invest while offsetting
the COVID testing inventory provision and lower COVID selling prices.

Next, I want to share with you our expectations for gross operating margins for full year fiscal '21 and
provide you with an estimate of the net impact of COVID testing and the related reinvestments of profits
on our margins. We expect our full year adjusted gross margins to be in the range of 53.5% to 54%, and
this range includes a net neutral to slight positive impact from COVID testing reinvestments. We expect
our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. This range includes a 200
basis point contribution from the net impact of COVID testing and reinvestments.

Finally, I'd like to address FY '22. We plan to provide our specific fiscal 2022 guidance on our November
earnings call, but we wanted to provide some directional color today. To give you a sense as to what a
floor could look like in fiscal '22, we have taken the following approach: As you know, there is a great
deal of uncertainty around the level of COVID testing. Therefore, we have not modeled any testing
revenue beyond the typical flu season. With the continued momentum we are seeing, we have increased
confidence in our ability to deliver strong mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal '22 over our fiscal '21
base revenues, which, as a reminder, adjusts for COVID diagnostic testing revenues.

With respect to Alaris, our filing is comprehensive and more complex than most submissions. As we
have previously stated, it is possible that the review could be in line with past pump time lines. However,
as we have also mentioned, it was more likely to take longer for the FDA to review and ultimately
grant clearance. It is inherently difficult to predict clearance timing. We are not assuming Alaris 510(k)
clearance. It is difficult to predict how things will play out as shipments are only being made under the
medical necessity process. At this time, we have incorporated the assumption that revenues associated
with Alaris will be approximately similar to FY '21. We believe it is prudent and responsible not to
definitively predict FDA clearance time lines. That said, we remain confident in our submission and the
process we are undertaking, including working closely with the FDA to obtain comprehensive 510(k)
clearance.

We expect to drive base business gross and operating margin expansion. We expect the operating margins
for our base business to expand more than our traditional annual target of at least 50 basis points and
translate into double-digit operating income growth. For reference, we expect our base business operating
margins to be between 21.5% to 22% in fiscal 2021. With these assumptions, we expect an adjusted EPS
floor of at least $12. This represents approximately low teens growth over our expected base business
earnings in fiscal 2021.

Now before opening it up for Q&A, I want to take a moment to comment on today's announcement of my
upcoming retirement. With our strong base business momentum, our strengthened balance sheet and
improved cash flows, which is evident by the increased number of tuck-in acquisitions that we've been
doing and the restart of our share buyback program for the first time since 2017, I feel that now is the
right time for the transition as the company is well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value and
impact the lives of patients around the world. I look forward to helping to ensure a seamless transition to
the new CFO. And I'm very excited about the value-creating opportunities ahead for NewCo and helping to
ensure this success as a member of their Board.

With that, let me turn it back to Tom.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. Can you hear me okay?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

We can, Bob.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great, great. Chris, congratulations on your decision.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Thank you very much.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes, absolutely. So I guess the first question I would have -- and thank you for all the detail today and the
early thoughts on '22. So it looks like you're suggesting operating margins in next year might be in the
22% to 23% kind of range. That's still multiple hundreds of basis points below where you were in fiscal
'19. So can you just help us understand the difference between 2019 and this new guidance for 2022 and
why you're those couple of hundred basis points below that level?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure. I'll let Chris respond to it.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sure, Bob. Thank you. Thank you for your comments, too. Yes, we -- as we think about margins, we
do see the opportunity to get back to those 2019 margins over time. And we'll see that as Alaris comes
back into the market and as Recode and our normal continuous improvement occur, and we'll see that
improvement. Also, as we grow mid-single digits and we provide leverage that drops to the bottom line,
and that will also increase.

There's a number of things that have pushed those margins down. We've talked about those in the past.
You have Alaris. The ship hold, obviously, is an impact, but that will come back. We also have the drop
in the China volume-based procurement is an impact. And obviously, we're seeing some pressure from
inflation, et cetera, that have run through. So they have come down, but the model is intact, and we're
very confident that we can drive those margins back to the '19 levels in the next -- in the near term as
Alaris comes back and as we get the continuous improvement from Recode.

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Okay. So just to make sure I'm hearing it, so the primary difference between those 2 as you guys see it
is really those 3 things: Alaris, the China price cut and then inflation? Just want to make sure we have a
sense for all the moving pieces because I think it's...

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes, that's it.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes, okay. That's it. Okay. And then in terms of the time line to get back to those levels, is that something
that's a multiyear process? Or do you think that, that can happen within a year or 2? And then I'll get back
in queue. .

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. So a couple of things will help us improve. And the other thing that I should mention is there is some
FX drag on margins as well, and that's been flowing through. But as we think about improvements going
forward, we'll see improvements from utilization as utilization comes back. And so that will help. We'll also,
comparatively to the margins that we have this year, we'll see continuous improvement, Recode kicking
in. We'll see less onetime items. We took a number of onetime items this year, the spending in the Veritor
proceeds, et cetera. So those come back.

So you would expect to see us getting back to those kind of margins as Alaris kicks in, in '23, and we see
that impact and as we make continuous improvement in '22 and '23.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Chris, all the best to you. Tom, maybe starting with the margins back on Bob's question. It's -- one way of
looking at it as your prepandemic gross margins were 56%. I think your base for the fiscal '21 is 53.5%
to 54%. Walk through the delta about 70 bps seems to be inflationary costs, 70 bps FX, you do have this
inventory charges related to COVID diagnostics and Alaris, 4 moving parts. I guess my question is, when
do inflationary cost abate? Do we have to annualize -- is that mid of next year? Should FX still be a drag
next year? And when you think about COVID, inventory charges, are we done with that in Q4? Or is that
going to be a drag in fiscal '22?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

Vijay, let me -- I'll take a little bit of that question and, again, let Chris comment further on the margin
details. When it comes to just the inflationary question that you had, certainly, I think we felt the most
significant impact of inflation already. And we have a good view of where that's going to be in '22 as
we rolled up our costs. As you know, it's been an unprecedented period of time there as you look at
everything from the cost of resins to electronic components and shipping. Shipping is up 4x to move
products, let's say, from Asia or Europe to the U.S. or vice versa.

So we are also being very proactive in -- we're not looking to absorb all of those increases in raw
material costs over time. We are beginning to pass on some of those. We've raised our shipping rates
for customers, and we are passing on price increases. Of course, as you know, we do have long-term
contracts and tenders around the world. And so that's not something that we can pass through those price
increases immediately. But we do have a very active program to share those increases. We have to share
those increases with customers. That will not happen, though, overnight. So I'll just share that, that will

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

also be something that will have an impact as we look forward. We're not going to absorb all of those raw
material costs just within BD. Chris, other comments on margins?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sure. Yes. I think it would be helpful to look at the flow from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We
do expect margins to improve. I think we said that our margins would be 53% to 53.5%. That's up a
full point from the Q3 margins. And that's coming from improved utilization combined with some of our
continuous improvement efforts. We'll also have less onetime airfreight that we saw in the back half of
'21, and we'll have some pricing actions as well. We do expect it to improve operating margins more than
the normal 50 basis points relative to that 21% to 22%. And that again comes from utilization. As that
improves next year, there's less impact from FX. We have seen FX flowing through our inventory. And so
you'll see that abate going forward.

And then we see our continuous improvement items offsetting any continued flow-through of inflationary
pricing. When we look at the impact on our raw materials, resins, as you know, is a big piece of that.
Resins is a combination of some inflationary pressure, but it's also a function of other things, supply
and demand in the oil market. And we took a big hit on that in '21. And we would expect that to abate
somewhat, and that's something that we're watching very closely as we think about giving guidance in
'22.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got you. And maybe, Tom, one on the Q4 revenue guidance and some of the comments you made on
reinvestments. The Q4 -- it looks like at 3Q your base grew 4% or prepandemic 3Q '19 levels. Q4, I'm
not sure if I'm doing the math correct, but I'm getting to a 2% and a slight decel versus 3Q. Is that just
conservatism? And related to the reinvestments that you're making, should we expect any new products
flow through in fiscal '22?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. It was a little bit difficult to hear what you said there, Vijay, on the Q4 topic. I'll let Chris comment
on that. As we've said in the past, we do expect that -- and we'll share a lot more about this our Investor
Day in November, which we obviously hope to see you there, is we expect the impact of our investments
of the COVID profit reinvestments to begin having an impact in the back half of next -- towards the tail
end of next year. And we'll talk about what those specific programs are. Some are -- were short-term
R&D life cycle management programs that we'll be hitting, but also include non-R&D initiatives such as
reinvestments we made to establish new, for example, telesales organization in Europe. That's helping us
access smaller hospitals that we weren't calling in before and we're getting new growth from.

Or expanding our non-acute sales channel in the U.S., we use some of those investments to accelerate
investments there, tapping into a high-growth market as the nonacute space is now growing much faster
than the acute care market, where we've had our traditional sales strength in. And so obviously, those
commercial investments have near-term payoffs. And we expect actually the investments that we're
making on the commercial side this year to be fully funding -- self-funding next year. So they're quick
paybacks, and we'll see those benefits, as we've said, that strong mid-single-digit profile in our base
business next year.

On your other question, let me turn that over to Chris.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. So Vijay, I would just remind you that going back in history, if you look at the Q4 of FY '19, that's a
tough compare. That was the biggest MMS quarter for a number of reasons. And so that's what you're
seeing as you're doing your calculation.

Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'll hand my congratulations. Chris, I will be sorry to see you go.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Appreciate it.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I wanted to focus on the fourth quarter margin guide and
the floor of $12 for next year. It's been probably, if I go back a decade plus since you last had operating
margins as low as you're guiding for fourth quarter. And even to get to a floor of $12 versus where you are
in that fourth quarter margin is pretty tough to do. So I was hoping you could really -- as best as you can
walk through the building blocks of why the fourth quarter margin is so low, especially after you said last
quarter it'd be in the low 20s for the back half of this year. It looks more like high teens. And then some of
the building blocks you used to get to a floor of $12. And on top of that, how you're thinking about what a
floor means in relation to where numbers might settle at?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

Robbie, this is Tom. So on the -- let me take the -- I'll let Chris address the Q4 question that you had.
On the $12 floor, I think Chris walked through very clearly how we built up to the $12 floor there. And
essentially, that takes out all COVID -- stand-alone COVID diagnostics. So all of that comes out. Any
stand-alone COVID testing that we were to have would be incremental to the $12. And you know how
much that is this year. Again, it's very difficult to predict what type of COVID testing is going to occur next
year. And so we thought it's most prudent to focus on projecting our base business. We do have some
Veritor flu sales and flu/COVID combination, which is really a next-generation flu test built-in, but much
more aligned to what you would see in a normal flu season rather than increased demand from testing for
COVID patients. And as I said, we have no COVID stand-alone revenue in. So that's how we've built in our
$12 floor.

As Chris also mentioned, we don't have Alaris 510(k) assumed at all. We do believe that, just given
inherent ability to predict FDA approval timing is not prudent to to try to peg when that would be. And so
we do not have anything beyond Alaris revenues being flat year-on-year, which, as a reminder, we said it
was a little over $100 million in FY '21. And so we have that flat going into '22, obviously. So that's that.

Those are the main factors. Chris went through a number of others. We can circle back on any other
questions you have there, but let's go back on your Q4 question. I'll turn it over to Chris.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sure. Thanks, Tom. And what I would remind you, Robbie, is that we have pointed to the fact that we're
making investments this year and not to really look at the second half margins, we said they were going
to be lower. We said not to use those as an indicative base to jump off for '22, which is what we're saying
today.

The Q4 margins are pressured by an additional amount of COVID reinvestment, so we made that
reinvestment announcement earlier. It takes a while. It tends to be back-end-loaded. So there's a
preponderance of reinvestment there in the quarter. We continue to see some drag from FX in the quarter,

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

although less than the third quarter. We also expect to see the impact of inflationary costs running through
the -- through our inventory. And we see that coming through in the fourth quarter as well.

So when you sum all of that up, we talk about the baseline of 21.5% to 22% as the jumping off point. We
said that it was more than our 50 basis point target going forward. And that -- how much more is where
you have to plug it in to get to the $12 number that we gave as a floor.

And I think Tom articulated what that $12 floor was meant to be. It doesn't have any testing assumption
for COVID in it, although we would assume some water level of stand-alone testing. It also assumes the
testing for flu and COVID combination, which is equal to a normal flu season. That's still pretty early to
call that, and that's something that we'll give more clarity on as we get into November. So it is just that,
a baseline. We wanted to make sure people understood that we can grow more than normal off of '21 and
get to at least that $12 level and to close out anything lower than that. And then we'll build from there as
we give more specific guidance in November.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And maybe just one quick follow-up. The tax rate came in a little lower this year. What do you think
we should be thinking as we head into next year?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I think you flow that through for this year. And then for next year, we should be -- we've traditionally
guided 14% to 16%. I think you should consider that being at the low end of that range.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Chris, congratulations on your decision.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Thanks.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

A couple of questions on the margin. So when we look at the 20% to 20.5% base for Q4, what's the ramp
through fiscal 2022 look like? On the last call, you said it would kind of ramp through the year.

And Chris, just a multipart question on the margin, so I apologize in advance. You had guidance of 25%
to 26% post-Alaris, post-China VBP. So the difference here mostly inflation. You talked about the moving
parts. And the $200 million reinvestment, that alone you said would come up. That's 100 basis points. So
just lastly here, any other headwinds, tailwinds to consider that margin commentary?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Okay. So there are multiple parts to that. I'm not sure I got them all. So let's start with -- I would say
from the phasing. Let's talk about the phasing. I think it's still too early to tell. We can't give that kind of
specificity for November. I would say one of the things that I did mention was utilization. I do think that
builds throughout the year, but that's as much clarity as I would give to that. What's the second part of
the question?

BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Well, just on the -- people have looked at this closely. Post-Alaris recall, the China VBP, you gave guidance
of 25% to 26% for the operating margin. So is the difference really here mostly inflation? And just lastly,
the $200 million reinvestment in 2021, that goes away next year. That alone is 100 basis points.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

That does come back from that baseline, and that's in the assumptions that get us to more than the
normal 50 basis points. So that does go away, and it does come back in margins. The difference between
the -- whether it's 56-ish on gross margin or 25% to 26% on operating margin is not really inflation. It's
more around the China VoBP, Alaris and some FX impacts that on -- the combination of those bring you
down in the area of about 150 basis points on a gross margin basis, for example.

If you take a step back, we're pulling all the levers that are necessary to drive that up. So the base
business is doing well. That's a great foundation. We're reinvesting the Veritor proceeds that drive revenue
growth going forward, but also to drive Recode and help there. We've got a balanced allocation strategy.
You saw us buying back shares that will help on the bottom line. We're divesting nonstrategic businesses
that will help with the growth profile going forward. So all of those things give us great confidence that
we'll get back to those kind of margins in the near future as we take those steps. And we're headed in the
right direction.

And the fundamental assumption of mid-single-digit growth on the top and double-digit TSR in the bottom
implies a certain amount of leverage that we feel very comfortable with. We feel good with that operating
model. It's intact. And that will drive margins up over time.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.

Richard S. Newitter
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

And that last one was really the question I was looking to ask. But just -- if you could just go through
those parts a little bit more clearly. So you've got China VBP. You have inflation. You have Alaris. I mean
FX is the bad guys, but then you have reinvestment going away as the good guy. Could you just add those
up again for us one more time just to make sure I'm clear on what the pluses and the minuses are? I think
that would be helpful.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Okay. I think you did a good job of it. That is the summary. You have exactly those parts, and that is the
headwind. The Alaris headwind is something that should come back to us in 2023 over time. And I think
you've got the parts.

Richard S. Newitter
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then going back to -- I think it was Robbie's question. Maybe just putting a little bit more
of a framework about how to think about what a floor truly means. And any kind of broad strokes how
to thinking about what testing could look like based on everything that you know today and what a
reasonable base case might look like based on what you know today?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. So I would refer you back to the prepared remarks because I think we were very clear as to what's
included in that $12 and what is not included. The ability to estimate what testing is going to be next
year is very volatile. Frankly, if you asked me 2 weeks ago, it would have been a different answer than

it is today with the delta variant, and it will be very different in November. So when we give November
guidance, we'll give you a better sense of that. But the floor is exactly what it is. It's no testing other than
a normal flu season and nothing in for Alaris. And that's all I'll say about that.

Richard S. Newitter
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Okay. And good luck, Chris. Congratulations.

Your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Barclays.

Travis Lee Steed
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congrats, Chris, again from -- and on the -- the calculus for the mid-single-digit revenue growth and the
double-digit shareholder return. When you think about that, is there a minimum operating margin that
you're committed to longer term with that calculus?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I think it's really an improvement in the margin year in, year out, and that's been the model. And we're
very confident that we can return to that and to drive those margins back up to the '19 levels and beyond
as we move forward.

Travis Lee Steed
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then do you expect Alaris to be accretive right away to operating margin? Or is there going
to be a period where it takes a bit longer to get accretive? And then on the COVID testing margins, you
mentioned a lower price point, OUS. Is there a big difference in margins on COVID testing U.S. and OUS?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. So you want to?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

I'll just take that. On the ex U.S., one of the main differences is, as we had shared in the past, we did
launch a manual test ex U.S., particularly in Europe. We don't sell that in the U.S., and that is at a lower
price competitive with manually read lateral flow test. So that's one. There's a product mix difference. And
there is a slightly lower price even on the base of Veritor in some cases, given the way that those products
are purchased in very large quantities on government, country-based tenders. So therefore, it gets a little
bit better pricing, given the scale of the purchasing. So that's the main thing there on Veritor as we think
about the mix.

Again, we're really pleased that we're right in the revenue range that we project. We're actually ahead of
what we projected at the beginning of the year. And then have continued to be in that $1.8 billion to $1.9
billion outlook for the full year there. Obviously, on your other question, Travis was...

On the operating margin difference?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

The operating margin difference, yes. Chris?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

The operating margin from -- oh, when it comes back. Okay, yes. And the only thing I would say is you're
-- you should be thinking about, when Alaris comes back, that the -- it takes a while for the sales to ramp.
And that's all I would say on that.

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

And we have said before, Travis, as well, we do have -- we very purposely kept a number of expenses
on the P&L that stay at the GP line that as Alaris does -- is 510(k) approved, those expenses will not
get absorbed by the higher revenue as soon as the higher revenue starts to come through. So those
expenses that stay in the GP line, for example, are a very large service organization that we know we
need. It's extremely experienced, strong team, deep relationships with our customers. And we've kept
those expenses in place because we want that team in place to continue to service our customers and as
we ultimately get the 510(k) approved and back fully to market.

Same thing on our commercial side, right? We've kept our -- while the revenue has gone down, we've
kept that commercial team in place. We have many, many people with decade-plus experience and long
relationships with our customers who have great expertise in that -- not only that space, but overall
medication management. And so we want to keep that expertise in place as we think about it long term.
So those expenses, of course, as revenue ramps, we don't see the need to add those service or sales
investments because we've actually kept them in place similar to what we had when it was a much higher
revenue number.

Your next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Not to throw another moving piece at you, but I'm assuming that the floor doesn't include the diabetes
spend. Do you have a better sense of what dilution is from that and impact to operating margin on a pro
forma basis?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

So I'll take that. The floor does not contemplate that. As we complete the spin and as we get closer to
the spin, we'll make adjustments to any kind of outlook or guidance that we have. So the $12 relates to
BDX as a whole. And as it relates to dilution, what we have said is that the dilution of RemainCo would be
primarily stranded cost. We'll have transition service agreements in place, and we'll have some time to
offset any potential dilution that we have during that transition services period of time. And more to come
on that as we get closer to the spin date.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then -- excellent. And then what's a little bit tough about the guidance for next year, is that --
I think everyone assumes there will be some COVID testing. So there will be upside from that. But the flu
season is also probably a little bit lower than what's normal. What is the normal flu season for you as far
as like revenue goes so we can kind of adjust that delta?

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Matt, the first thing I would do is just correct your statement that we didn't give guidance for '22. So using
the term guidance is inaccurate. We just gave you a floor and a way to think about it. And so I just want
to make sure that that's clear.

And what we said was a normal flu season, and we have talked about in the past that, that normal flu
season is in the range of $80 million to $100 million. And it remains unclear as to what type of flu season
-- flu/COVID season we have. Last year, the flu season was basically nonexistent. So that's why we
outlined that assumption as clearly as we did.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. My apologies, and it seems like, yes, that COVID testing, the upside would be greater than
downside from flu at that point. Is that correct?

Christopher R. Reidy

I'm not sure what you just said there, but I think the -- would there be some COVID testing stand-alone?
That's something we'll give insights going forward in November.

Just a reminder, Matthew, we do have a COVID/flu combination test, rapid test, right, which we -- that's in
that flu category as well. So we do think even if there's a lighter flu season, the availability of symptoms,
we'll be testing for combination as well. We do expect there will be some continued testing of COVID only
as well, but the ability to predict that number right now, again, we're not giving guidance. We just shared
a floor number. The ability to predict how much stand-alone COVID testing is going to happen next year is
not something one should do. Thanks for your question.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Congrats, Chris, you'll be missed.

Christopher R. Reidy
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Thanks.

I think we've got margins back. So I'm going to ask a couple of growth questions. So the first one is I
wanted to ask you about your assumptions for disruption. I know there are some states that are seeing
that in elective procedures now. Would you characterize the build into your guidance is relatively minor?
Any framing that you can do for us in terms of how much disruption you think we could see here in the
coming months?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. This is Tom. I appreciate the question there. So I can give a little bit of color on what we're seeing
overall, both in just general utilization, and then I'll talk about what we're seeing more recently in just the

last 1 or 2 weeks. So as I think most folks are aware, we have one of our informatics platforms is called
MedMined, which is a software that allows us to see real-time admission data, utilization data, test data,
outbreak data, resistance data, literally real-time at hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.

And so some of the details that we see generally are, over Q3, we saw about 91% to 92% utilization
versus pre COVID, about 92% exit in June. And that was a sequential improvement from Q2 average,
which was in the 80s. And we expect to see further sequential improvement as we think about Q4 overall.
In the nonacute sector, it was already -- we saw 105% utilization versus pre-COVID in May, June and
sequential improvements from Q2, which was in the 95% range. As we think about the impact of -- in
Europe, by the way, the data we look at show the bed utilization versus pre-COVID utilization overall
versus pre-COVID was estimated around 92%, exited the quarter around 93%, which was sequentially up
from Q2, which was about 86%.

So as we think about the impact of COVID delta variant in the last 1 or 2 weeks, we've seen it really --
as was expected, I think, when there would be outbreaks, that you'd start seeing them in concentrated
geographic pockets. And that's certainly what you're seeing with the delta variant. The last number I had
was there were 16 meaningful U.S. health care systems that had stopped or significantly reduced elective
procedures. And many of those -- of the largest ones of those U.S. systems that have done that, that was
as of last week, that was the number I had was 16. They were down in Florida, Louisiana. A lot number of
those were in the South.

So it's -- we're seeing it in those areas, but not -- certainly not across the country broadly, and we're not
seeing really any significant change globally. Certainly, there's pockets where that's happening. But for
example, in Europe, which is a major market for us, we're not seeing a change there.

We have built in some continuation of that back into our guidance. And so if it doesn't continue at that
level, that could be an opportunity. But again, being prudent, as I think we've been all year long, we took
an approach that said, look, if the delta were to continue and there were to be some impact on procedural
volumes, we would be absorbing that within our guidance. It would have to be a significant change versus
what's being seen there.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. I just had one quick follow-up. You did a bunch of tuck-ins. So I was wondering if you could
quantify the contribution we could expect from those as you purchase that or going forward?

Thomas E. Polen
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, we see that as built into our outlook, Matt. And when we talk about the strong mid-single-digit
performance next year and continuing to help fuel our mid-single-digit growth profile, none of those
acquisitions have any meaningful impact in Q3. Many of them closed actually either at the very end of Q3
or even more recently in Q4. So not an impact in Q3 and part of our growth equation as we look going
forward.

But as you said, we're excited about the tuck-ins we're doing. It's a combination of both strengthening our
base business, like what you see in Velano, offering a really unique innovation into an already extremely
strong portfolio and that we have, to areas that are entering us into new spaces like what you saw with
Tepha or the ZebraSci, which both enters us into new spaces, but connects us deeply with an important
customer segment, small biopharma, providing them services that ZebraSci is the leader in providing,
the combination drug device testing services allows us to build those relationships further. And as you
know, many of the new drugs coming into the pipelines are in that small biotech segment that we think is
attractive to invest behind. Thanks for your question.

Operator

At this time, we have reached our allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to
Tom Polen for closing remarks.

Thank you, operator. Before we sign off and on behalf of the Board and the entire executive team, I want
to thank BD's 70,000 associates around the globe. This past quarter, I had a special opportunity to travel

been working tirelessly to produce essential medical devices, some that are being used for the pandemic
response. And I'd like to say a special thanks to them and all of our manufacturing associates around the
globe. They are the essential part of our frontline team and make me proud to BD. So I thank you directly
on behalf of the entire organization.

For all of you listening, I hope everyone stays safe and healthy, and thank you for joining in. Hope you
