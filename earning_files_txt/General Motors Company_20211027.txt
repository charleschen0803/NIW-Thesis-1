Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to General Motors Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, October 27, 2021. I would now
like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.

Rocky Gupta
VP & Treasurer

Thanks, Tammy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the
third quarter of 2021. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on the GM
Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined today by Mary Barra,
GM's Chairman and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's CFO; and Dan Berce, President of GM Financial.

Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page
of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to
Mary Barra.

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Rocky, and hello, everyone. It's great to have an opportunity to talk with you all again today.
Before Paul and I discuss our third quarter results, I want to thank all of you who participated in person or
remotely in our recent Investor Day.

Our team really appreciated the opportunity to deep dive our growth strategy and to hear your
perspectives. After spending time with our leaders and subject matter experts, I hope it's clear to you
that we have assembled the right technology to have the right platforms, and we have the right talent to
achieve our long-term goals, including doubling our annual revenue and expanding our margins.

Our confidence comes from the fact that we are already making significant progress in transforming
GM from a traditional automaker to really a platform innovator. You can see it in the conversion of the
Orion Assembly and Factory ZERO plants as they've gone from building gas-powered cars to EVs, the
construction of our Ultium Cell JV plant, the rapid expansion of Super Cruise, the development of Level 2
plus autonomy with Ultra Cruise, the lead Cruise has in Level 4 autonomous driving, and our portfolio of
20 start-up businesses.

You can also experience it in the software and services that will enhance our customers' lives and drive
growth. And you can see it in our talent and expertise. This includes the new digital business team that we
formed to establish digital market leadership for GM and our expanded Board of Directors who have deep
experience in IT, e-commerce, software development, venture capital, cybersecurity and more.

As one of you observed, the real magic happens in our vehicles at the intersection of the Ultium and Ultifi
platforms. Ultium enables us to efficiently deliver the industry's broadest portfolio of EVs, including a
diverse portfolio of truck entries. And the beauty of Ultifi is the way it will allow us to deploy new software
and services rapidly and securely across our entire fleet. This includes Super Cruise upgrades and services
we'll create in the future.

And seeing is believing. I have to tell you, I will never forget the overwhelmingly positive reaction that
people had after they experienced Super Cruise or had an opportunity to ride in the GMC HUMMER EV
and experienced Watts to Freedom for the very first time. The same can be said for the Cadillac LYRIQ
that we'll begin delivering to customers next spring. They were spoken for in just about 10 minutes after
we opened the reservation site, so I think that starts to show the strong demand that we will see for the
LYRIQ.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Our next EV reveal will be the Chevrolet Silverado EV, and I can tell you the truck is amazing. Our dealers
love it, and so you won't want to miss it when we take the cover off at CES in early January. It will evoke
passion and enthusiasm through great design and engineering, and we believe it will drive mass adoption
of electric vehicles, specifically trucks. And I promise you that the capabilities of Ultium and Ultifi will be
just as evident in mass market vehicles like the $30,000 Chevrolet EV crossover, which we showed. And as
Mark shared, we're also working on another EV that's even more affordable than that.

So to be clear, we will also continue to improve the successful ICE vehicles that are funding our future, and
we'll do that while improving them to reduce emissions and also offer new technologies. Our plan provides
resources to [ main ] leadership in key segments like trucks and SUVs during and after the transition
to electric vehicles. And although it's only been about 3 weeks since Investor Day, the strategies and
initiatives we talked about have advanced even further.

Let's talk first about our work to build a strong and secure battery supply chain in North America. We've
established and announced 4 major supply chain initiatives recently, and we expect to add more soon to
support our growth, our performance and our cost reduction plans. And our goal is to eliminate supply
chain risk that -- and control our own destiny as we rapidly scale our EV volume.

A common thread that runs through these and our recent announcement is a clear commitment to U.S.
leadership in EVs. For example, we will add 2 more battery plants in the U.S. by mid-decade. We also
have plans to build EV motors and another EV truck facility here in the U.S. We look forward to sharing the
details very soon, but keep in mind this is just the beginning.

As Gerald said at Investor Day, we forecast that North American EV assembly capacity will reach 20%
by 2025 and climb to 50% by 2030. We're also bringing Ultium to China, starting with the LYRIQ, which
is launching in early 2022. And GM China also recently announced it's doubling the size of its Advanced
Design Center to support EV development.

Cruise is the second opportunity that I want to highlight. As you know, we have always gated the progress
of Cruise by safety. As we speak, Cruise is just 1 state-level approval away from full regulatory approval to
charge customers for rides in San Francisco. And it is still the only company with a permit to provide full
driverless ride-hail service in the city.

As Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said, the complementary skills of GM and Cruise have brought it to the
cusp of commercialization. This includes the launch of the Cruise Origin that will be produced at Factory
ZERO, and we have already built dozens of engineering development vehicles like the ones you saw during
Investor Day.

All of this is why joining Cruise is so high among experts in artificial intelligence, machine learning and
robotics, and why Cruise is hosting another series of virtual recruiting events called Under the Hood on
November 4. If you'd like to participate, please contact GM Investor Relations.

Now let's turn to earnings. As we have shared before, we are taking advantage of GM's strong cash flow to
fund our investments in growth. Our third quarter results, which while reflecting the near-term challenges
of the global semiconductor supply chain issues, clearly shows the strength of our underlying business.

We reported EBIT-adjusted of $2.9 billion, which includes another strong performance by GM Financial and
our joint ventures in China as well as a recall cost settlement with LG. LG has been and continues to be a
very valued and respected partner, and we are working closely with them to deliver replacement battery
modules for our customers. In fact, we began scheduling and completing repairs this month.

While the semiconductor situation improves, I believe our full year performance will be strong from an
earnings perspective and far ahead of where we expected to be at the beginning of the year. And most
importantly, as we manage this dynamic environment, our clear focus is on transforming GM.

Now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul, who will share more about the quarter and our outlook.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. We outlined
our long-term strategy earlier this month, including the opportunity to double our revenues and expand
margins by 2030. We believe that the strength of our underlying business today is a crucial element to
delivering on that growth, and I'm proud of the execution by our team during the quarter in the face of
continued challenges.

So let's get into the results of the quarter in more detail. In Q3, we generated $26.8 billion in net revenue,
$2.9 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 10.9% EBIT-adjusted margin and $1.52 in EPS-diluted-adjusted. Adjusted
automotive free cash flow was negative $4.4 billion during the quarter due to higher work-in-process
inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules and working capital impacts from plant
downtime and lower production levels as a result of the ongoing semiconductor shortage.

We expect the impact on working capital to unwind, contributing to positive cash flow as production
increases and vehicles build without the modules are completed and wholesaled. We realized strong price
and mix performance in North America again through our production prioritization actions and our go-
to-market strategies. Additionally, used vehicle prices drove continued excellent results at GM Financial.
In the quarter, we also reached an agreement with LG to substantially recover the cost of the recall. The
pretax impact to the quarter of this recovery agreement and associated recall was $700 million.

So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q3, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.1 billion
with continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups and SUVs and the recovery agreement with LG. We
generated a 10.3% EBIT-adjusted margin in the region. From a pricing standpoint, we're continuing to see
high customer demand for our products and limited dealer inventory, which is driving strong transaction
prices and lower incentive spend.

In the quarter, our incentive spend as a percentage of ATP fell to 4.6%, 7.4 percentage points below Q3
2020. And even with these ATPs, we are growing or maintaining share in key segments. For example,
almost 7 out of every 10 customers in the full-size SUV segment purchased a Tahoe, Suburban or Yukon.
The Escalade remains the best-selling large luxury SUV by a significant margin. That said, our overall
volume and inventories remain low, which is impacting total market share in the region. We ended the
quarter with approximately 129,000 units in U.S. dealer inventory. We foresee low inventories and strong
pricing continuing well into next year even as production volumes are expected to increase.

Let's move to GM International. GMI EBIT-adjusted was $200 million, up $200 million year-over-year as
we experienced positive price and mix benefits across the segment. China equity income was $300 million
in the quarter despite the semiconductor impacts due to continued strong mix, stabilization in pricing
and material cost performance. GMI, excluding China equity income, has made substantial progress
toward breakeven despite the impact of semiconductors, reinforcing the structural progress on our path to
sustainable profitability and cash flow.

A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and Corporate segments. GM Financial has continued its
record-setting pace with Q3 EBT-adjusted of $1.1 billion as used vehicle prices and favorable consumer
credit trends continue. We've received $1.8 billion in dividends from GM Financial year-to-date, and
we anticipate additional dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter. Cruise losses in the quarter were
$300 million and Corp EBIT was a loss of $200 million, in line with our run rate estimates of general and
administrative costs, including investments in growth and our new businesses.

Let's turn to the outlook for the rest of the year. Despite some ongoing volatility in the supply chain, which
our teams continue to work to mitigate, we expect sequentially higher volumes in Q4. We also expect
costs from commodities and logistics to increase along with investments in our growth initiatives.

I want to make sure that we clearly articulate how we are performing relative to the guidance we have
in the market. As you recall, we began the year with a guided range of $10 billion to $11 billion of EBIT-
adjusted and provided updated full year EBIT-adjusted guidance at Q2 earnings of $11.5 billion to $13.5
billion. We now expect to achieve EBIT-adjusted approaching the high end of that range. Our EPS-diluted-
adjusted range will increase to $5.70 to $6.70, driven by a revised full year effective tax rate due to
favorable tax determinations and a mix of global earnings. We also expect to achieve EPS-diluted-adjusted
approaching the high end of that range.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Now I will provide an update on our capital spending, including investments in our Ultium JVs. We now
expect spend to be in the $8 billion to $9 billion range this year, slightly below the $9 billion to $10 billion
range we previously provided. This decrease is a result of both innovative work by our team to reduce
required capital investment while maintaining the schedule on our upcoming product programs as well as
certain timing of invoices that will shift into early '22.

Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year is expected to be approximately $1 billion. Note that this
guidance now includes the impact of remaining work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced
without certain modules at the end of the year. Through the fourth quarter, we expect to clear the
majority of our work-in-process inventory but anticipate some inventory will remain at year-end. As
we've indicated, these units will provide additional cash flow in the first half of 2022 as we wholesale the
vehicles.

To close, we're at an inflection point for GM and we're focused on new metrics and KPIs as we progress on
this journey. We plan to begin to provide some interim milestones and KPIs that we will use to benchmark
our performance relative to the growth plan that we laid out at our investor event. We look forward to
sharing that with you in the coming months. As we execute on our growth plan, we will maintain the
strong business we have today and these results demonstrate that.
This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

First, just a question on the pace of volume recovery. Can you just tell us, do you have any risk from the
emerging magnesium shortage? And then maybe you could just tell us your expectations on what the pace
of improvement is in volumes, what the baseline expectation is for when the supply shortages will be fully
mitigated, just the shape of recovery.

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Dan. And related to the Chinese magnesium shortages, while we do think there is some
near-term price escalation risk, we do not see it as a significant supply risk or a constraint for our North
America operations. The aluminum alloys we purchased have a very small percent of magnesium, and
nearly all of our aluminum is domestically sourced. So we are working with our supply base and we
continue to monitor the situation. We'll take appropriate mitigation steps if needed, but that's our view
right now. And Paul, I'll let you talk volumes.

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Dan, thanks for your question. So when we outlined the second half trajectory on volume,
we said that we expected it to be down approximately 200,000 units second half to first half, with the
majority of that occurring in Q3. That's certainly what we have seen. So we expect a pretty sizable step-
up in volume sequentially from Q3 into Q4.

That being said, when we look at Q4 volumes, they look more like what we kind of saw volumes in the
second quarter, but we have significant sort of additional cost pressures that we've seen, most of which
relate to either commodity inflation or, more importantly, investments that we're making in the growth
side of the business and in our manufacturing facilities as well. So volume is certainly recovering off of
where we were in Q3, which is consistent with what we said. And we would hope to see that and expect to
see that as we go through 2022.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. So continued improvement through 2022, it sounds like. There's just a sequential -- you'll have
ongoing sequential improvement. Okay. Okay. My second question is, I want to draw -- a question on EV
margin. I want to draw a comparison with a certain EV automaker, which just put up a very strong third
quarter. And I think you're finally starting to see, like, the EV margins materialize at some [indiscernible]
in the past.

Now I know you've put out the target for your BEV margins to be equal to or better than ICE, and I know
battery -- you've laid out certain battery targets, that's going to be a big part. But I'm wondering if you
could just walk us through maybe the other areas where you could see opportunity to boost EV margins,
setting aside the software opportunity and just how easily those things could be attained.

Is it just better architecture consolidation, greater vehicle simplicity? Is it more in-sourcing or more digital
or quasi-direct to retail sales? Just what other opportunities are there to improve the EV margins aside
from the battery cost?

Mary T. Barra

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Sure. Well, you rattled off a lot of them, Dan. Obviously, as we get scale, and the battery improvement is
not insignificant but as we get the scale part of that and get scale with the vehicles, I think you're going to
see margins improve. We're definitely leveraging the Ultium platform and being able to launch in roughly
half the time, there's just savings coming from that from less engineering because we already are working
off the platform as well as the way we've done the control system.

And we're looking across all aspects of the vehicle to ensure that EVs are affordable, really focused on
what customers want. We do extensive consumer clinics to understand what's going to be important. So
I think you'll see us, every aspect of the vehicle, we're looking to improve. And then the scale that we'll
be able to get across platforms, I think, is going to drive it. The battery cost will be another. And then you
mentioned it but on top of that will be the services and that revenue that you don't get until you sell a
vehicle. So we are working on that plan quite aggressively.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

I was hoping just first, you can help us a little bit more about -- with some thoughts on 2022. I know it's
still early. We know some of the big items, right? You're going to have volume upside on the positive side,
and it's been like a $10 billion headwind volume for you over the course of '19, with the strike in '20, and
'21 with these shortages. That's going to be offset by some headwind from raw materials you're spending
on EVs and some reversion of GM Financial.

But can you just maybe provide some high-level brackets on how we should be thinking about that, in
particular, the volume, the raws and the spending? Because it sounds like you still believe that a path to
10% margin in North America is plausible.

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll start with that, Rod, and Mary can add in any additional color she wants to give, obviously. I think
we certainly do still see that path. I think you outlined kind of the big moving pieces in your question
itself. We're certainly going to see lift in volume. I think we're going to see a very different mix because
the incremental volume that will be coming on will be coming on at a little bit lower of a contribution than
what we've seen, given some of the prioritization actions we took this year going forward.

We do have that commodity inflation, but we still remain convicted about our ability to be able to offset
either that through productivity or through some of the pricing actions that we've seen. Certainly, we've
seen the chips impact trim mixes and other things that we would otherwise want to be doing, but we've
had to reduce a little bit. So I think we're certainly looking at next year right now in detail, and we'll have
more color to provide as we get into early '22.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. But you can't provide any kind of high-level brackets around magnitude of maybe commodity just
based on where spot prices are or what is plausible for volume or spending?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think we said earlier this year that we expected the bulk of the commodity inflation to occur in the
first half of the year. Everything is moving around, obviously, as we've seen some -- a lot of volatility in,
broadly, commodities and the supply chain. We've seen a little bit of that retrace from the highs of this
summer.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

So we're triangulating around that, but we've seen a couple of billion dollars as we look at 2022 right now.
But that could go either way, just based on the volatility we've seen. So that's why I'm hesitant to anchor
on it right now. We're certainly looking at macro trends and that's part of the process, and we'll provide
more detail as we go through our budget plans.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And just second, there is a little bit of confusion this morning about the drivers in Q4 versus Q3, so
I was hoping maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that. In the third quarter, ex the reimbursement, it
looks like EBIT would have been about $2.2 billion. And it looks like your guidance, if you hit the higher
end of the range, would be around $2.1 billion in Q4.

But it sounds like you've got a fair amount of WIP inventory now, so volumes should be up quite a bit.
Maybe there's some adjustment you've got in GMF and you said some mix in commodities. But can you
maybe talk a little bit to some of the magnitudes of those sequential moving parts?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So if you look at the wholesale numbers that we articulated, you'd see a pretty sizable jump from
Q3 to Q4. Included in that is clearing out some of the build-shy going forward. But when you look at
sequentially in terms of costs, you've got some seasonality in the fixed cost there.

You've got investments in the future, particularly around some of the manufacturing plans, marketing
related to the new campaigns and the new vehicle launches going forward and just general investment in
engineering and growth across the board. So that's putting on some of the cost pressure going forward,
but that is the type of long-term decisions that Mary has mentioned we're staying focused on as we go
through this.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Paul, maybe just to follow up here. If we look at the third quarter, right, and we back out the 2 items from
the LG reimbursement and also the cost, then you had, it looks like, about a $2.2 billion headwind in cost.

So you just went through like commodities, investments. I think there's also a non-repeat of some of the
austerity. But can you help us bucket some of that a little bit just so we can better think about how those
should trend going forward?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Joe. To clarify, you're talking about Q2 to Q3 sequentially?

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Sorry. No, in the third quarter on a year-over-year, right, your cost, if you look at your costs and you back
out the recall and the reimbursement, it was like a $2.2 billion headwind. So I'm trying to understand
what made that up.

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

I would say just as a general rule, I would put about half of that into commodities inflation and about half
of that into growth investments going forward and then what we've seen in our fixed cost structure.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the CapEx, I know you said you lowered it. Some of that is
efficiency. Some of that sounds like timing. If we go back to your investor event, I think you said about
$9 billion to $10 billion over the midterm. So was that -- should we think about maybe towards the higher
end or maybe even a little bit above next year, given some of these timing issues?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would just stick with that $9 billion to $10 billion guidance, I mean, because things bounce around
from time to time. But I think the important thing to take away from this update is that everything is
progressing on schedule and on target. That's the biggest concern. So timing between year will move.
Sometimes it moves for you, sometimes it moves against you.

But what we're really tracking on is the efficiency of the investment, which has gotten better as well as the
timing to make sure that we're hitting our longer-term goals. And that remains consistent. So I would just
stay with the $9 billion to $10 billion.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I want to go back to some of the unanswered questions from C&D. Probably the biggest 1 we've been
getting is all sounds good but what about the capital markets, in particular, where the unique time in the
capital markets where billions are being devoted to pre-revenue companies.

So if you kind of think of Cruise in that light, how do you think about the kind of tension between waiting
for some commercial milestones on that? And for example, particularly another SoftBank investment if
they're paying [indiscernible] that versus taking advantage of capital market conditions now? And then for
the rest of the portfolio, what's the kind of metrics you're looking about when it's time, if ever, to take at
least part of those out to the public markets?

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

So from a Cruise perspective, we have Cruise well funded. So we're executing aggressively to
commercialization, and we have the ability to do that with the steps that we've already taken as well
as with GM's involvement. And I think what you need to really look at though with Cruise is the vertical
integration with GM is a key differentiator, and I believe it's one of the reasons Cruise is so well positioned
as the only person who's got the permit in South -- in San Francisco to actually take the driver out of the
vehicle.

That seamless integration of the technology along with leveraging Ultium as well as our manufacturing
capability are a huge value. So I think the message on Cruise is we're well funded and we have rapid
commercialization plans in front of us, and that's the play we're executing. And over the longer term, the
Board will look at what is -- what best enhances the overall value creation and shareholder value for the
GM shareholder.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Well, specifically, it seemed like Dan's pay was tied to an eventual public offering. A, is that a correct
reading of the proxy? B, does that imply it's a question of when as opposed to if, at least there's a partial
offer in Cruise?

Chairman & CEO

I would say that the Board has flexibility with the way the agreements were written to do the right thing
for the GM shareholder over the long term.

Brian Arthur Johnson

Okay. And some of the other things in [ PAM's ] portfolio, would the idea be to hit commercialization
targets? Or are some of them less tied to the core light vehicle business, e.g. the fuel cell business and
might be you could consider strategic actions earlier on those?

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Again, we'll evaluate each one for what we think creates the most shareholder value. From a fuel cell
perspective, clearly, there's a vehicle application as well as across many different transportation industries
and even stationary power. So we remain open to structure those in a way that's going to drive the most
value.

Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.

Itay Michaeli
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just 2 questions for me, 1 short term, 1 longer term. On the short term, maybe going back to the second
half bridge, I think Paul, last quarter, you outlined about a $1.5 billion to $2 billion increase in commodity
costs H2 versus H1 and $0.5 billion of investments in growth. Are those still the right numbers to think
about? And do you have kind of a rough split of how that might trend from Q3 to Q4?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Itay, thanks for that question. What I would say is it's still largely consistent but it's really trending
with volumes. So I would expect that more of that inflation is going to hit in Q4 than it did in Q3 just
sequentially, but that's really because of the volume lift that we see quarter-to-quarter.

Itay Michaeli
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it, that's helpful. And then just on a longer-term basis, I think one of the interesting takeaways on the
2030 revenue target is that you have $90 billion of EV revenue and only maybe a loss of $12 billion or $13
billion of ICE revenue, so that kind of implies pretty healthy market share gains there for the EV business.

Can you maybe talk more, unpack that more for us around what's driving these implied share gains? And
does the $90 billion potentially include new regions, new markets that you don't really operate in today or
other types of agreements? I would just love to get more detail on that split.

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

So the way I would look at it, Itay, is that the forecast that we put together and the plans that underlie
it are for our current markets, so I would say if we enter into other markets in a broader fashion, that's
growth on top of that. So that's the way I would look at the EV margins.

And again, I think it relates to the fact that how quickly we're going to have a full portfolio of vehicles
across brands, serving value customers, luxury customers, performance customers with our 4 brands.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.

Colin M. Langan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to follow up on the magnesium and aluminum question. I guess, one, I mean, how much
visibility do you have? I mean, like coming from the semi issue, there hasn't been much visibility. I mean,
do you -- is aluminum, because it's such a big bulky item that you actually have pretty good line of sight
to where your suppliers are getting there, aluminum and sourcing the magnesium, which makes it, I think,
a little more complicated.

And then what about international? Is there risk there for those operations? It seems like just magnesium
is such a large part of global supply.

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Well, so as it relates specifically to China with our JVs, we're working with our partners in the supply base
to closely monitor the situation and we'll take mitigation actions as required. Obviously, we're working
closely with the suppliers from a North America perspective as well. So our current view, again, with all of
those conversations is that we aren't going to see a significant supply risk.

Colin M. Langan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it, okay. And then just looking at Slide 13 and the -- the GM International profits ex China, have been
pretty weak. I mean, is additional restructuring needed in those regions? And any color, now that it's all
lumped together, how much is South America, Korea? And I guess there's a bit of rest of the world still in
there.

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Yes, go ahead.

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

I'll take that one, Colin. So what I would say that you're seeing particularly in the third quarter in GMI
performance, excluding China, is -- has a lot to do with the way that the chips have been allocated. So if
you look at the market share, particularly in South America, it's been pretty low and near historic lows, I
would say. But as you look at sequentially through the quarter and certainly what we're seeing in October,
as we've been able to turn plants back on, that market share is recovering quickly.

So I don't think the results that you're seeing ex China is indicative of the run rate capability of the
performance. In fact, I think it's a testament to the restructuring efforts that have been done, and we
would look for further improvement in those regions as volume returns back to normal levels.

So my question, it's not focused on the next 30 or 45 days, like some. But when you're looking at the EV
vision into 2022, can you walk us through the key bogeys? Obviously, it starts off with CES. But what are
sort of the -- what we would view as almost a time line and the key events going into '22 when we think

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

So I think it really starts at the end of fall this year with the HUMMER EV followed by the LYRIQ launching
in both the United States and in China. Then -- and well, as you said, at CES, we're going to be revealing
the Silverado EV and this is really a redefinition in taking trucks to, I'll say, a new level based on what
we can do with the Ultium platform and understanding what truck owners want but also people who are
coming in who aren't our traditional truck buyers.

At CES, we'll also share a little bit more detail about the $30,000 Chevy EV that will then be revealed later
in the year. And we'll have more to say with the vehicle that's even going to be more affordable than that.
And again, we have a number of EVs, as we've talked about, 30 by '25, so there'll be more information.
But those are what I can share with you now, so some pretty significant milestones of not only having EVs
out. We will also, as we take care of our customers with the Bolt EV and EUV, we'll have an opportunity to
really grow that share because the vehicle was doing quite well before we took the necessary actions to
protect our customers. So I see a very strong EV landscape in '22 but then in '23, it really turns on.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.

Adam Michael Jonas
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So Mary, you've talked about taking driver out of Cruise vehicles in quarters, not years. How confident
does GM feel driver-out can be achieved in 2022? Is that too soon? I know you're close.

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

I would say we're pretty confident.

Adam Michael Jonas
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay, that's good enough for me. Mary, just a follow-up on car rental and fleet support with -- as your
cars become more connected and software-designed, OEMs are kind of moving into -- like yourself are
moving into this recurring revenue network operating model. You see that VW bought Europcar, Tesla does
a major deal with a car rental firm.

I'm just wondering -- your 2030 targets are heavily based on software and service revenue, which implies
some degree of physical fleet management. So what is GM's strategy for fleet support? You thinking more
in-house and vertically integrated? You work with the franchise dealers? Or are there other alternatives
like working with non-dealer partners like car rental or other logistics partners along the way?

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Well, I think if you look at how we're structuring BrightDrop from a commercial vehicle perspective
and some of the close relationships that we have with FedEx Express, et cetera, that -- and there -- we,
as a part of BrightDrop, are going to have a system that kind of holistically helps them manage the whole
ecosystem. So I think that points in a direction.

Having said that though, with the launch of EVs, I think in the software services we're going to have in the
vehicle, we're not going to cede that to someone else because I think that revenue and managing that is
very important, and none of it starts to accrue until you actually have the vehicle being driven.

But having said that, I will just say, Adam, there's a lot of conversations going on right now. And again,
we're going to look at what provides us the biggest growth opportunity, not only in EV sales but also in the
whole software system to manage those fleets or provide different services to our customers. So I don't
have anything specific to announce today, but I'd just say there's a lot of conversations underway.

Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

I just wanted to ask about sort of inventory management here in the short run, midterm and long term.
I think, Paul, you had mentioned there's about 124,000 units in dealer inventory right now. There's some
units in work in progress. If you can maybe let us know what that number is.

Then also for both of you, where do you think that travel level should be in the U.S. as things normalize?
Because I mean, pre-crisis, you've been running right around 800,000 units, plus or minus. So it indicates
that there can be very significant catch-up.

But I guess the question is, where do you actually land and how much of the price activity that has been
really positive because of tight inventory might be maintained. So really sort of short term, what are we
actually looking at of effective inventory? And then long term, where do you think it stays hopefully tighter
than history? And what does that mean for pricing?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

So what I would say is the inventory levels that we see now around kind of that 125,000 is expected
to remain low, probably into and through 2022. To be honest, I think as production ramps up in terms
of what we're seeing in demand, I think the opportunities to build inventory are going to be somewhat
limited, which in the short run, I think, is a good thing for pricing and for what we see in terms of the
demand environment.

Midterm, we would expect to start building inventories off of these levels because it's not healthy where
we see our dealers with empty lots, et cetera. And when consumers want to buy a vehicle, they want to
buy a vehicle. They don't want to wait. And we're meant to have more inventory. And longer term, what
I would say is go back to kind of what we've said from the beginning of this, that there's a lot of lessons
learned in inventory management and certainly what the impact has been on pricing this year.

And the right answer is certainly a lot more than what we have today but certainly quite a bit less than
what we've carried historically going forward. So as we come through this over the longer term, we'll
continue to manage that dynamically through the market, but I'd expect it to be less than historical levels.

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I think -- go ahead.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

No, Mary, go ahead. I just have a follow-up after that.

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I just -- Paul, spot on. The only thing I would add is we've added a lot of data analytics to better
support our dealers to have the right inventory. And so I think like Paul said, you're going to see
something less, but I think it's going to be much more efficient from a company and a dealer perspective.
So I'm really pleased with how well that's working out with our dealers as we look at getting the right
products specced the right way to really serve the customer efficiently.

Okay, that's incredibly helpful. And then just 1 question on the Cadillac dealer strategy. I mean, it sounds
like there was a charge in the quarter as you're transitioning some of the dealerships out as they don't
want to tag into or invest in the new EV strategy.

I'm just curious how big that is in the base of Cadillac dealerships. And if you think about the transition to
EV and your entire product portfolio, how big an opportunity is this to maybe streamline and strengthen
your dealership base on a stronger core like you have in other parts of the business?

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think what has been accomplished with the Cadillac dealer base is very, very important and it was
done the right way. We were clear with, as we transition Cadillac, it will be our lead brand moving to all-EV
and wanted to make sure that the dealers were in partnership with us to make the investments that they
needed to make to win selling electric vehicles.

And for those -- and we have a lot of dealers. Some are very high volume, some are smaller. So you can
imagine as they weigh that decision of what's in the best interest for them, we work through that. So what
we have now, I think, is a very efficient Cadillac dealer base that's very excited about the electrified -- our
all-EV products that are coming and are making the investments to support the customer extremely well.

So I think it's going to be a model as we go forward. But I'm very pleased with how that has turned out.
And again, we did it in -- with our dealers. And I think that's going to prove to be the right way to do it
and very strong from a customer support perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So 1 follow-up on the short term and then 1 longer-term question. On the short term, I'm curious if you
could put a finer point around how some of the cost pressure you expect in the fourth quarter are a good
read across the run rate for how to think about 2022.

And the reason I'm asking is if I understand you well, Paul, I think you expect Q4 volumes to be about
in line with Q2, but then at the same time, the guided EBIT for Q4 is probably about half of what you did
in Q2, so $2 billion versus the $4 billion. And so when I think of that $2 billion delta, seems like there's
commodities in there and then there's investments in the future. So first, is my understanding correct?

And second of all, how do I think about these costs going to next year? You spoke about commodities.
What about the investments in the future? Is this the sort of like run rate that is required for your plan?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So thanks, Emmanuel, for that question. In order to go back to Q2, we also have to understand that
there were some onetime or shorter-term impact issues that were affecting that. So when you back that
out of Q2 and kind of normalize it, you're looking at approximately $1 billion. So GMF had true-up of some
of its liabilities. Now that all that caught up to the credit terms and the used car prices, we're kind of on a
run rate basis at GMF. That was included in Q2.

We had some mark-to-market on investments as well. So if you take about $1 billion out and then you
look at roughly $1 billion to $1.5 billion kind of where we were Q4 to Q2, I would break that down into
about half of that, so call it in the $700 million range being about the cost inflation and where we're seeing
investment into the business on kind of a run rate, and then the other half being commodities, which
should vary over time. And certainly, we've seen some of that pressure coming off of the peaks. I hope
that answered your question.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. That's super clear, but the fourth quarter, how do we think about these investments in the business
on a go-forward basis?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

I think the fourth quarter is kind of indicative of that. You see kind of that fixed cost kind of being roughly
flat 3Q to 4Q is how we're thinking about it. But it's going to continue to grow over time as we roll out
these products and going forward. So you've seen some increase in CIB for the launches of the new EVs.

Obviously, we're going to be in a pretty sizable launch cadence going forward for the next few years, and
we're going to make sure that we invest in that. And then we've got engineering going on for multiple
projects going forward. So I think we've got good control of that, where we stand and where we go. And
it's stuff that we think is the right investment for the long term.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. And then on the longer-term view, I wanted to follow up on the question I asked you at the Capital
Markets Day. So I was very encouraged to see your bullish long-term targets for margin as well as the
goal to improve margins in the core automotive business by 2030.

My question is, how will you manage profitability in between, so between now and sort of like mid-decade
as some of these EVs roll on and ramp up at a lower than average margin as well like some of these
investments in the business as sort of like needed? How will you sort of ensure that the profitability sort of
like is on an upward trajectory before the 2030 target?

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Emmanuel, here's the way I look at it. Obviously, as we get scale, that's going to continue to help.
The question that was asked before, from an EV profitability perspective, so that we get there mid-decade
and then just continue to build on that. But we are also going to be focused on investing in businesses
that are going to allow us to create software businesses that have a very different margin potential overall
that's part of that.

So as we said at Investor Day, we said we -- plus or minus, we're going to maintain margins as we go
forward because we think we have the capability to do that. But just to be clear, we're also going to make
sure that we're doing the right investment. We're not going to constrain investment in the future growth
opportunities. But the current modeling that we've done and the plan that we're executing and the targets
that have been distributed that everybody is being held accountable to, we see roughly a steady and then
improving toward the latter part of the decade with margins. Paul, anything that I missed?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

No. And I think the additional truck capacity that's coming on is going to give us an ability to continue to
grow the leading truck franchise, which as we've said from day 1, is funding the journey. So we expect a
little bit of a mix uplift from that, that's going to help to offset some of that shorter-term margin pressure
that you might otherwise expect to see.

So this is going to be a focal point of -- as we -- as I talked about in my prepared remarks, of making sure
that we're bringing transparency on KPIs and how we're thinking about the business heading through '22
and into 2023.

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Thanks for taking my question, which is on how you are anticipating commercial negotiations with auto
part suppliers might track going forward and the potential impact to margin? I understand there are
typically built into contracts agreements for automakers to compensate suppliers for increases in raw
material costs but generally not for other forms of inflation such as freight, logistics, labor, et cetera?

On some of the earnings calls so far this quarter, suppliers have discussed attempting to negotiate for
reimbursement for some of these, at least, noncommodity supply chain costs and even for the magnitude
and suddenness of order cancellations due to the semiconductor shortage curtailing production, which
again, I don't think we've historically seen automakers compensate suppliers for lower volumes stemming
from factors outside of their control.

So just wanted to check in with you to see how you expect these conversations may proceed and whether
we should think about suppliers bearing the brunt of these noncommodity costs or if there maybe margin
implications for GM?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

Ryan, I'll take a shot at that, and obviously, I'm not going to go into any detail on any conversations that
we're having across our supply base. But what I would say is the singular focus is making sure that we
have consistency and reduce some of the volatility that we've seen in the supply chain, whether it's due to
logistics or semiconductors, et cetera.

So we're working across the board because that's where the real value is, working with our suppliers to
drive efficiencies across the business is ultimately what we all have to do to be able to counter inflationary
aspects of the business. But right now, the here and now is navigating through some of the short-term
challenges while focusing on operations.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. And then my last question is a follow-up to Adam's earlier question on fleet sales.
I recall that pre-pandemic, you had significantly reduced your sales to daily rental car companies in
particular.

How are you feeling or thinking about prioritizing of sales between retail and fleet customers, and between
the various categories of fleet customers with the supply chain where it is currently?

And then longer term, how do you view the relative attractiveness and profitability of the various different
sales channels, such as retail, daily rental, commercial, small and medium-sized businesses, et cetera?

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

Well, in the past, in the traditional ICE business, daily rental was the least profitable business, and we had
worked to reduce that substantially and held discipline to that. There actually, though, is fleet business
that's very good, as I mentioned before, with what we're entering into BrightDrop, not only the business
itself with the vehicles but then the services and the first-mile, last-mile solutions that we're going to be
offering so we're going to be aggressive from that perspective.

And then again, I think there's new frameworks opening up from what today -- or what has been, in the
past, from a rental car perspective. So as I said, there's a lot of conversations going on. We're going to do
what we think is in the long-term interest of maximizing our profitability and also reach with EVs, and so
more to come.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Software and connected services, especially on a subscription basis, is a big focus for the auto industry
or something that GM spent a lot of time focusing on at the Analyst Day. I think the company guided for
about $2 billion of subscription-related revenue this year at over 70% EBIT margin.

And you talked about that $20 billion to $25 billion target by 2030. Can you talk about how you see the
ramp from where you are this year to that 2030 target? What sort of increases should we be expecting as
investors in the next few years? And is it a pretty linear increase or is this going to be more of a back-end
weighted target?

Paul A. Jacobson
Executive VP & CFO

As we talked about, a lot of that revenue growth is really tied to the Ultifi platform and how we're going
forward in terms of getting the connected car park out there, which is going to build aggressively over
time as we ramp up EVs. So by definition, that's going to be a little bit more back loaded.

We can see a little bit of growth on the horizon as we look at OnStar and some of the connected services,
which is really the baseline today going forward. But certainly, we'd expect that to tick up as we --
significantly in the growth rate as we get into the second half of the decade.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Understood. And a follow-up question, it's about end demand. Wholesales are down and I think a lot of
it is on these supply chain challenges. But when you look at some of the macroeconomic indicators and
talk to your channel and dealer network, are you seeing any changes in end demand, either in the U.S. or
China that we need to be monitoring? Or is the wholesale decline really just due to supply?

Mary T. Barra
Chairman & CEO

We're selling everything we can sell. It is totally due to what we're able to supply. I'm so excited and
enthused at the strong reaction to all of our products. So I am confident as we build more, we will have --

outlook provided at CMD was quite impressive, backed by initial customer orders from FedEx and Verizon.

What we're hoping to get a bit more color on is how you're seeing incremental customer demand evolving,
given benefits highlighted on a TCO basis for buyers, and how we should think about margin progression
for the business as vehicle production ramps over the next few years and ancillary revenue streams
expand, helping to push margins to the low 20s long term?
