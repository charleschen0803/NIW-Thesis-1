Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to EOG Resources Third Quarter 2021 Earning Results Conference Call.
As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial
Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.

Timothy K. Driggers
Executive VP & CFO

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have
been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings. This conference call also contains certain non-
GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures can be
found on EOG's website.

Participating on the call this morning are Ezra Yacob, Chief Executive Officer; Billy Helms, President and
Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration & Production; Jeff Leitzell EVP, Exploration &
Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing; and David Streit, VP, Investor & Public Relations. Here's
Ezra Yacob.

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. Yesterday,
we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per
share special dividend and an update to our share buyback authorization to $5 billion. These cash
return announcements reflect EOG's consistent outstanding performance and are the direct result of our
disciplined approach to high-return investment.

During the third quarter, we set new quarterly earnings and cash flow records, adjusted net income of
$1.3 billion or $2.16 per share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. The strength of our current and future
earnings and cash flow that supports both dividend announcements can be traced back to 2016. Amid a
potentially prolonged low commodity price environment, we made a permanent upgrade to our investment
criteria. Our premium hurdle rate was established not only to protect the company's profitability in 2016,
but all future commodity cycles.

The discipline to only invest in new wells that earn a minimum 30% direct after-tax rate of return,
assuming a $40 oil price for the life of the well, continues to improve our capital efficiency, profitability
and cash flow. Our employees immediately embraced the challenge of this new investment hurdle. And by
the second half of 2016, EOG was reinvesting capital and paying the dividend within cash flow. We have
generated free cash flow every year since.

From 2017 to 2019, we generated enough free cash flow to significantly reduce net debt by $2.2 billion,
while also increasing the dividend rate 72%. We also expanded our inventory of premium wells by more
than 3x. While adding inventory that meets the minimum premium threshold increases quantity, our goal
through technical innovation and organic exploration is to add higher quality inventory.

Our employees, empowered by EOG's unique culture, applied innovation and efficiencies to raise the
return of much of the existing inventory while adding higher rate of return wells through exploration.
The premium standard established in 2016 and the momentum that followed provided a step change in
operational and by extension financial performance, which set the stage for the second upgrade to our
reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium.

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

Double premium, which is a minimum return hurdle of 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil, was
initiated during the depth of last year's unprecedented down cycle. That capital discipline enabled EOG
to deliver extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment last year. Using such stringent hurdle rates
prepare the company not only for 2020 but for our stellar results this year. There is no clear indication of
the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than
the 82% increase to our regular dividend announced yesterday.

Combined with the 10% increase made in February of this year, we have doubled our annual dividend
rate from $1.50 per share to $3 per share. After weathering 2 downturns during which we did not cut nor
disband the dividend -- suspend the dividend, the new annual rate of $3 per share reflects the significant
improvement in EOG's capital efficiency since the transition to premium drilling.

Going forward, we are confident that double premium will continue to improve the financial performance
just like premium did 5 years ago. We are also confident in our ability to continue adding to our double
premium inventory without any need for expensive M&A by improving our existing assets and adding new
plays from our deep pipeline of organic exploration prospects, developing high-return, low-cost reserves
that meet our stringent double premium hurdle rate, expands our future free cash flow potential and
supports EOG's commitment to sustainably growing our regular dividend.

EOG's focus on returns, disciplined growth, strong free cash flow generation and sustainability remain
constant. Just as our free cash flow priorities are consistent, so remains our broader strategy and culture.
EOG's competitive advantage is our people and today's announcements are a reflection of our culture,
of innovation and execution. Looking towards 2022, oil market supply and demand fundamentals are
improving but remain dynamic. While it's unlikely the market will be fully balanced by the end of 2021, we
will continue to monitor macro fundamentals, as we plan for next year.

We are committed to maintaining production until the oil market needs additional barrels. Under any
scenario, we remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency improvements. We are well positioned
to offset inflationary price pressures to help keep our well costs flat next year. To summarize this
quarter's earning release in 3 points: First, our fundamental strategy of investing in high-return projects
consistently executed year after year is delivering outstanding financial results. Second, we are still
getting better. As we continue to expand our opportunity set to add double premium inventory through
sustainable well cost reductions and organic exploration, EOG is set up to improve performance even
further. And third, we are well positioned to execute our high-return reinvestment program in 2022 to
deliver another year of outstanding returns.

Here's Tim to review our capital allocation strategy and our free cash flow priorities.

Timothy K. Driggers
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Ezra. As we have been progressing premium in the last 5 years, our capital allocation decisions
have been guided by a set of long-standing, consistent priorities. First is high-return, disciplined
reinvestment. Our returns on capital investment have never been higher. However, market fundamentals
remain the #1 determinant of when to grow. Second is the regular dividend, which we believe is the best
way to return cash to shareholders. We have paid a dividend for 22 years without suspending or cutting it.
At the new level of $3 per year, we can comfortably fund both the dividend and maintenance CapEx at $40
WTI. The combination of our low-cost structure, high returns and strong financial position will sustain this
higher regular dividend.

This resilient financial position is backstopped by our third priority, a pristine balance sheet with almost 0
net debt. We remain firmly committed to a strong balance sheet. It's not conservatism. It's a competitive
advantage. Fourth, we regularly review other cash return options, specifically special dividends and
share buybacks. Yesterday, we declared a special dividend for the second time in 2021 and updated our
share buyback authorization. Share buybacks have always been part of our playbook and will remain an
opportunistic cash return alternative.

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

We are cognizant of the challenges of successfully executing a share buyback in a cyclical industry. We
know and expect there will be periods in the future when the stock will be impacted by macro factors
such as the commodity cycle, geopolitical events and other unforeseen events like the COVID pandemic
in 2020. The updated $5 billion authorization provides the flexibility to act and take advantage when the
right opportunity presents itself.

We believe our strategy for the use of other cash return options is well designed to deliver value through
the cycle. Finally, we are not in the market for expensive M&A. It is simply a low return proposition. We
can create much more value through organic reinvestment and our shareholders can do better with their
excess cash our premium strategy generates back in their hands. Since our shift to premium in 2016, EOG
has generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow.

With that cash flow, EOG has reduced debt $1.5 billion, increased the cash balance by $3.6 billion and
will have returned more than $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. This is a significant amount of
shareholder value driven by premium. Today, EOG is positioned to translate that value creation into even
more cash returns to shareholders.

In the third quarter, we generated a record $1.4 billion of free cash flow bringing our year-to-date free
cash flow to $3.5 billion, which is equal to the total return of capital paid and committed this year to our
regular dividend, two special dividends and debt repayment. You can expect us to continue returning cash
going forward. There might be times when we strategically increase or decrease the cash balance, but
over time the cash will go back to our shareholders.

Here's Billy.

Lloyd W. Helms
COO & President

Thanks, Tim. As a result of the -- to the consistency of our operating performance, we delivered another
quarter of outstanding results. I couldn't be more proud of the engagement of our employees and their
culture of continuous improvement. Their execution of our 2021 plan has been near perfect. For the third
quarter in a row, we produced more oil for less capital. That is we exceeded our production targets while
spending less than our forecast for capital expenditures.

Well productivity, driven by our double premium hurdle rate, continues to outperform, while our drilling
and completion teams pushed the envelope on new sustainable cost savings and expand those efficiencies
throughout our active operating areas. Examples include in-sourcing and redesigning drilling equipment,
adopting innovative techniques to reduce nonproductive time, expanding super zipper completion
operations and reducing sand and water sourcing cost.

Our ability to continue to lower cost and deliver reliable execution quarter after quarter is tied to a
common set of operating practices that together form a sustainable competitive advantage for EOG.
First, we are a multi-play company with activity spread across 4 different basins in the U.S. As conditions
change, we have the flexibility to shift capital between plays to optimize returns. Second, we are
organized under a decentralized structure. Decisions are made by discrete focused teams closer to the
operation rather than dictated by headquarters. Our culture is non-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial. We
empower our frontline employees to make decisions, bringing them to drive innovation and efficiency
improvements.

Third, we have established strategic vendor relationships with our preferred service providers. We are
typically -- we are not typically the biggest beneficiary of price reductions during downturns, but we
also tend to not be on the leading edge of price increases during the inflationary periods. Fourth, we
have taken ownership of the value-added parts of the drilling, completions and production supply chain
by applying our operational expertise and proprietary technology to improve efficiency and lower cost.
Examples include sand, water, chemicals, drilling fluids, completion design, drilling motors, the marketing
of our products and much more.

As a result, our operating teams have complete ownership of driving improvements in every step. And
finally, we apply world-class information technology to every part of our operation. Our data gathering and

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

analysis capabilities continue to improve, which we leverage to better manage day-to-day field operations
for more efficient use of resources as well as discovering new innovations. As a result of these strategic
advantages, we are confident in achieving our target of 7% well cost savings this year.

This is an incredible accomplishment given the state of inflation. And as we move into next year, we're on
track to lock in 50% of our total well cost by the end of this year. We have locked in 90-plus percent of
our drilling rigs at rates that are flat to lower than 2020 and 2021. We've also secured more than 50% of
our completion crews at favorable rates. While it's still early, the savings from these initiatives and other
improvement efforts will continue to be realized next year, helping us offset the risk of additional inflation.
And thus, we remain confident that we will be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022.

Now here's Ken.

Kenneth W. Boedeker
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Thanks, Billy. Last month, we published our 2020 sustainability report. As detailed in this report, we are
focused on reducing emissions in the field. Our flaring intensity rate decreased 43% in 2020 compared to
2019, which drove an overall 9% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity. We continue to make progress
toward our goal of 0 routine flaring across all our operations by 2025 with our more immediate goal of
99.8% wellhead gas capture this year.

We also made significant progress on methane last year, reducing our methane emissions percentage by
1/3 to less than 0.1% of our natural gas production. Since 2017, we've reduced our methane emission
intensity percentage by 80%. Our sustainability report profiles the technology and innovation that
contributed to these improvements and illustrates why we are optimistic about future performance on our
path to net zero by 2040. Examples of how we are addressing emissions in the field include closed-loop
gas capture, which helps us continue to reduce flaring.

We're leveraging information technology and our extensive data analysis capabilities from both mobile
platforms and our central control rooms to better manage day-to-day operations. In addition, we are
piloting technology in the field such as sensors and control devices that complement our already robust
leak detection program. These are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway. Like all efforts
at EOG, our sustainability strides are bottom-up driven. Creative ideas to improve our ESG performance
come from employees working in our operating areas every day. We have a long list of solutions we
expect to pilot and profile in the future. Our record of significantly reducing our GHG intensity over
the last several years speaks for itself. And we are committed to continuing to improve our emissions
performance.

Now here's Ezra to wrap things up.

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Thank you, Ken. Our record-breaking operational and financial results throughout this year and the
cash return announcements we made yesterday deserved to grab some headlines. However, the real
story behind our performance is consistency of strategy supported by our unique culture. At the start
of the call, I said there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had
on our confidence in EOG's future profitability than the annual $3 per share regular dividend. And while
establishing the premium standard back in 2016 shifted us into a different gear culminating in the
magnitude of our cash return this year our fundamental strategy executed year after year by employees
united by unique culture dates back to the founding of the company.

That's ultimately what gives me confidence that EOG's best days are ahead. We are a return-focused
organic exploration company that leverages technology and innovation to always get better, decentralized,
non-bureaucratic. Every employee is a businessperson first focused on creating value in the field at
the asset level. Our financial strategy has always been and remains conservative, not just to offset
the inherent risks in a cyclical business, but to take advantage of them. We are committed to the
regular dividend and believe it is the best way to create consistent and dependable long-term value for

shareholders. We have a proven track record that our strategy works and going forward investors can
expect more of the same, consistent execution year after year.
Thanks for listening. We'll now go to Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Two questions, please, Ezra. First, you have the authorization for the buyback. But quite frankly, I don't
recall EOG ever done any buyback for the past 20 years. So can you talk about what is the conditional
criteria for you to actually act on it? And in theory that if you're going to buy it when the market is
suffering the downturn, does that mean that you should have a really strong balance sheet going into the
downturn maybe at a net cash position in order for you to be able to afford it? Like last year that in the
-- at the top of the pandemic, your share price was really attractive, but I'm not sure that you had the
balance sheet or that will to do the buyback at that point. So that's the first question.

The second question is on the hedging. You have been quite aggressive putting in a lot of natural gas
hedges. Two is that, I mean, with your low breakeven requirement and a very strong balance sheet, why
put on the hedges so aggressively? And to some degree, even though you have the physical barrel or MCF
to support it. But is that -- the fundamental basic is that you become a speculation on the direction of the
commodity prices when you're doing in that way.

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes. This is Ezra, Paul. Thanks for the question. Let me start by just outlining a little bit on the buyback,
and then I'll hand it to Tim Driggers for a little more detail on it. You're right, buyback authorization we've
had one previously, and we haven't exercised that in quite some time. What we've done right now is we've
refreshed it to a size that's a little more commensurate with the scale of our company today. And we plan
to exercise the buybacks in more of an opportunistic way rather than something programmatic, is how we
expect to be able to use it. And I'm going to ask Tim to provide you a little more details on exercising it.

Timothy K. Driggers
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. My microphone, I'm sorry. First of all, we will evaluate buybacks like any other investment decision,
how does it create long-term shareholder value. So that will be the first thing we'll have to look at every
time we make this decision. Specifically, to answer your question about could we have started during the
pandemic, but didn't have the financial wherewithal to do that. You're exactly right. At that point in time,
oil was negative. The price of oil was negative. We had 2 bonds coming due totaling $1 billion.

So had we been in the shape we're in today, that would have been a perfect time to buy shares, but we
weren't in that same position we are today. That's how -- that's why continuing to work on the balance
sheet and positioning ourselves for the future has been so important to EOG. So we should not ever have
that situation again. We have positioned the company to be able to opportunistically take advantage of
these situations.

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

And Paul, on the second question regarding our hedges, specifically gas, but really, in general, our hedging
strategy hasn't changed at all. As you know, we invest on a very, very stringent hurdle rate, our premium
and now double premium rate. That's based on a $40 oil price, but it's also based on a $2.50 natural gas
price for the life of the well. And so when we can opportunistically look to lock in some hedges north of
$3, we feel very good about the returns that we're generating going forward on the gas price. In general,
we like to have a bit of hedges put on, whether oil or gas. It just give us a little bit of line of sight into our

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

budgeting process as we enter into a new year. And so really, that's the commentary on both the gas and
the oil hedges.

Operator

The next question will come from Arun Jayaram.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Ezra, the 2021 cash return to equity holders has tallied just under 30% of CFO. If you add in debt,
it's around 36% of your CFO. I know there's no formal framework in place, but how should investors
be thinking about cash returns on a go-forward basis? And could this 30% be viewed at some sort of
benchmark?

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Arun, this is Ezra. No, I won't -- I would not take that as any type of benchmark. I think we've been
very clear for the last couple of years in talking about our framework for cash return, really just our free
cash flow priorities. The emphasis -- the priority really is on a sustainable growing regular dividend. We
think that's the hallmark. It's forward-looking. That's a hallmark of a very strong company. It hopefully
sends a signal to everybody that -- of our confidence in the growing capital efficiency of our company.
Obviously, we've talked about some low-cost property bolt-on acquisitions. We've highlighted those on
the last call and in the slide deck today. We obviously covered a very strong -- not just strong but really a
pristine balance sheet.

And then to the last part of -- really the other part of your question is our other cash return options for
excess free cash flow, which are the special dividends, and then as Tim was just mentioning some of the
share repurchases. And as we've said, we're very committed to returning excess free cash flow. We have
stayed away from a specific formula because we like to be able to -- we try not to run the company on
a quarter-to-quarter basis. We try to take a longer view of things. We realize that there are times when
potentially the cash on hand may need to move up or down, but regardless of it over the long term, I
think we've demonstrated, especially this year, that we're very committed to returning that excess free
cash flow.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And my follow-up. With the dividend increase to $3 on an annualized basis, Ezra, that will represent
just over $1.75 billion in annual outlays to equity holders for the dividend. How should investors be
thinking about future growth? Does this temper how we should think about longer-term production growth
given the higher mix of dividend payments?

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Arun. The step-up this year in the regular dividend is really a reflection of what we've been doing for
the last 5 years and reinvesting this in the premium wells. We've been seeing it slowly but surely show up
in our financial performance, as we've lowered the cost basis of the company. And the confidence going
forward really is what we're seeing with our change in focus over the past 18 months to these double
premium wells. We feel that it's providing another step change in operational performance that should
filter through to a step change in financial performance, as we've witnessed with that change to premium.

And then our inventory, of course, is spread across multiple basins. We have 5,800 of these double
premium locations and over 11,000 of the premium locations, and we're adding to that every day. Our
employees are working through either identifying low-cost bolt-on acquisition opportunities, sustainable
well cost reductions. As we've highlighted this quarter, stronger well productivity. And then, of course,
our low-cost entry into organic exploration opportunities to further expand both the quantity and the
quality of that inventory. So I think as we continue moving forward and sticking to our game plan of

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

investing in double premium, it has the potential to continue to expand the free cash flow potential of EOG
and thereby continue to provide an opportunity for us to remain committed to sustainably growing our
dividend.

Operator

Our next question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Our first question is on special dividend. In terms of the timing and the process for that, when you look at
the potential to announce one what did you see this time around that perhaps you didn't see last quarter
when you decided to forgo a special dividend?

Timothy K. Driggers
Executive VP & CFO

Jeanine, this is Tim. So as already been stated, we are committed to our free cash flow priorities, and that
has not changed. So we look at all the factors every quarter to determine when is the right time to do
either a special dividend or now the share buybacks or increase the regular dividend. So when we looked
at our cash balance at September 30, it was sitting at $4.3 billion. That gives us -- that leaves us well
positioned to pay off our bond in 2023 and provide this $2 special dividend. So it's a combination of all
those factors. And we felt this was a meaningful amount of cash to return at this time.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then my second question, maybe following up on Arun's question, on the base dividend.
So the large increase in the base. It seems like it's a catch up to close the gap between what the business
can support given the premium and double premium wells like you just said and what was actually getting
paid out. So I guess in terms of the timing also on the base, we're just curious how much of a factor the
potential that you now see in your exploration plays factored into the decision to increase the base.

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Jeanine. This is Ezra again. It's not just the exploration plays. It's really just our confidence in
being able to expand the overall inventory, the quality of the inventory into that double premium. And
some of it comes from the announcements that you saw in this quarterly -- on the quarter results, the
stronger well productivity supporting better than guidance volumes, the better than guidance CapEx
driven by sustainable well cost reductions. So when I think about that, I think about our existing inventory
increasing in performance and quality. And then I think about converting some of our premium wells into
double premium status.

And then, of course, we have identified small bolt-on acquisitions where we can continue to grow and
expand that inventory level for us. And then as you highlighted, we've got the organic exploration mix.
We're drilling 15 wells this year that we've talked about that are not in the publicly disclosed plays. Those
plays are at various states of either initial drilling, collecting of data or kind of evaluating, as we've talked
about on other calls, repeatability, production performance of those plays. And so we're very excited and
confident in our ability to continue to expand and, as I said, increase the quality of our double premium
inventory. And ultimately, that's what gives us the confidence to be able to see that we can continue
to lower the cost base of the company, increase the capital efficiency of EOG and continue to support a
sustainably growing base dividend, which is our commitment.

So in your deck, you mentioned a carbon capture pilot project, which is interesting. Ezra, can you speak
to your early ambitions in carbon capture? Are you looking strictly at EOR? You investigating pure storage
and what level of resources have you committed internally to the initiatives?

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Scott. I appreciate the question. I'm going to ask Ken Boedeker to address it.

Kenneth W. Boedeker
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Yes, Scott. We're continuing to make good progress on that initial carbon capture project that we've talked
about. We've finalized many of the below-ground geologic studies, and we're currently working on the
engineering and regulatory portions of the project. As we work our way through these steps, we'll get
more clarity on timing. But right now, we hope to initiate CO2 injection in late 2022. In terms of capital
that we're allocating towards it, it's roughly 2% to 3% of our budget. It's going to be allocated towards all
of our ESG projects, is what we see.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And as you investigate the opportunity, how are you thinking about participating in the value chain?
Would you be interested in entering transport? Obviously, it's an exciting opportunity, but get more capital
intensive as you kind of broaden participation. So just how are you thinking about the broader opportunity
in participating across the value chain?

Kenneth W. Boedeker
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Yes, Scott, we're really not going to change the business that we're in. We're looking at carbon capture
right now to significantly reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions at this point. That business is a much
lower return business than what we see with our well development that we have. So we'll keep an eye on
that, but our real goal for carbon capture is just reducing our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, which we've
made significant progress on in the last several years.

Our next question will come from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just looking at the guidance here for fourth quarter, we can certainly see some pretty significant growth in
U.S. gas. Obviously, looking at gas prices right now, we're at multiyear highs at this point in time. Should
we see that as a bit of a signal that EOG is perhaps flexing up a little bit on the natural gas side to try to
capture what are probably some fantastic returns at the current prices here.?

Lloyd W. Helms
COO & President

Yes, Leo, this is Billy Helms. So on the CapEx side, certainly, part of our program, as we laid out
earlier this year, was to advance some of our Dorado prospect in South Texas. As you know, it's a very
competitive gas play with the rest of the plays in the U.S. And we've been very pleased with the results
there. But we remain disciplined to only complete the 15 wells we targeted and laid out at the start of this
year.

And it's really a little bit early to be talking about what we're going to look like next year. But obviously,
with the results we're seeing, we're very pleased with the results being -- meeting or exceeding the type

curves we have laid out. That certainly gives us an option to look at increasing activity there. So it's a little
bit early yet to be saying what we're going to do next year, but we're very pleased with what we've seen.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, obviously, in your prepared comments, you certainly spoke about the
fact that probably be challenging to kind of meet all the necessary conditions at year-end '21 that you all
have laid out to put any type of real oil growth back in the market at this point in time. But I guess -- I've
certainly heard some rumblings lately that perhaps we might already be at kind of pre-pandemic demand
levels here as we work our way into November. I think OPEC+ has a plan to reduce its spare capacity
pretty dramatically by mid-'22. Just wanted to get a sense if you think perhaps in the mid- to second half
part of '22, there's a good shot at kind of hitting the conditions that EOG has laid out to potentially put a
little growth back in the market.

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. As Billy said, typically, we don't provide guidance for the following year on this call.
But in general, our focus on 2022 the potential for that and us, as you highlighted, the things that we're
looking at, we're focused on remaining disciplined and that hasn't changed. As we look into 2022, there
are the 3 items that you referenced that should signal a bit of a balanced market. At first is demand,
which has probably surprised to the upside a bit with just how quickly we've approached pre-COVID levels.
The second is going to be the inventory numbers, which, for us, we'd like to see at or below the 5-year
average, which they're currently there right now, but that brings up kind of that third item that you spoke
to, which is the spare capacity.

And we'd like to see that spare capacity back to low levels more in line with historic trends. So as we sit
here today, 2022 is looking like a year of transition. Spare capacity is going to come back online at the
scheduled rate that should translate into rising inventory levels. And if things move forward, we could be
looking at a balanced market sometime in the first half of '22. For us, for EOG in a scenario like that, we
could probably return to maybe our pre-COVID levels of oil production around that 465,000 barrel a day
mark. That would represent no more than 5% growth next year.

But again, that's as we're sitting here today. We'll be officially firming up that 2022 plan and watching how
the market develops over the next couple of months. But as we're witnessing, bringing spare capacity
back online has hit some snags. So we're watching to see if is that more routine startup challenges or
is that more structural in nature due to underinvestment. And those 2 factors are going to be just as
important as seeing how the continued demand recovery from COVID really develops with any potential
future lockdowns, so on and so forth. So ultimately, we continue to remain to be disciplined going forward.

Our next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

You actually anticipated large part of my question with your answer to the last one, but maybe just to dial
in on it a little more closely. How far out do you think your view holds or your ability to look at the balance
or unbalance in the oil market? And then once you did see a call to increase your oil activity, how long
would it be before we actually saw it in the public markets in your quarterly financials?

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Charles, thanks for the question. I'll answer the first part of it and then ask Billy to provide a little
bit more color also. The -- how far out we can see the balance or the imbalance? To be perfectly honest,
we're watching a lot of the same things that all of you are, those 3 things that we highlighted. Demand

has recovered pretty aggressively, I would say. I think it's surprised everybody. And then the inventory
numbers in concert with the spare capacity coming back online.

And the spare capacity, again, if you simply look at the schedules that have been laid out and everybody
sticks to the schedules and the supply actually comes back online, that would contemplate some time in
the front half of the year. But as I highlighted and everyone's been seeing, there are some challenges or
hurdles to getting all that spare capacity back online. As far as the color on what we would be looking at,
perhaps Billy can speak to it.

Lloyd W. Helms
COO & President

Yes, Charles. As far as how long it would take before we'd see any response, especially showing up in
our financials, if you just simply look at when we see the signal and then the time we deploy rigs and get
the wells completed and on production, takes usually 3 to 4 months. So you'd start seeing it no earlier
than that, but probably some time a quarter or 2 after so to have a meaningful difference in financial
performance.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. So if I'm understanding you correctly, it would be 2 quarters, maybe you start to see it nearly 3
quarters before there was a real delta.

Lloyd W. Helms
COO & President

That's correct.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Great. And then just one quick follow-up for Tim. And I think you partly addressed this in your earlier
comment. In the past, I recall you guys have talked about a target of $2 billion of cash on the balance
sheet. With this new $5 billion share authorization in a slightly different posture about wanting to have
some dry powder, does that mean that your target for $2 billion of cash? And I recognize you're not
always going to be at the target, but does that mean that the target has gone north of that? And if so, has
it gone to $3 billion or $4 billion? Or what's your thinking?

Timothy K. Driggers
Executive VP & CFO

No. We haven't changed our target. We will continue to monitor that through the cycle and see there's
all sorts of factors we have to take into consideration for the cash balance, as you know, working capital
changes, for example, as prices swing up and down. So that's a big consideration. But no, it has not
changed. The authorization has not changed our philosophy on the cash balance.

Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I don't want to belabor this just on the growth in reinvestment. But I just want to make sure I'm clear
on this. You guys have been quite clear about returns. I just want to make sure that I'm certain around
the priority about the moderating reinvestment rate in order to drive the cash returns. Is that what I'm
hearing over growth?

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

14

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

Yes, Neal. When we think about moving forward, we've done a lot on reinvesting and building this
company to take a bit of a step away from the commodity price cycles by focusing in on the premium wells
and now double premium strategy. The growth for us has always been an output of our ability to reinvest
at high rates of return. Through 2017 to 2019, during a period of rapid growth for the industry, in fact, we
are reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year and putting that
towards an aggressively growing base dividend.

So the strategy for us hasn't really changed. I think we've talked about potentially watching the macro
environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year-to-year. And that's where it falls in line with
what we've been discussing over the last couple of questions. We still remain very committed to that.
We don't want to push barrels into a market that's oversupplied or doesn't need the barrels. And so we'll
be looking for the right time to see if the market needs our barrels before contemplating any return to
growth.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Very good. Very clear. And then just a follow-up on -- I asked earlier about -- it looks like you all had been
adding a little bit of gas hedges. Is that in relation to -- does that mean that you've been increasing the
focus on the Dorado play, given what natural gas prices are doing? So I guess I'm just wondering are the
2 correlated? Or are you adding to that activity in the Dorado?

Lloyd W. Helms
COO & President

Yes, Neal, this is Billy Helms. So as far as the volume of gas hedges and then what we've been doing
there, it really is not focused strictly on Dorado. It's simply -- it goes back to our premium strategy as we
displayed out. It's based on a $40 oil and a $2.50 gas price. We saw the opportunity to lock in gas prices
above $3. So it gave us encouragement of locking in returns over the next several years at those prices.
We have gas production quite a bit, as you know, in Dorado, but also quite a bit in other plays as well. So
it just helps ensure locking in returns over a multiyear period.

Operator

Our next question will come from Scott Hanold with RBC.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I'm going to try, Ezra. I know you'll probably give me the answer, that you'll talk about the budget next
year. But if I could talk about it more big picture, if -- we all think of just a base maintenance spending
levels into 2022. Would -- has the capital changed too much from what you all did this year? Like what
would be the puts and takes from that? Because it seems like your well costs are going to hold pretty
steadily. So is sort of your maintenance CapEx case this year somewhat similar to what it would be next
year, all else being equal? Or are there anything else to consider?

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Scott, this is Ezra. And we'll talk about next year's budget next year. I'd say that a little bit facetiously
for you. But quite frankly, I think we haven't updated our maintenance capital number yet. We'll provide
that number commensurate with our plans laid out next year. But I think what you can see is that our
team continues to make great progress in sustainable well cost reductions through their efficiency
gains and applying innovation and technology. And I think Billy highlighted pretty well that we feel very
confident that we achieved our first initial goal, I should say, a 5% well cost reduction, and we're in line to
reduce our cost 7% this year. And we feel that a lot of those costs are what's going to insulate us against
some of the inflationary pressures out there.

about that any differently?

No, Scott. Really over the last few years, a lot of our percentage dedicated towards exploration and ESG
have been pretty consistent.

Operator

Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Ezra, I think your share price reaction today, I think you can see the market's response to the greater
cash returns. I'm wondering why is it reluctant seemingly still from EOG to provide a framework around
the proportion of cash returns? It seems to be a persistent barrier perhaps to recognition of sustainable
free cash flow, which at the end of the day is what defines the value. I'm just wondering why there's a
reluctance not to commit to or at least lay out some kind of framework as to how you think about the go-
forward cash returns as opposed to one-off special dividends.

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Doug. It's a question that we've been answering. And we feel that we have provided a framework for
our free cash flow priorities. It's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend, to strengthen
the balance sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions. And then more on point with your question, the
other cash return options, which are special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. And in a
lot of ways, when we look back, I think we've shown our commitment to that, not only this year, with
committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over year-to-date free cash flow generation of about $3.5
billion.

But I think we added a slide into the deck that shows longer term what we've been able to do in providing
just over 5 -- just over $5 billion of free cash flow return since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash
flow generated. And so I think we've laid out a framework. I think our 2 announcements this year on
special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials really demonstrates our commitment to it. And
as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number, I think we've
demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free
cash flow.

To us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. We do want to continue
to make decisions based on what we think. We'll create the most significant long-term shareholder value.
And that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really
taking a longer-term approach. And so locking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as
conditions change is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. I understand that. I guess it's a moving piece. Maybe my follow-up is related then. I want to talk
specifically about the buyback. There's been a lot of reference to the '16, '19 period. And you know the
history. It was a subsidized environment. You doubled production. Saudi was taking oil off the market,
and we all see how that ended. So we know what the response to the industry has been. But I want to
get specifically to your view of mid-cycle and how you think then about the relative priorities around mid
cycle. What is your definition of mid cycle? And how should we think about growth versus growth per
share given the buyback announcement?

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Well, Doug, I don't think I'm comfortable getting into mid-cycle metrics on here. But what I would tell
you is we continue to think of this buyback as opportunistic. We think, again, with our authorization
in place, we want to use it in a way that we feel confident we're going to be generating long-term
shareholder value. More often than not, for us, that's going to tend towards special dividends and we're
going to reserve our buyback authorizations to be used really just in times of dislocations and you use it
opportunistically rather than a more programmatic method.

It looks like you turned a couple pads on in Dorado in the third quarter. Any color or commentary there?
Hitting expectations? Exceeding?

Kenneth W. Boedeker
Executive Vice President of Exploration & Production

Yes, Bob, this is Ken. As Billy said earlier, we have turned on several wells in the last few months. And
the color is all of them are at or above our type curve and what our plans were going into the year. We do
have one drilling rig active in the play right now, and we're really moving rapidly up the learning curve.
Again, just to reiterate, this play is really double premium returns and it's competitive for capital with our
oil plays.

Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Ezra, every new CEO has an opportunity to put their own thumbprint on the business and recognize that
you're a part of the prior leadership team as well. But just talk about your early observations as the new
leader of the organization, any subtle changes that you're making. And talking about your messages to
your internal and external stakeholders that you want the market to be aware of.

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes, Neil. I appreciate the question and the opportunity. I think the biggest thing for our investors, our
employees, everyone who's listening to the call is that EOG has got a proven track record. Our strategy
works. The shift to premium strategy has put us on a different trajectory and the shift to double premium
is going to do that as well. The culture of EOG, the people at EOG has always been our competitive
advantage, and that will continue to be that way. Honestly, Neil, the most important thing we can do as a
leadership team is put our employees in a position to succeed where they can really contribute to the best
of their abilities. And that's what we try to do every day. And that's going to translate into, not only our
operational performance that would you see the results of this quarter, but to our financial performance as
well.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

The follow-up is that I appreciate the slide that shows the breakdown of the well costs and how you guys
are ahead of your competition in terms of managing and mitigating some of these inflationary pressures.
As you step back and think about the U.S. oil industry broadly, do you think this is ultimately going to be
a challenge? These inflationary pressures to restart the shale machine and -- in which of these bottlenecks

EOG RESOURCES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

do you worry about the most in terms of being a constraint on the ability to -- for the industry to grow
again?

Lloyd W. Helms
COO & President

Yes, Neil, this is Billy Helms. Certainly, as an industry is seeing, we're seeing quite a bit of inflationary
pressure, mainly in 3 areas, I would say, steel prices, so tubulars; labor, which is -- certainly affects all
industries and then fuel. Those are probably the 3 inflationary pressures that are throughout our industry
and really throughout all industries. The one thing that I think is going to be -- or maybe 2 things -- 2 top
priorities would be probably steel. I think availability of tubulars is something that I think most companies
are struggling with or dealing with, I guess. And then the other one would be labor and is getting enough
people to manage the activity levels.

Just to maybe give you a little bit color then on where EOG sits. Each year, we try to get ahead of the
curve and lock in a certain amount of our services to secure activity, but in this case, also protect us from
inflation. So for instance, in 2021, we protected about 65% of our well cost going into the year. And as a
result of that, plus the improving efficiencies, we were able to reduce our average well cost by about 7%
as Ezra stated earlier.

So during the year, though, we also took advantage and renegotiated many of our services at lower rates
and lock them through -- in through the end of next year. So going into 2022, we expect to have about
50% of our well costs secured. And with over 90% of our drilling rigs secured at lower rates and also 50%
of our frac fleets secured. So we expect to see inflation certainly in items such as steel, labor and fuel,
just like everybody else. But by doing that, we've given ourselves visibility into areas of also improving
efficiencies that we expect to offset much of this inflation. So we're still confident we can keep well cost at
least flat going into next year.

Our next question will come from Michael Scialla with Stifel.

Michael Stephen Scialla
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

It's not a high-level question. Ezra, on your long-term outlook, as you think about the energy transition,
how are you thinking about oil versus natural gas? Is there any preference there? And are any of the
exploration plays focused on gas? Are they all on oil?

Ezra Y. Yacob
CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Michael. Long term, we believe that hydrocarbons are going to have -- be a significant
part of the energy solution long term. Obviously, we need to do, as an industry, a better job with our
emissions profile. But when you think about oil and natural gas, they both go to different markets,
dominantly. Your natural gas essentially is more on your power side and potentially in direct competition
with things such as coal and your renewables. And then your oil transportation -- your oil obviously is a
little more focused on transportation. In general, when I think longer term, I think the energy transition
is going to be significantly slower than oftentimes you hear about, and we're very bullish on the prospects
for both. As far as the exploration plays goes we've said in the past, dominantly, the exploration plays are
all oil focused.

Michael Stephen Scialla
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And Ken, you had said on your CO2 pilot -- or excuse me, your CCS pilot, I think you said you plan
to inject in late '22. That seems to suggest you would not need a Class VI permit. So I'm wondering, is
it fair to say you're reinjecting CO2 into an EOR project? And when you say it's not really economically
competitive with your upstream business, are you planning on capturing 45 tax credits with any of your
projects?

tax credits. Our goal in terms of what class a permit that we would secure, we believe that we will initially
secure a Class II permit that can be converted. We'll go through all of the regulatory requirements to be
able to convert it to a Class VI later in its life. But that's what the plan is for our CCS project at this point.

Just very quickly on -- can you talk about your LNG or downstream natural gas strategy?

D. Lance Terveen
Senior Vice President of Marketing

This is Lance. Thanks for your question. Yes, we're -- the team is definitely executing. You've seen several
of our slides that we've put back talking a lot about our transportation position, is so incredibly valuable.
We can move gas from all our different basins from the Permian Basin, from the Eagle Ford. We talked a
lot about Dorado earlier. And then with that, it gets access as you look along the Gulf Coast and you look
at the LNG demand, especially that's growing over time.

Obviously, we've got a position there that we started and just really speaks to being a first-mover,
especially when you think about LNG. We went through a whole BD effort kind of '17 and '18. We
got the contracts finalized in 2020. And in 2021, obviously, we're definitely seeing the value of that
contract. So being a first-mover is absolutely important. And yes, we're going to continue to look at new
opportunities from an LNG standpoint and very well positioned. Again, it gets back to our transport, our
export capacities and just having that ability to transact. We can definitely be very nimble as we even
think about new opportunities.

Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC

Got it. And then a follow-up on the buyback. I'm not clear. Are you saying that it's a shelf ability to
buyback shares when you want? Or are you actually going to try and get through this amount in, let's say,
the next 12 months?
