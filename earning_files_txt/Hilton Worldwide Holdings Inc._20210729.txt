Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and
Corporate Development. You may begin.

Jill Slattery
Director, Investor Relations

Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would
like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual
results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking
statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or
revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ
please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.

In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financials on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-
GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our
website at ir.hilton.com.

This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of
the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President of Global
Development, will then review our second quarter results. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take
your questions.

With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think our second quarter
results demonstrate, we continue to make significant progress towards recovery, working hard to serve
all of our stakeholders; for our guests to deliver reliable and friendly experiences in a very demanding
environment,; for our team members to maintain an award-winning culture by creating an inclusive, safe
and welcoming environment full of opportunities; for our owners to drive value through premium market
share and efficient and effective operating models; for our communities to remain a positive force for good
at a time when it is needed most; and finally, for our shareholders to maximize profits, free cash flow and
overall total returns.

We're pleased to see that our diligence and determination are beginning to pay off. As much of the world
reopens, the pent-up demand for travel we've been anticipating is happening. While the pace of recovery
varies and COVID variants remain a risk, we are seeing significant sequential improvement in every major
region.

In the second quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was
down 36%, improving 17 percentage points versus the first quarter, with June RevPAR improving 24
percentage points versus the first quarter and down only 29 points versus 2019.

Additionally, 30% of system-wide comparable hotels exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in June. Adjusted
EBITDA was $400 million, up 684% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand and
rate growth. For the second quarter, U.S. leisure demand exceeded prior peak levels, with rates at 90% of
prior peaks. This positive momentum continued into July with system-wide and U.S. leisure room nights
and rate exceeding 2019 levels.

HILTON WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Business transient also increased meaningfully throughout the quarter, with June RevPAR for the segment
increasing 20 percentage points from the first quarter. We saw improving results in small- and medium-
sized businesses and positive momentum across larger accounts. In June, business transient room night
demand was 70% of 2019 levels, with rate over 80% of 2019 levels. We continue to see progress in July
with similar room night demand and rates at 90% of 2019 levels.

Group performance in the quarter also improved sequentially, driven primarily by social groups given
seasonally higher leisure demand. Overall, group demand increased nearly 20 percentage points
sequentially from the first quarter, ending June at more than half of 2019 levels.

Additionally, group bookings for next year are at rates above 2019 peaks. Approximately 99% of our
hotels are now open and operating, including some of our largest urban and group properties. In the
last few months, we were thrilled to celebrate the reopenings of the legendary Palmer House Hilton, the
Chicago Hilton and the Hilton San Francisco Union Square.

As government restrictions loosen and more people are vaccinated, we continue to see positive
momentum in demand and an increasing ability to push rate. For July month-to-date, system-wide
demand is 85% of 2019 levels, with rates equal to 2019.

In the U.S., July RevPAR is roughly 85% of 2019 levels. And in China, RevPAR is now above prior peak.
With increasing transient bookings, digital traffic and group sales leads, we are optimistic about the
forward trends.

Turning to development. We delivered another robust quarter of growth, with net units increasing 7%
year-over-year ahead of expectations due to strong openings in the U.S. and fewer overall removals.
During the quarter, we added 119 hotels totaling nearly 20,000 rooms and celebrated the 5-year
anniversary of Tru with the opening of its 200th property. With nearly 270 hotels in development, Tru
continues expanding across the U.S. and Canada as well as moving into new markets in the Caribbean and
Latin America.

We were also thrilled to celebrate the highly anticipated opening of Resorts World Las Vegas last month,
marking the first ground-up resort development on the strip in over a decade. The property features 3
of our premium brands, Hilton, Conrad and LXR and adds 3,500 rooms to our portfolio, with expansive
meeting and event space, 120,000 square foot casino, 40 world-class food and beverage options and a
concert and entertainment venue with capacity for 5,000 attendees. This spectacular property raises the
bar for Las Vegas and delivers on our long-standing promise to return to The Strip.

Along with the recently opened Virgin Hotels Las Vegas Curio, we are now -- we now have more than 30
properties totaling 11,000 rooms across 12 brands in the city. Las Vegas is also the first U.S. market to
house all 3 of our luxury brands.

Earlier this month, we debuted our premier meetings and events focused brands Signia by Hilton, with
the opening of the Signia Orlando Bonnet Creek. The property will undergo a multiphase transformation
featuring the addition of more than 94,000 square feet of multifunctional meeting and event space
designed for an elevated meeting experience. In the quarter, we also broke ground on the nearly 1,000
room Signia Atlanta scheduled to open in 2023. Our exceptional brands and industry-leading RevPAR
premiums continue to drive a high-quality pipeline.

In the quarter, we signed nearly 26,000 rooms, up 40% year-over-year and increasing from our first
quarter pace given strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. We ended the quarter with
approximately 401,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction. We
had a record number of conversion signings in the quarter, representing 40 hotels and accounting
for approximately 30% of our total signings, including the Conrad Chia Laguna, Sardinia, the Conrad
Shanghai, which will be our largest Conrad in Asia with more than 725 rooms, and the Hotel 1000 LXR
located just steps away from Seattle's iconic Pike Place Market.

Further expanding our all-inclusive and luxury portfolios, we announced the signing of 3 beachfront resorts
in Mexico earlier this month: The Hilton Vallarta Riviera All-Inclusive Resort; the Hilton Tulum All-Inclusive
Resort; and the Conrad Tulum, will add more than 1,500 rooms to our existing 70 hotel portfolio in Mexico,

demonstrating our commitment to continued expansion across the region and growing our all-inclusive
resort footprint. Travelers will soon be able to choose from an even wider variety of Hilton-branded all-
inclusive resorts globally.

We expect the positive development trends to continue and remain confident in our expectations to deliver
mid-single-digit net unit growth over the next several years. For 2021, we expect net unit growth in the
5% to 5.5% range, above prior expectations given the pace of openings year-to-date. Delivering on guest
desire for more flexibility in their travel experience and solving a long-time travel frustration, last month,
we launched confirmed connecting rooms, a first in the industry, this innovative technology enables guests
to easily book and instantly confirm at least 2 connecting rooms. As families and friends begin to reunite,
reconnect and travel again, we're excited to create a seamless travel experience from booking through
stay.

We continue to prioritize unique opportunities to engage our nearly 120 million Honors members, driving
value for them through our enhanced partnerships and points redemption offerings. In the quarter,
membership grew 10% year-over-year. On average, our premium members are staying with us even more
frequently than in 2019. For the quarter, Honors members accounted for 58% of occupancy, reaching a
high of 61% in May, only 2% below May of 2019.

As we head into the back half of the year, we know it's critical to lead with our culture, which was recently
earned -- which recently earned us the #1 spot on DiversityInc's list of top 50 companies for diversity. We
were also thrilled to invite all of our team members to return to our headquarters last week. The energy
and excitement in the office is palpable, and we're thrilled to be back fostering a collaborative environment
which allows for innovative thinking as we remain focused on our strategic priorities and the bright future
ahead.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results for the quarter.

Kevin J. Jacobs
CFO & President of Global Development

Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8%
versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as recovery accelerated driven by strong
global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restrictions and surging leisure demand, particularly in the
U.S.

As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 36.1% compared to 2019. Performance was largely
balanced between occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million in the second quarter,
and those results reflect relaxed travel restrictions and strengthening global demand. Management and
franchise fees grew 220%, demonstrating the resiliency of our fee-based business model.

Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels.
Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the more challenged demand environment
throughout Europe and Japan and related suspensions of hotel operations. Fixed operating costs further
weighed on performance. Overall, the ownership segment performed better than expected, largely due to
continued cost control for the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.56.

Turning to our regional performance. Second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year
and was down 31% versus 2019. Demand improved sequentially throughout the quarter, with occupancy
averaging roughly 70% in June. Strong leisure demand, combined with improving business transient
trends drove rate improvement across the U.S. with weekend ADR finishing June, down mid-single digits
as compared to 2019 rate and weekday rates down in the high single digits.

In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 390% year-over-year and was down
54% versus 2019. While limited international travel weighed on overall performance, easing restrictions
and strong leisure demand drove improving trends in June.

HILTON WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

In Europe, RevPAR grew 470% year-over-year and was down 72% versus 2019. While the region saw
month-over-month improvement, rising COVID cases and prolonged travel restrictions continued to weigh
on performance.

In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 287% year-over-year and was down 35% versus
2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand, with rate now nearly recovered to
2019 levels in July.

In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR grew 143% year-over-year and was down 33% versus
2019. RevPAR in China was down less than 9% as compared to 2019, with rising COVID cases in June
temporarily disrupting strong performance trends in April and May.

However, as Chris mentioned, China has since rebounded with RevPAR now trending above 2019 levels.
In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, performance was tempered due to lockdowns in India and continued
travel restrictions across Japan.

Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the second quarter, we grew net units 7%. Our pipeline
grew sequentially, totaling 401,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 62% of pipeline rooms located
outside the U.S. Despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, developer appetite for Hilton
brands remained strong across the globe. As travel restrictions ease, regions prepare for recovery and
owners focus on growth opportunities, development activity and interest is gaining momentum.

For the full year, we expect signings to increase in the high single to low double-digit range year-over-
year. We expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%.

Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we fully repaid the outstanding $1.2 billion balance on
our revolving credit facility. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet and financial
flexibility as we move forward into the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. Further
details on our second quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.

This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

You gave some great color on NUG, but I'd like to peel back the onion a bit more. Specifically, can you
discuss how net unit growth expectations have evolved over the quarter as we look around the world,
where your increased confidence comes from across things like brands, ads, leases, conversions and how
the financing environment is changing as we consider not only this year but sustained growth beyond?

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Stephen, thank you. Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about
around the world, on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development
is probably the simplest way to think about it. So versus our earlier expectations and why we're a bit more
optimistic, obviously, and have raised our outlook for the year is largely driven by what we were seeing
in faster recovery in the U.S. and faster recovery in Asia, really China. And I'd say those are sort of the
largest drivers.

If you think about recovery, that's where -- as we suggested in the prepared comments, that's where we
see the steepest slope of recovery. Europe is obviously -- we knew would be lagging and isn't contributing
as much as the U.S. and China is at this point. But obviously, our expectation there is as the U.K. and
Europe continue to open, we'll see a meaningful uptick there. So I think it's pretty much that simple slope
of recovery steeper, more activity on the development side in terms of both signings and openings, people
are back at it and picking up steam.

On the conversions, I'd say just modestly better. We -- as you would note from prior calls, we've been
-- we've had high expectations for conversions. We have some great conversion brands. The system is
performing at the highest levels from a market share point of view than it's ever performed in our history,
and I think that's a great leading indicator for opportunities to convince folks who are independent to
come into the fold as well as folks that have weaker brands that are looking for a better performance to
come into the fold, both of which are happening at a little bit better than our expectations. And so while
we had -- we expected things to pick up in the conversion area. I would say, this year and then leading
into next because a lot of -- some of the signings will take some time. Most of them have pretty quickly,
but some of them will take some time in terms of CapEx work, property improvement programs and the
like. It's modestly better than what were pretty high expectations.

In terms of the financing environment, I mean, there's a lot to discuss. I think -- so we can get to lots
of other questions. I think the simple answer is it's improving. I mean the world is a big place. So again,
following the slope of recovery, the U.S. and China, I would say, the financing markets are recovering
most rapidly because markets are efficient. And performance is starting to really pick up and not just from
an occupancy, but you're getting back to rate levels very rapidly, probably more rapidly than I've ever
seen in my 40 years of doing this.

What happens is the lender community starts to have more confidence. Rates are obviously hyper low and
have been low and lenders need yield. And so the more comfort they get, that recovery is afoot and that
there's going to be a recovery back to where we were and then beyond, the more they're willing to take
the risk, go a little bit further out on the risk spectrum and underwrite it.

And so you're seeing pretty robust financing markets in China. The U.S. is still -- has a ways to go. I
mean you can look at the data out there, it's not anywhere near where it was, but it's improving. And my
expectation is as you get into the fall, and I'm sure we'll talk about this, I'll leave it for other questions.

HILTON WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

And our belief, my belief is that we're going to continue to have very, very strong recovery in the fall and
into next year, you're going to continue to see a gradual increase in financing that's available, certainly,
here in the U.S. I think Europe will take a little longer. So a ways to go. I'm not saying it's back anywhere
near where it was. It's a long way off. But of sort of off the floors of what we had seen last year.

Operator

Next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Chris, could you talk a little bit about how you guys plan to use key money in development spend? And
obviously, in light of the financing environment that you just talked about and the way that's coming
around, is it something you guys maybe rely on a little bit more in the near term and then start to wean
away from it as we get more comfortable with kind of the outlook for new unit growth and things of that
nature.

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that's a good question. We -- if you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in
the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is I don't see anything that -- I don't think
anything is changing materially, meaning, still over 90% of the deals that we are doing are dry deals.
We're not spending -- we're not using the balance sheet anyway. So there's not any material shift, given
what's going on in the broader macro environment, the financing markets. Nothing material that shifted.

The reason you're seeing a little bit heavier key money spend right now is a super positive story in the
sense that both things that we've been working on for a long time and/or opportunities that have arisen
because of the pandemic have sort of come together in an unusual way this year. So example, some of
the bigger key money expenditures are iconic assets for our portfolio largely resort-oriented that we've
been working on that will be generational. They'll be in the system for decades and decades and decades.
So the Waldorf Astoria in Monarch Beach and Laguna, I've literally been working on that deal one way or
another for 20 years, I think, between host and here. And that's in the system, an incredible addition to
the Waldorf brand.

Resorts World, which I talked about in my prepared comments, 3,500 rooms on The Strip. We're basically
the only major player on The Strip with a massive meetings platform and 3,500 rooms. We've been
working on that for a number of years. Not a crazy amount of key money by any means, but relative to
our normal expenditures, is significant.

And then the deals that I talked about in Mexico, the 3 deals, 1,500 rooms, in Puerto Vallarta and then
in Tulum, these are incredible assets that were either existing in the one case, and PV was an existing
hotel that was operating with another brand. And in the case of Tulum, was developed literally over 20
years to get the entitlements with another brand. And because of COVID and what has happened in the
industry, presented an opportunity for us. And so that allowed us to enter the zone on hotels that would
have taken us a decade to sort of pull together, and in a matter of 6 or 12 months, we're going to have
these purpose-built incredible hotels in the system.

And so that's, I know, a long answer, but I view all of those, and then there's some others that I'm not
going to be mentioning. But those are the big ones that's like incredible progress for us in all-inclusive,
in resorts and in luxury. And those deals just don't come around that often. We're getting a few more of
them now, as I said, aided by COVID. So maybe there -- I would say, our spending overall is going to
be up probably this year and next year relative to 2020, but 2020 was a depressed year. If you look at
it versus our normal run rate like '17, '18 and '19, honestly, I think our overall CapEx is sort of going to
be within the ranges that we would have been. But again, I don't see anything -- we don't see anything
material. We still think over 90% of our deals are going to be dry. And when we have these really unique
opportunities, even with key money, they're very nice returns for us, and they're incredibly, I think,
strategic and important to the system.

The next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Given significant progress we've seen in the operating environment, given your balance sheet and where
your leverage ratios are heading by the end of this year, I was hoping you could give us an update on how
you're thinking about what you're looking at, which might be obvious, but -- and how you're looking at the
timing of resuming capital return.

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Great. Great question. I figured I'd get it and I figured I'd get it early. So thank you. I know that's on
everybody's mind. And we have obviously talked a bunch about it. We, ultimately, that's a decision we'll go
to our board with. We have an upcoming meeting. We've had broader dialogue, but we haven't pinned it
down. But I said on the last call that I was pretty confident that we would be reinstituting return of capital
program next year. I still feel that way. Obviously, the slope of the recovery is even steeper. So I would
say the update to that would be, I feel confident that we're going to do in the first half of next year. The
exact date and time to be determined when we talk to our Board.

But I think you should read the results of second quarter, you should read the commentary that Kevin and
I gave in our prepared comments, plus everything, you're hopefully going to get in color to say that we're
very optimistic. We know we're not -- we read the papers, I talk to a lot of people. We're not oblivious to
the delta variant and things that are going on in the world, but we're confident because we think we will
power through that. The trends that we see real time are very strong and improving. We feel really good
about that going to happen in the fall. And so yes, we -- every quarter that goes by, I think we feel better
and better about where the recovery is going. And so that should ultimately translate into our feeling
better about starting to return capital because we'll be generating real significant free cash flow. In my
mind next year, and we do not need to hoard it, our belief has always been that, as I said in my prior
answer, we're going to be able to keep growing with very little use of our own balance sheet. And so we're
going to give it back to folks. So my expectation is in the first half of next year, that program will resume,
and we'll be having some discussion with our Board in the very near future.

Operator

The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

Chris, you mentioned a couple of times now just talking about that recovery in the fall. So I was hoping
we could dig in there a little bit. I know you're sort of probably right at the cusp of when you have too
much color you can actually share on the corporate side. But can you talk about how that is starting to
firm up, be it September, October, and what data you have? And then last quarter, you talked a little bit
about an exit trajectory for the year of possibly something in the down 30% range, and I appreciate --
it may be a little early to give an update to that, but kind of how are you thinking about that relative to
maybe where we were 3 months ago?

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes, totally fair question. That's the $64,000 question I think everybody is trying to figure out. So I'll
give you -- I mean we do have some data points and some -- and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I
mean, we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I both described in the nuggets that we gave in our comments
that you wouldn't find in the press release, we've seen really nice recovery, and that recovery has been
across the board. Obviously, the greatest strength in leisure, but significant pickup in business travel and
significant pickup while -- further to go in the group side. And we continue to see that, notwithstanding

the delta variant and all the things going on. Like I got just last night, as an example, system-wide U.S.,
occupancy was 74% Trailing 7 days, 74%. That's with the urban markets, with some urban hotels not
even open and those are in the comp set. And with all of our -- so all of the urban hotels, obviously, the
urban environment has been lagging a little bit.

So what that says to you, like last night, if we're running 74%, that's not leisure. I mean while we have
a leisure-oriented hotels, we have a lot of business-oriented hotels. And so mid-week occupancies at that
level are definitely reflective of business travel being back. And we've seen it, literally, it's funny sort of
post Memorial Day I mean, you just saw the shift. You just saw a shift where weekday occupancies went
up 10% or 20%, at any given night, went up 10 or 20 percentage points. And that was business travel,
dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, by the way.

But even pre-COVID, keep in mind, 80% of our business travel was small and medium-sized business,
right? So that's sort of currently what's going on. I know your question is forward looking, and I promise
you I'm going to get to that. I think the trajectory, my own view, and I think the data sort of supports
this, as you get into August, what's going to happen is you're going to continue to have massive surge in
leisure travel because everybody wants to get out, notwithstanding, again, the delta variants and the like.
We've not seen impact in sort of consumer behavior from that. So I think you're going to have continued
very good strength in the leisure.

I do think in August, you'll -- as you always do, you will see business transient fall off a little bit, right, just
because people are going to be, like they always do, they're going to be not traveling for business as much
and going on more vacations. And it's sort of the last hurrah before maybe a lot of people going back to
work. And the kids are finally going back to school and all that fun stuff.

But when you get to the fall, and limited -- we have limited data, obviously, this far out. So this is -- I
gave you data points that I have real time today. When you get 60, 90 days out, business transient stats,
a lot of the bookings haven't occurred. So this is where it gets into my view of what I think will happen.
I think you get after Labor Day, I do believe -- I'm not a health expert, but I'm talking to a lot of them. I
do believe we will have powered through the Delta thing, if you look at the stats on hospitalization and the
like, they're really not, not terrible.

If you look at what's happened in the U.K. and we're sort of 3 or 4 weeks behind them, the patterns there
right now are quite good. They have infection rates down 50% on a trailing 12 day basis over there. So I
think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we sort of power through that. And when we get to the
fall, here's what I think we do know, kids are going back to school. I mean, we'll debate whether they're
wearing masks or not. Some places, yes, but they're going back to school, and I'm pretty confident in
that.

And offices are opening. I mean they may open different times. Some people, you're reading, you're going
to push it a month or whatever. Obviously, I said we're open. We're open and operating here at our -- at
all of our headquarters. But you're going to have people back at work, which means with kids in school,
with baby sitters and with people in the office, you're going to have more propensity to want to travel.

And when we talk to customers, again, I can't give you the booking data because it's too far out. When we
talk to customers, anecdotally, it supports all of that, that when you get into the fall, people are going to
be traveling. There's both pent-up demand, okay, if things they've been needing to do, and then there's
just demand, generally, to -- for folks to be able to run their businesses. And so I think as you get into
the fall, you're going to see the natural reduction in the leisure, as we always do, because now kids are in
school. They weren't last year. Kids are in school, people are back in the office, they don't have as much
time to go on vacation.

I do believe, again, I can't prove it, but my belief is leisure will be elevated for a while because we're still
living in a bit of a hybrid world. But I think business transient will come back. Group will obviously take a
little longer gestation period, but group will definitely be coming back, the booking trends into the third,
particularly the fourth quarter are much better than they've been.

And I think we're motoring forward. In terms of -- last time, I believe I said that I think we'd be back to
sort of 70% by the end of the year, of '19 levels. And obviously, I feel better. So while we're not giving
guidance, so I'm not going to do it. We're not ready to start doing that. There's still enough uncertainty,
we want to wait. We do, do forecast, okay? I mean we're not -- it's not [indiscernible] here. We are
looking at our numbers.

And I'd say our view is demand levels probably -- RevPAR levels are probably in the U.S. and globally
somewhere circa 80% versus the 70% I thought. In our current thinking, demand levels probably back
to 85%. So we're getting there. And we're -- I mean, again, much -- I said last time, recovery has been
much steeper than we thought. I say it again today. Just things have been coming back more quickly than
we would have thought. We knew they'd come back. Obviously, you all know I've been optimistic about
the recovery, but it's even better than I would have thought.

I think one of the most surprising things, although it shouldn't be to any of us because as I kid our team,
the laws of economics are alive and well. And the most surprising thing is how quickly rate comes back.
But that's -- again, that's just demand, right? We're pricing demand, we're being really smart about it. But
I do believe when this -- when we look back on this recovery, the most unusual thing, relative to any other
period of my almost 40 years of doing this, will be just a rapid return of rate.

The next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi.

Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on that. I wanted to follow up a little bit on that. I think in your opening
remarks, you said that your group bookings are trending greater now in 2022 than they were in 2019,
which I think is a pretty big positive increase sequentially from what you've mentioned on your first
quarter call. And I was just hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the composition of those
groups and what you're seeing on the rate side. And maybe just kind of a little more color around folks'
willingness to book group at this point.

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Still -- great question, still building. What I said is that all of our bookings for 2022 are at rates that
are greater than 2019. So to be specific, rate. I didn't say volume. Volume is still a bit off just because it
takes time to build the book. So my expectation is we get closer to next year and in the next year. In the
year for the -- later in this year, particularly when you get past this Delta wave and then in the year, for
the year, we'll be a barn burner year, bigger than anything we've ever seen in the year for the year simply
because people have to meet. It takes time to plan it. They want to sort of get through their budget
season before, they know how much money they have.

But I'm not worried about the volumes next year. Again, they're a bit -- they're not where we were at
'19. They're close, but they're not there, but the rate is above. And so what I've been -- honestly, what
I've been saying to our teams is be really careful, like we -- there's going to be a monumental amount
of demand, we don't want to give it away. We want to make sure that we're pricing. Even though we're
not at the volumes now, my expectation, very strongly, is it's all going to fill in. It just takes it a little bit
longer, given what's the reason for this recession being a health issue. And sort of getting through the
final stages of that, in my opinion, is required before you really get the momentum on the volume. And so
that's why rates are up is because we're being super disciplined, recognizing that there's a limited amount
of meeting space, there's going to be a gargantuan amount of demand, and we can be a bit patient, I
think, given what's going on.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So on net unit growth, you've obviously seen some great progression in terms of your guide, and you
gave some helpful color earlier. But do you think you can get back to the 6% to 7% unit growth you were
putting up pre-COVID? And if so, when?

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I do. And I think it's probably sometime between '23 and '24, Kevin?

Kevin J. Jacobs
CFO & President of Global Development

Yes.

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Kevin is also Head of Development. So I want to make sure he's -- before I commit to him. Yes, I think it's
sometime in '23, '24. Probably more '24 just because you got to get through the -- if you look at starts
last year, you'd look at -- I mean, if you look at the progression, you'll see when we're done last year, we
were down in starts. This year, we'll be down modestly, not nearly as much as last year in starts. And I
think that's the bottom. And then I think next year, we'll be ramping up in starts. And I think if you just
play that through, that's what gets us in the mid-single digits for the next sort of couple of years, 2 or 3
and then I think you're back in business in the 6% to 7% range.

Kevin J. Jacobs
CFO & President of Global Development

Yes, if the average construction time or gestation period in the pipeline is 2.5 or 3 years, you've got to be
2.5 or 3 years past the bottom before you get back to your old run rate.

Operator

And the next question is from Robin Farley from UBS.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes, I wanted to ask you about the pipeline as well. You mentioned that conversions were, I think you said
30% of signings. I'm wondering what percent of openings that was in Q2 and maybe what you expect it
to be for the full year? And then just on the theme of pipeline, you mentioned mid-single digits for the
next 2 or 3 years. I think last quarter, you had said that 2022 might be kind of in the 4% to 5% range,
but maybe lower than this year, just given that there was some kind of construction catch up this year. So
I'm wondering with the higher unit growth rate here in '21. Does that carry through to sort of continued
acceleration into '22? Or in fact, is it bringing forward some things you thought would open in '22 that kind
of bring forward into '21, and so maybe we'd still see that slightly lower rate closer to 4% next year than
the 5% for '22?

Kevin J. Jacobs
CFO & President of Global Development

Yes, Robin, thank. All good questions, I think I've got it. I'll try to go in order. I think on the conversion
front, openings were lower. I don't remember the exact percentage, but they were circa 10% of openings
for the quarter. And that was just timing. I'd say, last year, we were sort of 19%, 20% of openings. I think
this year, it will be that or maybe even a little bit higher given sort of the number of signings we had in the
second quarter. And so that's -- I think that's a good way to think about it.

And look, we are doing more conversions. Very happy with the conversions in the second quarter, really
nice mix between hard brands, soft brands, conversions from independents, conversions from other

brands regionally. So very happy with that. But that said, our pace of deliveries of new builds is going up
as well. So it's sort of hard -- it's a little bit harder for that percentage to move. And of course, that's all
baked into our outlook.

The idea of -- I'll do the third one next, the idea of '22 being affected, not as much. I mean, I think '22 is
going to be about what we expect, maybe a little bit of timing pull forward, replaced by a little bit more
conversions. So 2022 is about the same as we thought. And then, yes, you picked up on, we said 4% to
5% for the next several years, we were not pointing to any one specific year when we said 4% to 5%.
And now we're saying mid-single digits, which, of course, 4% to 5% is mid-single digits. So it's about the
same, but I think what you're hearing is a little bit more optimism about the future of net unit growth
given what's been going on lately.

Next question is from Richard Clarke from Bernstein.

Richard J. Clarke
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Just wanted to ask your sort of opinion, your thoughts on labor shortages in the U.S. And there's been
some commentary around drops in service levels. Obviously, it's across the whole industry. But how much
truth is there in that? Or is this working the other way, you actually being able to realize some sort of
bigger efficiencies by working with less on the hotel side level?

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes, thanks, Rick. It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue, probably the single biggest issue
that we're dealing with that is definitely not just for Hilton, but industry -- all service industries and
manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain issues that you're reading about every day. All of this is sort
of interconnected to not having enough labor. At a high level, I think it will largely resolve itself over the
next couple of quarters in the sense that I think there are a lot of complex reasons behind it. Some of it
is obviously health. People still don't feel like, particularly with the Delta variant now that they should go
back to work, some people, because they're worried about their health as already `been -- we haven't
had kids in schools, so we don't effectively have day care. There are women in the workforce or where it's
been most dramatically impacted because they have to stay home to take care of kids.

And then some of the government programs that were really important last year in the depths of this
crisis have -- aren't as important right now when there's a ton of opportunity for employment and that is
unemployment insurance of the federal top-up, but that goes away in early September. So I think when
you get kids back in school, we get past these -- hopefully, the last wave with Delta and unemployment
insurance goes away in the early fall, I think you're going to start to see a significant easing of the issues
on the labor side.

In terms of what -- its impact on margins, given that we're able to -- while there are service issues all of
us are having, we're obviously working awfully hard to deliver great service. And I think we are doing a
very good job given the difficult circumstances. We are doing it with less labor. And so ironically, given
demand and given the ability to price the demand, margins are, in many cases, unbelievably high because
you're getting, effectively, rates that are consistent with what you had before, and you can't get the labor,
so you just have less cost. That obviously is a temporary thing. You're going to have more labor ultimately
in the hotels.

Having said that, long term, we've done a bunch of things in the crisis in terms of testing and learning
on different ways to change the operating model, particularly as it relates to housekeeping and food and
beverage and then a whole host of other smaller things where we think we can deliver great experience
for our customers and do it more efficiently. And so I think when it all gets flushed through, and we're on
the other side of this and through the stresses and strains on the labor issues we're talking about, I think
we have developed a plan to have higher-margin businesses across all the major brands. And so yes, it's

a big issue. We're spending a lot of time on it, but I do -- as the old adage goes, this, too, I think, shall
pass.

And the next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James.

William Andrew Crow
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

A clarification and a question. The clarification is, I think you mentioned that RevPAR was down 29% in
June relative to '19 numbers. And did you say that it was going to be closer to 20% down in the fourth
quarter as we pivot to business travel? That's the clarification.

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I did.

William Andrew Crow
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

The question, I guess, goes to your discussion about rate being the biggest surprise. I'm just -- I'm
wondering if we're already at a point where we can declare victory over rate integrity maybe for the first
time in any recovery, right? Or do we have to wait until -- or do we have to wait until we get into business
travel and really see what lies beneath this leisure surge?

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes. On the first one, I answered it well, maybe you didn't hear because I was -- and I apologize talking
over you. But yes, on the first. That's what I said, to clarify the first question.

You know me, Bill, I tend to be a little -- under promise, over deliver is my theory in life, so I don't want
to declare victory yet on rate. I meant what I said. I mean I've been doing this a long time, and been
through bunches of recessions at this point. And what I'm seeing is very atypical. So -- and I do believe
that into the fall and next year, we're going to continue to have robust demand and improvement. So
I think the rate story, as I said in my earlier comment, when we look back on it, I think that's going to
be the real difference in recovery here, but I don't know about declaring -- I don't know about declaring
victory. George W. Bush did it on an aircraft carrier. It didn't work out for him.

William Andrew Crow
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

It didn't work out so well.

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

But listen, it's nice to see. It's nice to see, but it's -- again, it's just a function of demand. It's then being
smart in how do you price demand.

Our next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.

Charles Patrick Scholes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Quick question here, and this is sort of just sort of looking for a ballpark answer. But with the labor
issue out there, what percentage of your hotels right now are unable to sell full inventory due to staffing
shortages?

HILTON WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

I can't -- I don't have a scientific answer for you. I would say, sort of atmospherically, I think it's a
relatively small percentage of our portfolio. It definitely -- there are definitely some hotels that can't
because I've talked to some owners, but -- and I was with a bunch of owners out of Dallas this week and
labor was probably the #1 topic because it's what everybody's talking about. But I'm not -- I'm just giving
you the atmosphere, I don't -- we don't -- I don't have our data on it. I think that it is an issue but not a
significant issue.

And by the way, it's helping, to a degree -- it's also helping with rate because in some markets where they
can't, they're reducing capacity and driving rate, which, by the way, back to Bill Crow, when we're done
with it, maybe we can declare victory that we were actually really smart about not only rate recovery, but
sort of how we manage occupancy versus rate to drive the best profitability.

So in the hotels where they are having issues, in many of them, and I can think of a few who I just talked
to, are having great success in sort of moderating occupancy levels down and then driving it on the top
line.

And net-net, they're making more money than if they had the incremental labor and they opened up
the capacity. They're just -- their profitability is higher. So it's not all a bad story. Long term, obviously,
the labor issues we have to sort -- I mean I already gave my answer. I do think they'll sort. There are a
bunch of things we're doing to make sure that our system has unique opportunities to access labor and,
ultimately, deliver the kind of service we want to deliver, we do need to get more labor in the hotels. But
at the moment, from an owner point of view, in many cases, some are limiting capacity, but I think it's a
relatively small percentage.

Operator

Next question will be from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Two questions, if I may. Within the sort of franchise fees line item, we're sort of in a moment where it's --
candidly, nothing is easy to model, I assume, for either of us. But that one in particular was much larger
than what we had, and I know that there is a number of things in there. Getting to franchise fees should
be straightforward. But Kevin, if you could give us just a little insight on the other pieces that are in there,
right? There's credit card fees and there are some royalties in there and sort of how those flow, a little
modeling would be welcome.

Kevin J. Jacobs
CFO & President of Global Development

Yes, David, it's hard and easy all at the same time. I mean, basically, overall fee growth was a bit lower
than overall RevPAR growth, that's your question. And the real -- the short answer is, yes, license fees
are growing. By the way, they're growing really strongly. I think license fees were up something like 80%
in the second quarter, but that's obviously a lot less than RevPAR growth at 234%. And so just the math
ends up being a little bit less than RevPAR. And so when we -- when we're in this period of RevPAR growth
being sort of at these really elevated rates because of the crazy comps, we're going to be a little bit lower
than fee growth. On a long-term basis, it should be about 1 to 1. So that's sort of the easiest way I can
sort of lay it out. We said it's hard to model though. Sorry about that.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's okay. No, whatever you got, I will take. If I may ask a similar question around sort of owned and
leased. It's not -- certainly not the biggest part within your model. But if you don't mind my asking, any
color on sort of how that recovers and grows out in the future would be helpful as well.

HILTON WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Kevin J. Jacobs
CFO & President of Global Development

Yes, it's totally fair question. I mean, it's sort of telegraphed a little bit in our prepared remarks, again,
pretty straightforward. I mean, that portfolio is concentrated in places like the U.K., Central Europe and
Japan, in particular, that are just behind in the trajectory of recovery. So all the things we talked about,
there's nothing structural there. It's just it's behind. It obviously was loss-making this quarter. It probably
will be loss-making next quarter just because of the level of recovery and what's going to be needed in
those parts of the world. And we think it's sort of breakeven-ish in Q4. We'll see what happens. Again, it's
dependent on recovery and the world opening up a little bit. And then the last thing I'd say is, obviously,
it's going to grow more quickly than the core business. So it's going to contribute positively to our growth
going forward because it's going to be growing off of a much lower base.

The next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.

Vince Charles Ciepiel
Cleveland Research Company

I wanted to come back to the Honors contribution, which sounded really high. I think you said around
60%, which is maybe a few points under 2019. And that's all while business transient is still, I think,
30 points off. I think that usually over-indexes to brand direct. So just curious how you think this direct
contribution evolves through the pandemic. Usually, there's a narrative that OTAs take share, but it seems
like your direct business is really impressive. How do you think it evolves over the course of the next year?

Christopher J. Nassetta
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, over the next year, it's probably harder to judge. Over the next several years, obviously, our
objective is to continue to enhance the value proposition for Honors, such that, as I've been saying for a
long time, you're sort of crazy not to be a member of Honors. You get all the technology, you get a little
bit of a discounted rate. You get the points. You can use the points to shop on Amazon, buy a concert
ticket at Live Nation, go travel the world and get rooms or food and beverage or a spa treatment or
whatever. It's very much an opportunity to sort of create value.

And if you're not an Honors member and you're staying with us, you're sort of silly, I mean, just because
you're effectively giving away value. And so that happens to be true. Obviously, we've been trying to, over
the years, as I've talked about many times on these calls, sort of go high and low, make sure that for our
most frequent travelers, it's a really relevant program, which I think we've done, but infrequent travelers
as well. And that's probably been what's most game-changing for us, and I think it's helped us, sort of
over the last 5 years, lead the industry in percentage of occupancy represented by loyalty, which is we've
made it relevant to somebody that travels 2 or 3 days a year and not just 60 or 100 days a year because
it's a currency effectively, and there's a value proposition that works for them.

And so being specific about it, we want to continue that. I mean my own view is we were running in the
60s pre-COVID. My goals are much higher for that pre-COVID, and I'm not letting up. I mean COVID
set us back, but I think COVID also provided opportunities. And as you pointed out, in May, we were
effectively only a couple of points different than we were in '19. Why would that be when our core traveler
is not back? Well, I think it's 2 things. One, in May and June, our core travelers started to come back.
Number two, we worked really hard in how we sort of shifted our upper funnel and lower funnel strategies
for marketing to attract customers into the system that were traveling during COVID that weren't our core
customers.

And so we were able to get a bunch of those folks to say, "Gosh, I would like to be an Honors member"
and sign up, and then realize this is a really good value proposition. So the whole thing during COVID has
been to basically say, let's go really hard after the customer that maybe wasn't our core, wasn't an Honors
member, make sure they really understand the value proposition and then keep them in the system. And
then when our core customer comes back, obviously, we believe we've got a great value proposition and

17

HILTON WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

they're staying. And when you put one and one together, you hope to get 3. And so the objective would
be not to get back to where we were, because that wasn't the objective pre-COVID. It's to get significantly
beyond that.

Why? Because we believe it's a better experience for our customer. Like the more -- the better the value
proposition, the happier they are. The better experience with the technology, the happier they are. From
an ownership and system point of view, we lower our distribution costs. It's the lowest distribution channel
-- the lowest cost distribution channel we have.

So for all the right reasons, we want to continue to build very direct relationships. And my belief is when
you wake up in 2 or 3 years, while COVID has obviously been a difficult time for everybody in the industry,
including us, I do think it afforded us an opportunity to accelerate some of those efforts.

Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Obviously, we covered a lot of territory, and you can probably tell
from my comments, we're obviously pleased with Q2, relative to where the business has been industry-
wide and the company. And we're very bullish about, while we know there are risks out there, not
oblivious to that, we think those are all reasonably manageable, and we're very bullish about not just the
second half of the year, but very bullish about recovery as we go into '22 and beyond. We look forward
