Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Charter's Fourth Quarter 2019 Investor
Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to Stefan Anninger.

Stefan Anninger
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to Charter's Fourth Quarter 2019 Investor Call. The presentation that
accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section.

Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary
statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K filed this morning. We will not
review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call, however we encourage you to read
them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and
prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks
and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results.

Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no
obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the
future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and
reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be
comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth
rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise
specified.

Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With
that, let's turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Stefan. Our operating strategy continues to deliver strong results, and we remain focused on
driving customer growth by delivering superior services and value to our customers; improving the quality
of our operations by reducing unnecessary service transactions and truck rolls per customer; delivering
sustainable free cash flow growth by driving EBITDA growth while reducing capital intensity; and finally,
positioning our company for long-term customer relationship growth with current and new products by
continuing to evolve a fully converged network that delivers high-speed, low-latency seamless connectivity
services inside or outside customers' homes, in the sedentary environments or on the move.

In 2019, we created over 1.1 million new customer relationships, substantially more than 2018. And
we added over 1.4 million new Internet customers also more than 2018. We grew our full year cable
adjusted EBITDA by 6.6% in a nonpolitical advertising year. And combined with our lower cable capital
expenditures, our 2019 cable free cash flow grew by over 100% year-over-year. We expect that our cable
EBITDA growth, combined with our declining capital intensity and disciplined capital deployment strategy
will drive continued strong free cash flow growth.

Our mobile business is a strategic extension of our core connectivity capabilities today and in the future
and it continues to grow. We now have well over 1 million mobile lines in service with over 900,000 of
those added in 2019 at an accelerating pace.

In 2019, we saw a substantial reduction in service transactions per customer relationships, and those
improvements were reflected in lower per relationship repair calls, trouble call truck rolls and billing calls.
We also performed fewer physical installation truck rolls, giving growing levels of self-installation activity.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

Looking forward to 2020, we're well positioned to continue to reduce service activity per customer,
given a higher level of customers in Spectrum pricing and packaging, the completion of our insourcing
program and increasingly experienced insourced call center and field operations workforces, the overall
improving quality, reliability and maintenance of our network, greater levels of online service activity --
self-service activity and growing levels of self-installation activity, as I mentioned, which in the fourth
quarter exceeded 50% of sales.

So in 2020, these lower levels of overall service activity per customer relationship should continue
improvements in customer satisfaction, lower churn and a reduction in cost to service customers, per
customer relationship.

Our in-home connectivity product set also continues to improve, with 85% of our residential Internet
customers now receiving minimum Internet speeds of 100 megabits or more and nearly half receiving
minimum speeds of 200 megabits or more. We continue to offer 400 megabits, our Ultra product and our
gigabit speed tier across our entire footprint. We made a network capable of providing gigabit service
everywhere we operate using DOCSIS 3.1 technology over the course of 13 months for $450 million in
plant capital.

Through our 10G plan, we also have a cost-efficient pathway to offer multi-gigabit speeds and lower
latency to consumers and businesses that continue to attach more devices to our network, use more and
more data on a daily basis and are demanding greater network responsiveness and reliability.

During the quarter, we also continued to deploy our advanced home WiFi capabilities to new markets
beyond Austin, Texas, including Dallas, San Antonio and portions of Southern California. Our advanced
WiFi capability provides enhanced security, privacy and app-based control over all IP devices in our
consumers' homes, while simultaneously delivering a superior customer experience through better in-
home WiFi coverage and managed WiFi solution through dynamic band switching and channel optimization
within the bands. So far, our deployment has gone well and we plan to roll out this capability throughout
our entire footprint.

Our Spectrum Mobile business continues to grow quickly, and we added over 280,000 lines in the fourth
quarter, more than we added in the third quarter. While it's still early, we believe that our results so far
indicate our mobile product drives core connectivity customer satisfaction and will generate stand-alone
profitability at scale. We also continue to test dual SIM technology using CBRS Spectrum via small cells
mounted on our own high-capacity two-way network. Our tests continue to go very well.

We continue to add features and functionality to our Spectrum Mobile product and in the first quarter, we
plan to offer 5G mobile service. Now I will turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Tom. And before covering our results, a quick reminder that we closed the sale of NaviSite, a
managed cloud services business within Spectrum Enterprise, in September. We have [ now ] prepared
pro forma financials to our reported results include NaviSite in the fourth quarter of 2018, but not in the
fourth quarter of 2019. For the next few quarters, I will discuss enterprise revenue growth, including and
excluding NaviSite, for comparability. On an annual basis, NaviSite generated roughly $150 million in
revenue and its impact on our EBITDA and CapEx was not material.

Turning to our results on Slide 5. Over the last 12 months, we grew total residential and SMB customer
relationships by over 1.1 million or 4% and by 268,000 in the fourth quarter. Including residential and
SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 339,000 in the quarter and by 1.4 million or 5.6% over the last
12 months.

Video declined by 101,000 in the quarter, wireline voice declined by 128,000 and we added 288,000
higher ARPU mobile lines. At the end of the fourth quarter, 85% of our residential customers were in
Spectrum pricing and packaging. And residential customer relationship growth accelerated to 3.8% year-
over-year.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

As we look to 2020, our goal is to accelerate our full year customer growth rate as we deliver highly
competitive products with better service, driving connect and reducing churn. In residential Internet, we
added a total of 313,000 customers in the quarter, resulting in residential Internet customer growth of
5.4% year-over-year, driven by continuing churn improvement.

In residential video, we lost 105,000 customers in the quarter, primarily driven by lower video gross
additions year-over-year. And in wireline voice, we lost 152,000 residential customers in the quarter,
driven by lower sell-in following our transition to selling mobile in the bundle and continued fixed and
mobile substitution in the market generally.

Turning to mobile. We added 288,000 total mobile lines in the quarter, driven by the value of our mobile
product offers, growing brand and product awareness and increased sales effectiveness. As of December
31, we had nearly 1.1 million lines with a healthy mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines.

Spectrum Mobile continues to scale with less EBITDA loss per line even at an accelerating net addition
rate, and that does not include any benefits to our traditional cable connectivity business.

Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by just over 1 million or 3.8%. Residential revenue
per residential customer relationship grew by 1.8% year-over-year, given the lower rate of SPP migration
and promotional campaign roll off and rate adjustments. Those ARPU benefits were partly offset by a
higher mix of nonvideo customers, higher mix of streaming and lighter video packages within our video
base and $29 million of lower pay-per-view revenue year-over-year in the quarter.

Our cable ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue, but Q4 especially benefited from the timing of the
rate adjustment this year.

As Slide 6 shows, our cable customer growth combined with that elevated Q4 ARPU growth, resulted in
year-over-year residential revenue growth of 5.7%.

Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 6.3%, faster than last quarter, as the revenue effect from
the repricing of our SMB products and Legacy TWC and Bright House continues to slow. SMB customer
relationships grew by 6.8% year-over-year.

Enterprise revenue declined by 4.5% year-over-year, driven by the sale of NaviSite and some one-time
cell tower backhaul fees that we mentioned as a benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding NaviSite
from the fourth quarter of 2018, enterprise revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019. And
excluding both cell tower backhaul and NaviSite, enterprise grew by 8.5%. I expect that retail portion
of enterprise to continue to grow nicely and that the wholesale piece, including cell tower backhaul, will
continue to be challenging.

Fourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 23% due to less political revenue in 2019. Our nonpolitical
advertising grew -- revenue grew by 4.6% year-over-year, primarily due to our advanced advertising
capabilities and recently deployed products that efficiently sell highly viewed long-tailed inventory using
our own anonymized and much more detailed viewing data.

As we look to the full year 2020, we expect continued ad growth, driven by our advanced advertising
business and a healthy year of political revenue.

Other revenue declined by 6.6% year-over-year, driven by lower processing fees and lower home
shopping revenues related to video subscriber declines, partly offset by higher levels of video CPEs sold to
customers. Mobile revenue totaled $236 million with $138 million of that being device revenue.

In total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 4.7% year-over-year. Cable revenue growth,
excluding mobile, was 3.4% or 5.2% when excluding advertising in both years and NaviSite in 2018.

Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses grew by $165
million or 2.3% year-over-year. Cable operating expenses, excluding mobile, were essentially flat or up
0.6% when excluding NaviSite, and that's despite strong relationship and revenue growth.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

Programming increased to 0.6% year-over-year due to higher rates that was offset by a video customer
decline of 2.8% year-over-year, a higher mix of streaming and lighter video packages, such as Choice and
Stream, and lower pay-per-view expenses year-over-year tied to the $29 million of lower pay-per-view
revenue I mentioned.

Looking at full year 2020, we expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the mid-single-digit
percentage range. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 4.3%, and that was driven by
higher cost of video CPE sold to customers and original programming cost.

Costs to service customers declined by 2.3% year-over-year compared to 4% customer relationship
growth. So we're meaningfully lowering our per relationship service costs through a number of operating,
quality and efficiency improvements, which is core to our strategy.

Key metrics like calls per customer, truck rolls per customer, churn and self-installed rates all continue
to move in the right direction, as Tom mentioned. Looking ahead, we expect further declines in cost to
service customers on a per customer relationship basis, but this quarter's level of operational productivity
was exceptional and it won't be replicated every single quarter.

Cable marketing expenses increased by 2.1% year-over-year, and other cable expenses were down 1.4%,
driven by lower ad sales cost, which reverses in a political year, and lower costs related to the sale of
NaviSite, which will carry through to the third quarter of this year.

Mobile expenses totaled $372 million and they were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device
revenue, customer acquisition and net MVNO usage cost and operating costs to stand up and operate the
business.

Our 2020 mobile EBITDA probably looks similar to 2019 due to growth and the scale cost. But looking
even further, our current expectation is that in 2021, our mobile service revenue will exceed all regular
operating costs, excluding acquisition and growth-related mobile costs.

Turning to EBITDA. We grew total adjusted EBITDA by 8.8% in the quarter when including the mobile
EBITDA start-up loss of $136 million. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.9% in the fourth quarter, including
a roughly 3% negative growth rate impact from advertising revenue, net of its associated expense in both
periods.

Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $714 million of net income attributable to Charter
shareholders in the fourth quarter versus $296 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily
driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a loss on financial instruments in the prior year period, partly offset
by higher income tax expense.

Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter with our cable CapEx
declining about $200 million year-over-year, driven by the same CPE trends, DOCSIS 3.1 benefits and
lower insourcing and integration costs I've mentioned throughout the year. We spent $151 million on
mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for and support capital. And it was driven by
software and development costs and retail footprint upgrades for mobile.

In 2020, we expect our mobile capital expenditures to be similar to 2019 and then decline meaningfully in
2021 as that work will be behind us. That mobile CapEx outlook excludes any potential mid-band spectrum
acquisition and build-out, which would be based on a separate ROI evaluation.

In 2020, we expect our cable CapEx intensity to continue to decline from the 15% in 2019. And on an
absolute dollar basis, we don't expect our cable capital expenditures to be meaningfully different from
2019 levels. Similar to what I just said about our mobile capital expenditures, if we find new high ROI
projects during the course of the year, where that accelerated spend on existing projects could drive faster
growth, we'd still do so.

The Slide 10 shows we generated $1.6 billion of consolidated free cash flow in this quarter. And excluding
our investment in mobile, we generated $1.9 billion of cable free cash flow, up $700 million versus last

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2019, we generated $5.8 billion of cable free cash flow, up $3 billion
versus 2018 despite a cable working capital headwind of $800 million this past year.

For the full year 2020, we would expect cable working capital to improve significantly with a neutral
to slightly negative impact on our cash flow. We'll still have typical seasonal swings, including the first
quarter, in which our working capital is most always a use of cash.

With respect to mobile working capital, we continue to add mobile customers at an elevated pace, which
will continue to drive handset-related working capital needs in 2020. In any event, our free cash flow
profile improved significantly last year. We're positioned to continue to couple our free cash flow growth
with our return-focused investment and capital structure strategy.

We finished the year with $78.4 billion in debt principal and $74.9 billion in net debt. Our current run rate
annualized cash interest is $4 billion and as of the end of the fourth quarter, our net debt to last 12-month
adjusted EBITDA was 4.45x at the high end, or 4 to 4.5x leverage range.

And when calculating our leverage, we include the upfront investment in mobile to be more conservative
than looking at cable-only leverage, which was now 4.31x at the end of the fourth quarter.

During the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units,
totaling about $2.6 billion at an average price of $459 per share. For the full year 2019, we repurchased
over $7.6 billion of our equity. In September of 2016, we've repurchased over $27 billion or a bit more
than 25% of Charter's equity at an average price of $346 per share.

Turning to taxes. On Slide 2 (sic) [ Slide 12 ], our tax assets are primarily composed of our NOL and our
tax receivables arrangement with Advance/Newhouse. We now don't anticipate becoming a meaningful
federal cash taxpayer until 2022, with some modest federal cash tax payments beginning in late 2021 as
we expect the bulk of our existing NOL to be utilized by the end of that year.

For the years 2022 to 2024, we expect our federal and state cash taxes to approximate our consolidated
EBITDA less our capital expenditures and less our cash interest expense multiplied by 21% to 23%. That
estimate would include partnership tax distributions to Advance/Newhouse, captured separately in cash
flows from financing and the financial statements.

There are multiple factors that impact what I just described and we're always looking for ways to improve
our cash tax profile, but it's a good baseline for today.

So we're pleased with our results, and we believe in our operating strategy, our network capabilities and
the balance sheet strategy, which all work in concert to create value over a long period of time. Charter
is an infrastructure asset with strong growth characteristics and cash flow yield. We have a lot of ancillary
products to use for and sell on top of our core connectivity services that, when combined with good value
and service, will drive cash flow growth with tax-advantaged levered equity returns.
Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS.

John Christopher Hodulik
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Chris, you gave a lot of good detail on some of the cost metrics as we look out into 2020. And the 200
basis points you guys saw in cable margin improvement this quarter, especially with the advertising
headwind, I think, was really the highlight. But putting it all together in terms of the programming, the
cost to serve continuing to come down, how should we think of cable margin trends heading into 2020
here?

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Look, on one hand, you had a headwind, as you mentioned, political advertising not being in the
fourth quarter of 2019. On the other hand, we had some fairly exceptional pieces that were taking place
as well. The timing of our rate increase was earlier inside of Q4 2019 than it had been in prior years. And
so I think that results in a higher ARPU per customer relationship growth in what would be sustainable
either prior to that quarter or inside of 2020. So you need to take that into account. I think that growth
rate, given the subscriber mix, could look a lot more like what we saw for the full year of 2019 than it
would -- what we saw in Q4.

The second thing I'd mention is that programming had done very well on a gross and per customer
relationship basis. I think it will still do well relative to other years. But we expect mid-single-digit per
customer relationship growth in programming costs in 2020. And then finally, as I mentioned, the cost
to serve was exceptional in the fourth quarter. Our cost to serve per customer relationship has been
declining. It's going to continue to decline is our expectation. But to have an actual gross decline, a
significant one inside of a quarter, was a big step down. And I just would encourage people to replicate
that every single quarter.

So then working against that, again, I'm not giving guidance, but the ways to help you to build a model,
particularly later in the year. We expect this to be a pretty good year for political advertising. So all in, I
think it's going to move around and it's not something that we actively manage inside the business. What
we're managing is can we grow customer relationships faster and that's our goal, which would then drive
better revenue growth, which continues to be our goal to grow faster. And it has been our experience and
it continues to be our goal to grow EBITDA at a faster rate than our revenue growth rate with or without a
political advertising year. So that's, I think, the right way to think about it. And not to get particularly hung
up in a particular quarter of year-over-year comparison on a margin rate, but what's happening with the
underlying trend.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.

Philip A. Cusick
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Following up there, Chris, you talked about lower video gross adds year-over-year. Is that a result of fewer
promotions and changed incentives? And you said the goal is to accelerate customer growth rate. How do
you expect that to go from -- in terms of gross adds and churn going forward?

And then quickly, a follow-up, if I can, on the insourcing program. You talked about it in your commentary.
Where are we on the completion of that? And how much in terms of costs are still being duplicated as you
insource labor and everything else?

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

Sorry, Phil, what was your second question? So first one is lower video gross add. Third one is status
insourcing program and any double up. What was the second one?

Philip A. Cusick
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That was the gist of it.

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. I thought there was a second. But anyway, lower video gross adds up, I think it's more a function
of the marketplace more than anything else. We still believe in video as an attractive piece to the
connectivity package that we offer. It's an important attribute. We continue to invest in it, both in a
traditional set-top box sense with -- as well as all of our IP platforms. And I don't know if Tom wants to
add any more on that.

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

Well, yes, the lower gross adds, I think, are a function of the marketplace. It's not material to what drives
our economic model. But it is a nice small addition to our broadband connectivity business.

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

And then on the insourcing program, the insourcing is essentially complete. We have well over 90% of our
service calls are handled in-house and onshore. And then in the field service side, you need to have some
contract labor available for peaks and valleys, but we're well over 75% of our labor being insourced there.
And that's been the case for both of those for some time now. So there's very little in the way of double
up costs anymore that's in the system.

I do think that it's going to continue to get better for all the reasons that Tom mentioned, the tenure
of our employees gets longer, which means they get more experienced and better and higher quality
transactions with our own employees who have a career path at Charter. The amount of self installation is
going up. The number of calls and truck rolls are going down. The churn is going down. And the amount
of digital transactions, which Tom talked about, is also going up, which means less labor-intensive service
infrastructure. And I think that's -- that trend is going to be with us for a prolonged period of time.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.

Brett Joseph Feldman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And Tom, you just mentioned how video still can be very complementary to your core broadband product.
There are a number of new direct-to-consumer video products coming soon, whether it's HBO Max or
Peacock. And those providers have all said they're looking for distribution, including through MVPDs. I
was hoping you could give us your updated thoughts around being a partner for some or all of them? And
maybe some of the factors that you have to think through as you decide whether it makes sense, whether
it's the economics, if there's technical issues or just some strategic considerations that are weighing on
whether or not you intended to do this.

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

Right. Well, Brett, yes, there is an opportunity in us marketing direct-to-consumer products in our
relationship with programmers. And those relationships, in many cases, are also operating under the old
model, too, which is the bundled cable model. And we can hold both thoughts in our head at the same
time and sell bundled products, which I think we'll be selling for years to come, but also selling direct-to-
consumer products. And because of our customer relationship, because of the way we can package those
products into our overall product mix and the user interfaces that we develop, which products like Flex are
designed to help enhance, we have an opportunity to create and help programmers sell their content and
do that in a way that's mutually beneficial to both of us.

And so we're working through those models with the various companies. We have already placed direct-
to-consumer products like Netflix on our user interface and customers can purchase products directly from
our user interface, à la carte product, so to speak, which we've been doing for a long time, by the way.
In many ways, I look at these products like I look at pay TV. They are opportunities to enhance the video
experience and part of the customer relationship. So we have ongoing discussions with all of the entities
out there. And fundamentally, I think while there's a lot of dislocation going on in the video business,
there's an opportunity in there for us.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.

Benjamin Daniel Swinburne
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Two questions for either of you or both of you. Tom, any change in how you're thinking about pricing the
video business in particular? I don't know if you would characterize your rate adjustments in the fourth
quarter as a change from prior philosophy or not. But at least it seemed to us like a more aggressive
increase in your video pricing than you've done in the past. I'm just wondering if that reflects a change in
your mind about how you manage the business?

And then Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks sort of mid-band spectrum and any acquisition
build-out there. I was just curious where your guys' collective head was at on that opportunity, if that's
something that's becoming more likely, less likely or just how we should be thinking about that as we go
through this year and think about some options coming down the road.

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

Ben, I think fundamentally, we didn't -- or haven't changed anything with regard to our pricing strategy,
which is price isn't the major component of how we drive our revenue growth. It's subscriber growth. And
we have accelerating subscriber growth, and we expect to continue to have accelerating subscriber growth
because we have the price strategy we do with the product strategy we do. And the bulk of our revenue
growth comes from that.

So we have been passing through things like retransmission consent fees and other things in the video
business. And looking at the margins in the video business and the competitive environment in the video
business and how we're priced, but our fundamental strategy is not different.

We're interested in mid-band spectrum. There's an auction coming up for CBRS. We're likely to participate
in that auction. I think there's an opportunity for us. The FCC has been helpful and positioning that
spectrum in a way that's an opportunity for us and so we're carefully considering our options there.

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

But we'll be, Ben, disciplined, as you'd expect, about an ROI approach to the spectrum that's acquired,
the cost to acquire, the cost to build it and what's the financial return for doing so and where would you
do it. So I think people should expect that we will be disciplined around there first, but we think it's pretty
attractive. And clearly, the more mobile lines that we have, more attractive that ROI is.

Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.

Craig Eder Moffett
MoffettNathanson LLC

Two questions, if I could. First, on the wireless business, if I could just continue down that line of thinking.
How much -- just given what you know today, how much traffic do you think you will eventually be able
to offload or -- was sort of thinking about it as a percentage of total, maybe, that you'd be able to offload
under your own facilities? If you think about where it might make sense to build where you have aerial
infrastructure to be able to build? And is there any scenario where you would ever want to go to a full
facilities-based strategy where you would own your entire network?

And then just back to the video question for a second. How do you think differently about programming
renewals, just given the change in tone around your video strategy?

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

Right. So look, on the wireless situation, it's really a math question of what's the cost to pay for your
MVNO rate? And what's the cost to build, where is the traffic and what's -- and how does all that work?
And that's the discipline that Chris was talking about.

So as we think about it, there's -- it depends on what you're paying for mobile traffic and what the
economic traffic zone is inside of a particular area and how you would switch that traffic. So I don't --
there's no immediate plan to change our fundamental relationship with our carriers. And -- but over time,
as the market evolves and speeds go up and capacity goes up, the economics may change. And we'll take
advantage of those through time as the marketplace unfolds.

With regard to programming, obviously, the biggest issue in the bundled package is price and a lot of
people have been priced out of the market and we continue to negotiate contracts. And as penetrations in
the overall distribution change, the relative value of the content changes and it changes the relationship
and changes how much programming is worth to you as an operator. And so that's -- I don't expect the
general circumstance of distribution to precipitously change over the next couple of years. I think we'll
still have a big bundled product. But the relative pieces of that [ aren't ] changing in value and we'll act
appropriately in the marketplace.

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

Craig, you had a sub-question on the wireless side that asked if there's any scenario where we'd want to
own it all, the MVNO network, and so far, we haven't seen anything that really demonstrates that need.
We have a very good partner with Verizon. It's going very well and they have a very strong macro cell
tower network. And so I don't think that there's any economic case that we're seeing today that says we
need to own all of it and I hope we'll be partners with MVNO partners for years to come.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.

Jonathan Chaplin
New Street Research LLP

Just a follow-up on the questions around cost of service. I just want to get a quick clarification. You said
we shouldn't impute the same improvement in cost of service that we saw year-over-year this year or we
shouldn't assume the same cost of service that there's something that would drive cost of service up from
here or something one-time [ in a full ] quarter that depressed it. And then related to that, I'm wondering
if you can give us an update on where the Legacy Time Warner churn is relative to Legacy Charter churn
and whether Legacy Charter churn has finally bottomed out? Or are there still opportunities for that to
come down? Because it seems like the churn improvement drove a big component of the improvement in
cost of service.

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

So you were a little garbled there, Jonathan. But on the cost to serve, the cost to serve trend is --
it continues to go down on a per-customer basis. There are all sorts of reasons. That's true. I think
Chris was trying to say that what the pace of that is and how that will manifest itself quarterly isn't
something that you should straight line extrapolate. But the fundamental arc that we're on in terms of
customers self-serving, using high-quality service operations with well-skilled people doing the work is
reducing overall transaction volume, as is the digitization and the definition of the network as a software-
defined network and many of the operations becoming software-defined. All of those things are taking
fundamental operating cost out of the business and the capital expenditures that we made over the last 3
years as a result of the integration puts us in a position to realize that upside. So that's the fundamental
notion that he was trying to express.

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

And Legacy TWC churn continues to be both elevated relative to Legacy Charter, but continues to be
declining at a faster rate than Legacy Charter continues to decline.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

I have 2 follow-ups. I think it was Tom who said that you will accelerate or you expect to accelerate
customer growth rate this year. And I just wonder if you could elaborate on that. Do you mean the high-
speed data only? Or are you including video in here?

And then you also -- Tom mentioned Flex and I don't know if it was just in the context of direct-to-
consumer services, but do you have plans to offer a service similar to Comcast's Flex? Or can you talk
about how you're thinking about the evolution of your broadband product that would differentiate -- that
would make it more different? Besides speed, what else will differentiate it?

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

Right. Well, when I spoke of accelerating growth, I was talking about high-speed data and customer
relationship growth accelerating. So that's what I meant by that. And in terms of Flex or similar products,
yes, the answer is yes. There are a variety of IP relationships we have. We have one with Apple, selling
IP devices through Apple. We have Roku devices that our product is on. We've got millions of customers
who subscribe to us directly through an app-based product. And so our video product on the Internet or
IP-delivered cable TV and IP-delivered over-the-top products, are all being delivered through a variety
of new technology platforms. Flex is one of those. And so the answer is we're pursuing all the various
opportunities in video that are available to us and including those in our broadband strategy.

In addition to our broad -- we've enhanced our broadband through speed differentiation and taking our
minimum speeds up. More than half of our customer base now gets minimum speeds of 200 megabits
as the slowest speed we sell. And we've enhanced that with our advanced WiFi products, which deliver
high-quality service throughout the house, allow you to manage all the devices in your house, see what
the service quality of those devices is and how they're connected to the network as well as allow you to
manage the privacy or the utilization of any of those devices throughout your house so that you're secure,
private and delivering and getting a high-quality service everywhere inside your property and on the go.
And so we continue to invest in the broadband platform to make it a better platform, and we continue
to invest in legacy video. And we continue to invest in the way legacy video transforms itself into an IP
platform.

Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore.

James Maxwell Ratcliffe
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

It's James Ratcliffe for Vijay. Two if I could. First of all, Tom, you mentioned 10G is sort of the next phase
and that -- with the 3.1 rollout done. Can you give us any idea of the timing or magnitude of that sort of
deployment? I mean, I assume it's differing in kind, not just degree to the $9 or a home passed or so that
3.1 was?

And secondly, in the slides, you mentioned that the strategy in the business is not dependent on M&A. Can
you talk about what you see the M&A landscape looking like, both any opportunities for horizontal? Or if
there are any incremental vertical acquisitions that would make sense?

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Well, with regard to 10G, we just upgraded the whole network to 1 gigabit everywhere. That was
the $450 million capital project that I mentioned over a 13-month time frame. 10G is a set of technology
specifications that the industry has developed that allows us to ultimately get to 10-gig symmetrical
services, which are provided at very low latency deliveries specifications and allows you to put high-
compute capabilities throughout your network. And there is no immediate need to deploy a new upgrade
in the marketplace today, but it's an evolution that we can invest in as we go forward. And it allows us to
do that incrementally in a very cost-efficient way. A lot less cost than it would cost to build a brand-new
network. And so we have no immediate capital deployment associated with it. But it's a variety of tools

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

to incrementally get you to at least a 10-gig symmetrical. And there's -- we have already surpassed that
capability in our laboratory testing. And so that's just a stake in the ground in terms of what the potential
of our existing infrastructure is.

With regard to M&A, first of all, we don't have anything that we're about to talk about. But the cable
business is owned by control shareholders mostly through the United States. And I think we have a great
business and lots of opportunity. And with the right combination of assets, there's always value in scale
and market approach. And -- but there's nothing for us to say at the moment.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.

Bryan D. Kraft
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I wanted to ask you a couple of questions on CapEx. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes
and scalable infrastructure capital. It was down quite a bit in 2019 from the prior couple of years. Just
wondering how we should think about that spending category in the coming years relative to history? Is
there a sort of normal level, if you will?

And then secondly, on CapEx, as you've reached the end of the FCC commitment for new homes passed,
what should we expect in terms of a normal homes passed growth rate? Will it kind of be the -- just the
rate of home growth in your footprint, the way it's been maybe historically over the years? Or do you see
opportunities now to extend the network to existing premises that are currently off net?

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

So with regard to scalable CapEx, Bryan. The -- we are getting advantages from the 3.1 deployment.
And I think that those advantages which are in -- what the advantage is, is that the growth in Internet
utilization on a per-customer basis is a continuous investment required by us. And the 3.1 so expanded
the capacity of the plant that some of that scalable infrastructure capital that might have been in prior
periods isn't required right now.

But that opportunity continues for a while yet because, one, it's a function of the rate of data usage per
unit per customer. And interestingly, our Internet-only customers now are using over 500 gigabytes per
month, 0.5 terabyte of data usage. So it is something that continues to climb. And that's relative to a
wireless average customer of 8, to put that in proportion.

The -- but the capital expenditure, I think will stay in that space, similar to what it is now for some period
of time, clearly, 2020, because of the capacity that's been built by 3.1. And the evolution of traditional
video toward DOCSIS [ will continue ] that opportunity.

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

Homes passed.

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

Homes passed. Look, we've built everything that we can build from a homes passed perspective, without
regard to the requirements of our consent decree. So we've accelerated and actually built more passings
than the consent decree required. And there's nothing going forward that would change the rate at which
we're building, other than the rate of household formation.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

Bryan, just on the CapEx. Tom mentioned we're temporarily depressed in 2019 and probably in 2020 for
the continued DOCSIS 3.1 benefits. But if you think about the different line items for CapEx or CPE, which
includes traditional install, which is now a growing higher self-install, our CPE is declining and already, the
majority of that mix of CPE is more tied to Internet-related products as opposed to video products.

As Tom mentioned, we've been building at an accelerated pace on the line extension. So I think that will
continue to be elevated with positive ROI attached to that build-out. The scalable, while lower last year
and probably this year as well, over time, that's an area that we'll continue to invest like we have in the
past.

And then in support, we continue to have not the same magnitude that we've had in the past few years.
But there's still a fair amount of integration -- back-end integration capital that's going on and you'll see
that in the support category, whether that's through real estate or through IT systems. And so whereas
scalable may be temporarily lower, I think support is temporarily still higher. And that's the way the
different pieces of CapEx will move over the short to medium term.

Bryan D. Kraft
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Great. And on balance, continued declines in capital intensity as you look beyond 2020, for the most
part?

Christopher L. Winfrey
Chief Financial Officer

Right. We don't see anything that changes the arc that we're on. And mobile will have its own trajectory,
which I talked about in the prepared remarks, which we expect it to step down significantly in 2021. But
for any ROI-based investment in spectrum and/or build out.

Operator

And our last question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Crédit Suisse.

Douglas David Mitchelson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wanted to dig in more specifics on a couple of topics. Tom, I think to ask the question directly that I
think folks were trying to get to. Will you need to subsidize OTT video services to compete in broadband
in the future against the likes of AT&T, that's going to include an HBO Max for certain customers? So, one,
the competitive outlook going forward on broadband.

Two, on spectrum, it's super interesting the conversations you've been having with us around wireless
and the lack of a need for a physical network. I guess my question is, how much spectrum do you need?
Because if you're just going after high capacity areas, I think you could do that with a small amount of
CBRS or C-band spectrum, 10 or 20 megahertz. But if you're going to build out 10 or 20 megahertz,
you might as well build out more because the cost to build is sort of the same regardless of how many
megahertz. So I'm just curious how you think about quantity of spectrum relative to that return on
invested capital dynamic.

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

Well, on the subsidization of OTT, that's really just price what you're selling broadband for. And I think
that we have a relatively good competitive posture, from a price perspective, in the marketplace. And so I
don't see us changing that.

Whether we'll do promotional offers that have a price effect in them, a cost in them, I won't say never, but
it's just a marketing technique. It doesn't mean you have to change your fundamental pricing strategy.

And with regard to wireless, you're into the math of what's the value of the physical network pieces,
and that's a function of a lot of things. It's not -- it is the cost to build. It's the cost of what your rented

network is and how those 2 things interact with each other. And so I'd say, your thinking is correct. But we
haven't decided exactly what we'll do.

Douglas David Mitchelson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

The -- if I could just follow-up on that, Tom. Do you need updated MVNO with Verizon or a new MVNO to
take advantage of maximized, taking advantage of building out mid-band spectrum in high traffic areas?
Does there need to be any evolution in that relationship for you to be able to switch to your spectrum?

Thomas M. Rutledge
Chairman & CEO

We have a good relationship, and we're happy with our MVNO relationship with Verizon. And I'm sure it
will evolve through time.
