Thank you, John, and thank you all again for joining our call today
I'll recap on the usual items, our first quarter production, our updated 2017 production outlook, and then I'll finish up with a few comments on LOE and service costs
While we're off to a great start in 2017, our Q1 2017 net equivalent production came in at 1.063 Bcf a day, beating the upper end of our guidance by 13 million a day and setting a new record for total company production
With quarter-to-quarter production gains in both the Permian and Mid-Continent, our Q1 total company net equivalent volume was up 11% from our Q4 2016 posting of 960 million a day and 9% from our Q1 2016 volume of 973 million a day
With our focus on Permian oil and high-liquid Mid-Continent projects, we saw a solid sequential quarter increase in oil production, reporting a total company Q1 oil volume of 52,181 barrels of oil per day, up 15% from Q4 2016 and 13% from Q1 2016. Our oil volumes were up in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent, with our Q1 Permian oil production up 13% and our Q1 Mid-Continent oil production up 20% from Q4 2016. With a strong contribution from our Reeves County Wood State project that John mentioned, our Q1 2017 Permian net equivalent volume came in at 577 million a day, that's up 13% from Q4 2016 and 21% from Q1 2016. We brought on a total of 25 gross, 16 net Permian wells during the quarter and we had 14 gross and 11 net wells waiting on completion at quarter end
We also saw a nice gain in our Q1 Mid-Continent volumes with continued operated and non-operated production adds from our East Cana infill project
Our Q1 Mid-Continent net equivalent production came in at 484 million a day
That's up 9% from Q4 2016. In aggregate, we brought on 45 gross and 10 net wells in the Mid-Continent during the quarter and we have 68 gross and 15 net wells still waiting on completion at quarter's end
Looking forward into 2017, we've updated our model to incorporate our actual Q1 results and the projected drilling and completion schedules for the three Permian rigs we added in mid to late April
With our Q1 production beat and our revised projections, we've increased our full year guidance to 1.09 Bcf to 1.13 Bcf a day
That's up from the 1.06 Bcf to 1.11 Bcf a day we reported last call and it reflects a 13% to 17% increase over the 963 million a day that we reported in 2016. The 2017 capital remains focused on high-liquid Permian and Mid-Continent projects
As a result, we continue to project significant oil growth in both the Permian and the Mid-Continent during the year, which results in total company forecasted year-over-year production growth in the range of 24% to 28%
Our projected capital and completion activity remains skewed, approximately 60% to the Permian and 40% to the Mid-Continent
We anticipate bringing on 60 net Permian wells and 39 net Mid-Continent wells during 2017, and that's up from the 30 and 31 respective net wells that we completed in the two areas during 2016. With our strong tailwind from Q1, we're modeling Q2 production to be in the range of 1.08 Bcf to 1.13 Bcf a day
That's up 2% to 6% over Q1, and it's an 11% to 16% increase over Q2 2016. We're forecasting a number of our Permian and Mid-Continent spacing projects to come on online later in the year, and that will accelerate our capital and completion activity forecast into the Q3 to Q4 timeframe
As such, we're modeling Q3 to be relatively flat to Q2 followed by a nice production ramp in Q4. Our production calls for Q4 2017 exit rate in the neighborhood of 1.13 Bcfe to 1.19 Bcfe a day, and that's a strong 18% to 24% increase over Q4 2016. On top of that, we'll have approximately 44 net wells either drilling or waiting on completion as we forecasted at the end of the year
So with that, we anticipate having great momentum going into 2018. Jumping over to OpEx, our first quarter lifting cost came in at $0.65 per Mcfe
That's right at the midpoint of our guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 and just below our 2016 average of $0.66 per Mcfe
Our Q1 posting was approximately $0.07 above the $0.58 mark that we reported in Q4, and that's primarily a result of increased workover activity in Q1 as compared to not only Q4 2016, but several recent past quarters
We are starting to feel some LOE cost pressures in items such as compression and water hauling
That said, our production team remains vigilant to maintain the reduced operating cost structure that they've worked so hard to achieve
Taking into account the fluctuating nature of our workover expenses and our 2017 focused on high-liquid projects, we're maintaining our 2017 lifting cost guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 for the year
That's well below the $0.83 per Mcfe we posted in 2015 and the $1.08 we reported in 2014. And finally some comments on drilling and completion costs
On the drilling side, although a number of cost components have remained in check, we've seen 5% to 10% increases in items such as day rates and directional services
And with less availability on the ground, we've seen 15% to 25% increases in the cost of our tubulars
With our dry hole cost or drilling cost representing only about 30% to 35% of our AFEs, at the total well cost level, the largest cost pressure we're seeing is on the completion side
In addition to seeing increased cost – service cost to pump our fracs, we're also experiencing a tighter market for prop, which also appears to have limited supply on the ground
We've been able to offset a good portion of the service cost increases by optimizing our job design, utilizing fewer stages and pumping zipper fracs where we can, and we've focused on long lead time planning to ensure adequate prop sourcing for our program
As compared to Q4 2016, we've seen our current total company per well average frac cost increase approximately $300,000 to $500,000 per well, which again is dependent on so many variables such as lateral length, number of stages, pounds pumped and so on
Although we focused our drilling and completion efficiencies to limit the impact of these frac cost increases, we've experienced some modest increases in our total well costs
In the Permian, we've raised our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFE with larger fracs, approximately $300,000 to $500,000 per well, with a range of $5 million to $6 million
In the Wolfcamp, we've increased our AFEs for larger completion, 2-mile lateral Wolfcamp wells in Culberson by $300,000 to $10.5 million to $11.7 million per well
That's still down from the late 2015 cost levels we had and with a much larger completion today
In Cana, our current Woodford 1-mile lateral AFEs are running in a range of $7.5 million to $8 million, that's up $400,000 to $500,000, again, all driven by higher frac cost
And as we continue to experiment with frac design, we bumped the midpoint of the cost range for current 2-mile Meramec AFEs by about $250,000 with a range of $10.5 million to $12.5 million per well with frac design again being the largest cost variable
So in closing, we're off to a great start here in 2017. Our diversified oil-focused development program generated a great production beat in Q1. With that as our springboard, we're forecasting continued production growth coming here into Q2 with forecasted year-over-year total company production growth of 13% to 17% and just as important a strong exit rate to enter 2018. We stay focused on finding cost pressures in order to keep our cost structure healthy and strong and our overall program continues to generate positive results, all that despite the modest cost increases we've seen in our total well costs
All in, we remain very excited about 2017. So with that, I'll open it up to Q&A
Question-and-Answer Session
The way I would answer that question, we – in total, as you look at the year, the net well completions quarter-to-quarter, we had a good number of completions in Q1. We'll see that slow down a little bit in Q2 and ramp back up into Q3 and then taper off just a smidge in Q4 as wells come online, and with that parallels our projected oil production and our oil growth
We're still projecting that our oil growth will continue to extend itself into the fourth quarter and surpass slightly the ranges that we quoted last call
And this is Joe
I'll add that we have, as forecasted, approximately 44 wells that we'd still be drilling and waiting on completion with the – just the Permian rig counts that we've got in our current plan at the end of the year
This is Joe
On the gas side, yeah, I think, overall, that differential increase is kind of stemming around concerns about Mexico infrastructure and demand and maybe secondly the pipe outlets to the Gulf Coast
And we're having no problem selling our gas right now
We are seeing the hit of the differential
Long term looking out, we're looking at the various options for pipe out of Waha to the Gulf Coast because we think it will be something that we're going to need to secure ourselves with
We do have Perm on El Paso coming off the tailgate of our Hidalgo plant and we're looking at possible other open seasons as well
So, we're taking a proactive stance to try to secure the Perm that we think makes sense relative to our volumes and then think long term on how to better get our gas out of the basin
With regard to the oil side, we believe that there's capacity that does exist right now
Current supply or surplus capacity on takeaway out of the basin we think is sufficient for the short term
Long term, we're going to look – again, like I mentioned on the gas side, at possible solutions as well
As far as Delaware, gravities being a little bit higher than Midland
We do see a variation in our gravities from Reeves over to Culberson and our contracts to sell both those will allow for us to blend and we're well below the minimums on those contracts
So, we've had no problems right now getting oil or gas out of the basin
So hopefully that answers your questions
Hey, Mike, I'll just add on that
On the first quarter, we did see a positive Midland – Cushing differential, which definitely benefited our realization in the first quarter
It's something in the neighborhood of $0.60 positive
Looking forward in the second quarter on the futures market, that's probably going to go up to maybe $0.80 to $1, currently at $0.70 at today's spot price
And looking out in the third or fourth quarter, this may be up to just over $1. And out into 2018 on a fourth trip (37:47) it's in the $1.20-ish range going out into the future
So yeah, we'll definitely have to keep monitoring that Mid-Cush differential and even consider our hedging practice around that
Currently, we only hedge it to WTI NYMEX, but we'll keep monitoring that differential
The only comment I'd make on that front is that in particular in Reeves County where we have higher liquids, we see it more prudent to run in the hole with tubing gas lift and any capillary treating mines at the time that we turn the well on
And this saves us from shutting in the well and doing it and as we get further down the road and that – down the road not being that far away before we feel like we'll see some detrimental flow due to lifting issues
But when you have the tubing in there, you're somewhat limited by which you can flow
And so that has a lot to do with what we're seeing in Reese County
Yeah
This is Joe Albi
Late last quarter when we were cleaning out that well, we stuck bottom-hole assembly and coil tubing and made the decision after retrieving the majority of it that we would rather shut the well in, produce the offset well, slower any possible pressure in and around that well a bit and then come back in later to retrieve the fish
And so we currently have ongoing operations right now to retrieve that fish and are getting close to home
