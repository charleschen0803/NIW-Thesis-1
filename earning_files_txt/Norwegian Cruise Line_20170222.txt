Thank you, Frank
Good morning
Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2016 and 2015 net yield and net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis
I'll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter and full-year results followed by color on booking trends, and then will close with our outlook in guidance for 2017. I'm pleased to report another record quarter of revenue and earnings
Fourth quarter results were slightly ahead of expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.56, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.57. Adjusted net yield decreased 1.7%, or 2.2% on an as reported basis versus the prior year
Stronger than expected close-in demand resulted in adjusted net yield outperforming guidance expectations of down 2.25%
Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel decreased 0.7% on both a constant currency and as reported basis
Higher than expected expenses related to repairs and maintenance mainly due to a technical issue on Norwegian Star, as well as an increase in other ship operating expenses, resulted in costs coming in higher than guidance expectations
Looking back at 2016, it was another year of record revenue and earnings, and solid financial performance, despite the impact of geopolitical headwinds
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 18% to $3.41, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.38 to $3.42. Our strong earnings were driven by record revenue of $4.9 billion, representing a 12.2% increase from the prior year
Other key metrics for full-year 2016 are as follows: adjusted net yield for the year was up 1.8%, or 1.2% on an as reported basis
Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel increased 1.7%, or 1.5% on an as reported basis
And fuel price per metric ton net of hedges decreased 13.5% to $466 from $539 in the prior year
We are proud to share that since 2006, we've reduced fuel consumption per capacity day by approximately 30%, as we continue to focus on fuel efficiency and energy saving initiatives, implementing new technologies and optimizing itineraries
Now let's discuss our outlook for 2017. On a full-year basis, our capacity is expected to increase approximately 6.5%, with the midyear addition of Norwegian Joy along with a partial year benefit from the annualization of Oceania Cruises' Sirena and Seven Seas Explorer
Looking at our deployment around the world, we believe we have an optimal mix of itineraries for 2017. The Caribbean will make up 37% of our deployment mix, with capacity in the region decreasing mid single digits from last year, primarily due to the redeployment of Norwegian Getaway to the higher priced Baltic region during the peak summer season
Europe, which will experience a capacity increase of approximately 10%, will comprise 23% of our deployment mix
We have made several changes to our European deployments, reducing our capacity in the Mediterranean region by approximately 10%, and significantly increasing our deployment in the Baltic and Northern Europe
As Frank mentioned earlier, we are seeing strong demand for European itineraries, particularly from North America
The Asia, Africa and Pacific region will experience a significant increase in capacity, with deployment mix increasing from 3% to 8%, primarily due to the introduction of Norwegian Joy to the Chinese cruise market, as well as the deployment to Asia and Australia of Norwegian Star in the first part of the year, and Norwegian Jewel in the latter part of 2017. As for other markets, deployment is consistent year-over-year
Turning to the first quarter, capacity is expected to be up approximately 1.5% due to the addition of Seven Seas Explorer, and Oceania Cruises' Sirena, partially offset by an increase in the number of dry-docks in the quarter versus prior year
As for our deployment mix, the first quarter is very Caribbean-centric, with approximately 59% of our deployments allocated to the region
This reflects a capacity decrease of approximately 8%, mainly due to the repositioning of Norwegian Star to the Asia-Pacific region along with a heavier weighting of dry-docks in the first quarter, which is partially offset by increased capacity in the region for both Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises
This market continues to show strength, with price and occupancy both ahead of prior year
Turning to Europe, only 4% of our deployment mix is allocated to this region in the first quarter
This includes a 54% decrease in capacity, mainly due to the repositioning of Norwegian Epic from Europe in the non-peak winter season to the peak season in the Caribbean
The Asia, Africa, Pacific region accounts for approximately 9% of our deployment mix which is up approximately 400 basis points from prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned redeployment of Norwegian Star to the region
As for other key markets, our deployment is similar to prior year
Now turning to our guidance, for the full year we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.85. Since our last earnings call, strong booking trends including the benefit of voyages to Cuba have offset headwinds from fuel and the impact from a technical issue on Norwegian Star
Adjusted net yield for the year is expected to increase approximately 1.75%, or 1.25% on an as reported basis
Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 1%, on both a constant currency and as reported basis
As for the first quarter, adjusted net yield is anticipated to increase approximately 4.5%, or 4% on an as reported basis
The first quarter has a few positive year-over-year benefits, which will help to make this quarter the highest yield growth quarter in 2017. These benefits include Pride of America, the highest yielding ship in the Norwegian fleet, is in service for the full quarter, versus prior year where she was in a 25-day dry-dock
Norwegian Epic is sailing in the Caribbean peak season, garnering higher pricing in both ticket and onboard versus Q1 of 2016, where she sailed in Europe during the non-peak shoulder season
And the benefit from the addition of Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Sirena, both of which were not in our fleet in Q1 2016, and garner higher yields than the corporate average
Now turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 5.25% on both a constant currency and as reported basis
The first quarter also represents the highest growth quarter for adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel mainly due to the timing of dry-dock with five scheduled dry-docks occurring in the first quarter, compared to two dry-docks in the previous year
As well as the previously stated incremental expense of approximately $15 million related to the launch of our China operations, which will occur in the first half of the year
Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $450, with expected consumption of approximately 190,000 metric tons
Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $0.36. As we mentioned last quarter, there are a few items to keep in mind for the balance of 2017. As mentioned last quarter, we will be up against tougher pricing comparisons in the third quarter when we lap the premium priced 40-day charter of Norwegian Getaway in the period
The third quarter also lapsed the introduction of Seven Seas Explorer, which entered the fleet in a premium market in peak summer season after experiencing record early bookings at the higher prices typically expected in an inaugural season
2017 marks Explorer's first full year of operation, resulting in a normalization of pricing that takes into account both peak and non-peak season
And now to discuss our recent newbuild order, I'll turn over the call to Frank
Sure, that's a great question
So due to the mix of our portfolio brands, as we bring on Norwegian newbuilds, which are highly accretive to both revenue and earnings, their yields are slightly dilutive to our corporate average, which includes our higher yield brands that make up approximately a third of our gross revenue
In other words, the addition of a new Norwegian vessel which has yields lower than the corporate average inherently dilutes yields
In addition, in 2017 we are also annualizing both the Explorer and Sirena to include the non-peak season
We also do not have the benefit from the Getaway charter, which garnered a significant yield premium in the third quarter of 2016. So again, I'd just reiterate that Q1 is where you'll see the highest yield and then obviously that implies that the back half of the year then is much more moderate
We have been working very, very hard on a number of supply chain initiatives that have been actively being worked all through 2016 and 2017, so we're getting the benefit of that, as well as we're also getting the benefit of scale, as we bring in the Norwegian Joy and leverage the rest of our costs
Okay, so good question, Robin
I would again point to the fact that it's dilutive to yields, as you bring in – or not meaning – it's not increasing
Norwegian ships are not increasing the yields, so the Joy is coming in on par with the average of the NCLH average yield
So it's not increasing it
It's still going to be one of the highest yielding ships in the Norwegian fleet, but it's dilutive to the overall NC – or at least not accretive to the overall NCLH yield
And then the other things that I mentioned that were rolling over, so all – the Explorer, the Sirena and the Getaway Charter
For that reason, when you look at the yields being highest in Q1, you can imply then by our full-year guidance that yields will be much more tempered in the back part of the year
Great question
So, yes, as of the end of 2016, on a pro forma basis, we actually were at 3.98 times, but still at 4.34 times on an as-reported basis and de-levering rapidly
So on an as-reported basis, we will be at 4 times by the end of the year, and we stay consistent with our plans that we want to continue to de-lever, and that will allow us to return capital to our shareholders in the back half of the year
So we continue to be favorable towards share repurchases, but we'll be opportunistic and look at our options
And then, Tim, with regard to adjustments to net yield, that actually ended in Q1 of 2016, so you won't see that any longer
So our strategy has remained consistent
Inherently we say that we want to be at least 50% hedged as we move into a new year
We're significantly higher than that this year at 78% hedged
It is a mixture between HFO and MGO, and hopefully investors and analysts have found it helpful with additional color that we provided in the last couple of quarters and also in this quarter, breaking that out
So of the 78% that's hedged, then you also have the correlations
We're floating approximately 30%, somewhere in there, and we do use the fuel curves
Next year, we're at 66% hedged, and the following years we're at 48% and 18% hedged
But in those outer years, in 2019 and 2020, we'll continue to be opportunistic
That's what we've done, so we will continue to see benefits of our fuel hedges as we move into those outer years
I think we've got a nice balance right now as to what we've presently hedged between HFO and MGO
So, James, good morning
Fuel has actually moved up about 20% since our last call
I also had made mention of the Star technical issues that we had, so those were additional headwinds that we faced, but we have offset those additional headwinds by this strong operational environment as well as the 41 announced voyages to Cuba
So there's nothing further that we have implanted into our guidance for 2017.
First off, I would say the vast majority of this is the reset from the revenue from 2016, which then you're starting with a lower base rolling into 2017. So Q2 of last year on our earnings call, we did specifically talk about 70% of the reset was specifically due to the geopolitical headwinds that we had faced
So, that's the lion share, but then there is also fuel and FX that also has been affected, all well baked within our guidance to say that we would be within double-digit EPS growth in 2017 and moving forward
So revenue the largest, and then fuel and FX
