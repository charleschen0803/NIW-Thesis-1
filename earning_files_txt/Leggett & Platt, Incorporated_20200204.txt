Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Leggett & Platt Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your
host, Ms. Wendy Watson, Vice President of Investor Relations for Leggett & Platt. Thank you. You may
begin.

Wendy M. Watson
Director of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for taking part in Leggett & Platt's Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. I'm
Wendy Watson. With me today are Karl Glassman, Chairman and CEO; Mitch Dolloff, President and COO;
Jeff Tate, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Susan McCoy, Senior Vice President of
Investor Relations. The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a summary of the
major statements we made in yesterday's press release; Jeff will discuss financial details and address our
outlook for 2020; and finally, the group will answer any questions that you have.

This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not
be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR
portion of Leggett's website.

We posted to the Investor Relations portion of the website yesterday's press release and a set of
PowerPoint slides that contain summary financial information along with segment details. Those
documents supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations.

I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies,
trends or results constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially
due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or
revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to
yesterday's press release and the section in our 10-K and 10-Qs entitled Forward-Looking Statements and
Risk Factors.

I'll now turn the call over to Karl.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Good morning, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter call. First, I want to thank our
dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. In 2019, our
employees accomplished the acquisition and integration of ECS, the largest acquisition in our history;
the very successful restructuring of our Home Furniture business, where we are already seeing an
EBIT margin benefit; the orderly closure of our Fashion Bed business and successful liquidation of that
inventory, all while keeping a sharp focus on deleveraging; generating record cash from operations;
and delivering our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. This represents tremendous work by our
employees across the company. And these efforts are very much appreciated. Thank you all.

As a reminder, in November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to our segment structure.

These changes align with how we manage our businesses. Effective January 1, 2020, all of our bedding-
related businesses, including our innerspring and Specialty Foam businesses, our Steel Rod and wire
and Machinery businesses and our Adjustable Bed business, will be 1 Bedding Products segment. This
optimizes efficiency and allows us to holistically manage our bedding value chain of rod, wire, spring
specialty foam.

The newly formed Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment will contain our Home and Work
Furniture businesses, our Flooring Products business and our Fabric Converting and Geo Components

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

businesses. Our Specialized Products segment is not changing and includes our Automotive, Aerospace
and Hydraulic Cylinder (sic) [ Hydraulic Cylinders ] businesses.

The segment commentary in yesterday's press release is based on the historical reporting format as we
continue to report under the prior segment structure through 2019. Before we report first quarter 2020
earnings, we will furnish an 8-K providing 5 years of historical segment data based upon the new segment
reporting structure.

We have several items to highlight in our 2019 performance: 4 sales grew 11%; EBIT grew 18% and
adjusted EBIT grew 12%; full year EPS was $2.47; and adjusted EPS was $2.57, a 4% increase over 2018
adjusted EPS. We generated record operating cash flow of $668 million. Adjusted working capital as a
percent of annualized sales improved to a low 9.9% at year-end.

We experienced fluctuations in sales and earnings from the effects of raw material cost, primarily steel
scrap cost and selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings, along with corresponding movements in
LIFO benefit or expense. We passed our steel cost increases or decreases along to our customers after an
approximate 90-day lag. Because of this lag, in the first half of 2019, our selling prices for steel rod, wire
and innersprings increased from the recovery of cost inflation that occurred in 2018. At the same time, our
cost for steel scrap were deflating. This had a positive impact on both sales and earnings as sales dollars
were increasing and earnings benefited from the lower cost.

In the second half of 2019, we began to pass our lower steel scrap cost along to our rod wire and
innerspring customers. Despite downward effect of our -- on our sales dollars, we continue to experience
earnings growth from steel cost deflation through October of 2019. We also experienced increased
earnings from LIFO benefit as steel costs deflated.

Steel scrap costs began to rise in November of 2019 and have continued inflating through January
of 2020. We expect steel movements to cause sales and earnings fluctuations in 2020 and anticipate
negative earnings impact in the first quarter. We also expect year-over-year changes in LIFO as we had
a $32 million LIFO benefit in 2019. As the quarters progress, we will update you on the changes in steel
scrap and rod and our full year LIFO expectations. While we are most affected by moves in steel scrap and
rod, we also experienced a negative effect on sales from foam chemical deflation in our ECS business that
I will discuss later in the call.

Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $1.14 billion. The ECS acquisition added 13% to sales in the quarter.
Organic sales were down 4%, 1% from volume and 3% from raw material-related price decreases and a
negative currency impact. Most of our businesses grew in the fourth quarter. The growth was more than
offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and
continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. Absent declines from exited businesses, volume was
up 2%.

We are pleased with the performance of our Bedding businesses in the quarter. U.S. Spring sales were
up 7%, international Spring sales were up 4% and Adjustable Bed sales were up 22%. In addition, our
Automotive business was up 8% in the quarter, while global auto production was down 5%. Our Aerospace
business was up 11% in the quarter.

Fourth quarter EBIT increased $51 million over fourth quarter 2018, and adjusted EBIT increased
$20 million or 17% to $140 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12
million of amortization expense; lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefit; and improved earnings
performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points to 12.2%, and
adjusted EBITDA margin increased 160 basis points to 16.4%.

Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.64. This included restructuring-related charges that reduced
earnings $0.04 per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.68 per share, a 10% increase versus
fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in fourth quarter earnings reflects higher adjusted EBIT, partially
offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

For the full year 2019, sales grew 11% to $4.75 billion. ECS and other smaller acquisitions added 14% to
sales. Organic sales were down 3% on 3% lower volume. Raw material-related selling price inflation from
increases implemented in late 2018 were offset by a negative currency impact.

Full year organic sales growth in most of our businesses, including U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work
Furniture and Aerospace, was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home
Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and weak trade demand in steel rod and wire. Volume was flat for the
year, absent declines from exited business.

Content gains continued to drive sales growth in both our Bedding and Automotive businesses in 2019.
U.S. Spring sales were up 6%, benefiting from the continued shift to higher-value innersprings. Our
Automotive sales were up 2% for the year, with global auto production down 6%.

Full year EBIT increased $76 million and adjusted EBIT increased $56 million or 12% to $529 million.
Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $50 million of acquisition accounting, lower
raw material cost, including LIFO benefits, and improved earnings performance in our Furniture Products
segment. Full year earnings per share increased to $2.47, adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to
$2.57. Adjusted EPS benefited from higher EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.

In January 2019, we acquired Elite Comfort Solutions and gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam
technology, along with scale in the production of private-label finished mattresses. ECS' full year 2019
sales were flat with 2018, primarily from deflation and weaker demand in non-Bedding markets. Volume
was up 11%. As expected, ECS' EBITDA margin is accretive to our total company EBITDA margin, and
their cash flow generation is strong.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated restructuring activities after an in-depth analysis of our Fashion
Bed and Home Furniture businesses. Total restructuring and related charges were $15 million in 2019 and
$16 million in 2018. The restructuring activity is substantially complete.

In November, the U.S. mattress industry's antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses came to
a successful conclusion, with the International Trade Commission making a unanimous final determination
that the U.S. industry had been materially injured by Chinese mattresses sold at prices that violate the
U.S. trade laws.

Jeff will discuss our 2019 financial details and full year guidance for 2020. I'll now turn the call over to
him.

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of
$668 million, a $228 million increase over 2018. This improvement was driven by a significant reduction
in working capital across the company and strong operating cash generation in many of our businesses,
including ECS. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales of
9.9%, an improvement versus 10.6% at the end of 2018. .

In addition, we brought back $96 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total
to $279 million. In November, we declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, a 5% increase versus the
fourth quarter of 2018. At yesterday's closing price of $46.96, the current yield is 3.4%, which is one of
the higher yields among the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.

Consistent with our deleveraging plan, share repurchases were limited in 2019. For the full year, we
repurchased only 700,000 shares of our stock, primarily surrendered for employee benefit plans at an
average price of $44.20. We issued 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option
exercises.

From an acquisition perspective during the year, we acquired ECS and 1 small geo component operations.
We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities. Total capital expenditures

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

in 2019 were $143 million, 10% lower than the prior year, reflecting a balance of investing for the future
while controlling our spending.

Our financial base remains strong. We ended 2019 with debt at 2.9x our trailing 12-month adjusted
EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and continue to
expect to delever to a ratio of debt-to-trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by
the end of 2020. We expect to accomplish this by limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of
acquisitions and using our operating cash flow to repay debt.

We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies
on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term,
which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. Our annual TSR was below the
11% to 14% target in both 2017 as well as 2018 but significantly above the target in 2019. Over those
same years, the TSR of the S&P 500 was well above historical averages. As a result, our recent 3-year
performance did not meet our top 1/3 goal. However, we believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio
management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this goal over time.

Now moving to a discussion of our 2020 guidance. 2020 sales are expected to be in the range of $4.7
billion to $4.9 billion or down 1% to up 3% over 2019. Acquisitions in 2019 should add 1% to sales growth
in 2020. Raw material-related price decreases implemented in the second half of 2019 should at lower
sales 1%.

We expect mid-single-digit volume growth in 2020 for most of our major businesses. This includes
Automotive, U.S. Spring, ECS, Aerospace, Geo Components and Work Furniture. We also expect the
growth in these businesses to be offset by approximately 1% of further year-over-year sales decreases
from planned exited volume in both Fashion Bed and Home Furniture as well as continued weak trade
demand for steel rod and wire. So absent exited business, volume is expected to be flat to up 4%.

2020 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60, reflecting earnings growth in
our Automotive, Bedding and other businesses to be more than offset by increasing steel cost, including
the nonrecurrence of 2019's LIFO benefit. Additionally, we expect increased cost in 2020 because
of investments we're making to support the growth, security and continuity of the company. These
investments include network and cybersecurity upgrades and personnel to support those activities.
We're also investing in our human resources organizations and related technology. Finally, employee
benefit costs are increasing due to a valuable change we made to our 401(k) plan, adding employee auto
enrollment. We're very pleased that this change increased employee participation rates in the 401(k) plan.

Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 23% versus 22% in 2019. We expect
2020 depreciation and amortization to approximate $200 million, net interest expense of approximately
$80 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. Based upon this guidance framework, our 2020 full year
adjusted EBIT margin should be in the range of 10.7% to 11%. Cash from operations should approximate
$550 million in 2020. Capital expenditures should approximate $160 million for the year and dividends
should require $220 million of cash.

Finally, we know impacts from the Corona virus are top of mind for many of you, and we are closely
monitoring global developments. Our current 2020 guidance does not include possible impacts from the
virus. It's still too early to develop reasonable quantitative data related to the impact. Our first priority is
the health and safety of our employees around the world.

For our employees in China, we've extended the Lunar New Year plant shutdowns in accordance with
Chinese provincial and local government extensions. We're establishing protocols in all 16 of our Chinese
facilities to better protect our 5,200 employees in China when they can return to work.

And for all Leggett & Platt employees around the world, we've implemented a travel ban to Asia and are
severely restricting all international travel. We're assessing the potential impact of this pandemic on our
business, including demand for our goods and our customers' goods, inventory availability throughout
our supply chain as well as our customers' supply chain, the global movement of goods and workforce
availability.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

We do not anticipate that there are factors unique to us that will cause the impact from this Corona virus
to be greater to our company than our global manufacturers -- than other global manufacturers. We
continue to monitor this situation, and we'll take all reasonable mitigation steps as facts unfold.

With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy.

Wendy M. Watson
Director of Investor Relations

That concludes our prepared remarks. We thank you for your attention, and we will be glad to answer your
questions. To allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only one question and
then yield to the next participant. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue
and we will answer those questions as well.
Melissa, we're ready to begin the Q&A session.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I guess, my first question is just -- can you talk a little bit to Comfort Core, maybe in the quarter, overall
Bedding, how that did? And anything that we should be aware of in the channel as we head into the
President's Day weekend and kind of the sales events around that.

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Sure. This is Mitch, Susan. So for Comfort Core, units continue to be very strong on the U.S. Spring side.
They were running at about 62% of units for the quarter, and about 48% of those included our Quantum
Edge as well. So I think that the Bedding outlook continues to be strong. I'll let Karl comment on any
trends going forward into that -- the holiday period.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

As Mitch said, the continued adoption of Comfort Core driven somewhat by the growth of hybrid
mattresses, both compressed and uncompressed, is at a level -- at a rate of 62% for the quarter, 56% for
the year that we didn't anticipate. So we're pleased with that -- with the launch of new product lines at the
Las Vegas market, which was last weekend that there was a greater introduction of Comfort Core.

The bedding industry feels pretty optimistic in terms of that there's relative stability in that industry, which
is kind of a change compared to the last 5 years. And advertising investments seem to be in place, new
product launches, so there's excitement around there. We feel pretty good. President's Day is a tough
one to call. I know there'll be heavy advertising going into it, but it's always one of those holidays that its
performance is subject to weather just because of being in February. But there's a build-up to it. We're
excited. Bedding was a great story in 2019, and we expect the same in 2020.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then you gave a lot of color around the impacts that you've seen
over the last year and then into the beginning of this year from steel prices. And understanding that it's
kind of hard for you to project going forward. But can you just kind of give us some sense of maybe what's
going on in that market? You talked to the weakness of trade demand in your rod and wire segment in
there. So can you just talk a little bit to how we should think about that as we move through 2020? What's
driving that weakness in demand? And any other color there?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Let's talk, first, pricing, and then we'll go through weakness in trade demand, which is very different
than our internal demand. But what happened is a continual deflation of input costs as 2019 progressed
until November, where we saw the first move-up in scrap. So we saw steel scrap inflate in November at a
rate of $20 a ton, followed by $25 a ton in December and then $30 a ton in January.

So we're dealing now with kind of the reverse lag effect from the standpoint that as prices deflated in
2019. We kept that benefit for 90 days. We're flipping that situation in 2020. But because of the kind of
the oddities of year-end, we actually are -- decreased our customer prices in January of 2020 because we
adjust every quarter.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

So we're -- those contracts, actually, in the face of our increase in input cost, we lower prices because of
lag effect. We will be increasing our customers' prices starting in April. So with that, there is a LIFO swing.
There is 0 impact of LIFO expense in our forecast for 2020 as we laid out guidance, but who the heck
knows, to your point. So that's what's happening from a pricing standpoint.

From a trade market perspective, again, this is trade, so think of us for about the 25% of the total tons
that we produce from the perspective as you would a large public steel company. In that case, we're like
them from the standpoint that our metal margins are okay. Margins aren't so bad because of the deflation
cycle, but the demand is incredibly soft. It's not specific to any particular sector. It's just macro, U.S.
economic and export demand for steel products in virtually every channel of distribution.

So people may question, "Well, wait a second, the steel -- U.S. steel industry was protected by
Trump tariffs last year while the products weren't." So there was a continued inflow of products in an
environment where export demand was very, very soft. So from a trade perspective, that's really what
happened in 2019, and we don't see a change in that in 2020. So I apologize for the long-winded answer,
but steel moves are really, really complex.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Yes. No, that's very helpful. And it sounds like it's having a -- quite an impact on the 2020 and how we
think about the guidance, so that's really helpful for us. And it means like...

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

It really does from a quarter perspective, Susan, so expect 1Q is going to be negatively impacted by that
pricing decrease while costs are rising. So yes, it is impacting the kind of the quarterly sequencing.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then as we go through the year, though, your comps also in that segment -- I know the
segments are going to change, so it's going to make it a little -- that's going to change things as well for
us. But the comps get a little easier and then -- as we move through the year from a revenue's...

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Said differently, we'll become more fully recovered from a margin perspective. But to revenues, you are
right, because we have the business that we appropriately walked away from that still impacts us in the
first half of the year that we anniversary. So Fashion Bed -- that kind of headwind of Fashion Bed really
goes away in the back half of the year, but we still deal with that legacy exposure in the first half. And
Home Furniture has a little of that same situation. But we'll move to an inflationary environment, which
will help offset some of that from a top line perspective.

Susan R. McCoy
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Susan, I'm going to go ahead and take an opportunity here really quick to -- you didn't specifically ask the
question about kind of progression of sales guidance and margin sort of progression through the year, but
Karl has introduced that idea already.

So I'll complete that discussion by saying, just to be clear, as we look at quarters throughout 2020, we
expect sales in the first half of the year to be down slightly and then in the second half of the year to be
up slightly. And so the stuff that he was talking about, and you guys have alluded to, there's more impact
from the excess volume in the first half of the year. We've got the flip from deflation to inflation. By the
second half of the year, we expect to have anniversaried most of the exit volume. So that's on the sales
side.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

On the earnings side, we would expect to see our quarterly margins, the margin trend to be very similar
to what we experienced in 2019, including the first quarter being lower than our expectations for the rest
of the year. And that gets to the steel lag that Karl was talking about, a slip on the steel side. And then
for the full year, we would pattern the margin progression basically to be flat to down slightly versus each
quarter in 2019 and then for the full year of 2019.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then I assume like as we get closer to you restating the
information according to the new segments, too, we'll get some of that historical, so we'll have a sense of
how to model it going forward?

Susan R. McCoy
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Absolutely.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

And it actually will help things, having the historic industrial and residential pooled together in this
Bedding segment. I think it should help because there's been this kind of offset. You had to read through
to try to figure out where the impact and when the impact in industrial was rolling through residential.
So I think it will help you from an analytics standpoint. And more importantly, it's how we manage the
business.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Yes. No, I think it's going to be very helpful, and especially as we get ECS in there and a lot of those
pieces of that supply chain. So I think it is going to be helpful. So yes. I will let somebody else talk.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

[ I think ] we spent a lot of those time on that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.

Daniel Joseph Moore
CJS Securities, Inc.

I guess, I wanted to start with -- just 1 or 2 real quick. Number one, can you quantify the dollar amount
or EPS impact of increased costs for some of the investments you described, network, cyber security, et
cetera, as well as the increased employee benefit-related costs in '20 versus '19?

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Daniel, this is Jeff. That number is approximately $10 million in total.

Daniel Joseph Moore
CJS Securities, Inc.

Between the 2?

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Between the 2. Correct.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Daniel Joseph Moore
CJS Securities, Inc.

Perfect. And second is more philosophical, but obviously, you remain committed to deleveraging, which I
know a lot of investors appreciate. Given the guidance a little light relative to expectations as well as just
the incredible powerful cash generation, why be quite that rigid if the shares were to come under pressure
for any reason, disappointment, whatever? Why not be perhaps a little bit more opportunistic and flexible
regarding potential buybacks?

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Daniel, this is Jeff again. Again, thank you for the question. I think that's a very appropriate one. But I
think if you'll go back and look at what we discussed at Investor Day, I think we're going to stay very
disciplined, very methodical and very intentional with our uses of cash. I mean, for us, we're going to
continue to invest for growth from a prioritization standpoint. We're going to continue to protect the
dividend. And we're going to continue on the path to reaching our deleveraging commitment that we've
made to all of our stakeholders. And after that would come share repurchases as a potential opportunity
as well as acquisitions. That may come down the path as well. So the point is well taken. But for us, we're
going to continue down that sequential path in terms of our prioritization of uses of cash.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I guess, we'll start with ECS. Could you clarify, it wasn't clear. I guess, I'm interested in volumes in Q4 and
the year. I think you said the year was up 11%. And then, of course, you talked about non-Bedding being
weak. I'm curious for 2020, in terms of the guide, if we're looking at, I think, mid-single digits of volume
up for ECS. How does that sort of break out between non-Bedding and Bedding?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Okay. Hey, John, this is Mitch. Yes, so for -- I think we see that the same trend that we saw in '19 in terms
of decline in some of the non-Bedding market but continued strong opportunities in 2020 in the Bedding
markets, both with pure foam mattresses and hybrid mattresses.

Wendy M. Watson
Director of Investor Relations

[indiscernible] Sorry, we're going to see some continuing deflation in 2020. And it's -- and some of it's due
to just that softness in the furniture market and the furniture brands that ECS sell.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. So is the mid-single-digit guide for volumes for ECS for 2020 comprised of high single or almost
double in Bedding and declines in non-Bedding? Or any help?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Yes, John, I think that's accurate. And that melt-off of non-Bedding and moved to Bedding from a
margin perspective is good for us. Remember, the non-Bedding tends to be blocks of commodity foam,
to the most part, replaced by higher-value Bedding-related products that may be either specialty foam
components or finished mattresses. So the answer to your question is yes. We would expect that the
Bedding-related side of it would be in the double-digit range. The net 5% is a continuation to Wendy's

point of deflation, which continued through the year, even into the fourth quarter and the softness of the
non-Bedding business.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then in the 2020 guide, again, on -- it looks like, I guess, excluding the exiting in the Fashion
Bed and the Home Furnishings. But is the guide for volume, exclusive of the exits, also down? And if so,
sort of how much and why?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

At the midpoint, it's up about 2%. And there's an expectation -- we rattle off all these businesses that
are growing mid-single digits, and you heard that list, so you -- something's down, and that's a continued
expectation of soft demand in the trade steel industries, is the primary driver of that.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay, okay. And then incredible job on working capital in the year and a huge source of cash, particularly
in Q4 in accounts receivable. Jeff, was there something timing-related there? Or how do we think about
either working capital as a percentage of revenue for 2020? Or what's -- what are some of the big moving
pieces on that? Obviously, it's a tough compare.

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Right. Thanks for the question, John. I mean, first of all, the team, you're right, did a tremendous job on
working capital during the course of 2019. And you saw that reflected in the 9.9% ratio there. I mean,
there were quite a few yeoman efforts that were contributors in 2019, especially the combination of
liquidating the inventory of the exited businesses that we've highlighted during the call, increased overall
and the focus of inventory-level reductions. You saw the deflation of raw material costs throughout the
course of 2019. It also contributed to that.

As we think about 2020, John, for us, the rigor and the focus will not change or will not let up at all as it
relates to our working capital efforts and improvements. But we don't see where we will have as many of
those significant huge wins that we saw in 2019 and 2020. However, again, the focus will continue to be
there, and we'll continue to drive that result as best we can across the organization.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And my last question is just sort of this high level focus that's taking hold, I mean, in the
investment side of the world on ESG. And wondering kind of where you are internally thinking about that,
whether you've hired a consultant or are sort of measuring yourself? What early inning -- gleanings you
may have on that and what we might expect going forward?

Wendy M. Watson
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. John, this is Wendy. Yes, we are working on ESG. We hope to finalize our first sustainability report
sometime in 2020. We are working with some external consultants to help us. As you know, we feel like
we've long been doing the right thing and have a really strong story to tell from an ESG perspective. But
gathering all that information from our different businesses around the world had been a challenge, and so
we have some help to do that.

So we're -- thanks for the question, and we're looking forward to being able to issue that first
sustainability report. But there is a lot of work going on across the company on those factors every day,

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

not in order to report great ESG, but because it's the right thing to do in our businesses. But we are going
to be pleased to be able to report them later this year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James.

Robert Kenneth Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

But just quickly, I wonder, Susan, I want to go back to your comments about the progression for the year,
just to make sure I'm grasping it correctly. But for 1Q, based on the steel sequential kind of inflation that
you're seeing from steel on the input side, we would want to model the expectations for 1Q EBIT margins
to be down year-over-year in the low point of 2020?

Susan R. McCoy
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

We would -- year-over-year, in the first quarter, expect the -- each of the quarters, not just the first
quarter, but each of the quarters to be may be in line with or slightly below what the prior year's quarter
was. That means, sequentially, it goes down from fourth quarter to first quarter because of the steel
issues that Karl was talking about and just normal seasonality, frankly, with our -- from fourth quarter to
first quarter in that business or across the businesses.

Robert Kenneth Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And that would mark a...

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Bobby, with the low point -- to your question, the low point being the first quarter.

Susan R. McCoy
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

That's right.

Robert Kenneth Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And I realize you guys are still doing some of the initial work on what the
potential impact could be from the buyers. But can you maybe just remind us of what products are
produced in China that are consumed back by the U.S. consumer? Because I know, typically, you set up
your production as produced in the local country, consumed by the local country. So any color on that
would be helpful.

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Bobby, this is Mitch, be happy to comment on that. So we have 16 plants, as we mentioned, in China.
Probably the biggest China-to-U.S. shipment comes in our Home Furniture business. There's some of that,
that's consumed by our customers in China, converted to finished goods and then it comes to the U.S.,
as well as a bit that's direct ship for us from China to the U.S. And then we have 10 automotive plants in
China.

And as you mentioned, primarily, those are local production for the local market. But there is some portion
of our -- of those goods, particularly motors and actuators, that are consumed all around the world,
including Europe and the U.S. So those are probably the 2 largest impacts. There's a small operation on
the Work Furniture side that has some shipments to the U.S., but Home Furniture and Automotive were
probably the biggest exposures.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Robert Kenneth Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay, that's very helpful. And I guess, lastly for me, Mitch, I think this will probably be back towards you
again. But can you maybe comment a little bit of detail on Hydraulic Cylinders? We had another decline
in the fourth quarter. Maybe what's -- what happened over the last 2 quarters in that business? And then
maybe the outlook going into 2020 for that growth area?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Okay, Bobby, sure. Yes, it's been a bit tough. Sales were really strong in Hydraulic Cylinders from the
second quarter of '18 through the second quarter of '19 and then really began to fall off rapidly. Our
customers, who are really the leading forklift producers, started forecasting significant demand drops of
15% to 20%. And that's really what we started to see in Q3 and again saw that accelerate in Q4. .

We don't have a lot of great data. But the industry data we do see shows that shipments were down over
20% in the fourth quarter, so pretty much in line with where we were and down 13% for the full year,
again, with that same kind of accelerating decline trend in the fourth quarter. We expect some of this
impact to continue as we look into 2020. Probably, at this point, we'd see sales year-over-year down in the
low double digits.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

I just have a question on pricing. You talked about the raw material relationship throughout this call, with
the pricing you're going to be putting on your customers coming in April. I think you're talking about
spring-related products there. Could you talk about your foam products, what pricing was looking like
going into the new year on that product?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

The -- like steel, it's hard to forecast. But we think that the foam chemical inputs have stabilized. There
was a little bit of a continued deflation in the fourth quarter but at a much lesser rate. So we think it's
near bottom, Keith. There's, frankly, not a lot of room to go. Corona virus may have some impact on it,
but we think we're at bottom. But we have not seen any signs of recovery. So in steel, we certainly are
seeing inflationary cycle. We do not have that call on foam chemical inputs.

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And second question, on the shape of the year, is the LIFO impact going to be spread out evenly
over the year? Or is a quarter-by-quarter sort of determination based on where inputs have moved?

Susan R. McCoy
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Keith, we're starting the year with 0 LIFO in 2020. So if nothing else changes, LIFO, purely as a stand-
alone element, would basically unwind from last year. So in quarter-to-quarter has increased a little bit,
first quarter to second quarter to third quarter and fourth quarter. We can provide those amounts to you if
you need the extra details.

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Yes, I'll probably get those from you. I'll probably get those from Wendy offline.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Wendy M. Watson
Director of Investor Relations

I have the quarter-over-quarter. We don't -- I mean, it's also -- we don't know, Keith. We'll update our
LIFO estimates as the quarters progress, but it's way too early to make a call.

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I didn't know if you had accrued something and then make adjustments to the accrual as time went
along or just -- it just hasn't happened. It sounds like the latter.

Wendy M. Watson
Director of Investor Relations

That's how it works, Keith. But again, because it's so early in the year, it's too early to make a call on
where we think steel -- the cost of our steel inventory will be at December 31. And that's -- so that --
those are the quarterly adjustments we make, and then we true it up at the end of the year. .

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Final question. On the Home Furniture products, you've been moving away from businesses there.
Where are you in this process? You had called that out as kind of a negative for the year. I thought that
was mostly done. Has something else that might come up on the radar that you just don't want to do
anymore?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

This is Mitch, Keith. No. You're right, it is substantially complete on the restructuring. We just -- while
we're looking at the year-over-year comparisons, we will continue to have -- show some decline from a
revenue standpoint. And as Karl mentioned, we'll face that, and particularly in the first half of next year
as well. But from the point of the restructuring around improving margins and earnings, that's been very
successful. The team has done a great job there.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

And Keith, a kind of final [ note ] to that, when you think about steel moving from a deflation to an
inflationary environment, you'll remember the last time we went through this cycle, we had a hard time
passing through steel inflation in a portion of our Home Furniture business that we no longer participate
in, the [indiscernible] side of the business and in Fashion Bed, which we no longer participate in. So we
feel that, as we move into this steel inflationary cycle, our company is better positioned. And the pricing
power that we had years ago, we now have again, and with a lot of good work in Home Furniture.

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Yes. And from a -- I guess, going forward, just to add on the Fashion Bed, that exit, it will be, particularly
as we go into next year, those are significant dollars that just don't repeat as we exit that business.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.

Peter Jacob Keith
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I didn't want to dig into the auto business because you guys have actually done quite well there the last
2 quarters. I think, with global market down 5, you guys were up 8, so now you're back to outperforming

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

the industry by over 1,000 basis points. Could you help us just understand the -- what's going on with
some of that outperformance? And if there's any ongoing continuation of that?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Yes, sure. Peter, this is Mitch. Yes. And all it took was taking the basis point -- the 1,000 basis point target
away for us to start killing it again, right?

Peter Jacob Keith
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes. That's how it works.

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Yes. Great timing. But no, I think we're glad that we did that. I mean, as we said before, it really is a long-
term target. But we think it's fair to look at ourselves against how the overall market is performing. But
again, that's a longer-term kind of basis.

We did have stronger Q3 than Q4, as we expected, right? As we know early in the year, it was tough to
have confidence in us, but I think we came through with what we expected. And then we continue to see
that same kind of optimism in 2020.

Right now, I think we'd see somewhere mid-single-digit improvement year-over-year for 2020, with the
market right now flat to down 0.5% or 1%. Who knows? I think that will continue to move around a bit.
But we continue to have strong gains, content and new products. So I think we remain very positive on
that business.

Peter Jacob Keith
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then I wanted to ask a question around spring and also the adjustable basis. So the U.S.
Spring business accelerated sequentially, but the raw material headwind also picked up notably. And if I
remember correctly, I think you did cut prices at the beginning of Q4. So the 2-part question would be,
does that imply that the units of spring, which I know you don't report anymore, but did that accelerate
with the fourth quarter? And then on a related note, why did the adjustable base business pick up so
strongly in Q4?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

I'll take the mattress units. It's really a content story. It's for us to run 62% Comfort Core, as Mitch said,
and then the connectivity to an increasing adoption of Quantum Edge. So its dollars are significantly
outpacing units. But on adjustables...

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Yes. On adjustables, yes, very strong quarter, up over 20%. But it's also -- you have to look -- so it was
strong. It's been strong for the last few quarters. I think the outsized year-over-year comparison is in part
because of a very weak Q4 in '18. So the run rate was good but pretty consistent with what we've been
seeing for the last few quarters.

Peter Jacob Keith
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And lastly for me, just on -- was just trying to understand the timing of price cuts and price
increases. So are we correct in -- it was the beginning of Q4, there was a price cut. Now there's another
one at the beginning of Q1, and that will be followed by a price increase in April. And I guess what I'm

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

trying to get at is that raw material headwind looks like it could have a -- get worse in Q1 and then start
to stabilize in Q2 to Q4.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Keith, you're exactly right based on what we know today. You're absolutely accurate.

Operator

Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James.

Robert Kenneth Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I just want to quickly touch on the fabric and flooring products segment. How did that perform during the
quarter? And as we haven't talked about it in a while, but is that business still kind of the same strong
cash flow-generation business that we used to talk about before?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

The answer is yes. That it's a really good business that consumes very little capital. Mitch and the team
have done a really good job of leaning those businesses out from a working capital perspective, so a
greater focus there. But in flooring's case, it's slow growth. As a matter of fact, we would call it probably
over time. Carpet adoption is probably negative 2% to 3% a year, but its returns on capital employed
are very, very high. It's the proverbial cash cow. It's a good business. The fabrics business is somewhat
similar to that, with the exception of Geo Components, which we continue to invest in and is performing
very, very well.

Operator

Our next question is another follow-up from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. .

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Karl, in your remarks, you said that your Aerospace volumes were up 11% in the quarter. Can you just
give us any color there? Has there been any disruption as it relates to, obviously, some of the issues that
the OEMs have been having this year with some of their models? And how are you seeing the health of
that supply chain? And how we should be thinking about that for 2020?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Susan, I just read numbers. Mitch is going to answer the question.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. All right. We'll let Mitch talk.

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Okay. I'll give it a shot. Yes. So we actually haven't seen disruptions so far. Of course, the Boeing 737
MAX production halt is big news in the industry. But the supply chain -- dip in the supply chain -- had
been struggling to catch up for a long time. And so while they have stopped production, it really hasn't
impacted us at this point.

We're also seeing really strong production on some of the engine platforms that we're on. And remember,
we service not only Boeing but the Airbus planes as well. And so that's really what has been driving our

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

strong growth in the last couple of quarters, particularly on our fabrication facilities in the U.S. and in
Europe. And we see that continuing into 2020. I think that, right now, our outlook is for low double-digit
growth there in Aerospace continuing.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms.
Watson for any final comments.
