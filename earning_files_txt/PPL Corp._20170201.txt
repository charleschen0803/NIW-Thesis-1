Good morning, everyone
We appreciate you joining us for today's call
With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, as well as the presidents of our U.S
utility businesses
Starting with slide 2, our agenda this morning includes an overview of our 2016 earnings results along with an operational update
Following that, I'm going to address our 2017 earnings forecast and review our projections for long-term earnings growth
Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview
Before I get started, I did want to highlight a few key points of our presentation this morning
We've delivered strong 2016 ongoing earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth
We've also raised our dividend by 4% in 2017, with our continued commitment to grow that by 4% annually through 2020. We've also taken steps to further de-risk our 2017 through 2020 plan by significantly reducing our foreign currency risk and reducing our load growth forecast from 0.5% to no load growth
Finally, we also believe we are well positioned to manage the potential impacts of tax reform
Turning to slide 3, today, we announced 2016 reported earnings of $2.79 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2015. Adjusting for special items, our 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, up 11% from 2015 results which puts us at the high end of our forecast range
For the fourth quarter of 2016, reported earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago
Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.60 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.43 a year ago
The key drivers of the 11% growth were strong performance across the regulated businesses and a positive tax adjustment of $0.05 per share related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits
2016 marks seventh consecutive year that PPL has exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast
As our track record shows, we take great pride in delivering on the commitments we make to our shareowners
Turning to slide 4, backed by the continued strong performance of our utilities, today we announced we're increasing our common stock dividend on an annualized basis from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share or a 4% increase
The quarterly dividend of $0.395 per share will be payable April 1 (sic) [April 3] to shareowners of record as of March 10. This marks PPL's 15th dividend increase in the last 16 years
Let's move to slide 5 for an update on our utility operations
In Kentucky, our rate review continues to proceed as expected before the Kentucky Public Service Commission
This comes after our Kentucky Utilities filed a request in late November of last year to increase revenue by a combined $210 million
That includes revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million respectively at Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric, through adjustments to annual base electricity rates
In addition, it includes a revenue increase of $14 million for LG&E through an adjustment to annual base rates â€“ gas base rates
The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient
We've included a schedule for the rate review process in the Appendix to today's slides
If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect on July 1, 2017. The company's continuation of the customer experience initiative has resulted in another J
Power award in Kentucky
LG&E and KU ranked first and second among mid-sized utilities in the Midwest region in 2016 Calendar-Year Electric Utility Business Customer Service Satisfaction Study
This brings the total number of J
Power awards earned by PPL subsidiaries to 42. In Pennsylvania, we remain focused on transmission and distribution system improvements, with an eye towards reliability and resiliency
We continued to make substantial progress in these areas in 2016. As a result of the investments we've made, PPL Electric Utilities today has one of the most robust and advanced distribution automation systems in the country
That system, which was bolstered by the addition of more than 700 smart grid devices last year, avoided more than 100,000 customer interruptions throughout the year
And as a result of investments we've made to modernize and expand our transmission system, sustained transmission outages have dropped by nearly 75% over the last five years
PPL Electric Utilities reliability performance is among the nation's best
We're intent on keeping it that way, as we execute our plans for 2017 and beyond
In the UK, we received the final RIIO-ED1 results for the 2015-2016 regulatory year, achieving the highest incentive revenues among the UK's distribution network operators
End customers have rated us the best electricity network in the UK, with an average customer satisfaction rating of 89%
Meanwhile, we remain on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016-2017 regulatory year incentive targets
Details on our projected 2016-2017 incentive revenues is included in the Appendix on pages 24 and 25. Turning to slide 6, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15. Moving to slide 7, we show a walk of the drivers from our 2016 ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast
I should point out that included in our 2017 forecast is $0.05 of hedge restrikes that move value from 2017 to 2019. Without the restrikes, our EPS forecast would have been $2.20 per share
Our 2017 guidance is lower than 2016 earnings, primarily from a lower foreign currency hedged exchange rate, dilution from issuing additional equity of $250 million per year, and tax benefits recorded in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in 2017. We've increased our equity issuances in the plan from $100 million to $350 million per year, to support the funding of incremental capital spending and to continue to strengthen the balance sheet
This will help us maintain strong credit metrics and also lowers future holding company debt balances, which reduces the potential impact of tax reform, as we'll discuss in a moment
Moving to slide 8, PPL continues to invest responsibly in the future
It's that investment, coupled with timely rate recovery in the constructive jurisdictions we operate in, that's driving our 5% to 6% earnings per share growth
Our capital plan of about $3 billion per year is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of 5.3% from 2017 through 2020, with our rate base growing to $29 billion
We expect to receive near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $13 billion infrastructure investment we expect to make during that time
As you can see, our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth objectives
Slide 9 highlights the key drivers and assumptions in our business plan
As mentioned earlier, that plan assumes $350 million per year in equity issuances and targets additional dividend growth of about 4% annually through 2020. We expect 4% to 6% growth in our domestic utilities from 2017 through 2020. This reflects several things: higher gross margins from additional capital investments in Kentucky; increased transmission spending in Pennsylvania, partially offset by higher depreciation and interest; and the dilution from the equity issuances I just mentioned
Domestic net income is expected to grow 5% to 7% over the forecast period
Meanwhile, we're expecting UK earnings growth of 6% to 8%, reflecting the hedges we've put in place and our ability to achieve our $1.30 per pound budgeted rate through 2020. In addition to effects of currency, the growth in our UK segment is driven by higher gross margins, driven by annual price increases and higher pension income due to higher returns on higher pension asset balances, which more than offsets the effects of any dilution
We continue managing our currency risk proactively, taking steps to improve the risk reward profile and the certainty we will achieve our growth objectives
We can meet 5% EPS growth through 2020, even if the pound drops to $1.13 per pound, and we can meet that growth through 2019 at $0.90 per pound
This is a very significant improvement in our risk reward profile
Vince will provide a detailed update on our foreign currency hedging in his remarks
We're expecting net income for the UK segment to now grow in the 8% to 10% range for the forecast period
Overall, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 through 2020. Further, we expect to achieve a very competitive total annual share on the return of 9% to 10%, as we execute our plans for growth
Let's turn to slide 10. We know the investment community has a keen interest in the topic of U.S
tax reform, including how any changes may impact PPL and other utilities
For PPL, the two primary effects we're tracking are the deductibility of interest expense on our domestic holding company debt and the net effect on rate base at our utilities from the extension of 100% bonus depreciation, offset of course by our tax rate
I want to highlight two very important points that differentiates PPL from its peers
First, since about half of our business resides in the UK, we have minimal exposure to tax reform for half of our earnings
Second, we have the flexibility to raise capital in the UK, thereby retaining the ability to deduct interest
We support efforts to simplify the U.S
tax code and to lower the federal corporate tax rate to a level that is more competitive globally
But speculating on the impact of tax reform is extremely difficult, given the lack of detail on current proposals that have been set forth today
Our industry has a good track record of working with policy makers to shape meaningful tax-related legislation that minimizes negative impacts to our customers and to our companies
This was true during the last comprehensive tax reform in 1986, as well as during the debate on â€“ later on taxes related to dividends and capital gains
Our base assumption is that any benefits from the reduction of the tax rate will be passed through to our customers
Therefore, the only real impact on our utilities is the impact on rate base
As we think about tax reform, it's important to keep in mind that we have several opportunities, in PPL's case, to offset potential impacts
We can use the dry powder created by our hedging strategy, we could shift some of holding company debt financings to the UK, and we have the ability to increase capital spending
Of course, the details of any tax reform plan are very hard to predict at this point
But to help frame this up for PPL, I wanted to address a few possible scenarios
First, as it relates to rate base at our domestic utilities, if we're required to adapt 100% expensing of capital, our breakeven tax rate for rate base would be about 20%
Regarding deductibility of interest, if the tax rate is reduced to 20% and we retain the ability to deduct interest to expense on all debt or if non-deductibility of interest is only applied to new debt, we would see about a $0.05 per share impact to earnings which we believe we can fully mitigate with the strategies I just talked about
If non-deductibility of interest applies to all existing debt, we would see about a $0.10 per share impact to earnings, which we also believe we can largely mitigate through these strategies, especially if the pound stays around $1.20 or above as it is today
I'm confident that U.S
tax reform, as it's currently being discussed, is a manageable event for PPL and not a barrier in our ability to meet our stated goal of growing EPS by 5% to 6% through 2020. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince, for a more detailed look at our earnings
2016 was a very good year and I'm proud of PPL's many accomplishments in 2016. And I'm equally excited about our future, as we continue and advance a smarter, cleaner, and more reliable energy infrastructure
At the outset of the year, we established our earnings forecast
In the end, we delivered, achieving the high end of that forecast range
As 2016 began, we said we would begin to grow our dividend more meaningfully in 2017. Today, we have delivered, announcing a 4% dividend increase
We established also a plan to invest more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2016. Again, we delivered
It's what we do, we deliver
And looking ahead, we are very well-positioned to continue to deliver on the commitments we've made to our shareowners and customers
PPL is uniquely advantaged with operations in the UK, with only half of our earnings subject to potential U.S
tax reform, and our ability to optimize the capital structure relative to interest deductibility
And as Vince noted in his remarks, we believed we are now positively positioned with the company's exposure to the British pound, given our hedging activity to-date which could also be used to mitigate any potential negative impacts of U.S
On that note, I want to thank you for participating in today's call
And operator, let's open the call for questions, please
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning, Greg
I'll ask Vince to comment, but just one point to note is what the increase in our equity issuance is that obviously is going to create some dilution which has a ripple effect across all the businesses of course
So, that's one driver
But Vince, do you want to take care of the other drivers?
Those are the biggest
Thanks, Greg
Good morning, Julien
I'll ask Vince to take that question
I don't think our strategy would change much even in the face of tax reform
I think the capital deployment might get a little bit higher, again, depending on how the 100% expensing goes
But I think overall, the capital structure and the credit metrics that we currently are targeting would still be pretty much the same
Would be probably more Pennsylvania distribution than Kentucky
Yeah
Still roughly $0.01 for $0.01.
So yeah, that's still probably â€“ it would clearly be well below where the pound is today
So probably in the upper teens
So, there is room on some of the hedges
The more recent hedges we put on are straight swaps, so there's less flexibility there
But obviously, with the open position for the remainder of 2019 and 2020 now, that would be upside and then, of course, longer term as we see how Brexit turns out
And hopefully, with the rising pound, we have the ability to lock in 2020 and beyond at higher than $1.30. I think we've talked on previous calls, the 20-year average prior to Brexit was above $1.50, so closer to $1.60. So, there's room to grow there and certainly exposure to the upside for us
I'll ask Greg Dudkin, President of our Pennsylvania Utility, to answer that question
Thanks, Steve
Good morning, Jonathan
Got you, yeah
Incremental $0.05.
Sure
I'll ask Vic Staffieri, the President and Chairman of our Kentucky Utilities, to answer that one
Good morning, Paul
I don't think reliability would be at risk at all, but I'll let Robert Symons, the CEO of our UK operation answer that question
That's a good question
I'm not sure that we have that right off the top of our heads
So, we'll have to follow up with you on that
Sure
So I'll start and I'll let Vince follow up
But as you may recall, with the UK holding company we can lever up to 85% and still maintain investment grade credit ratings
So that's the kind of upper limit
We're right now in the kind of mid-to-upper 70%, so we have that level of headroom to go up to 85%
So, I don't know if you had any other comments, Vince
Okay, operator, I think that's all the questions in the queue
So, I'm just going to close now and say thanks everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you in a couple of months on our first quarter earnings call
