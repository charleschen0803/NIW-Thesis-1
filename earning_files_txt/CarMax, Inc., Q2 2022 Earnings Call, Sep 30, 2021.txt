Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q2 FY '22 CarMax Earnings Release
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to your host David Lowenstein. You may begin.

David Lowenstein

Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings
conference call. I'm here today with Bill Nash, our President and CEO; Enrique Mayor-Mora, our Senior
Vice President and CFO; and Jon Daniels, our Senior Vice President, CAF operations. Let me remind you
our statements today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance
are forward-looking statements we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These statements are based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future

Should you have any follow-up questions after the call, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations
department at (804) 747-0422, extension 7865. Lastly, let me thank you in advance for asking only one
question and getting back in the queue for more follow-ups. Bill?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, David, and congratulations on your new role. Welcome to the call to everyone else.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you read in our earnings release this morning, we
delivered a record level of used sales for the second quarter and an all-time record for wholesale vehicle
sales as well as robust CarMax auto finance income growth.

For the second quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered total sales of $8 billion, up 49%
compared with the second quarter of FY '21, driven by higher average selling prices and volume gains.

Net earnings per diluted share was $1.72, down $0.07 from a year ago as we rolled over last year's
pandemic-driven expense reductions and also continue to invest in our growth.

Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 420,000 cards in total, up 20% versus
the second quarter last year. For the 6 months of FY '22, we have sold approximately 872,000 retail and
wholesale cars combined. We also bought 59% more cars from consumers in the second quarter this year
versus last year and achieved record self-sufficiency of approximately 70%.

Our omnichannel platform, unique customer offerings, solid execution and macro factors are driving
performance across our company. In our retail business, total unit sales in the second quarter were up
6.7% and used unit comps were up 6.2% versus the second quarter last year despite headwinds from
inventory levels, staffing and overall used car valuations.

Our teams made steady progress in building our saleable inventory during the quarter, and we achieved
sequential growth each month despite the strong retail demand that carried into the second quarter. While
it remains below our targeted levels, we are on pace to grow our saleable inventory during the balance of
the year.

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

In addition to strong unit sales, we reported $2,185 of retail gross profit per used unit in line with our
historical second quarter performance. For wholesale, units sold were up 41.4% from a record second
quarter last year. Wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,005 compared with $1,086 for the same period
last year. The strength in wholesale units was primarily driven by the ongoing success of our instant online
appraisal offering that rolled out nationwide on carmax.com in February after launching on Edmunds.com
last year.

We also benefited from still elevated valuations of used autos in the broader market. CarMax Auto Finance
or CAF continued to deliver solid results with income of $200 million. In addition, CAF and our partner
lenders delivered strong offers in all credit tiers, though we did see a sequential decline in Tier 3 volume
relative to the first quarter.

Jon will provide more details on customer financing and CAF contribution shortly. Now I'd like to turn
the call over to Enrique, who will provide more information on our second quarter financial performance,
followed by Jon. After that, I'll update you on the progress against our strategic priorities and then open
up the call to Q&A. Enrique?

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Total gross profit was $815 million, up 8% over last year's
second quarter. This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $189 million, which was up 31% and used
vehicle margin of $507 million, which was up 5% from last year's second quarter. Other gross profit was
$120 million, down $7 million from last year's second quarter.

Favorability in the quarter included $22 million of margin contribution from Edmunds since our June 1,
2021 acquisition. This was on revenues of $34.5 million, which is noted as advertising and subscription
revenues in the earnings release.

Other gross profit also benefited from an $18 million improvement in third-party finance fees with
income of $3 million compared with $15 million in costs last year. This was driven by lower Tier 3 volume
compared with last year and our renegotiated third-party finance fees.

Offsetting this favorability, service was down $40 million, primarily the result of rolling over favorable
items from the prior year's quarter and short-term headwinds during this year's quarter. Specifically, we
comped over last year's COVID-related cost reductions.

Additionally, we experienced higher 90-day warranty cost timing stemming from the significant increase in
sales during the first quarter of fiscal year '22 compared to last year's first quarter. We also realized lower
retail service margin as production capacity was focused on reconditioning retail cars. Also impacting other
gross profit, EPP was down $6 million or 5.4%.

While penetration was stable at above 60%, last year's second quarter included a benefit of approximately
$8 million in profit sharing revenues that was not recognized this year due to a timing shift in the
performance period for one of our providers.

On the SG&A front, expenses for the second quarter increased to $574 million, up 30% from our COVID-
impacted quarter a year ago and as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and growth. As a
reminder, last year during the pandemic, we took aggressive cost containment actions, particularly during
the first half of the year.

SG&A as a percent of gross profit was 70.4% compared to 58.8% during the prior year's second quarter.
The increase in SG&A dollars over last year was primarily driven by 3 main factors. First, a $55 million
increase in total compensation and benefits driven by staffing and sales growth and by the inclusion of
Edmond's payroll this quarter.

Second, a $41 million increase in other overhead due to investments to advance our technology platforms
and strategic initiatives. Third, a $35 million increase in advertising expense, as previously communicated,

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

to amplify the CarMax brand, build awareness in our -- of our omnichannel offerings and drive customer
acquisition.

We estimate that the COVID-related cost savings in SG&A in the prior year quarter was between $25
million to $30 million. For the first 6 months of FY '22, SG&A as a percent of gross profit is 64.8%
leveraging 5 points over last year's first half rate of 69.3%. We remain committed to ensuring we are
efficient in our spend and we expect that targeted areas of focus will continue to deliver improvements
over time.

We achieved an additional reduction year-over-year from our core CEC cost structure during the second
quarter. Additionally, our omnichannel capabilities will unlock new opportunities as we leverage automation
to reduce expenses and streamline operations.

For example, our online instant offer program is resulting in more efficient buying organization as we
continue to leverage the power of automation, AI and data science. On capital allocation. Our ongoing
focus is to deploy capital in our business to grow market share and deliver long-term shareholder value.
That includes investing in digital capabilities to enhance all aspects of our omnichannel experience, such as
online vehicle acquisition, which is already generating a strong ROI.

We also continue to invest in the strategic expansion of our store footprint and look for additional paths to
create incremental value. In regard to our share repurchase program, we remain committed to returning
excess capital to shareholders and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares in the quarter for
approximately $220 million. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon.

Jon G. Daniels
Senior Vice President of CarMax Auto Finance

Thanks, Enrique, and good morning, everybody. Once again, our finance business has delivered
outstanding results. For the second quarter, CAF's penetration, net of 3-day payoffs, was 43% compared
with 42.6% a year ago. Tier 2 decreased to 21.6% of used unit sales compared with 22.3% last year.

Tier 3 accounted for 7.2% compared with 11.1% a year ago. As a reminder, last year, CAF decided to
strategically route a portion of its Tier 1 volume and all of its allocated Tier 3 volume to partners to
preserve the high quality of its portfolio during the start of the pandemic.

These changes were rolled back by the end of Q2 last year. During the quarter, we observed strong offers
from our Tier 2 partners as they competed for additional volume within the CarMax channel. We also
saw a decrease in application volume and conversion to sale for applications in the lower portion of the
credit spectrum. We believe these decreases are due in large part to the higher average selling prices seen
across the industry.

During this year's second quarter, on the strength of record used unit sales, CAF's net loans originated
was nearly $2.4 billion. The weighted average contract rate charged to new customers was 8.5%, up from
8.2% a year ago, but down from 9% in the first quarter.

Similar to the first quarter, this year-over-year difference in EPR is a result of the change in credit mix of
customers rather than an increase in the rate charged. For our portfolio, overall interest margin increased
to 7.2% versus 6% in the same period last year, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $65 million or
33%.

This strong net interest margin highlights the strength of our ABS program and the favorable state of the
capital markets. Given we recognize income over the life of our loans, we will benefit from this higher net
interest margin across multiple years.

CAF income for the quarter was $200 million, up from $147 million a year ago. This significant year-over-
year increase comes as a result of the stronger net interest margin and higher receivables. Our expense
related to the provision in the second quarter was $35 million and results in an ending reserve balance of
$398 million for the second quarter or 2.66% of managed receivables. This is in line with the 2.62% at the

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

end of the first quarter while also reflecting a modestly higher percentage of Tier 3 loans in the portfolio as
a result of our decision to retain 10% of Tier 3 volume.

We believe our future outlook on losses and corresponding reserve is appropriate given the current
macroeconomic environment. With regard to our lending platform and specifically, where CAF participates
across the credit spectrum, we are constantly evaluating the landscape and remain committed to making
decisions that we believe are sustainable in the long term and in the best interest of our customers.

During the second quarter, in coordination with our business partners, we began a small test of CAF
originating in the Tier 2 space. Much like when CAF entered Tier 3, this test will remain in place at low
volumes for an extended period as we take the time to understand both the Tier 2 customer and how
CAF's participation in this space can best enhance the range of credit options, improve the customer
experience, and drive profitability.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Jon. Thank you, Enrique. I'm very proud of how our teams have driven strong results this
quarter across our diversified business model. We're excited about the incredible opportunity that lies
ahead. We've intentionally built our omnichannel platform to give every customer the ability to progress to
a sale or a buy regardless of how they shop with us.

We found that most customers don't want to shop for a car in a way that is tied solely to an in-store or
digital experience. While we provide the ability for customers to buy a car 100% in-store or 100% online,
our omnichannel capabilities really differentiate CarMax by enabling our customers to personalize their
experience with a mix of digital and physical interactions to meet their needs.

In the second quarter, approximately 9% of our retail unit sales were online, consistent with our first
quarter and up from the prior year's quarter of 3%. As a reminder, we considered an online retail sale
when a customer completes all 4 of the major transactional activity remotely. So that's reserving a car,
financing the vehicle, if that's needed trading in or opting out of a trade-in and creating a sales order.

Our wholesale auctions remain virtual, so 100% of wholesale sales, which represents 21% of total revenue
are considered online transactions. Total revenues resulting from online transactions was 28%. This is up
from 24% in the first quarter and up from 18% in last year's second quarter.

Approximately 55% of retail unit sales were omni sales this quarter, flat to the first quarter and up from
the prior year second quarter of 49%. Omni sales are those where customers complete at least one of
those major transactional activities remotely.

We've been focused on completing the rollout of our 100% self-service experience where customers can
independently complete the entire car buying process online if they so choose. Currently, a little more than
50% of our customers have access to a complete end-to-end unaided online experience.

And we are on track to bring this capability to all of our retail consumers by the end of the fiscal year.
Remember, while rolling out access to these capabilities will enable more customers to complete a 100%
self-service online experience, all customers currently can buy a car online with assistance from an
associate.

In the second quarter, we bought approximately 188,000 vehicles from customers through our online
instant appraisal, which represents about half of our total buys from customers. That's a 15% increase
from our record first quarter number. This growth supports our belief that we become and are further
expanding our position as the largest online buyer of used autos from consumers in the U.S.

We are continuously enhancing our e-commerce offerings to exceed customer expectations and to
seamlessly integrate with our best-in-class store experience. Let me share a few examples. One of the
areas we've enhanced is our digital capabilities -- our digital capabilities is our financing process. Nearly
65% of our finance customers start their loan process online with a preapproval application. And as of

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

the second quarter, 100% of those customers now receive a digital decision that includes customized loan
terms.

A majority of those customers through no additional time or effort are provided digital access to their
personal financing terms on every car on inventory, allowing them to shop with more confidence. In
addition, what differentiates our experience is the ability to provide these inventory-wide credit offers
using multiple finance partners, including CAF. This ensures we provide our customers with the most
attractive rates and terms.

We're excited about our progress on this crucial part of the car buying journey. We also continue to
advance what we believe is industry-leading digital merchandising which is critical to providing customers
an immersive experience with our inventory as they shop remotely.

This quarter, we added 360-degree interior views from the driver side and the back seat of the vehicle and
continue to advance vehicle hotspots, which are call-outs to help the customer understand key vehicle
features. We also continue to leverage artificial intelligence to ensure that our photos are consistently high
quality to best represent our inventory.

We're hearing very positive feedback on these advancements that help customers understand and fall in
love with our vehicles as they shop online. In relation to our acquisition of Edmunds, we're very pleased
with our progress as our teams have hit the ground running on new innovations. We will continue to invest
in the Edmunds brand and work together to unlock opportunities to compete across the larger used auto
ecosystem.

We are really proud of the quarter and the significant progress we have made in advancing our
omnichannel strategy. We are well positioned to deliver the most customer-centric experience in the used
auto industry, which will enable sustainable growth and create meaningful long-term shareholder value.
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. So Kevin?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on the new Volt. So I guess the question I want to ask, and I know you talked about this
a bit in your comments, but just as we look at this quarter and the 6.2% used unit comp, maybe help
us better contextualize that. I mean that's the backdrop. And clearly, with COVID, maybe coming out of
the COVID crisis, a lot of the internal initiatives, what -- is there a way to think about that number on a
more normalized basis? I mean, how is it tracking versus what you view as the real help to the underlying
health of your business.

Then as a follow-up, this is from a positioning standpoint, you and your team are talking more and more
now about used cars together with wholesale cars as a measure of overall sales. Does that reflect more of
a strategic shift on the part of CarMax?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Thank you for the question, Brian. So on the first question, look, we're really pleased with the roughly
6% comps. And I say that because you also have to put little context around the environment. So we had
several headwinds that we also faced during the quarter. First of all, inventory.

Inventory is lower than where we want to be. It's probably about 30% off of -- at the end of the quarter
probably about 30% off of where we would normally target. In addition to the inventory headwind, we
were understaffed, and we still are understaffed, but not to the degree, we were understaffed pretty much
across the board.

And that's important not only because it hinders our ability to hit our SLAs, but in some cases, we just
weren't able to get back with customers, which is never a good thing. And so we're working on that. And
then I think also just a broader macro thing, it's just the used car valuations.

I mean year-over-year, acquisition prices are up about $6,000. And I think Enrique talked about in his
opening remarks or Jon talked about in his opening remarks about how that may push some used car
customers just out of the market. And I think when you take the comps in that light with those headwinds,
those headwinds when you add them all together are material headwinds.

So we feel great about the comps for the quarter, and we also feel great about the overall progress. On
your second question, how we talk about using the wholesale? Yes, we do talk a little bit differently about
that, but I think that really goes back to a little bit of what I talked about on Analyst Day, which is people
always think about us as this used car retail. And that is, in fact, great, but we're much more than that.

We're a great retailer, a great wholesaler, a great financier. We've added Edmunds, we're getting dealer
services, and it really goes to this broader used auto ecosystem. So that's really kind of the change that as
to why we talk about both.

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

That's helpful, Bill. And just a follow-up on the initial question. I mean is there a way to quantify what that
6.2% would have been had you not faced these headwinds in the quarter?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

Yes, I'd tell you, Brian, it's hard. And I'll give you one example, like the inventory. Being that down, that
substantially down inventory would be just in itself a significant headwind. Now I will tell you, I don't think
the normal elasticity applies right now. because a lot of folks are under inventory.

But what I will tell you is we feel like when you take all 3 of those things and add them up, there are
material headwinds. So again, we're pleased with how the quarter came out from a comp perspective and
just overall.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

So the inventory dynamic has been, I think, pretty obvious throughout the quarter for anyone kind of
looking at your website. What is your line of sight into getting inventory back into kind of more normalized
levels? I know you mentioned you expect it to continue to improve as it did during the August quarter, but
just is this something where you're 3 or 6 months out? And just to quantify, is it a staffing issue? Is it the
acquiring of vehicles that's the issue? Help us understand kind of where the pinch point is right now on the
inventory side.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Great. Yes. Thank you, Sharon. Well, first of all, it's not acquiring the vehicles. I talked about in my
opening remarks, it's just about the fact that we're approximately 70% self-sufficient. So it's definitely not
the sourcing. As I talked about with Brian's question, it certainly has been a headwind.

And it really all relates back to what happened in the fourth and the first quarter. In the fourth quarter
typically is the time where we build our inventory up, we weren't able to do that because of COVID and
some winter disruption productions.

Then we had record sales in the first quarter. So we're still digging out of that hole. And like I told, Brian,
we're about 30% light to target. We're about 15% year-over-year. If you look at last year's second
quarter, where were this second quarter, we're about 15% light.

We did make great progress sequentially every month. We grew our inventory. And look, we plan to
continue to build inventory over the rest of the year. And I think the timing is really going to be -- when
we get back to where we want to be, will really depend somewhat on the demand.

As far as staffing, yes, during the quarter, although we were able to build inventory, we did have some
headwinds even on the staffing side. But again, I think staffing in general, we're making great progress.
We made great progress staffing across the board throughout the quarter, and we continue to make great
progress in this quarter as well.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

And I know you mentioned to Brian, that it's kind of hard to quantify the impact of the inventory. But I'm
curious if you've seen conversion go down just because, obviously, every used car is like a snowflake. And
if you don't have as broad of inventory, I mean you have to be losing sales. Is there any way to look at
conversion as like a metric that might indicate what's been left on the table?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think conversion was down a little bit. We look at conversion in a couple of different ways, both
conversion from when they start top of funnel, but then also in the store. Store was fairly strong, but up
top of the funnel we saw conversion go down, which we think is a great opportunity because we've always

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

said, one of the main reasons people don't buy from us is because we don't have the vehicle that they're
looking for, and that certainly is magnified when your inventory is down.

Operator

Our next question comes from Rick Nelson with Stephens.

Nels Richard Nelson
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I wanted to follow up on CAF and the strategy to do more Tier 3 business at CAF. Can you compare the
profitability of a Tier 3 unit sale to a third-party lender and what are the risks, I guess, with the strategy?

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. I appreciate your question, Rick. Yes. So with regard to a Tier 3 unit, a Tier 3 sale from a
finance perspective, obviously, there's generally a higher cost of fund. There's a higher-risk customer
there. But it's going to be just a little south of maybe a more prime -- a prime loan, if you will. So in that
-- depending on the funding environment and obviously, the APR we can charge. But let's say, in that
$2,000 to $2,100 range if you're able to capture all the finance economics potentially, but there is higher
risk there.

So there's a funding aspect there. Now obviously, with our partners, we were able to renegotiate fees.
We're currently paying $750 to those Tier 3 loans that our partners pick up. And obviously, we mentioned
beginning -- over the course of Q1, we started taking now 10% of the volume within the Tier 3 space. And
we're happy with that volume, and we appreciate it, and we'll continue to assess the mix that we should
have.

But ultimately, for us, we want to make sure that whether we take more Tier 3, our partners take more
Tier 3, we want to make sure that we are able to provide great credit offers to those customers. And in
our current credit platform construct, we feel we do that. So those are the economics simply that answers
your question. But again, we love the way it's constructed today, and we provide great offers to those
customers.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And Rick, the only thing I would add to that is whether it's Tier 3 or Tier 2 for that matter, it really is
about balancing the sustainability of the program, the profitability and then the customer experience. So
we take all that into consideration.

Operator

Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Bill, the surge in vehicles sourced from your online appraisal tool, it's really impressive. Do you have a feel
for what those sellers would have done without the tool? Would they have showed up at a CarMax store?
Where they have gone to another dealer or they have sold through some person-to-person listing service?
Where are they coming from?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Craig, I think -- look, we're pleased with the online. I think we're getting a lot of incremental units there
because even our traditional appraisal lane is still very strong. So I'm not sure where they would have
gone. But we absolutely feel there's a tremendous incremental value there by the fact that we are offering

this service. So maybe they would have gone and sold other channels, but I don't know which channels,
but we feel good about the incrementality.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And what percentage of online offers are you able to purchase? And does that tell you anything about the
competitiveness of your offer?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So our buy rate, traditionally how we've talked about the buy rate is through our appraisal and our
appraisal lane buy rate is still -- I mean it's very high, it's in the low 30s. On the online offers, the way we
really look at that at this point is who -- if you get an online offer, because think about it, we're putting
millions of online offers out there each quarter.

The way we think about it is, okay, once we put an offer of those customers, how may show up at the
store and of those customers that show up at the store, how many of them actually sell. And as you can
imagine, that buy rate, the customers that show up with an online offer that sell is actually much higher
than the traditional A lane.

Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan.

Rajat Gupta
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just had a question on some of the investments that you have made in the second quarter. Clearly,
advertising picked up. The other investments picked up. You've added more headcount. Could you give us
any color on like how much of this has started to benefit comps?

Maybe if you could give us some color on how September is tracking? That would be useful. And then just
on GPU, just given the rising used vehicle pricing environment we are back in, again, late August into
September, likely into October, November as well. You've previously given us some color on like a greater
than 2,000 number for retail GPU. Any similar color you could provide us for the third quarter as well that
might be useful and that would be all.

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Rajat, yes, in regards to SG&A, we firmly believe that now is the right time to invest in growing our
business. We're very bullish about our future given the strength and trajectory of our business. And we're
going to continue to invest in our growth. We're going to continue to invest in the omni and e-commerce
functionality as we move forward.

Again, but we are on track by the end of this year to offer up to all of our retail customers 100% self-
sufficiency online, our self-service online. We're going to continue to invest in the acquisition of customers
by marketing. The investment in marketing is something that we had communicated last year that we
were going to step up our marketing, advertising and other channels as well.

Again, we believe we have a superior platform. We want to make sure that we're communicating that in
an effective way to our consumers. But at the same time, there's also a very targeted ROI opportunities in
advertising as well that we're investing in.

And then lastly, we're going to continue to invest in the acquisition of vehicles in the Instant Offer program
that we launched that has had tremendous success is just an example of one of those investments that
just provided an outstanding ROI.

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

But we're going to continue to invest now. That being said, we do expect to lever over the longer term
because at the same time that we're investing, we also have cost efficiency plays, whether it's the CTCs
or whether it's the buying organization or whether it's other panels as well, we have opportunities to get
more efficient in how we work.

And so we'll continue to do that. But I think it is important to remember that we're on track with our
investments. We're on track with our performance at this point.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And Rajat, the only thing I would add to that is on the -- like the advertising example, we're really
pleased with the performance of that. We saw about a 19% increase in web traffic. Our average flow to
our website was about a little more than 34 million a month. So that's another example where we feel like
the investment is paying off.

As far as the second part of your question, the GPU, it's a great question. So I kind of think about -- we're
in a very similar situation today than we were last quarter when we talked about this. We're constantly
testing. A couple of quarters ago, we talked about doing some broader scale testing just because of some
of the other factors, some of the other profit channels that were coming through the organization.

And while those still exist, just like last quarter, we really wanted to make sure we -- you got to monitor
the macro factors and does it make sense. You got to look at your inventory levels. You got to understand
the elasticity, which, again, we're still getting the read on elasticity with the test that we always have
going.

You want to see what competitors are doing. And it just didn't make sense to deviate more from that
historical trend that we have on margins. And we -- at the end of the day, we want to have very, very
competitively priced inventory, I think, with the self-sufficiency, that certainly helps. I think going forward,
how you should think about the third quarter is probably GPUs more in line with historical averages just
like the second quarter was.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore.

Michael David Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just wanted to follow up on the cadence of the comps throughout the quarter and then to start the third
quarter. From our work, it looked like the trends had accelerated nicely into August and basically could
have been up double digits into September. So just wanted to see if you all would comment on that,, if
you could do it quantitatively. And if not that, if you could provide some color as to why trends may have
strengthened, if it's inventories or enhanced multichannel.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Michael. Yes. So obviously, I've already said, we're pleased with overall comps for the quarter. We had
positive comps every single month, and we really continue to trend. It started since March. March was not
only a record all-time high record, but it was a record for the month, April, May, June, July, August have all
in the respect have been a record month for us. So we feel great about that. And to your point, we're also
very pleased with the start of the third quarter. And obviously, we'll talk more in detail about that at the
end of the third quarter.

Michael David Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then if I could, just on the margin front, kind of 2 questions there. One was some folks had
been anticipating a little upside on GPU due to pretty inelastic demand at the moment. So just wanted

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

to understand if there's something we need to also consider in terms of the volatility of the pricing in the
environment or if perhaps there's more investment you all are making?

And then the other one was just on advertising spend for the year and if there's any kind of cost
reductions to consider as we cycle 3Q and 4Q, what you called out in 2Q was helpful, $25 million, $30
million?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Yes. So on the margins, look, we're always looking at our margins. And I know we probably have
some competitors that were the big spike up in average selling prices, they'll take more margin. You
followed us long enough to know that ASPs don't really drive our margins. We feel very comfortable about
where our margins are.

For us, it's about making sure we get a great margin but also having great, great prices. So again, to the
question I answered earlier, I think the third quarter, you can think about margins more in the historical
trend. Could you have taken more margin? Yes. But again, we're in this for the long haul, and we want
to make sure our prices are super competitive all the time, and we feel great about that. I'll let Enrique
speak to the advertising.

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So 2 questions. On advertising, we had communicated earlier this year that our expectation for
advertising on a per unit basis for this year was going to be similar to what we spent in the back half of
last year, so somewhere in the mid-300s per unit. And we're on track so far this year, and our expectation
is that we're going to meet that for the full year.

In regards to comping over COVID and the $25 million to $30 million that we estimate that last year kind
of onetime savings that was really focused on the front half of the year. There still are some of those that
will carry over into Q3, but not to the same level of materiality as what we saw certainly in the first 2
quarters of the year.

Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.

Seth Mckain Basham
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

My question is around GPU and the pricing environment. Bill, maybe you can comment on what's
happening with wholesale price trends and retail price trends through the quarter and how that's impacted
your retail GPU?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So obviously, retail, if I look at it from a mix adjusted standpoint, retail pricing was up about -- from
an acquisition standpoint, was up about 6,000. Wholesale was up probably around 3,000. So both are
actually, as long as I've been doing this, those are the biggest jumps I can remember ever seeing.

Now I think the fact that self-sufficiency is so high for us. I think that provides us a lot of opportunities as
we go forward because that comes into play on not only your margin, but your pricing structure. I think
during the quarter, what we saw was we came out of the first quarter very high elevated prices. It hung in
there for a little while.

We then actually saw a little bit of depreciation take place. But surprisingly, it started to appreciate again.
So -- and we went back, I think we finished the quarter probably at the high that we finished the first
quarter. So it's a very interesting dynamic.

And I can only speculate maybe because the chip shortage is -- looks like it's going to be longer than I
think what people originally thought of for new cars, I think maybe there's some folks out there buying
more used cars to replenish their lot since they're not going to have new cars. But it is an interesting
dynamic that we're seeing.

Seth Mckain Basham
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Yes. So the fact that prices started to appreciate again through the back half of year quarter unexpectedly
should indicate that you could have captured incremental margin on those unit sales. So your GPU exiting
the quarter was probably stronger than it was at the beginning of the quarter. Is that the right way to
think about it?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

No. I would just think that pretty much -- the way we manage our GPU really doesn't -- it doesn't take
into consideration the average selling prices. There's other factors that go into that. So I think it's fairly
consistent throughout the quarter, the way you should think about it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.

Adam Michael Jonas
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Why are you guys still buying back stock? I mean, you have such a once-in-a-generation growth
opportunity. You're up against competitors that have a license to lose money and 0 expectation to return
cash. I understand there's the business spins off cash and everything. But isn't it time to change the
philosophy and just double down on the growth of the business and cut the buyback stuff.

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Like you said, we generate -- we're blessed with the operating model and the business model that
generates a significant amount of cash. And we're making the investments we think are the right
investments at the right time to generate our growth.

And we still -- still with that in mind, we believe we have excess cash to buy back stock and return it back
to shareholders. So we're not holding back on our level of investments. And you can see that in our spend
and in our CapEx that we are investing aggressively. We'll continue to do so. And even in that scenario, we
have enough cash to buy back shares. But we are not holding back on our investments.

Operator

Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just a question on 2 pressure points. I mean first on inventory. I mean it certainly seems Bill, as you just
alluded to and based on what we know on the new vehicle side that this inventory shortage on the new
vehicle side is going to persist well into next year and certainly probably past mid next year, calendar year
2022. So I'm just curious if you think any of these dynamics will be relieved until we get there.

And then also, as you think about sort of the staffing levels, finding folks at reasonable prices is getting
harder and harder so that cost inflation on the SG&A side and staffing up might be difficult as well. I
mean I'm just trying to understand if you can change strategy, alter strategy or this changes your growth
strategy as you fight through these 2 macro factors and when they'll be relieved because it's kind of

15

CARMAX, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 30, 2021

masking all the good stuff you're doing, and it's muddling the story, but it's not it's not your fault and it's
the macro issues that you're just going to have to fight through.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think whatever I tell you on like the chip situation, probably the only thing I guarantee you would
be wrong. But I do agree with you. I think it's going to persist throughout this year, which could keep
used cars at an elevated -- will persist through this year, and I think pretty much through next year or a
good part of next year, which will keep, I think, prices elevated. But it's also the reason why I'm so excited
about the investments we've made in vehicle acquisition and things like our Instant Offer because that
really helps to offset some of those headwinds and really gives us a lot of opportunity.

And like I said earlier, I mean we're making strides in continuing to get our inventory up. So we feel good
about that. On the staffing, look, we've always invested in our associates. I mean they are -- they're the
reason of our success. And during this time period, you know, I mean, every employer is out there looking
for staffing, and we're no different, and we continue to invest more in this quarter in our associates. We've
made pay changes that we feel really great about.

We also -- look, for 17 years in a row, we've been one of the best places to work, which is a great thing
from an employer brand standpoint. So again, even on the staffing side, we feel great about the trajectory
that were going on. So yes, there's some headwinds there, but we're progressing both on the inventory
side and both on the staffing and feel great about some of the opportunities that we have that things like
self-sufficiency and IO give you.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

Is it fair to say or maybe just a follow-up, the SG&A leverage is going to be difficult to get through this
period of macro pressure, right? I mean, it just seems like -- I mean, you're going to maintain -- I mean,
you guys have executed incredibly well on same-store sales and grosses despite these headwinds. I mean
I think some people are concerned about it, but I mean what you've done this quarter is pretty remarkable
on the grosses and the volumes.

I mean, are you going to be able to get SG&A leverage until we get through sort of the end of calendar
year 2022? It just seems like it's going to be hard to pull off. I mean what's your thought about that? And
where should we think about that inflection point?

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We certainly are in investment mode as we've made it clear and you can go back to our Analyst Day
and say we're really focused on driving our top line. We are focused on driving market share and meeting
and exceeding our target that we laid out there, which is greater than 5% market share by FY '26. And
that does require investments like we've been talking about the investments in the different areas that we
mentioned, certainly.

So will it be harder to leverage? Well, in that kind of environment, it is a little harder to leverage, right?
And our expectation is that our gross profit will continue to grow. It will grow robustly. And on the back of
that gross profit growth, there are opportunities to leverage, specifically for this year, for the entire year,
our expectation continues to be that we should be able to leverage for this year.

It's hard to look quarter-to-quarter, you just can't look at quarter-to-quarter just because there's so many
things that pop in and out of a quarter. But for the full year, we feel pretty good about that. And then
moving forward, again, it's -- we are in growth mode and we're investing accordingly.

And at the same time, and as I speak to every quarter, we do look at opportunities to get more efficient.
There are investments we're making to drive the top line, there are investments we're making to help pull
out costs as well. And we always have a sharp eye to that. So we'll continue to do our best on that. And

Our next question comes from Ali Faghri with Guggenheim.

Ali-Ahmad Faghri
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So I'm sorry about another question on retail GPU here. So I recognize that retail prices don't really drive
CarMax's GPU. But just the self-sourcing improvement from sub 50% to 70% this quarter by itself, should
have been a big boost to GPU given the cost advantage from acquiring from consumers versus auction?

I know you said you kept your prices competitive, but it also doesn't seem at least based on our work that
you are meaningfully outperforming peers on volumes either. So how do I tie that all together?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, first of all, we feel really good about our pricing position, and we've been looking at this for a
very long time. So we feel very good about where we are from a pricing standpoint. And look, this is one
quarter, some things have a longer tail.

But I would also go back to the fact that, look, we have some major headwinds that when you add them
all up together, they were hard to overcome, which I've already talked about, the inventory, just the
pricing, the staffing. So those are headwinds over the self-sufficiency.

I think what we're most excited about is this self-sufficient and the opportunity that, that gives us as we
continue to move forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from David Whiston with Morningstar.

David Whiston
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I hear you say you're happy with pricing. But then when I look at Page 6 of the GPU gross margin per unit
there, it's down considerably year-over-year and also down versus the quarter 2 years ago -- is there you
have -- it's obviously a competitive marketplace, so too. I mean, do you leeway to raise prices?

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

David, just so we're clear, like the GPU, if you look at it like last year's second quarter was a record GPU
and we're only a little bit off of that. So I would say, if you look at our historical average, we're on the
higher end of GPU. So I think there might be a little disconnect there. Could we raise GPUs?

Absolutely. And look, we're going to continue to monitor the macro factors to see what makes sense. Self-
sufficiency gives us a lot of opportunity as we go forward. But I think at the same time, we are in this for
the long term, and we want to make sure customers are getting great value every day. And so we're going
to continue to kind of weigh all factors as we go forward.

David Whiston
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. Just to be clear, I was talking about 8.3% versus the 11% and then the 10.5% 2 years ago, just --
that's why I asked about price.

Oh, I'm sorry. So you were talking more as it relates to ASP. Yes. And again, we just -- I would just...

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Look at it on a per unit basis. It's going to be skewed -- efficiently skewed as a percent of revenue just
because our retail prices are just up like 30% since the beginning of the year. So it's hard to look at kind
of as a percent of revenue. We really look at the business on a per unit basis.

William D. Nash
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And we manage it differently than a lot of the other publicly traded auto retailers.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

I just have 2 quick ones on other gross profit. So I guess just first part, I understand the service gross
profit seemingly went negative this quarter because of the warranty issue. Just like next quarter or
whatever, like does this go back to the 20% to 30% gross margin rate you've historically had? Or is there
something like some kind of like lagging tail of this warranty stuff that we should be thinking about?

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Service this quarter, we're upside $40 million year-over-year on the quarter. And we estimate that a
material amount of that were headwinds we faced in the quarter that were really shorter term in nature.
So the 2 largest ones, I'd tell you, number one, with the 90-day warranty that you mentioned.

And when you think about it, right, our comps this year in the first quarter were 99%, last year in the first
quarter, they were negative 42%. And so you're looking at a lot more volume from a 90-day perspective
warranty work that carries over into the sequent quarter. So that's very much is a timing play right there.

And then the second piece is similar to SG&A, we just had prior year kind of onetime COVID-related
savings and support pay and the employee retention credit plan as well that are more kind of shorter term
in nature. So the material amount of that is really shorter term.

What I'd say is, historically, we run service as a positive margin contributor. The exception was last year,
certainly during COVID, it was not. But prior years, it had been a positive margin contributor. And as we
move forward, on an annual basis, we do expect that to continue to be a positive margin contributor as
well. But this quarter, certainly, those few headwinds made it a little bit harder.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up question from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan.

Rajat Gupta
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, I just wanted to follow up in terms of like a housekeeping question around SG&A. How much of the
quarter-over-quarter pickup in SG&A was due to the Edmunds acquisition? And if you could frame it within
some of the buckets in SG&A also that might be very helpful.

Enrique N. Mayor-Mora
Senior VP & CFO

As regards to Edmunds, I spoke in my prepared remarks that from a gross profit standpoint, Edmunds
contributed about $20 million. You're going to see that in the 10-Q tomorrow when we file. Overall, so

it's an operating segment. Edmunds is we're going to be reporting on it as an operating segment, not a
reporting segment.

So we're going to be reporting moving forward on the revenues, on their gross profit, but that's the extent
to which we're going to report on them. What I can tell you though, Rajat is that overall, they were slightly
accretive to CarMax. So you can kind of back into their SG&A using that kind of an approach.
