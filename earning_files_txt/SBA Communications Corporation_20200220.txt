SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SBA fourth quarter results
conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

And now let me introduce Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Go ahead, sir.

Mark DeRussy
Vice President of Finance

Thank you, Julio. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Fourth Quarter 2019
Earnings Conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer;
and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.

Some of the information we'll discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any
guidance for 2020 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that
may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, February 20,
and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make.

In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The
reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial
data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.

With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our results.

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another solid quarter in the fourth quarter with strong operating
and financial results in both our leasing and services businesses. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the
fourth quarter were $481.1 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $478.1 million. Foreign exchange
rates were in line with our estimates for the fourth quarter but were a headwind on year ago comparisons.

Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a
constant currency basis, was 6% over the fourth quarter of 2018, including the impact of 2.3% of churn.
On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 8.3%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue
growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 8.2% on a gross basis and 5.6% on a net basis, including
2.6% of churn, 0.8% of which continues to be related to Metro/Leap and Clearwire terminations. The
balance of domestic churn is from a variety of sources, including a number of smaller customers that
are modifying or shutting down older technologies, some sites that were never on air that are not being
renewed and some legacy consolidation churn.

Domestic operational leasing activity, representing new revenue placed under contract during the quarter,
was down from the first half of the year and sequentially from the third quarter due to the industry-wide
slowdown as our customers awaited resolution of the legal challenges to the Sprint/T-Mobile merger.
Amendment activity was again the bulk of our domestic bookings with newly signed up domestic leasing
revenue coming 71% from amendments and 29% from new leases. Although we had essentially no
contribution to leasing activity from T-Mobile during the quarter, the big 4 carriers still represented 87% of
total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter.

Our domestic application backlog is strong, and we expect that the closing of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger
will drive a significant increase in incremental leasing activity as our customers invest heavily in their
future 5G networks.

Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 8.3%,
including 0.6% of churn or 8.9% on a gross basis. We had another solid leasing quarter internationally,

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

although our reported same-tower growth numbers are down from last quarter primarily due to the rolling
off of a very strong fourth quarter of 2018 from this trailing 12-month calculation.

This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to lease-up. Gross same-tower organic growth in
Brazil was 11.6% on a constant currency basis and continue to have contributions from all 4 major carriers
there.

During the fourth quarter, 84.6% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S.
dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing
12.1% of all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.8% of cash site leasing revenue,
excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.

Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $387.4 million. Our industry-leading domestic tower cash
flow margin was 84% in the quarter. International tower cash flow margin was 69.7% and was 90.2%,
excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $362.4 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 71% in
the quarter, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-
through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.7%. Approximately 99% of our total adjusted EBITDA
was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter.

AFFO in the fourth quarter was $248.8 million. AFFO per share was $2.18, an increase of 10% over the
fourth quarter of 2018 on a constant currency basis.

During the fourth quarter, we continued to invest in expanding our tower portfolio. On December 6, we
closed on the acquisition of 1,313 wireless sites in Brazil purchased from Grupo TorreSur for a total cash
consideration of USD 460 million. These towers have 1.7 tenants a tower, are located in high-quality
population centers and in locations that geographically complement our existing portfolio well. And they
were purchased for less than 15x their anticipated 2020 tower cash flow.

We're very pleased with our ability to continue adding high-caliber sites to our portfolio at attractive
prices. In addition to the GTS acquisition, we acquired 23 other communication sites during the quarter
for $11.7 million, and we built a total of 170 sites in the quarter. Most of the added sites were located
internationally. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired 11 additional sites for $11.9 million. As
of today, we have under contract for acquisition and anticipate closing by the end of the second quarter on
166 additional sites at an aggregate price of $97.8 million.

We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits.
During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $13.7 million to buy land and easements and to extend
ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land
underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases,
including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years.

Looking ahead now, our earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2020. Even with
the industry slowdown in the U.S. in the second half of last year and into the first part of this year, our
outlook reflects another year of solid growth in our leasing business. We expect a similar level of domestic
operational leasing activity in 2020 as we experienced in 2019. However, this year is anticipated to be
back half loaded, whereas 2019 was much busier during the first half of the year.

Our outlook for 2020 leasing revenue is built largely upon the operational leasing activity we've had over
the last 6 months. Our anticipated acceleration in lease-up in the second half of this year is expected to
provide minor contributions to our 2020 leasing revenue. Similarly, although our guidance for full year
2020 services revenue is anticipated to be less than we saw during a very busy 2019, we expect to see a
pickup in our services business in the second half of the year once the Sprint/T-Mobile merger has been
closed.

In our international business, our outlook anticipates continued steady organic leasing contributions. We
have incorporated consensus estimates of a slight weakening in the Brazilian foreign exchange rate from
where we are today, assuming an average FX rate during 2020 of BRL 4.36 to USD 1.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Our full year 2020 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today,
and it does not assume any share repurchases at all. We do, however, intend to deploy additional capital
into both portfolio growth and opportunistic share repurchases.

Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO include the impact of our recently completed
unsecured notes offering as well as the repricing of our term loan completed during the fourth quarter,
each of which Mark will discuss in a moment. We estimate a relatively similar level of cash taxes in 2020
as we incurred in 2019, mostly related to international taxes and state taxes where we do not have any
NOLs.

Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted
common shares of $114.8 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices.
We are excited about 2020 and particularly about the great opportunities that lie ahead for SBA over the
next several years.

I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and our balance
sheet.

Mark DeRussy
Vice President of Finance

Thanks, Brendan. We ended the fourth quarter with $10.4 billion of total debt and $10.3 billion of net
debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.1x. Our fourth quarter net cash
interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 3.8x.

On November 19, we repriced our $2.4 billion term loan from a coupon of LIBOR plus 200 basis points to
a new coupon of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. Subsequently, on December 3, we entered into a series of
interest rate swaps on $1.95 billion of that term loan, effectively replacing both of our existing interest
rate swaps. The effect of these new swaps was to reduce our swap interest rate by approximately 30 basis
points to a fixed rate of 3.78% through the maturity date of the existing term loan.

After year-end, on February 4, we issued $1 billion of new 7-year unsecured senior notes at an interest
rate of 3.875%, our lowest-cost unsecured senior note issuance ever. The net proceeds of this offering
were used to redeem all of our outstanding 2022 4.875% senior notes, pay the associated call premium
on those notes and repay a portion of the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

As of today, the outstanding balance under our revolver is $175 million. Pro forma for the senior note
issuance, the weighted average coupon of our outstanding debt is 3.6%, and our weighted average
maturity is approximately 4 years.

During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 859,000 shares of our common stock for $200 million or an
average price of $232.77 per share. All the shares repurchased were retired. As of today, we have $624.3
million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company
shares outstanding at December 31, 2019, are 111.8 million, which is down 0.6% from December 31,
2018.

In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $41.5 million or $0.37 per
share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.465
per share or an increase of 25.7% over the last quarter. It's payable on March 26, 2020, for shareholders
of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2020.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a very good year
for SBA. We delivered solid financial results in both our leasing and services segments, finishing at the
high end of guidance for tower cash flow, AFFO and AFFO per share and exceeding the high end of our
guidance range for leasing revenue, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our full year financial results also

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

finished above the high end of our initial 2019 guidance given in February of last year for leasing revenue,
services revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share.

We produced over $2 billion in revenue for the first time in our history, and we grew full year AFFO per
share by 11.7% over 2018 and by 13.1% on a constant currency basis. We also grew our portfolio at the
high end of our 5% to 10% goal, and we expanded into an attractive and exciting new market, South
Africa. We completed several debt transactions, improving our cost of financing with each one. We bought
back over 2 million shares of our stock at an average price of $231.87, and we began paying a quarterly
dividend ahead of schedule.

All of this was accomplished notwithstanding the domestic industry-wide slowdown for our customers
during the second half of the year resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the T-Mobile/
Sprint transaction. As I said, 2019 was a very good year for SBA.

Looking ahead now to 2020 and beyond, we are very excited about the prospects for SBA. We anticipate
the resolution of the legal challenges to the T-Mobile/Sprint transaction will set us up for significant
network investment by our U.S. customers involved in the transaction, including DISH, beginning in the
second half of the year. In order to meet their required 5G coverage goals, the new T-Mobile will require
meaningful upgrades across their combined portfolio, deploying 2.5 gigahertz spectrum to legacy T-Mobile
sites and 600 megahertz spectrum to legacy Sprint sites. These efforts will drive amendment activity for
SBA.

DISH, now on track to be the clear fourth nationwide facilities-based carrier, will need to invest heavily
as well, deploying a brand-new 5G network across the country. DISH's build-out will drive new colocation
opportunities for SBA. And Verizon and AT&T each have their own 5G initiatives ahead, which we believe
will lead them to embrace the new competitive landscape and continue to invest significantly in their own
networks.

The release of more 5G-enabled devices and the advent of more and more new 5G applications will be
continued catalyst for the network investment required to support these technologies. The initial 5G
deployment cycle has really only just begun, particularly as it relates to macro sites and the deployment
of mid-band spectrum and massive MIMO architecture. And we expect it to be a very long cycle. The
anticipated auctions of CBRS and C-band spectrum later this year will only serve to further support this
upward investment trajectory over the next several years.

Outside of the U.S., the future for our international business looks bright as well. Our leading market
in terms of new leasing activity has continued to be Brazil, our largest international market. During the
fourth quarter, our presence in Brazil got even larger with the acquisition of over 1,300 sites from GTS.
This acquisition brings our site count in Brazil by almost 10,000 towers. We saw activity in the fourth
quarter from all 4 major carriers in Brazil, primarily around their 4G networks, and the future prospects in
this market look strong.

From a macro level, Brazil has seen economic stability largely restored with pension reform approved,
inflation under control, record-low interest rates driven by 4 consecutive rate reductions and increases
in foreign direct investment. The Brazilian foreign exchange rate, however, has been somewhat volatile
and generally continued to weaken. We are optimistic that the positive economic trends in Brazil will
ultimately translate into a more stable exchange rate. Nonetheless, our 2020 full year outlook does reflect
the headwind from the Brazilian real compared to last year.

Across our other international markets, we anticipate steady leasing contributions during 2020 as well as
the largest contributions to our portfolio growth. On a company-wide basis, we are again targeting 5% to
10% portfolio growth in 2020. In order to achieve this level of growth, we will have to identify one or more
quality tower portfolios at appropriate price levels. I'm particularly proud of our track record in selecting
-- in selectively acquiring high-quality assets at disciplined prices, and I'm confident we will be able to
continue and identifying and securing these types of opportunities.

In addition to portfolio growth, I expect us to continue to execute well on further enhancing our capital
structure as well as our capital allocation to stock repurchases and cash dividends. On the capital structure

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

front, we had a very strong 2019, completing our largest single tranche ABS deal in the company's history
at a very attractive rate, repricing our $2.4 billion term loan with a 25 basis point reduction at par and
subsequent to year-end, closing on our lowest-cost, high-yield issuance in company history.

During the fourth quarter, we also received an across-the-board increase in our credit rating from Moody's,
evidencing not only the high quality of our business but also the liquidity and stability in our capital
structure. We continue to actively evaluate our existing capital structure and look for further opportunities
to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment in order to both extend maturities and
improve the cost of our debt.

With regards to capital allocation, we again had a strong year in 2019, not only growing our tower
portfolio by almost 10%, but we also repurchased our stock opportunistically, investing over $470 million
to retire over 2 million shares. And we commenced paying a dividend in the third quarter. We expect to
continue returning capital to shareholders through both share buybacks and dividends during 2020.

On the dividend front, we're very pleased to announce our first quarter dividend today. Our dividend
represents an almost 26% increase over the dividend paid out last quarter, and I believe that will
represent one of the highest dividend increases this year anywhere, certainly in the real estate investment
trust space. Our current dividend represents approximately only 20% of our 2020 outlook for AFFO,
meaning that we have substantial capital still available for portfolio growth and share repurchases.

In addition, maintaining our leverage in the high 6x to low 7x range provides us with even more capital
to continue investing in the business. We are positioned extremely well to take advantage of all future
opportunities and continue growing AFFO per share.

Finally, I'd like to again thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our
success in 2019. It truly was a great year. With their continued contributions, we are very excited for a
tremendous 2020 and beyond.
And with that, Julio, we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We have Jessie Cusick for our first question.

Philip A. Cusick
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. It sounds like as we model 2020, we should think about the first half
activity similar to the fourth quarter activity and then ramping in the back half. Can you give us any
update on the Sprint/T-Mobile or DISH cadence of potential network planning and when those 2 start to
really impact numbers?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

A lot of discussions, Phil, but no real operational activity yet, of course, given the fact that there is no
closing. And while I believe that things will begin to move pretty quickly, particularly on the T-Mobile side,
DISH had their own commentary yesterday as to the cadence of what they will be doing, but on the T-
Mobile side, I think that will go quickly once the deal closes. But I think we're going to have to wait and
see as to when that happens. They need to get through the California PCS and I think some other things. I
think there's a lot of folks ready to go, but they're just waiting for the starting gun.

Philip A. Cusick
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then a separate topic, can you give us any early read on the South Africa business, sort of how
you think about that now that it's under your belt and attractiveness of other markets as you look out over
the next year?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, we like South Africa a lot. I mean within our 4 years of investment there, we took close to 1,000
towers and actually beat 1,000 today. I'm not quite sure of the count, but it's getting awfully close to over
2 tenants per tower with a very good return on investment. Dynamic market, a lot of room for additional
greenfield builds, all the things we look for. So we're very excited about the ability to continue to grow in
that market. We will continue to look for markets like that. We think there are some out there. They're not
10s or 20s of those kinds of markets, but there are some out there, and we're going to continue to pursue
them. And if you don't mind, I'm not going to name them.

Philip A. Cusick
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then if I can just follow up and be even more explicit since we're almost 2 months into the
quarter. It looks like we should be assuming that activity in 1Q is probably even below 4Q. Is that a good
starting point?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, I don't know if you should assume it is below. But I think you should take the comments about
things came to a pretty abrupt slowdown, at least with respect to several customers in August. And the
reason things came to that slowdown have not changed as of today.

Operator

Next question is from Spencer Kurn from New Street Research.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Spencer Harris Kurn
New Street Research LLP

Could you just remind us of your average remaining lease term with Sprint? And how are you thinking
about approaching the decommissioning of Sprint's network? Do you see value in signing any agreements
that would minimize churn? Or would you take a similar approach as you did with iDEN and coordinate a
steady decommissioning schedule?

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Spencer, on the overlap, the average remaining terms for the Sprint leases on sites where they
overlap with T-Mobile is about 4.5 years.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And I am confident given the complexities of what will need to be accomplished by the new T-Mobile
transfer that we'll have an opportunity to address those issues. And again, we have no kind of religious
opposition to MLAs. And if it makes sense for both parties, as we have in the past, we would do more.

Spencer Harris Kurn
New Street Research LLP

Great. And one other question. Could you just talk about the amendment pricing that you tend to see for
mid-band spectrum, like 2.5 or potentially CBRS and C-band, and how that relates to what you've been
seeing for low-band spectrum over the last couple of years?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

We don't want to get too specific. The incidence of CBRS amendments haven't been that numerous yet.
And there's really only, of course, been one customer that has deployed mid-band in the massive MIMO
architecture. And I would say the amendment pricing has been reasonable, fair and consistent with all the
other types of amendments that we've done over the years in terms of size and weight and all the things
that have kind of gone into the way we've conducted our business.

Operator

Next question is from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company.

Colby Alexander Synesael
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

We had an expectation that churn domestically in the U.S. have come down or improved in 2020 versus
'19. It doesn't look like that's happening. I was wondering if you can give some color around that.

And then secondly, as it relates to the GTS acquisition, I appreciate you gave, I think, sub-15x tower cash
flow. But I was wondering if you could just be more explicit and tell us what the expectation is for revenue
and EBITDA in 2020?

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Colby. First, on the churn. It is down slightly because -- in terms of the same-tower analysis due
to the falling off of the iDEN churn that took place in the fourth quarter of last year. But as we look out
to next year, some of that reduction due to the loss of the iDEN is being offset by a little bit of a slight
elevation in Q4 churn notices. They're coming from a variety of miscellaneous items. I mentioned some of
those items in the scripted comments.

There's a number of smaller customers that are kind of modifying or shutting down older technologies, for
one. An example of that is we had one regional carrier who had previously entered into some leases with

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

us for 4G installations that we have recorded in the past as lease-up, but those were separate and apart
from their preexisting leases for their 3G installations, which they're now decommissioning. And so we've
had a few slugs of things that were a little more than what we typically see, and because it's happening in
the fourth quarter, that carries over into the 2020 numbers.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

GTS?

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Oh, on GTS. Yes. So on GTS, the numbers around tower cash flow contribution or EBITDA contribution is
approximately $30 million for next year, a little over $30 million, $31 million. Now that can be affected,
of course, by where the FX rate shakes out. But that was our expectation when we put the guidance
together. And from a revenue standpoint, it's approximately a little more than $40 million, $42-ish million.

Operator

Next question from Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.

Simon William Flannery
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

[Audio Gap]

guidance. How are you thinking about AT&T and Verizon? We obviously heard Verizon last week talking a
lot about densification, but the FirstNet project is moving along. So is that fairly level year-to-year? Or any
big changes you might call out?

And then you touched on CBRS there a minute ago. We got the auction coming up. How are carriers you're
talking to thinking of deploying that? Is that still very much in a small cell, indoor-type environment? Or
do you think there might be potential to use it more broadly on macro cells?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

First question, Simon, is our guidance assumes essentially the same or certainly materially the same
contributions from AT&T and Verizon. And in terms of the CBRS, primarily because of this tower and --
which, of course, affects the range, the CBRS will be more of a small cell, indoor. But there will be some
macro uses as well, and we were actually -- we have some applications for outdoor uses. So it will be
across the board. But we don't think for -- at least for SBA, the CBRS spectrum will be nearly as impactful
as C-band spectrum will be.

Operator

Next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions. One, how should we think about the process flow as far as when applications start
coming in with the T-Mobile/Sprint merger with amendment activity that applications could turn into
revenues? Is it a 3-month, 6-month process or possibly longer?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

It depends on what they want to do. Amendments can go quicker, have a history of going quicker,
certainly much quicker than brand-new leases. So yes, I would use 3% to 6% as opposed to 6-plus on a
colo.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Makes sense. And like you said, you're not opposed to MLAs, particularly given the complexity of this
thing. Is there the possibility of doing -- involving DISH in it as well? DISH, on their call, talked about how
they're interested potentially in some of the Sprint decommissioned sites. So what's the process for them
to take over those leases or weave it into an MLA?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, we got to know what leases you're talking about, first. And we're not anywhere close to that. And
then you have to match up heights and terms and things like that. The -- my personal opinion is while
there will be a lot of business from DISH and the freeing up of space and the inventory of what is available
will be great for both DISH and the tower industry, the exact matching up of existing Sprint or T-Mobile
leases that are to be decommissioned, that's going to be a tougher match.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Sure. Makes sense. And then I think we've heard from AT&T that their FirstNet project was, "maybe 75%
done," but I'm sure that's probably not equal across the whole country. As you think about how much
you've seen touches from AT&T, can you give us an indicator of where you think they are on the project
based on your sites?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think their 75% includes a lot of advanced work. I think from our perspective, we think it's closer to
50%.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

As far as touching your sites?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. In terms of work yet to be done.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Sure. Okay. And last one from me. You mentioned CBRS could be some indoor systems or small cell
systems. What's your appetite given your balance sheet and your ability to put money to work on a shared
infrastructure to get involved in maybe neutral host, indoor systems? And how big could that opportunity
be? And what's the time line?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, our appetite for the right deal is quite large. The -- finding the right opportunities are more difficult.
There are asset-by-asset type of opportunities. And we are pursuing that area. We've actually added some
resources there because we do think there will be some good opportunities, but it's an asset-by-asset
hunt.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And the time frame as far as -- is it kind of more like a '21 event where it starts becoming noticeable then
for the industry?

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, I mean there's things going on now. And now there are folks that are building out DAS systems that
I think will be converted to CBRS and folks that are interested in types of technologies today that will be
converted to CBRS. So it's evolving. Our -- just like we have always approached the tower business, we're
very much focused on looking for the best assets.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then congrats on the nice return on your stock buyback. That was very attractive, obviously.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you.

Next question is from Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Brandon Lee Nispel
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Two, if I could. You guys are obviously excited about sort of the second half of 2020 relative to the second
half of 2019. Can you maybe just help quantify to us what you would expect to see from a increase in the
backlog perspective from a year-over-year basis?

Secondly, Jeff, you talked a lot about massive MIMO antennas. Have you been able to sort of determine in
your conversations with customers how deep into the network those type of antennas will need to go and
then maybe further be able to quantify for us what that would mean in terms of an amendment?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

I think they're going to go fairly deep to achieve true 5G outside of the dense urban markets. All of the
work that I've seen indicates that that's what you need in the macro world. And you really do need to see
the mid-band spectrum to do it, which I think explains a lot of the different carrier spending patterns.

I don't want to get too much in -- I think I commented enough on the amendment pricing earlier about
how that gets priced. So if you look back at Spencer's question, you'll have your answer there.

And in terms of the backlog, it all depends on when these deals get done. I mean these -- the backlogs,
I think, will grow very, very quickly and could grow -- they could double or more in fairly short order. I do
believe a lot of work has already been done in terms of what needs to be done to the network. It's really a
question of when is the deal going to be approved. Then we -- then I do -- as I think I said 6 months ago,
I think you'll see a lot of activity.

Brandon Lee Nispel
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And I guess if I could follow up. Is there anything that you need to do operationally to prepare for that?
And any limiting factors such as tower climbers that could mix or the growth doesn't come in as fast as
you expect?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

We tend to retain -- given our size of our company and our benefit plans, we're a pretty good employer.
And we will tend to use our tower climbers to make sure that the work will get done on our towers, make
sure that the amendments and the colos on our towers get done, so we can prioritize there. So we'll be

okay. There will be some general shortages in the industry, but I don't think it will be catastrophic. I mean
it will be an issue, but we always get through it as an industry.

Operator

Next question is from Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson.

Nicholas Ralph Del Deo
MoffettNathanson LLC

I assume it's a very small number, but can you share the number of domestic towers you own that
effectively can't accommodate another tenant? And sort of related to that, is there any reason a player like
DISH wouldn't be satisfied with the height of the RAD centers you tend to have available?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Second question, the answer is no. First, I'm sure we have some, but I -- 30, 40...

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Very, very small.

Nicholas Ralph Del Deo
MoffettNathanson LLC

So an immaterial number?

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean the towers -- there are towers that require augmentations, but virtually every site we have
can be augmented to accommodate additional tenants. So it would be de minimis.

Nicholas Ralph Del Deo
MoffettNathanson LLC

Okay. Got it. And then when you're negotiating with an upstart network like DISH, are you inclined to
try to get some sort of guarantee from the parent company on the lease? Or are you satisfied with the
wireless operating today being the sole signatory?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

That's probably more information than we'd like to talk about on the call.

Operator

Next question is from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs.

Brett Joseph Feldman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I guess it came out during the trial that DISH has signed a master service agreement to cover over 30,000
sites. I'm not entirely sure what those are, but I'm curious whether you're a party to any of them and if
they've made any commitments to you.

And then second, you've not done a significant amount of domestic tower M&A recently, and there's a
range of reasons you've cited for that in the past. But one of them was -- there was this big mismatch
between the valuations of private tower assets in the U.S. and where your stock was trading. Your stock
has obviously performed a lot better. I'm wondering if that's changed the math such that there might be

14

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

more opportunities to make domestic accretive acquisitions or if asset quality is really the gate factor as
opposed to price.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Brett, my belief on the first question is that when DISH was building out their IoT network, they did
sign up a number of master agreements, including one with us. And in the course of that, a number of
companies, including us, submitted all their portfolios so that DISH was able to analyze those and figure
out which of those towers would be suitable for that project. And now they're able to do the same for the
broadband network. So that is what that statement was all about. But that was under kind of a different --
that was under the narrowband project. But the work that they did about how many towers that they've
analyzed that would be suitable for their uses, that was true.

So your second question in terms of the M&A, some of the stuff that we announced is actually more of
what we have in the pipeline is in the U.S., actually. And there are -- there's still -- there's a lot of price
competition still. There is some varying quality of folks who have done some things that -- to their terms
and conditions that we don't really like. But there are still some good assets out there that we will pursue.
And clearly, as we look at where we trade and things like that, we would take that into consideration. But
we are very interested, as we always have been, in adding quality assets to the portfolio.

Brett Joseph Feldman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Are you finding that valuation -- the valuation gap has started to close or private multiples just expanding
in conjunction with the public space?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, we took about a 4 turn jump in -- after the T-Mobile/Sprint deal got announced. But I can't say I've
seen private multiples jump 4 turns in 2 weeks. But who knows? Who knows? So let's just say, hopefully,
the gaps closed a little bit.

Operator

Next question is from David Barden from Bank of America.

David William Barden
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just on the dividend hike, obviously, the percentage is fairly eye-popping, Jeff, as you pointed out. The
dollars aren't necessarily all that large. But I was wondering if you could kind of lay out where you think
the -- what kind of message you want to say. This is -- is this what SBA can do? Is a dividend growth
stock for some extended period of time, is this more of just a signaling about your conviction in the next
cycle? It would be helpful on that.

And then the second question kind of related is just given how strong the stock price move has been that
we've seen in the last 6 or 9 months, at what point do you start thinking about a split to try to make it
easier for more money to kind of find its way into this, given that it's an income growth REIT story?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Your kind of perception, your former way you kind of talked about the dividend is correct, David. When
you -- when we kind of thought about this, it's more to give a longer, higher growth trajectory because as
we model things out, the first dividend we would have had to pay when we got to the exhaustion of the
NOLs, frankly, will be higher than the dividend we're paying now. So you'd have to start out high and then
of course, grow it not by the same pace.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

So by doing this, we can grow it at a faster rate, which some people are going to like. We can control our
remaining NOLs. And frankly, we can pay out less of our AFFO. So we think it's a win, win, win, win, which
is why we chose to be in to pay it early. And even though we start small, we can grow it faster.

And then on the split, I'm ashamed to say I really hadn't thought of that. Do you think that's something
we should do?

Brett Joseph Feldman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I think people would love it.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

All right. Well, we'll give it some thought. All you, analysts, weigh in. Send Mark your thoughts...

Mark DeRussy
Vice President of Finance

We'll take a sell poll. Just everybody in the next question.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

There you go. We'll take a sell-side poll.

Operator

And the next question is from Batya Levi with UBS.

Batya Levi
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I'm for it, too. In terms of the -- maybe given the faster growth outlook that you were expecting as we
exit the year, can you also remind us where you would like to be in terms of your leverage target? I think
as you started to grow the dividend, you potentially thought that you might come inside the 7 level. But
any updated thoughts there?

And then a second question on how you think you're positioned in terms of the rule footprint that T-Mo
is expected to build over the next few years? And how you think about the leasing amendment mix to
change as we exit the year into next year?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, if you looked at our guidance, Batya, if we don't spend some money on something, whether it's stock
repurchases or portfolio growth, we're going to be in the mid-6s in leverage. And that's not where we
want to be. So we want to be high 6s to low 7s. So that's the -- that's kind of the new area, I think, where
we're targeting. And again, if we see something great to buy, we'd be very pleased to go above that for a
temporary period of time. I mean the cash flow generation power of the business is pretty amazing.

So on your second question, I think we're going to be very well positioned with T-Mobile. They are a very
good customer of ours. We have a close relationship. We have a lot of work to do with them. And I think
we will be a very active partner in terms of both amendments and colocations, just as we were in the first
half of last year prior to the August central shutdown.
