Thank you, Pat
Slide six compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter 2017 production was 2.78 million barrels a day, an increase of 252,000 barrels a day or 10% over the second quarter of 2016. Major capital projects increased production by 265,000 barrels per day as we started and ramped up multiple projects including Gorgon, Angola LNG, Jack/St
Malo, Alder, Moho Nord, Mafumeira Sul and Bangka
Shale and tight production increased by 41,000 barrels a day primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian
The increases were partially offset by normal field declines and PFE effects
The other bar includes the loss of 38,000 barrels a day due to 2016 asset sales
Turning to slide seven
Year-to-date 2017 production is 2.73 million barrels a day
Up 5% from 2016 and within our guidance range of 4% to 9% growth excluding asset sales
Our expectation is that full year production will be well within our original guidance range
The ramp-up of production in the second quarter was strong, with June's monthly production at 2.85 million barrels per day
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to see reliable production from the assets that are currently onstream, further growth in the Permian and Wheatstone coming online
Some of these increases will be offset in the third quarter due to normal turnaround activity
Year-to-date there's been no impact on production from 2017 asset sales since the first transactions involving producing assets closed on June 30. Assets sold year-to-date and assets expected to be sold later this year have a combined daily production of around 175,000 barrels per day
The impact on full year 2017 production from asset sales is expected to be 25,000 to 75,000 barrels a day given the late in year timing for the sales
Turning to slide eight
We're seeing strong performance at Gorgon
All three trains have achieved or exceeded nameplate capacity and are operating smoothly
On a 100% basis, second quarter Gorgon production was 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is currently averaging around 430,000 barrels a day
We are currently producing around 3 billion cubic feet of gas a day from 14 wells
In the second quarter, domestic gas sales were approximately 125 million cubic feet per day and condensate production was around 14,000 barrels a day
We shipped 88 LNG cargoes so far this year
Looking forward, we're focused on achieving sustained operations and are analyzing plant performance to find opportunities to increase reliability and production
Additional fine tuning of the plant will maximize efficiency and we expect further debottlenecking opportunities to increase plant capacity
Turning to slide nine
We're on track at Wheatstone
The Wheatstone platform and pipeline are operational and supplying natural gas to the inlet of the onshore LNG plant
Early well performance is encouraging
We're in the process of starting up the plant and expect to commence cool-down shortly
LNG production is expected to follow next month
Train 2 construction is progressing well and we're on track to start up six to eight months after Train 1. Turning to slide 10. The future growth project, or FGP, is progressing well, and I'll highlight some milestones
Module fabrication is in progress in Korea and Kazakhstan, as is the fabrication of gas turbine generators in Italy
Dredging is essentially complete, and other activities required for the initiation of port operations are on track
Infrastructure work and site construction are progressing, and we're 75% complete with our piloting program
We have two drilling rigs in operation on multi-well pads, with a third rig expected in August
We're on track for first production in 2022. In addition to FGP, we're also making progress on a number of other major capital projects
At Hebron, offshore Canada, the platform's been installed on location and we expect first oil before year-end 2017. Projects expected to come online in 2018 include Clair Ridge in the North Sea, where offshore hookup and commissioning is well underway; the Stampede platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which was recently installed on location; the Big Foot platform, which is preparing for sail away around the end of this year; and Tahiti, where we're progressing the Vertical Expansion project
These projects are expected to add approximately 20,000 net barrels of new production in 2018 and 65,000 net barrels in 2019. Let's turn to slide 11. This is an updated map of the Permian Basin including Southeast New Mexico and West Texas
Our two million acres, 1.5 million of which are Midland and Delaware Basins, are depicted in blue
Outlined on the map are our Chevron-operated and non-operated development areas
Additionally, on the right side of the chart, we've included an updated version of our assessment of acreage valuation
Currently, we estimate that approximately 650,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 an acre, and an additional 450,000 acres have a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre
The balance of our acreage is a mix
Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation
Some lacks nearby infrastructure, and other requires further appraisal
As a reminder, these estimates are a snapshot that assumes simultaneous development at a $50 WTI price, burdened with all the development and production costs as we see them today
Let's turn to slide 12. This slide illustrates our returns-focused Permian development strategy
We're investing for value
We're applying technology and learning from others to drive capital efficiency
Let me provide a few examples of how we're using technology as a competitive advantage
We're using seismic data to detect variations in the properties of reservoirs to identify the optimal areas
We're then applying petrophysical modeling to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of rocks and their contained fluids, and we integrate geophysical information with production data to identify the most productive intervals, and to select well locations that offer the highest returns
We perform focused data analytic studies to optimize horizontal well placement and well spacing decisions
To do this, we have a comprehensive database of industry wells with production, completion, reservoir, and operational data
We also use this data to optimize our completions for proppant loading, cluster spacing, and liquid loading
During drilling operations, we use well and model data to make precise wellbore placement decisions to keep the well path within the most productive depth, often within a 10-foot interval
Our Integrated Operations Center provides support to our field personnel, who have access to real-time, operational data on mobile devices
As an example, real-time equipment information, such as excessive compressive vibration, can provide an early indication of a potential problem, allowing us to react before downtime occurs
But the real key in all this is effectively applying the technology to deliver better outcomes
We also learn by watching others
The graphs on the right side are one example of how we successfully combine our application of technology with our learning from others
The initial six months' recoveries per lateral foot are highlighted on the charts for wells in two different benches
In red are the actual results of Competitor A, who's a strong growth player in the basin, employing a strategy of speed to the development of the second Bone Spring and Avalon horizons in the Delaware Basin
They got there first, they drilled aggressively in each horizon, and they demonstrated production growth
However, their strategy of trial and error required them to spend significant capital
We've learned from their experience
The blue on the chart shows our actual results in the same horizons
For a similar number of wells, we're recovering more production per foot, and our cost per foot is lower than our competitor
Our strategy is working
We believe real value is created through capital efficiency and discipline, as well as strong, consistent execution
Let's go to slide 13. This chart illustrates three elements of financial performance
Our current financial metrics, the competitiveness of our current spend, and the attractiveness of returns for future investments
First, our unconventional Permian business, fully loaded with overhead cost, has positive after-tax earnings for the first half of 2017. We forecast earnings growth, even at flat prices in future periods, as a result of lower unit operating costs and depreciation rates
Our depreciation rates are expected to further decline as we cycle through prior invested capital and replace it with today's more efficient development costs
At actual 2017 oil, gas, and NGL prices, our year-to-date operating cash flow per barrel is approximately $20 and is accretive to Chevron's overall portfolio
Second, our unit development and operating costs are competitive and declining
The chart on the right compares our company operated with our non-operated JV costs
As you can see, cost reduction progress has been encouraging, and we are increasingly competitive
And third, the Permian is an attractive place to make future investments
We estimate, as noted in the box at the bottom, that our 2017 investments in the Permian, fully loaded with overhead, will generate greater than 30% returns at a $50 a barrel WTI price
Turning to slide 14. We're actively managing our Permian portfolio through acreage swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and sales
This chart shows our historical and forecasted transaction activity in the Midland and Delaware Basins
We've identified between 150,000 and 200,000 acres in the Midland and Delaware Basins that we plan to transact to generate more immediate value
A recent transaction effectively more than tripled the value of our acreage simply by enabling longer laterals
Generally, the highest value transactions are swaps to core up acreage and enhance value through long laterals and other infrastructure efficiencies
In 2017, we've already closed seven deals and have grouped the remaining acreage into a number of packages that are actively being marketed
Slide 15. Production continues to track ahead of expectations as we continue to see efficiency gains and improved well performance
The chart on the left shows our second quarter, 2017 production of approximately 178,000 barrels a day, up about 44,000 barrels a day from the second quarter of 2016. In March, we gave you our forecasted Permian compounded annual growth rate of 20% to 35%
And we're currently near the top of that range
Today, we're operating 13 rigs and our plan is to continue to add rigs approximately every eight to ten weeks achieving 20 operated rigs by the end of 2018. In addition to our operated fleet, we expect to see our share of production from non-operated rigs
Our objective in the Permian is to generate value through capital and execution efficiency
We intend to be fully competitive on our unit development and production costs and realizations and use our superior royalty position to generate leading financial performance
With that, I'll turn it back over to Pat
We're seeing very good performance out of the Permian
Our drive on capital efficiency and good execution is really paying off for us
We also have seen good performance from our new basis of design
It's early yet but the results are encouraging
As we look at our overall portfolio and as we finish the period of heavy capital spend that we've been on, we have a pretty youthful portfolio that allows us a lot of opportunity to continue to build now on the infrastructure that's been installed and to capitalize on the Permian as a very large resource base for us
Our current plan that we've given you has the rigs running up to 20 company operated rigs by the end of next year
One thing I really like about the Permian is we're monitoring financial performance and financial returns virtually on a real-time basis
And as we continue to see performance out of Permian, we have the option to continue to expand that rig fleet or to hold the rig fleet depending on the performance that we're seeing
So we have seen a continued set of surprises to the upward over the years as we've shown you what the Permian can do for us and I would expect to see continued performance as we move forward
What's first and foremost, out of all this is that the Permian is one of our primary assets and it will attract the capital that's necessary
We are not holding back capital to the Permian and I don't think we'll need to
As these big capital programs roll off, the amount of discretionary capital allocation that we have has been increasing pretty significantly and that's going to continue over the next several years
So I'm very encouraged
Thank you, Evan
The actual update isn't a quarterly update
I think the last time we gave you that data was third quarter of last year
So it's over a period of time
But there are a number of factors that drive that increased valuation
Probably first and foremost is just the increasing efficiency we're continuing to see, both in terms of our recoveries and our cost development and operating cost per foot
So those are driving, to a large extent, the increased valuations that we're seeing, because they're based on our well performance
So, we would expect to see – we'll continue to update these periodically
We won't do it probably quarterly, because it's just too much effort focused on keeping track of all the acreage, but the general message is, our acreage position, we continue to work it hard
We continue to look for the next best development areas
We're using technology and the experience of others, and we are seeing continued improvement in those valuations
And then we're delivering those results
It's a combination of things
On the capital side, the DD&A is really a mix of what we've already got in the portfolio, plus the new wells being added on a continuing basis
But because of the profile of production on these wells, we have a pretty rapid turnover of the capital employed through the depreciation schedule
And so, as we move forward in time, the wells that we're drilling today are more efficient than the wells we drilled last year and the year before, and we're just seeing this progression and decrease of DD&A consistent with the decrease in our unit development costs
From a lease-operating standpoint, we have looked at our actual organization structures
We looked at how we're organized
We look at the efficiency of our factory model
We're using the Integrated Operation Center to keep our production reliability as high as possible
And, as we build scale, we don't have to increase the organization in direct proportion to the scale, so we start getting more and more economies of scale in our operations
So all those together, with the advances in the technology that we're really applying on a very real-time basis, we see this drive to continue to become more efficient
Unknown Speaker Thank you, Evan
Virtually all of our development activity now, all 13 rigs, are running in multi-well pad mode and factory mode
The only wells you'll see in the future in the Permian that won't be that basis might be some expiration wells that we do to stay ahead of our development drilling
But that would be a very small percentage of the wells
Morning
Okay, so from the Permian in terms of breakeven position, we gave you guidance in the SAM meeting back in March that if we – we're growing our rig fleet to 20 rigs, is our intention by the end of 2018, and then we have options at that point
But if we should decide to hold at 20 rigs and just continue to run those 20 rigs, under the current conditions with the current performance, we would expect to be cash-flow positive overall
But what's really important here is, we're looking at the returns each and every well and development area give us as we're drilling those areas and as we make the decision on the next area, and those are all very positive
How much we choose to invest into the Permian on an ongoing basis, or on an expansion basis, is really part of our portfolio allocation of, where do we get the best returns
So we're not really worried about whether the Permian in and of itself is returning positive net cash flow, as long as the underlying wells in development are all strongly positive on their financial performance
So, our view is that we're going to get to 20 rigs
We're going to understand our performance and the conditions in the Permian, and we have the option to continue to increase rigs beyond that point should we choose, and should that be an optimal place for us to continue to invest
Terms of the sweet spot, it's really – we're working on the best spots today
But what's important is, as we continue to drive more efficiencies into the business, as we continue to advance the technologies that I talked about and the application of those, what we're finding is that we're continuing to drive down our unit development cost such that we can move into areas that might not have been so attractive before are becoming more and more attractive today
And also, as the infrastructure buildout continues, we are able then to bring in some of these lower value areas now become more and more attractive, because they don't have to underpin infrastructure
We can just use what's already been built out in the past
So overall, we see a very good resource picture
We'll use exploration to stay ahead of the game, and that's really our focus
No
We're really looking at the financial performance of the developments that are in front of us and the results that we're achieving out of the investments we've made and comparing that with the opportunities that we have across our portfolio
Thank you
Gorgon's running really well
And particularly as we saw Train 2 and then Train 3 start up, Train 3 start-up was a beautiful thing
We're really pleased with it; it looked great
And so now all three trains are stable at or above nameplate
And that was our goal
When we look at the reliability, it's how many trips or how many times does the plant go offline, and obviously we want to eliminate those so that the plants run reliably day in and day out
And then on top of that, we start getting the plant performance data so we can look at what are the bottlenecks that we can correct that'll allow us to then increase the ultimate capacity of the plant
There may be some short pit stops that we'll take from time to time that are going to be economically driven and planned, if we find that some of those opportunities require us to take the plan offline to make that adjustment
There are other things that we'll continue to make adjustments while they're online and running
So on balance, I expect to see us running at these levels throughout the year
There may be times we'll take short pit stops but those would be planned in advance and they'll be driven by economics
So on Wheatstone Train 1, you're correct, we are in the final stages of commissioning, and in fact, we are now into the true start-up phase
So we expect to see cool-down occurring here shortly
There's really no construction going on at all in Train 1 and commissioning is largely complete
In Train 2, we still are in bulk construction mode
But we expect to see that winding down in the fourth quarter and at this point in time, really don't see any particular on obstacles or challenges in our path to getting Train 2 complete and getting into the commissioning and start-up
There's always the issues of moving from bulk construction into the sequence of commissioning but we've got teams all over that
And just as we saw at Gorgon as we move from Trains 1, 2 and 3, we expect to see continuing efficiency both in the final construction and in that transition to commissioning building on the experience of the first train
Hi, Neil
Sure
Base declines have actually been quite good
The shift in strategy as we've moved from the heavy new greenfield investments into a focus on leveraging maximum value from our installed infrastructure base on install base business has been paying big dividends
So the infield drilling programs, the focus on reliability, the workover programs have been really sustaining our production, I think better than we would have expected given the amount of capital and costs that we've pulled out of the system
We have the advantage of a portfolio that has a lot of young assets
So as we start installing things like – or start taking advantage of things like Jack/St
Malo and the other projects that I mentioned that are coming online this year and next year as well as Gorgon and Wheatstone, we are seeing a very young portfolio
Lots of continued opportunities for infield drilling and, really, brownfield expansions
And there's a lot of value in that, even at today's prices
Sure
In the Partitioned Zone, the stopping of production continues
There's been no restart activity
There are continuing negotiations and dialogue between the two governments
We continue to advocate for a return to the status quo, get the field back in production while the longer-term issues are addressed
But at this point in time, there has not been any movement towards a restart
Somewhat perplexing to us, but we'll continue to play the role of facilitator and see if we can't get the fields restarted
I think it's in everyone's best interest
In terms of Venezuela, we have continued to be operational
We do not have major impacts on our operations at this point in time, and it's just a situation we continue to monitor
Our priority is on just maintaining safe operations, and protecting our people and assets
And in Nigeria, we continue to see good performance coming out of Nigeria
There are disruptions from time to time, but it has not had, I would consider, a material adverse effect
Well, look, when we've talked before about how we look at the Permian, we look at the whole value chain
So everything from our development, operating cost on the front end to the realizations we get on the back end
And we've done a lot of good work to open up multiple pathways to get our products to market so that we can take advantage of the different variations in the markets
So we have been working to stay ahead of our build out curve
At this point, we don't see any constrictions on our ability to grow, as we've discussed, in the Permian
And this is an area that we'll continue to stay focused on and seek the best realizations as we move forward
Unknown Speaker Thanks, Blake
Hello
No, when we're talking about 30% returns, we're basing that on a $50 WTI price, $2.50 (49:45) gas, $25 NGLs
And what we are doing is looking at our all-in costs, so we're not cherry picking just development costs or anything like that
But this is what we really expect to see, full returns, fully burdened
Yes
So as we look at the different assets that we have across North America, one of the things that we are very active on is sharing the information and best practices that are being developed in each area with the other unconventional areas
So we've seen cost, development cost, come down in the Duvernay
We've been largely involved in an appraisal program and a land tenure strategy
But now, with the results that we're seeing, we have a good-sized resource there and we are evaluating, as Pat mentioned earlier, our business plan at the current time on just what we want to do there, but it's very encouraging
We'll give you more details on each of those in the SAM meeting next year
In terms of the Marcellus, we've also seen our cost structure come down significantly, as well as our drilling efficiency improve
So that also has some promise, especially with the recovery in gas price, as to whether or not we hedge
That's something that we'll evaluate as part of putting together our strategy going forward
Another key area for us is the San Joaquin Valley, where we continue to run a very efficient operation in that area
The strategy there has been a drill-to-fill strategy, so we're really utilizing the existing installed infrastructure base, and we see very good returns coming out of our San Joaquin area
Builds on our heavy oil expertise, and provides a very good return us to
So North America overall looks very strong in the onshore areas
Thank you
Unknown Speaker Thanks, Anish
Yeah
Thanks very much
It's a good question
And there are a lot of different things being tried in the Permian on a real-time basis
And, as I mentioned earlier, our strategy, we've been criticized for it maybe a little bit in the past, but it's proving to be a very good strategy, is to let some of the others do some of the experimentation and then we watch and see what performs well, and then build that into our basis of design
Right now, our focus is on 7500 to 10,000-foot laterals
We'll wait and see if those really turn out
But as you get longer and longer laterals, it gets very difficult to get good returns throughout the length of the well bore
So, our focus is on getting the ultimate return for the capital invested
And that's really what's going to drive us more than any other single parameter
Yeah
So the 20 is really based on – we want to be bringing rigs in a steady, orderly fashion so that we can continue to increase the organizational capability around those rigs and make sure we're continuing to use each incremental rig very efficiently
So if you think about all the work that has to go on from establishing the land position, coring up, getting ready for the design of the development area, all through the procurement and then into the offtake afterwards, we want to make sure that we're keeping the organization and the factory healthy around each incremental rig
What we are finding is that, in addition to increasing the rigs, the amount of production each rig is generating is higher, and growing as the efficiencies improve
So part of it is increasing the rigs, but part of it is also getting more out of each and every rig that we apply
And the fleet is becoming more productive
So we're balancing all that
And as I say, because we get data on virtually a real-time basis, we're able to make decisions now and look forward and decide, do we want to continue that pathway higher or do we want to go ahead and hold at any number of particular rigs that we feel would deliver the efficiency? Capital's not the issue
It's really making sure that we're delivering the financial performance that we're looking for
Look, it's early days in terms of Tengiz
We carry good contingency and we make sure that when we run our economics, we really take into account what we think it could cost, not just what we want it to cost
We're taking all the steps we talked about in previous calls in terms of making sure the design assurance, our contracting strategies, our execution and our quality management are all in place
It's got our full and complete attention
So we're really working hard to manage this project
We're off to a good start
Projects of this nature are so large, there are always going be challenges and our goal is to address those challenges and minimize the use of contingency
But it's too early to give any other guidance than what we've given so far
