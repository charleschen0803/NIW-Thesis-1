Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences First Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you. You may begin.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Diego. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike
Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the
close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released first quarter 2021 financial results. During today's
call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying financial
statements and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates,
assumptions and projections. These statements include, but not limited to, financial guidance and
expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation,
reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as
of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them
after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those
associated with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning
factors that could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the
press release, our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are
available on the company's website at edwards.com.

Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-
GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they're referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and
non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this call are included in today's press release.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Mark. As we anniversary our 1-year impact of the pandemic on our financial results, I'd like
to briefly reflect on the current environment and to discuss our 2021 and longer-term priorities as a
company. I'd also like to touch on Edwards' response to the pandemic and our efforts to better support our
patients, employees and the community.

Recall that our sales were dramatically impacted in the last few weeks of Q1 2020 as procedures fell due
to COVID disruptions. One year later after an extraordinarily difficult global crisis, I'm encouraged by the
signs of recovery and although we recognize that many people are still struggling around the world. Our
sales growth this quarter was better than expected across all product lines.

Although we expect the pandemic will impact the global health care system, based on the environment as
we exited the quarter, we have continued confidence in our positive 2021 outlook. We continue to believe
that 2021 will be an important growth year for Edwards with mid-teen sales growth, highlighting the
importance of treating structural heart patients even during this pandemic.

We also anticipate meaningful progress on expanding large, underappreciated and underserved
transcatheter opportunities in 2021. Recently, we achieved several important milestones. Let me mention
4. Just last week, in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, or TAVR, we received approval to initiate
a pivotal trial for patients suffering from moderate aortic stenosis. Also, earlier this month, we received

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

approval to begin treating patients at low surgical risk in Japan with SAPIEN 3. And in Transcatheter Mitral
and Tricuspid Therapies, or TMTT, I'm pleased to announce that the first patients were recently treated
with EVOQUE Eos, our next-generation transcatheter mitral replacement system. Also in TMTT, we initiated
the TRISCEND II U.S. pivotal trial for transcatheter tricuspid replacement.

Looking beyond 2021, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative
therapies. Our patient-focused culture drives us and motivates our employees around the world every day.
Our R&D targets breakthrough therapies that can create significant value for patients and health systems,
enabling strong organic sales growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Despite COVID disruptions,
we've continued to invest aggressively for future growth. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our research and
development investments today are focused on generating a robust body of guideline-changing clinical
evidence. And although clinical studies slowed during the pandemic, our dedicated clinician partners
are eager to accelerate enrollment in this important research. Regulators have also been supported in
addressing the impact of the pandemic and its impact on clinical studies.

Finally, I want to provide some perspective on how we've maintained our focus on creating long-term
value as we navigated the pandemic over the last year. We continue to invest in our people and our
infrastructure. During a time when widespread uncertainty impacted many families across the globe, we
have prioritized protecting our employees and have grown our team. We enhanced employee benefits,
rewarded performance and protected incentives. We also moved ahead on expanding Edwards' research
and production facilities around the world. We adjusted our agreements to support hospitals as they
navigated COVID. And additionally, we provided extra support to the communities where our employees
live and work. In fact, we recently converted one of our facilities into a mass COVID vaccination site to
support the community of 3 million people where our company is headquartered. As a company, we expect
that Edwards will be positioned even stronger and be able to help more patients than ever before as the
world emerges from the pandemic.

Now turning to our first quarter results. We reported $1.2 billion in sales this quarter, up 5% on a constant
currency basis from a year ago. Recall that our guidance assumed Q1 sales would be in line with the first
quarter of last year, which was largely unaffected by COVID. We were pleased with how sales improved as
the quarter progressed.

In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $792 million, up 4% on an underlying basis. The SAPIEN 3 Ultra
platform remains differentiated with low complication rates, ease of use, and significant potential for
length-of-stay efficiency. Our average selling prices were stable, and we estimated that global TAVR
procedure growth was comparable with our growth.

In the U.S., our Q1 TAVR sales were flat with fourth quarter and year ago results, and we estimate that
overall U.S. procedure growth was comparable. Consistent with our guidance on the Q4 earnings call in
late January, COVID stressed the global health care system during the winter months. We are encouraged,
however, that U.S. TAVR procedures grew as COVID hospitalizations decreased and vaccinations increased
during the quarter. Small and medium-sized centers played a valuable role in serving patients during the
quarter. We continued to activate new centers this quarter as we have been throughout the pandemic.
This demonstrates the clear interest of many smaller centers to provide state-of-the-art care for structural
heart patients.

Outside the U.S., in the first quarter, we estimated TAVR procedures grew in the low double digits on a
year-over-year basis and Edwards' growth was comparable. Although we are off to a strong start, the
slow vaccination progress outside the U.S. provides uncertainty for the remainder of the year. Edwards'
underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single-digit range. Edwards'
growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption rates outpaced countries where the therapy is more
established. Although TAVR centers were more prepared to treat patients, patient flow was disrupted due
to regional lockdowns and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease. Sales growth
in Japan and other countries was strong as aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease,
and we remain focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. As previously noted, we received
approval earlier this month in Japan for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk. We anticipate increased
treatment rates when reimbursement is approved later this year.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

In addition to geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain dedicated to pursuing indication
expansions. Our groundbreaking early TAVR trial is focused on patients who have severe aortic stenosis
but without recognized symptoms and who do not meet the current guidelines for valve replacement.
We expect enrollment to increase as we and participating sites are motivated to complete enrollment of
the trial this year. I'm also pleased to report that we received FDA approval for a pivotal trial for TAVR
in moderate AS patients as we expect enrollment to begin later this year. Based on recent trials, we're
learning on what was once thought of as a benign precursor to severe aortic stenosis may actually be
associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality than previously recognized. Thus, we believe TAVR
may be a future treatment option for these patients.

Separately, last week, we received SAPIEN 3 CE Mark approval to begin treating patients with a previously
repaired or replaced valve in the pulmonic position. Looking ahead to the upcoming virtual EuroPCR
meeting next month, we expect long-term follow-up data from our European registry on SAPIEN 3 as well
as the late-breaking clinical trial results on low-risk bicuspid patients.

In summary, based on the strength we saw at the end of the first quarter, we have confidence that the
underlying TAVR sales will grow in the 15% to 20% range in 2021. We expect continued near-term
COVID-related regional disruptions and a more normalized second half of the year. We remain confident
that this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual
growth rate in the low double digits.

Turning to TMTT. We're enrolling 5 pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio of technologies to
support patients suffering from tricuspid and mitral valve disorders. This quarter, we progressed with
the enrollment of our 3 CLASP pivotal trials for PASCAL. We continue to expect approval for patients
with DMR late next year. This is expected to be the first commercial approval of the PASCAL system in
the U.S. We've also begun treating patients with EVOQUE TR in the TRISCEND II randomized pivotal
trial in accordance with the FDA's breakthrough pathway designation. This trial will evaluate the safety
and effectiveness of the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system for patients with severe tricuspid
regurgitation.

In addition, the first patients were recently treated with our next-generation transcatheter mitral
replacement system called EVOQUE Eos through the MISCEND study. This study will evaluate the safety
and performance of EVOQUE Eos, which is designed to advance the treatment of patients with mitral
regurgitation with a low-profile valve delivered through a sub-30 French transfemoral delivery system. We
believe our 2-platform replacement strategy with SAPIEN M3 and EVOQUE Eos strongly positions us to be
the leader in treating these underserved patients.

As we expand our body of clinical evidence, we look forward to presenting meaningful data across our
portfolio at the upcoming virtual ACC and EuroPCR medical meetings, including multiple late-breaking
presentations. These include longer-term outcomes for transcatheter mitral repair from our CLASP trial
and the first report of 30-day outcomes with EVOQUE tricuspid replacement from our TRISCEND study.

Turning to our results. First quarter global sales were $16 million, driven by continued adoption of our
PASCAL system and activation of more centers across Europe. Assuming diminishing COVID-related
impact, we expect a ramp of sales throughout the year. We remain confident in our 2021 sales guidance
of $80 million as we advance commercialization, staying focused on physician training, procedural
success and patient outcomes. Adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes remain key drivers to
transforming treatment.

In summary, we are making meaningful progress toward our 2021 milestones and we continue to
estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2025. We remain committed to
transforming the treatment of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease around the world.

In Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter 2021 global sales was $213 million, increased 7% on an
underlying basis over the prior year. Despite a soft start associated with COVID, we are encouraged by
improvement across all regions over the course of the quarter. Notably, growth was lifted by premium
products and improved as declining COVID cases enabled more hospitals to resume treating surgical
structural heart patients.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

We remain very encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards' RESILIA tissue valves, including
continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve. We anticipate that adoption will be
bolstered by the 5-year data from our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the
Society of Thoracic Surgeons, which demonstrates the excellent durability of this tissue technology. And
we're pleased that in the first quarter, we initiated sales of INSPIRIS in China. Sales in the U.S. also
continue to gain traction with KONECT RESILIA, the first preassembled aortic tissue valve conduit for
patients who require replacement of the valve, root and ascending aorta, a critical unmet patient need.
Finally, we're pleased to announce that we received regulatory approval with reimbursement in Japan for
our MITRIS RESILIA valve, a new mitral valve incorporating our newest tissue technology. Yesterday in
Japan, we performed our first commercial cases with this differentiated innovation.

In summary, we have confidence in our first -- in our full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high
single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our premium technologies.
We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structural Heart market will grow in the mid-single
digits through 2026.

In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $196 million increased 4% on an underlying basis, driven by
increased sales of technologies for both the operating room and intensive care units. HemoSphere orders
increased as hospital capital spending began to show signs of recovery. Demand for our products used in
high-risk surgeries remains strong, and our ClearSight noninvasive finger cuff used in elective procedures
also recovered to near pre-COVID levels. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the
ICU remained in demand due to elevated hospitalizations in both the U.S. and Europe at the beginning
of Q1. We continue to expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for
Critical Care. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations and we -- as we continue
to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their
patients.

And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. Well, we are encouraged by the start to our year. Despite COVID still impacting the global
health care system in the first quarter, we were able to post positive year-over-year sales growth across
all of our product lines and regions as our advanced therapies helped patients globally. Total sales grew
5% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was better than the flat growth we expected when we
gave guidance for the first quarter back in January. This stronger-than-expected sales performance fell
through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, which was 8% higher than
the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in our sales performance during the quarter was choppy, but
we exited the quarter in a stronger position, and that gives us continued confidence in our outlook for the
balance of the year.

While macro conditions remain variable across our key geographies, we're projecting total sales in the
second quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, resulting in adjusted
earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.60. As our business continues to rebound from the impact of COVID, we
expect sales to strengthen and expenses to grow as travel and clinical trials ramp up. We're maintaining
all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion
to $5.3 billion; for TAVR, $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, approximately $80 million; for Surgical
Structural Heart, $800 million to $900 million; and for Critical Care, $725 million to $800 million. And
based on our first quarter earnings, we are raising full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.07
to $2.27, up from $2 to $2.20.

So now I'll cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin
was 76% compared to 76.7% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a negative impact
from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding to COVID, partially offset by
improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be
between 76% and 77%.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $331 million or 27.2% of sales
compared to $308 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the strengthening of OUS
currencies, primarily the euro, and personnel-related costs, partially offset by reduced travel spending
resulting from COVID. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate our spending will increase during the year
as travel restrictions subside and we resume a more normalized operating environment. We continue to
expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%, similar
to pre-COVID levels.

Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $207 million or 17% of sales. This
increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations. For the full
year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar
to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand
indications for TAVR and TMTT.

Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1%. This rate included a 290 basis point
benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate
in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 4
percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.

Foreign exchange rates increased first quarter reported sales growth by 280 basis points or $30 million
compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $60 million positive impact or
about 1% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross
profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates
positively impacted our first quarter EPS by about $0.01.

Free cash flow for the first quarter was $195 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $301
million less capital spending of $106 million.

Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share
repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately
$2.1 billion in cash and investments as of March 31, 2021. We repurchased 3.6 million shares for $303
million during the first quarter and have approximately $300 million remaining in our share repurchase
authorization. We plan to continue to execute our strategy of offsetting dilution from incentive stock
compensation as well as opportunistically reducing our shares outstanding over time. Average shares
outstanding during the first quarter were 631 million, down approximately 1 million from the prior quarter.
We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635
million.

So with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Scott. We remain confident in our long-term patient-focused strategy and our innovation pipeline.
To serve the many patients suffering from structural heart disease, we have never stopped investing
in our people, our innovative technologies and our new growth capacity. As a company, we expect that
Edwards will be positioned even stronger and in a position to help more patients than ever as the world
fully emerges from this pandemic.

So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Mike. So Diego, with that, we're ready to take questions now. [Operator Instructions] Diego?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

One thing that I'd love to get your view on that kind of stood out in the quarter is the TAVR growth rate
you guys put up in the first quarter outside the United States and especially outside the United States and
excluding Europe given some of the numbers you gave us. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little
bit more about that. And specifically, was Japan and maybe China really strong in the quarter? Mike, I'd
just love your take on what happened outside the U.S. this quarter with TAVR.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bob. That -- yes. That's a correct observation. Clearly, OUS did pull our performance up
in the quarter. And even though Europe grew nicely, most of this came from Japan and other countries.
And so Japan is pretty significant in size. And so it really was a meaningful contributor to growth. But it
certainly wasn't alone. You could go across many other countries. It's sort of that normally don't get called
out like the Australias or the Koreas and this kind of places in the world where it's underpenetrated. We
just don't have TAVR rates where they should be at. We're really strong growers. Some of that may have
been that they were impacted earlier by the pandemic. And so the year-over-year comparisons are a bit
stronger. But frankly, the numbers were just up. There -- we continue to see that therapy grow in those
areas. China, we're very early in that game. It was not a meaningful contributor to those results. So it's
really not a factor.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then one quick follow-up on that is just, was there anything in particular that you think that
gave you better results in Japan this quarter? And then on Europe, I'm just curious, did Europe get worse
over the course of the quarter, just following what happened with COVID? Or was it pretty stable? Or did it
improve like the U.S.? Just curious on that.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So in Japan, there was no specific thing that drove this. We've been focused in Japan for many years
and actually somewhat disappointed that adoption rates haven't been higher. And so this has been a long-
term and consistent effort, and it's really nice to just continue to see the adoption. We are glad to see this
approval for low risk in Japan that will start having some meaning later on in the year.

In Europe, it was interesting. It was kind of choppy. I would say not consistent across all countries. We still
saw the countries that were less penetrated probably have a little bit more growth than those countries
that have traditionally been strong. And if you looked at it through the course of the quarter, it exited
pretty solid, I think, similar to the overall growth rate of the quarter. So I don't think there was anything
notable there, Bob.

Operator

Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

Great. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe the opposite of Bob's question in the U.S., it'd be great to get a
sense of sort of the trends you're seeing, how the quarter went. And especially with so many of the adults,
particularly the 65 and older population now fully vaccinated, are you starting to see trends improve
there?

And then maybe I'll just ask a second question upfront. I've heard from a lot of doctors throughout the
COVID time that the time from diagnosis to screening to treatment with TAVR is starting to compress. I
want to see if you're seeing that on a company level. And if so, is that a durable trend?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Okay. So let's talk about the U.S. The U.S. did improve during the course of the quarter, no doubt about
it, but we would call it choppy. It wasn't straight up. So for example, things were tough in January and
February and clearly got better in March. Although when you got toward the back end of March and you
had spring break, you felt that effect as well but clearly an upward trend. I just remember the sort of the
roller-coaster that we went on, Robbie. When we first put out the TAVR estimates of 15% to 20% growth
in our December investor conference, we were feeling pretty good about it. When we got to the end of
January and reported Q1, we were saying, "Well, we're still in that range but probably we're a little lower
in that range just based on how things we're going." And then here, they went and recovered nicely. So
we feel confident about the 15% to 20% range going forward. So hopefully, that helps you get a sense for
the U.S.

In terms of the question about is it easier, all hospitals are not identical in the way that they screen
patients. And so although some are more efficient and getting more efficient, others are more challenging.
And one of the things that happens when you have COVID, so in addition to all the tests that you run
through, you also have to do COVID tests before you would come in a hospital. So it just becomes a
hassle for these patients in addition to just the fear factor. So I wouldn't say it's uniform. Overall, hospitals
will get a little better, but it's still a battle. The good news is length of stay is coming down. Hospitals are
clearly improving in that regard. And maybe some of that is COVID-driven, but it seems to be a trend as
well.

Operator

Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I had 2. Maybe I'll start with the first one on the guidance here. Mike, on your comments on 15% to 20%,
in January, you felt perhaps low end seems more appropriate. You just beat Q1, right, at the high end. It
looks like procedures have come back. So I'm thinking, are we -- should we be looking at the high end of
the guide? And I think that 15% to 20%, just to put a finer point to that, that's versus last year's guide,
right? If you look at the actual TAVR revenue numbers, I mean this is more like a 16% to 26% growth off
of actual fiscal '20 TAVR numbers.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No. Thanks, Vijay. We feel pretty good about the fact that we're putting pretty specific guidance
out there in the first place, and guidance is not that simple during the age of COVID. We did -- we do
feel better about it. We probably would tend to guide people more toward the middle of the range, Vijay.
Of course, it's possible for it to be higher and lower. And this is going to be somewhat dependent on
what your perspective is about COVID. So even in the U.S. or certainly across Europe, if COVID is more
challenging, it will put pressure on our numbers. If things go -- vaccinations go nicely and COVID really,
we start winning the battle. It helps us trend toward the higher end. But I feel like there's pretty balance
in the guidance that we try to advance.

Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. And then I did have one, perhaps more a bigger picture question, Mike. I guess the question
we've gotten is, how derisked is mitral? Because if I had to make a thesis, mitral is going to be a really
big TAM, much bigger than TAVR. I guess the question was, look, you've had COAPT versus MITRA-FR.
Patient selection matters. Then when I look at your trials, you have 2 different trials on the replacement
side, SAPIEN M3 and the EVOQUE. Is that a two-valve strategy? Is that perhaps Edwards trying to take
a portfolio approach? Are these valves different? Or I guess I'm trying to ask how derisked is mitral. Are
we at a point where we know exactly what patients we need to select and this is just a question of time
before mitral ends up being much larger than TAVR?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks for that, Vijay. Well, you can probably get a sense in terms of how dedicated Edwards is to pursue
transcatheter mitral and tricuspid. We really think it's a big opportunity. We think it's within our reach. And
we think the time is right for us to go after it and we're going after it with a lot of energy. You know we're
pursuing it with a toolbox. To say it's derisked would be overstating the situation at this point. It certainly
is not derisked. There's leaflet therapy out there right now that has a fair amount of data around it, but
there is still limited data on replacement, limited data in tricuspid.

And I think each time you see results from these trials and you see them actually in human use, you
start to -- you see more and more derisking and more and more clarity and frankly more clarity on which
patients are appropriate for which therapies. And I would say that's not fully known at this point. We have
some pretty good ideas. And maybe we know more than most because we have so many technologies
advancing in this space, but there's still more to learn. And so I'll turn your attention mostly to these big
clinical meetings where they'll be reporting the results from mitral and tricuspid trials to get a sense for us
getting a better understanding of the opportunity.

Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Mike, one on early TAVR, one on TMTT. Just on early TAVR, just a clarification, Mike. I thought I heard
you say earlier that you expect to complete the trial in 2021. Maybe that's just enrollment, but the
ClinicalTrials.gov was just updated in April. It says the primary end point will be reached in December
2021. So my question is, can you just tell us kind of what the status is on enrollment and when we could
expect to see a data readout there? And I have one follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Sorry if there was a lack of clarity on it. What I meant to infer is we're striving to achieve enrollment
completion by the end of 2021. You may have also gotten from my comments that enrollment was a little
lighter than we like in Q1, and that anticipates actually that we're going to have increased enrollment
as the year goes on and COVID gets a little bit more under control. So we're working hard to get there.
Remember that there's a 2-year end point on this trial as well.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful, Mike. On TMTT, can you talk a little bit more? You seem to be getting traction -- nice
traction there, a little bit more about what you're seeing in the mitral and tricuspid businesses there. I
don't know if you're willing to kind of split out mitral and -- versus tricuspid. But any color you're willing to
provide would be helpful.

Yes. Thanks, Larry. Yes. At this point, clearly, there's more sales in mitral than there is in tricuspid.
Tricuspid is pretty new, still -- I mean it's been a pretty impressive ramp in tricuspid. We're pleased with
what we're seeing. We think the opportunity is a nice one, but still, the opportunity is -- at least the sales
right now is, to a great majority, related to mitrals. There's still more centers that are doing this. And for
Edwards, actually activating sites is important, very careful training, trying to make sure that we get great
outcomes. Those are all critical success factors. But I don't know if that helps answer your question.

Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on the strong start to the year. I want -- 2 questions on TAVR. The first one, just on low-
risk bicuspid, the PARTNER III bicuspid registry data was -- has been made public. And just wanted to
get a sense of -- from you, if your team is relaying the penetration of TAVR into the low-risk bicuspid
opportunity, where it sits and with the registry data on hand now and where can that go.

And the follow-up question is just thinking about the replacement cycle for TAVR, I know it's still very
early, but as younger patients are getting implanted with TAVR and the TAVR-in-TAVR opportunity out in
the out years, maybe even past 2024, but maybe -- Mike, do you mind just framing what needs to be
done clinically to bring TAVR-in-TAVR into a place maybe where TAVR-in-SAVR sits today?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Josh. So let me take a shot at this. So overall, we're pleased with our bicuspid data. I don't
have anything -- a specific breakout to share with you. We routinely treat a lot of bicuspid patients. And
I think what will be interesting is what we mentioned in this upcoming meeting. I believe it's EuroPCR.
You're going to see a report of a pretty significant registry of patients that are bicuspid patients that have
been treated with transcatheter technology. So that should be an interesting data point and help give you
some good insight. That's just here within the next couple of months.

In terms of where we are in the journey for TAVR-in-TAVR versus TAVR-in-SAVR, you hear clinicians
talking much more about how do I plan a lifetime therapy, right? What should be -- for a given patient,
given their age, given their disease, what should be the first treatment? What might be the second?
Should it be surgery first, TAVR second; SAVR first then surgery then another TAVR; and all that. And
that's a very active discussion. I think there's been some really strong evidence that says TAVR-in-TAVR is
good as well as TAVR-in-SAVR. So those are both proven to be realistic options. And so now it's trying to
sort through for any given patient what's the best therapy. And it's on the podium pretty regularly, and I
think we're on a pretty steep learning curve in that regard.

Cecilia E. Furlong

Great. I guess I wanted to start off with TMTT again and just really -- as you're expanding in Europe and

versus account expansion as you factor that into your guidance.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Cecilia. The short answer is I'm not sure. Clearly, more sites is an important component here.
I also know that there's an increase within the existing sites, but probably site expansion is the biggest
part of that if you were just -- you have to pick one versus the other given the outcomes.

Cecilia E. Furlong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Great. And I guess I did want to turn back to TAVR in Japan and just what you're seeing there.
Really just ahead of low-risk reimbursement, if that has changed dynamics in terms of just interest versus
kind of what you've seen historically and that being kind of a driver of recent strength.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Cecilia. Yes. We believe that clinicians and the environment in general is pretty disciplined in
Japan in that clinicians do treat to approved guidelines. And so we don't think that there's a lot of low risk
that's in the current numbers. And so we expect that to be a positive boost. Having said that, as we've
talked about before, treatment rates in Japan compared to where they should be are just low. There's
almost as many elderly in Japan as there are in the United States but it's still dramatically less treated.
So we still have work to do. There's still potentially a lot of upside there. We're pleased to see the growth
rates, but we're not pleased at the penetration rates yet.

Operator

Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Crédit Suisse.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So I'm hoping, Mike, you could shed some light on just a couple of dynamics that we get questions about
often and how they're potentially affecting the growth of the TAVR business globally and maybe especially
in the U.S. So these 2 things -- and I'll keep it to one question, are first, the idea that TAVR somehow
benefited during COVID, this idea of a preference for TAVR over SAVR, driven by length of stay and that
potentially -- maybe that rolled back towards SAVR over time somewhat.

And then the second is sort of what you've contemplated in terms of -- you gained an awful lot of share
-- a fair amount of share from your largest competitor over the past 1.5 years or so, and how much you
contemplated sort of having to feed that back and maybe what you've seen on that front so far as it
compares to what you've assumed.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, thanks, Matt. So a couple of things. I mean clearly, we've heard clinicians and hospitals talk a
lot about their focus on length of stay and about how helpful it is if they don't have to utilize their ICU or
have patients that stay in the hospital. Having said that, I would say that if you were to take the U.S. mix,
for example, of TAVR versus SAVR during the pandemic, that's remained relatively flat. They're really --
we haven't seen TAVR versus SAVR, or vice versa, advantage very much during the pandemic. It's been
pretty stable. And so it's difficult to know if that's COVID-related or if it's just a sign of the times, but
that's the observation.

Matthew Stephan Miksic

On the second question.

Michael A. Mussallem

You also -- the second part of the question was about share. Yes. We feel pretty good about our
competitive position. We're really pleased with the performance of SAPIEN 3 Ultra. It's demonstrated not
only to be easy to use but low complication rates, and its length of stay has been remarkable, and people
have really been able to count on it during the pandemic. I don't know anything that's going to change
that. We continue to be aggressive innovators and we'll continue to advance the state of the art. But we've
gotten a lot of positive feedback from clinicians.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Is there a way to quantify backlog of patients that have put off a procedure during COVID-19?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Joanne. It's a tough one. We do think about that a lot. In general, we don't think that there's
a significant backlog of patients. Clearly, it's variable across centers. There might be some centers actually
that have some, but we don't think that that's significant. More of what we found during the pandemic is
that at the same time, when centers have a capacity problem and it impacts their implants, it also tends
to impact their screening. So you don't necessarily get this backlog built up. They tend to move more or
less in parallel. So it's not one that tends to drive a big backlog.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And as a follow-up question, I'm sort of curious what you're sort of seeing in terms of the clinical trials. It
sounds as if you've restarted many of them. Are they back to what I would call sort of a normalized run
rate in terms of enrollment?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Joanne. Yes. We never officially stopped any clinical trials. They were clearly slower in the first
quarter. And so that was a factor. Actually, interestingly enough, the CLASP IID trial actually enrolled
pretty nicely in the second quarter. So it wasn't uniform. But I'd say most of our trials were impacted.
We're -- we think that the clinicians that we're working with, they're eager to get back at it. To say we're
back at pre-COVID rates, I think, would be an overstatement. But I think we should start building back up
again. And as we mentioned, I think the regulators have been pretty good thought partners in this as we
try and really react to what COVID has done to clinical trials.

Mike, I have one TAVR question and one PASCAL question for you. First, on TAVR in Japan, so you've
talked a lot about how Japan has sort of -- I don't know if underperformed your internal expectations is
the right way to think about it. But what is going on there? And what is Edwards -- like what's going to
change the tide in a meaningful way in Japan? And then again, just one quick follow-up on that.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Danielle. It's multifaceted in Japan in terms of what's going on. We think there needs to be
more centers in Japan, amongst other things, because in many cases, patients like to stay within their
own region to get treated, and we don't have TAVR centers in all regions. There are still some pretty high
requirements for TAVR centers to begin in Japan. They actually have to be cleared by an external panel.
And so it's not just between us and the clinicians. And we're hoping that low risk, it has the possibility
of being a catalyst to be able to help along the way and maybe simplify this journey for clinicians and
patients.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then on PASCAL, big catalyst potentially coming next year with the late 2022
U.S. launch. What can you talk about as far as the learnings in Europe as you're opening new centers? I
mean has your progress in Europe -- I appreciate COVID has had an impact here, but has your progress in
Europe given you sort of a blueprint for what you might -- how you might approach the U.S.? Maybe talk a
little bit about that, if you could.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Yes. You're right. Naturally, we're learning quite a bit in Europe, as you might imagine. What we
stay focused on, and I think we've been pretty vocal about this, is trying to maintain a really -- I'll call
it a high-touch model. So we stay very close to clinicians, try and help make sure that they have terrific
outcomes, that they're very well trained and that they get incredible results. And we think we can't do
anything more important than that to really drive the adoption of the therapy on a long-term basis.
We're optimistic about the U.S. It's very large. Even though things have been -- we've had nice growth
in Europe. The pandemic doesn't make it easy. You can imagine the biggest user of this technology
is Germany. And when Germany goes through tough times, it doesn't make it so easy. So we're a bit
dependent on this. But we're going to apply much of the same strategy in the U.S. that we applied in
Europe.

Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.

Anthony Charles Petrone
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congratulations, strong start to the year. I have 2 questions and I'll ask upfront. The first would be on
early TAVR for asymptomatic patients. Just wondering to get -- if you could provide some high-level
comments on sort of the latest view on the asymptomatic opportunity and then once we sort of get
there in the next year or so with data, how influential the findings from the study will be at opening up
asymptomatic.

And then on existing U.S. centers, maybe just a refresh on where the average TAVR volumes are today.
And when you think about fewer hospital [ N days ], how significant of a driver could that be to average
utilization -- that average utilization number?

Michael A. Mussallem

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2021

So let me start with the asymptomatic trial, the early TAVR trial. We think this is a really important trial.
One of the obstacles for patients to be treated is they can have severe aortic stenosis. And if there's
uncertainty whether they have symptoms, then they're not treated because that's what guidelines say,
that assessing and identifying symptoms is a very sketchy game. It's subject to a lot of misinterpretation.
So if we took that requirement out of the equation, we think it would be very meaningful. And if you could
simply take some echo measurements and say, "Hey, this patient has severe aortic stenosis" and that
drives treatment, that simplifies the diagnosis dramatically. It would make a big difference. So we think
that's important.

The second question, I didn't fully understand. Do you mind, Anthony, saying it again?

Anthony Charles Petrone
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Sure. When you look at the average U.S. volumes in U.S. TAVR centers today, is there a number where
average utilization is just in terms of monthly surgical volumes? When you think of fewer hospital [ N
days ] as a driver, does that have the potential to move that average utilization number higher?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Okay. So we've seen new hospitals come into the system, and that's been -- that's helped with growth. We
feel like hospitals have the ability to add capacity, if that's really underlying your question, and that they
do that...

Anthony Charles Petrone
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Quite well. They can do it by adding days. They can do it by adding clinicians. And we found them
routinely able to do it and not really be a big burden to them. And so it is clearly helpful when the length
of stay is shorter. But some of it is their own practices. If they're able to do, for example, multiple TAVRs
in a day, that really helps. If they're able to discharge a patient faster, that helps. And all those are
improving. And also, I would just say generally their desire to be able to increase capacity. So it's -- we're
getting to a place where TAVR is becoming far more predictable than it had been in the past, and that
really helps hospitals' ability to plan.

Adam Carl Maeder
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Congrats on the nice start to the year. Maybe just sticking with the capacity theme, I wanted to ask about
new U.S. TAVR centers and kind of where we are today. I think there was a lot of optimism in 2019 with
the new NCD that would span a couple of hundred new TAVR centers. COVID-19 has obviously been
impactful. But just wondering if we're starting to see some green shoots again and new centers open up.
Or are we just not quite there yet? And then I had a follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem

Yes. Thanks, Adam. I hope your follow-up is for Scott Ullem. He's getting lonely over here without any
questions. But let me get to your question. Yes, we're probably approaching something around 800
centers in the U.S. It's interesting even during the pandemic, there's been an increase each quarter,
maybe 10 to 20 centers per quarter. And so it's gradually increased. We've been impressed that centers

have actually come online during the pandemic, which tells you about their desire to be able to bring the
TAVR treatment to these structural heart patients. So we've been doing nicely. I think at the time of the
NCD, we thought the number might go to 850. We really don't have any update on that at this point. So
maybe that gives you a sense of where we are.

Adam Carl Maeder
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

That's really helpful, Mike. And apologies to Scott, but one follow-up on the TAVR side of things in the
pipeline. Just -- it's been a little bit of time here, I think, since we've gotten an update on the SAPIEN X4
program. So just wondering if there's any new developments you can share there. And is that something
you still plan? I think you're planning to move that to a pivotal trial at some point in '21. So is that still the
case? And just when will we learn more about the feature set and product design?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. Yes. At this point, Adam, we're not prepared to share more about the feature set of the
product line. We are still expecting to begin the clinical trial in 2021. And I think maybe even from a
bigger picture perspective, although we're really pleased with where we are on TAVR, we're just not going
to stop innovating. We continue to find opportunities for us to improve this therapy and make it better for
patients, and we're just going to stay relentless in that regard.

Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe I'll try to get Scott involved. So I'm just wondering, with the slightly -- you had better-than-
expected growth across the product lines in Q1 and you basically raised guidance by the beat for the
year. But I'm just curious, at least from a high-level standpoint, are you feeling better about the year now
that you have one card turned over here, one quarter under the belt? And why not raise guidance more?
Is that out of an abundance of caution? Or have things gotten worse to the point where you don't feel
comfortable doing that yet?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Well, look, we're pleased with what happened in the first quarter both in terms of sales and how much of
that fell right through the bottom line. But just to take you back, remember at our investor conference in
December, where we laid out guidance for all of 2021, we said it was assuming 3 things. And that was that
we get through the winter months, that vaccinations get widely administered and that hospitals remain
open. And when we got to January, in our earnings call in late January, it felt pretty bad. I mean we felt
like things have probably, on the margin, gotten worse, not better, since our investor conference. But
here we are now having seen the results of the first quarter and we're feeling positive and still confident
about the guidance that we laid out originally in December. We think it's going to be choppy. It has been
choppy in the first quarter although there are certainly signs of strength, and it's the reason why we still
feel confident in the guidance that we've laid out for the second quarter and reiterating the guidance for
the full year.

One for Mike, one for Scott. First one for Mike. As the world begins to recover post-COVID, I'm curious
if you're seeing any changes with any referral channels. You talked about smaller centers outperforming
larger centers. Have you seen local docs help drive increased diagnosis of patients within their markets?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Pito. I think it's not fair to say that we've really seen meaningful changes in the referral
centers. One of the things we have seen though is -- and then we just hear this anecdotally, that patients
maybe are less likely to travel long distances to a center of excellence, and they're more likely to want to
stay local to their centers. And so that's probably been in there to some extent, probably driven some of
the behavior during the pandemic.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then for Scott, I get the cost will increase as travel and conferences begin to pick
up again as revenues begin to recover here. But if you can quantify how much travel conferences will
generally impact expenses throughout the year.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. We're not going to break down travel versus the other expenses, but note that there are a couple
of different drivers of our expectation that expenses increase. One is just actual travel and people out in
the field. Two is more training, more time going in-person to society meetings to the extent that those
start becoming more in-person. And then, of course, on the clinical trials, and we're expecting that
clinical trial enrollment will continue to increase. That's a number that shows up in our research and
development expense line item on our income statement. So those are at least some of the pieces that
will be influencing our overall expense ramp in the rest of 2021.

Jayson Tyler Bedford
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

No one's asked about the strength in surgical. And I realize there's a comp dynamic, but I can't remember
last time surgical grew faster than TAVR. So just a couple of questions on that. Can we assume most of
the strength was from international markets? Were there any stocking orders that impacted growth? And
you also mentioned growth was helped by premium products. Any way to parse out procedure growth
versus dollar growth?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So a few things. One is -- you're right. Surgical rates dropped pretty precipitously in late March. So
some of that is a comparable. So that should go into account. But actually, the U.S. was quite strong.
It certainly was comparable, if not slightly stronger than the global rates. And so I think it certainly was
broad globally, but the U.S. was good. And I don't know if that ended up answering the question.
