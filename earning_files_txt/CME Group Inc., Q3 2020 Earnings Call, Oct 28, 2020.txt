Presentation

Operator

Good day and welcome to the CME Group Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, I would like to
turn the conference over to John Peschier. Sir, please go ahead.

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to start with the safe harbor language,
and I'll turn it over to Terry and John for brief remarks, followed by your questions. Other members of our
management team will also participate in the Q&A.

Statements made on this call and in other reference documents on our website that are not historical facts
are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results
may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.

More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in our filings
with the SEC, which are on our website. Also, on the last page of the earnings release, you will find a
reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us today. I wish you all the best, you and your families,
during this challenging situation for many around the world. My comments today will be brief, as John
said, so we can spend the majority of our time directly addressing your questions.

We are -- we released our executive commentary this morning, which provided extensive details on the
third quarter. Also, as John referenced, I have John, Sean, Derek and Julie Winkler who are with me this
morning, and we all look forward to answering your questions.

We continue to see historically low levels of volatility in several of our asset classes, which began in the
second quarter. During the third quarter, we averaged 15.6 million contracts per day, down from 17.6
million contracts per day in the second quarter. We're fortunate to have a broad product portfolio.

During the third quarter, we saw strength in our Equity business. Our higher rate per contract Metals and
Agricultural products delivered volume growth in Q3, and FX volume recovered an average of 100,000
contracts per day, higher in Q3 than Q2. Our Market Data business during the quarter had exceptional
results, with revenue of $139 million, the highest quarter in our history.

We continue to launch innovative new products, and we have prepared for the cutover of BrokerTec onto
Globex later this quarter. We remain committed to achieving capital and operational efficiencies for our
clients. Clearly, the lack of volatility is impacting 2 of our largest asset classes, Rates and Energy. That is
the current reality, but not a permanent one.

We have intensified our efforts on the expense side, which is something we can control. As John will
discuss in a moment, we are reducing our 2020 expense guidance by $70 million from the initial guidance
we provided in February. Realizing we are in a tough environment, we also plan to deliver very strong
expense management going into 2021.

With that short intro, let me turn the call over to John to talk a little bit about the financial results.

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Thank you, Terry. With our strong expense discipline and the remote working environment, we finished
the third quarter with adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, of $386 million, down 6%
compared to the same period last year and down 5.5% year-to-date.

We are extremely focused on actively managing our costs, as Terry mentioned. This expense level reflects
the entire company effort to ensure that we are spending as efficiently as possible in the face of a tough
operating environment.

Our adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter is $1.38 and is $5.34 through 3 quarters, which is up slightly
from last year. Based on our outlook for the rest of the year, our guidance for adjusted operating expenses
for 2020, excluding license fees, is being reduced to $1.575 billion, down from $1.645 billion, which is the
midpoint of our initial guidance at the start of the year and down $20 million from our full year estimate
we updated last quarter.

Finally, we're bringing -- we're beginning our budgeting process for 2021, and we expect the intense
expense focus to cover or to carry over into next year. We recently let our employees know that we
are deferring promotions for now, freezing wages going into next year, and we are looking at other
opportunities to reduce discretionary spending.
With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Based on the number of
analysts covering us, please limit yourself to one question, and then feel free to jump back into the queue.
Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.

Richard Henry Repetto
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

You talked about the environment, the low interest rate environment, but you do have this migration
cutover in the fourth quarter. So I guess, Terry, besides the savings that you expect from it, I'm just trying
to get a better idea of what you think the behavior changes, like whether you've sort of got a better feel
for the margin savings. And could we see a change in behavior from it?

And also, I know there's some new regulations from the SEC out on treasury trading platforms and
whether that -- recognizing them as ATSs. Will that have any impact on BrokerTec and cutover?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thank you, Rich, and I hope you and your family are well. I'm going to ask Sean to comment. But
before I do that, I'll make a few remarks as it relates to what I perceive as potential behavior changes as
the platform comes on to Globex.

I am, like everybody who runs the organization, very excited about having BrokerTec onto the Globex
platform to deliver the efficiencies that we've talked about when first to made the announcement of the
transaction. I don't think you can underestimate the value of cash and futures on a single platform. So we
really -- against a liquid platform like futures because we've never seen it before.

So even though the rates, as we've discussed, are in a very disappointing place as far as the Fed policies
go, it doesn't mean that people will stop managing their rates. We're still continuing to see a tremendous
amount of issuance going. Especially into the long end of the marketplace, we're going to see that.

And we are excited by the BrokerTec integration onto that. So the behavior, I've heard a lot of positive
things from the client base as how they're looking to manage risks.

As it relates to the other questions around the SEC and others that you asked, I'll ask Sean to make
a comment. But behaviorally, I think that the participants are excited about having this single point of
contact to manage that risk.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Terry, this is Sean jumping in. Can you hear me?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes, go ahead.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. So I'll jump right in then. In terms of the migration to Globex, I'm very excited about the Globex
technology. Customers are very excited about the Globex technology and the significant increase in
determinism that it offers to our client base. In addition to that, I'm very excited about the functionality
that we're going to have available to us on Globex for BrokerTec cash markets that wasn't available
previously on the previous technology.

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

In particular, I'm very excited -- we do plan on launching shortly after we migrate BrokerTec to Globex.
We will launch something called RV or relative value trading. This, for the first time, will allow curve order
types. It will allow you to trade the spread between different securities, so simultaneously buying and
selling different securities such as 2s/5s, 5s/10s, 10s bonds.

By doing that, actually, there's a number of different values that will be added to the market first. You'll no
longer have to leg those spread trades. We believe that 10% to 15% of the treasury market is probably
done in curve trades, although, today, on BrokerTec, they are done as legged individual trades.

So first, you'll eliminate that legging risk. Secondly, by putting in a spread order type, we're going to have
that spread order type at a much tighter minimum price increment than outright contracts. Third, we're
going to use implied functionality on Globex that has been extremely successful in our Eurodollar futures,
for example, where when you have an outright order, let's say, 2-year notes and you've got a spread order
in 2s versus 5s, that then implies an outright order in 5 5-year notes.

So we're very excited about it. Reducing risk in the trade, lowering the cost of the trade and enhancing
the overall liquidity of the platform, so we are very excited about that. I might mention a couple of other
things that we're investing in at the same time.

Another platform we are investing in on the EBS side is something we call QDM 2.0, or quote-driven
markets 2.0. This is a brand-new technology, state-of-the-art technology, that will allow us to have much
faster round-trip times and much better technology overall for the bilaterally traded foreign exchange
market.

So we're equally excited about that. We do expect that to be fully rolled out sometime next year. We
have begun rolling it out now. Last, maybe I'll mention before stopping. We're also very excited about
new analytics that we are able to deliver to clients, having both the cash and futures platforms that Terry
mentioned earlier.

So next week, we're going to be launching a new tool on our EBS Quant Analytics platform. EBS Quant
Analytics is a total cost to trade or a transaction cost analysis for the foreign exchange market. It currently
allows you to look at the bid offer spreads and the depth of book in the bilaterally traded market on EBS
that were -- using your current chosen liquidity providers, it allows you to look at all of the other liquidity
providers that you're not currently using. It also allows you to look at the central limit order book.

So we're in the process of adding futures to that analytical tool. In particular, we're going to be adding
something called Market Profile. So this will show the great value of having both the futures liquidity
pool and the cash liquidity pool, and it will show you the advantages of, and really, the need for anyone
who transacts globally, to trade in both liquidity pools in order to minimize their overall costs. So we're
very excited about all of the technology investments that we're making and the growth that, that should
provide the platform.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Sean. Rich, hopefully that gave some color to how we feel about the migration and the cutover
and the behavioral issues. I think your other part of your question was around the SEC. And Sean, did you
touch on that?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. I apologize. In terms of the SEC, the new regulations will -- in terms of Reg ATS on cash market
platforms, we already adhere to most of the regulations. There are a number of platforms that do not.

So while there are exemptions for U.S. treasuries, certain exemptions under SEC rules for U.S. treasury
platforms, since, historically, BrokerTec traded Canadian government bonds as well as mortgages, NEX and
BrokerTec did not take advantage of those exemptions. So while there may be some new adherence that is
required, BrokerTec generally already adheres to the rules that we expect to be required.

Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

My question is on market data. Obviously, a good quarter. You highlighted subscriber growth and kind of
some of the demand trends. Can you talk about the kind of -- the type of customer that's the incremental
subscriber here? And maybe the momentum or outlook for this business as we think about heading into
next year -- 4Q and into next year, please?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Julie?

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Sure. Thanks for the question. Yes, we had a great quarter in Q3, revenue up to $139 million. And that
was -- the majority of that was driven by higher subscriber counts for that real-time data.

And so what we're seeing there is that, as many firms are continuing to be in a work-from-home
environment, it is necessitating additional access to our real-time data. We're also seeing good demand,
though, for our data being used in automated trading solutions as well as more usage of CME data into
the inputs into other financial products and services. So I think it's largely driven by this work-from-home
environment, but still continues to be strong.

I think as we look forward, we are definitely focused on integrating the data that came over from NEX as
well. We're continuing to build out our cloud-based distribution capabilities. We talked last quarter about
CME SmartStream.

And we've been pleasantly surprised there, I would say, about the interest from customers for that. It has
exceeded our expectations. And I think there, it's about the scalability of putting data into the cloud, it
being much easier for customers to access. And so we continue to have a good pipeline of clients coming
into that.

And we're also continuing to work on strengthening our market data policies and pricing and also the
enforcement related to the activities. And lastly, working on our benchmark business, and that includes
our participation in the ARRC SOFR term rate RFP that's due later this month.

Operator

Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just quick one on the expense side. One, obviously, you saw the updated guidance. I think it assumes a
little bit of a 4Q increase. So maybe just talk about that, the seasonality there.

Then, but more importantly, maybe this is a little bit early, but as we think about 2021, can you just
remind us how much savings you had this year from COVID, i.e., lower T&E, et cetera, that you expect to
come back next year? Obviously, the timing is uncertain, but any -- how should we think about kind of like
savings that you had that will not recur next year because of COVID?

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Alex. This is John jumping in. Yes, Q4 has a historically higher level of spending. Marketing spend,
some of which is contractual, has been deferred from the start of the year, and it's picked up in Q3. And
we anticipate an increased spend in Q4, but still at a significantly lower level than the annual spend last
year.

We also anticipate additional expenses associated with systems being put into production, associated
with the migration onto Globex, and with the data center consolidation efforts and the build-out of our
New York, New Jersey data center. So based on the current forecast, I would see -- I would expect to see
depreciation and the other cost line as the biggest changes from Q3. However, we will still continue to look
for additional synergies and cost reductions throughout the Q4.

In terms of next year, it's a bit early in the process, and we're in the budget development process now.
But the entire organization has done a tremendous job over the years in managing our costs, and we
expect to do the same next year. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've already taken action to
manage our expense growth in 2021. Our objective is to be diligent managing our costs, but to be flexible
should the environment change and opportunities present themselves.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Let me just add to what John said, Alex. You raised COVID and what do -- how much did we save for 2020
through COVID, and what do we think 2021 is going to look like. I think that is still to be decided because
we're only on one side of that trade. We can't just be sending people all over the country or the world if
other people are not receiving them.

So it will all depend on jurisdictions abroad and here in the U.S. about how meetings are to be taking
place. So I am anticipating our travel schedule will be light again in 2021. And I'm going to encourage
more people doing things from Zoom to make sure that we can realize those cost savings.

So I can't give you an exact number, and we are evaluating it now. But I do think it's important to realize
that we do need to be in front of some people, and there's others we don't. So we will make sure that we
achieve those savings as it relates to the travel.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.

Jeremy Edward Campbell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wondering about that new water contract with NASDAQ that you guys have said to go live in
December. Just wondering, did this new product kind of bubble up from potential users? Or are these
potential future users a little different from your current user base? Just kind of wondering if this could
be the start of a user base expansion and/or product development around other natural resources or
renewables going forward.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Sean, you want to talk a little bit about the agreement with NASDAQ and the water futures contract?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Sure. We were very excited, obviously, to extend the license with NASDAQ last year. And the growth in
NASDAQ futures have been a very big success this year. In addition to that, and as a part of that contract,
we have access to other indices that they offer. And we extended out to the Veles Water Index.

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

We are excited about growing the customer base. We do believe that this will have an interest by large
industrial users, so manufacturers as well as farmers. I would say farmers are already customers of our
products.

Nonetheless, we do believe that municipalities, farmers, industrial firms will be, in some cases, new
customers for these, or potentially new customers for these products. So we are excited about it in terms
of the product launch itself, innovative new products. But yes, it could lead to an expansion and should
lead to an expansion of our customers.

I don't know if Julie Winkler would like to comment on it at all? Sorry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Sean, Julie will, and I will as well. Go ahead, Julie.

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

I think, yes, it's a good point. I think in addition, right, to the water contract, this fits within this broader
context of ESG products. And the philosophy we're working with our clients around on that is that
there's a suite of products that are completely new -- that Sean just talked about that are new. They're
innovative, and they will help customers and their firms meet their very aggressive carbon goals over the
longer term, while we have another set of initiatives continue to modify and make enhancements to our
existing contracts, which may be things like certificates or ESG wrappers.

And so we've got a pretty robust program in place, doing product development around ESG since, from
the broader scope of things, ESG investment is really picking up. And at the start of 2020, it was virtually
the only class of funds that we're seeing investment inflow. And so it's a major topic of conversation with
our clients, primarily driven, I would say, in Europe but increasingly in the U.S. as well as APAC.

So we've got existing asset managers, banks, hedge funds all showing a lot of strong interest, which is
why you're starting to see those products roll out from CME Group. The cornerstone of that is certainly the
S&P ESG 500 contract. That is going to be the foundation of what we build everything around. And again,
this is client-driven and certainly investment-driven. We do believe that will help attract new customers.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

And just to add to that, Jeremy. I've been around a long time, and we've -- I've heard nothing about other
than why don't you have a water futures contract. And I think it was really another catalyst for a water
futures contract, until some of the things that Julie referenced under the ESG program. And to manage the
risk of water going forward could be something that we've never seen before.

So we are excited by the partnership with NASDAQ to launch this contract. We think, like a lot of things,
it's all about timing. There's a lot of great ideas out there with bad timing. We think that the timing is right
on this because, as some of the things that Julie referenced, when you look at the makeup of the globe
today, especially the earth, it's 80% water, most of it is undrinkable.

That is not a good equation for the environment that we're seeing today. People are going to need to
manage that risk, and we feel that we're the predominant place to do it. So we're excited to work with
NASDAQ and for the companies that Julie just outlined in order to bring risk management to something
that's critical to each and every one of our lives.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Great. Just wanted to go back to the integration to -- on the BrokerTec to Globex platform. The -- just
both from -- John, if you can remind us of the cost saves that we would expect in the 1Q '21 run rate
versus 4Q '20 or even 3Q '20 from that integration.

And then on the revenue side, basically, just a big initiative of this has been potential revenue synergies.
And Sean, you talked about the ARRC -- the value curve. Any way to kind of size what potential increase
in interest rate volumes you think you might be able to get over the next, say, year from having this
relative value capability launched?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. Thanks. I'll take the first part and then toss to Sean on the revenue question. We're very
pleased with the progress we're making with the integrating of the business onto Globex and our synergy
capture. As a reminder, we overachieved our run rate synergy capture last year when we targeted $50
million and achieved $64 million.

We're on track with the migration with -- I'm sorry, we're on track with the achievement of our expense
synergies. We are targeting $110 million run rate synergies by the end of 2020. So a $46 million increase
in our run rate synergies.

And also, as we mentioned previously, we anticipate exceeding our 2020 realized synergies from an
anticipated $15 million to $25 million. So ended the year last year at $64 million, end the year this year at
$110 million, so a $46 million increase.

In terms of what we've realized in our income statement, we targeted $15 million. We're going to achieve
$25 million. So real pleased with that. And it's been an entire company effort.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Sean to talk about the revenue side.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Thanks very much. In terms of the revenues, I'm not going to give any specific guidance in regards to
revenues. But I'm very excited about several different initiatives that we have available to us, with the
migration of the cash markets over to Globex as well as combining the advantages of having both the
derivatives and cash markets under one roof.

We are making several adjustments to the offering. First of all, we got the new technology, greater
determinism and new trade types that will be available on that new technology, which we're very excited
about. We're going to be offering new analytical tools, which will show the benefits of trading both cash
markets and derivatives markets. And we're adjusting some of the existing products in order to make
them more attractive, all in regards to trading greater efficiencies.

At the same time, we are also working closely with the DTCC in order to bring to the market, further
down the road, increased or enhanced portfolio margining or cross-margining between futures and cash
products. I've already spoken about the new trade type, the new RV trade type, that we'll be launching
shortly after we migrate to Globex. So we are very excited about that.

I did mention earlier as well, we are launching next week a new analytical tool that will allow participants
on the EBS analytics or quantitative analytics to have synchronized cash and futures data for the foreign
exchange market, showing top of book, depth of book and really guiding participants as to the best
liquidity pool to use in regards to executing whatever they need to execute, in whatever size they need to
execute, in whatever currency they need to execute. We're very excited about that.

The EBS Quant Analytics, just for background, has about 600 users globally. About 300 users logging on
each and every day. These are regional banks across the U.S., but in particular, Europe and Asia. And this,
for the first time, will allow them to see the value quantitatively of using both sets of products in their risk
management. So we're very excited about that in terms of our cross-sell. We will be, next year, launching
similar analytics for the treasury market.

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

I'll also maybe mention 2 additional things that we will be doing. We're going to be lowering the minimum
price increments on the 3-year notes in the first quarter. As you know, that had a significant positive
impact on 2-year notes when we did it both on the cash platform as well as on the futures platform now
almost 2 years ago.

So again, we're adjusting existing products. We're initiating new trade types. We're offering new analytics
and new technology. I mentioned earlier that we are in the process of rolling out something called QDM
2.0 or quote-driven markets 2.0 for the EBS platform, in particular, for EBS Direct. This will make it a
state-of-the-art direct trading platform. And we do plan next year on rolling that out as well for U.S.
treasuries.

So we're very excited across each of the different initiatives that we've got planned, I'd say, for the next 3
months, but also the next 12 months.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And just to be more precise on timing, the timing of the cutover on the platform integration in the fourth
quarter and then the timing of the RV curve launch in 1Q.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. The RV will be available as soon as it's on the Globex platform, but we'll probably do a significant
launch in Q1.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And just the timing of the cutover, is that November or December?

We are doing Europe in November and the U.S. in December. That's what's currently planned. Yes.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Brian, Julie is going to give you a little reference on the other part of the -- Julie?

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. So in Q3, just to give you guys a little bit of an update. It was another quarter where we completed
more than 500 cross-introductions. And so that has put us over that 1,000 cross-introduction mark for the
year. FX is -- continues to be the franchise kind of front and center on those, but interest rates is second
there.

But what I wanted to talk a little bit about is how -- as we've been able to now convert many of those
cross-introductions into sales opportunities, with 150 new sales opportunities in our pipeline and also
realizing some wins from that. And so that's when we actually see and have proof that our clients have
started to trade those new products and those services.

So some few specific examples, to your question, is we've been able to bring a repo trading desk, so
those are legacy BrokerTec clients, onto our CME Direct platform. And there, they are beginning to trade
our listed interest rate futures and options franchise. Another relevant example is cross-selling across a
number of customers that were legacy BrokerTec clients and introducing them to SOFR futures.

And so these are the types of things that we can do as a combined sales organization, in conjunction
with the technology changes and migrations that are happening behind the scenes that we believe will be
fruitful and continuing to bring new revenue into the exchange.

Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Given just the muted backdrop, further strained energy complex, with the Fed on hold and the COVID
situation, just curious if you're starting to see more interest in certain categories given some hints of
inflation. And then based on past periods, what may be some of the early signs of seeing demand picking
up?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

John, or Derek?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I'm sorry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Hang on, John, there. I'll let Derek go first, and then I'm going to make a comment or 2, and then we'll
get it to you.

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes. Just to be clear, Mike, you're looking for kind of catalysts to demand side of the equation in some of
these markets?

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. And mostly -- I mean, we've seen the pressure with the Fed on hold, but I'm just saying, you kind
of see some hints of inflation and how that could potentially maybe spur more activity, whether it's on
interest rates or energy, just because those are typically correlated.

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes. So I think I'll probably pick up on 2 pieces of that. I mean maybe I'll start on the -- what we've seen
in the metal side. I mean the gold market has been probably one of our fastest-growing markets this year.

If you actually look at the growth of that product, that's been global, it's actually been largely driven by
the growth that we've seen out of Asia as well. And that's been both a function of gold and precious metal
demand, i.e., being a store of value, certainly in times of uncertain inflation times. Going directly back to
the comments that we've heard from the Fed that, that's opened the door to inflation. We've seen that
push build up through 2000, and that's been a global demand story for us.

If you see from the materials we put forward on the summary sheet, you'll see a range of records that we
hit over the course of the quarter. In fact, in a very quiet Q3, we set a series of all-time records in precious
metals, led by both gold and silver. So we've seen a significant increase in demand on that side of the
equation as prices have gone up, and that's been a strong participation across commercials, buy-side,
retail and our sell-side customers as well.

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

What we're really excited about is the -- resulting from that, as we've seen more focus on precious
metals, just about 11 months ago, we rolled out, through the clearinghouse, a system by which we
allow customers to bring forward gold collateral or gold warrants and post those as collateral to the
clearinghouse.

And why that's important is because, in less than 11 months, Mike, we've seen $3 billion of capital
efficiencies brought forward for our clearing members, whereby they can use gold warrants, which is
typically a set of debt assets on balance sheets of banks to be used to actually bring forward and put
capital forward to make trading available in all of our asset classes.

So as we talk about -- one of the things we're doing in light of creating a monetizable set of assets for our
customers, providing $3 billion of effective liquidity for our customers to be used across all of our asset
classes, I think, is a really strong story there, another way in which we're focused on the client benefits in
an uncertain market, where we're seeing growth in different parts of the franchise.

So with that, I'll turn it over to Sean or, in fact, to Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Derek. Before we go to Sean, Mike, let me just make a couple of comments about the rate
business because I do think they're important. And I think a lot of us forget because of the policies that
have gone on over the last 7 to 8 months during this pandemic.

But if you look back just a year or so ago, we had a 10-year trading over 3% on the yield. The markets
have moved dramatically during this pandemic. And I think people lose sight of how quickly things can
change. I'm not saying they're going up, but I think you have to look at a few of the catalysts that are in
front of us.

One of the catalysts that I see in front of us, and I'm not predicting markets, but I will tell you, there's a
possibility of this, when we're looking at November 3, and when we do not have a President-elect come
November 3 for a projected period of time, the government still needs to go through its processes of
auctions and things of that of treasuries.

The question will be what will people be willing to pay for those auctions, not knowing what the makeup
of our government could potentially look like. So you could see some -- a lot of uncertainty around the
marketplace. I'm not just reflecting on the price of equities, I'm looking at how people perceive the price
of debt coming out around -- from around the world out of the United States, if we go into this contested
election process.

The 10 years' trading, roughly -- the yield on the 10 years is roughly 0.75% today, and so it's down
dramatically just over 14, 16 months ago. So I do think on the rate story, there is something here that
people need to be cautious about, and I'm not predicting that it's going to change dramatically. But I do
think there's factors in the market that could make a swing. So those are the things that I'm looking at,
and we are managing from a business perspective.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

So Terry, maybe I'll -- Terry, do you want me to jump in maybe some green shoots that I'm seeing?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes, go ahead, real quick.

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Yes. So I think we already know, massive increase in treasury issuance this year by the U.S. treasury
relative to the increased funding needs and the $3 trillion deficit this year, record -- all-time record to
deficit, all-time record debt, and we're approaching an all-time record debt to GDP. So massive increases.

In terms of the Federal Reserve and its longer-term intent to increase inflation, we are starting to see
green shoots further out the curve. So specifically to your question, if you look at the month of October,
because of the year-over-year growth month-to-date, the ultra tenure is actually up to 3% in terms of
its average daily volume. The bond futures are up 10% in terms of their average daily volume and the
ultra bond is up 20% in terms of its average daily volume. So we are starting to see, as we would expect,
further out the curve, increases in activity relative to this environment, that should, over time, move down
the curve.

Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point.

Christopher John Allen
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to revisit expenses. Specifically, the guidance for fourth quarter, that implies about a $40
million -- for the full year, I'm sorry, it implies about $40 million sequential increase in the fourth quarter.
Normally, you see a bump in marketing and other, but a lot of that's driven by your conference, which is
not occurring. So just any granularity around that increase?

And then on the build-out of data center and trading platforms, just kind of wondering what's onetime in
nature? What's going to be into the run rate for next year? And how much of that is going to be offset by
some of the savings as you shut down some of the BrokerTec and EBS over time?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Chris, this is John. I'll jump in on that. Yes. So as I mentioned previously, what we've seen is a
pushout of our marketing spend from the first 2 quarters and part of the third quarter into the back half of
the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And some of that marketing spend is contractual in nature.

So you are correct that there -- our customer-facing events that we normally have in the fourth quarter
have been postponed. Some of -- but some of that spend that we have in marketing is contractual and is
-- got pushed into the later half of the year.

Also, as we migrate onto Globex and as we build out our data center, we are expecting -- that goes into
work in process. And then when it gets turned on, it goes into depreciation. So where you're going to see
the increase in spend relative to those items are in depreciation and in our technology expense as we have
to pay maintenance on some of the third-party software and on the equipment. So that's where you're
going to see the cost go up into next year.

Now what comes out is going to be the synergies that we have targeted for 2021. And we've got the
majority of the synergies in terms of run rate synergies impacting next year. So we expect to end the
year with run rate synergies of $110 million, and we expect to end next year with $200 million in run rate
synergies. So our cost base would go down by that additional $90 million.

Now the amount that we would realize in 2021, we're still in the process of determining through our
budgeting process. But we have a very -- as Terry indicated, a very strong focus on our expenses going
into next year, and we'll be looking to accelerate synergy capture where we can in 2021. So that's what
you should expect, Chris.

In terms of -- if you take a look at our employees that we have now and the amount of employees that
have been notified that they will not be -- that they'll be leaving by the end of the year, I would expect
that to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million of increased costs that we are avoiding next year.

Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.

Kwun Sum Lau
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Could you please comment a bit of your conversation with your clients about the VOLQ futures? Is there
any demand for other derivatives products around VOLQ in the future? And then quickly on the sales
force, your client engagement has increased quite dramatically. What does it take to monetize that
engagement and drive higher open interest and trading volume?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

So it's Terry. Let me just comment real quickly on the VOLQ futures. That contract was just listed in
partnership with NASDAQ. We are excited by that potential of that contract. But I think it's very early in
a launch to try to predict how the success of that contract is going to be. We've all been around a long
time, and we've seen how long certain contracts take to nurture. And again, timing is a big component of
anything that you do in this business.

So it's really hard for us to draw any conclusions around the VOLQ futures. Sean can give you a little bit
more color, if you want. But I know there's quite a bit of interest from clients on both sides, buy and sell
side, around that product and how they can use it to offset or mitigate some of the efficiencies as it relates
to some of our other products in the equity space.

So that is one of the benefits that we have here with our suite of equity products today to potentially get
more savings as the open interest starts to build. But until then, it's really hard to draw a conclusion on
that product just yet. And the second part of your question was what?

Kwun Sum Lau
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

It was about the sales force. I think your client engagement has increased by over 100%. What does it
take to monetize that engagement and drive higher open interest and trading volume?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And we won't -- we'll -- we've answered the VOLQ question, Julie, so let's just talk about the sales
force.

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. We've -- thank you for the question, Owen. We've had a busy Q3, as you mentioned. Client
engagement was up about 145% versus the same period last year. And so what we're seeing previous to
other quarters when we've still been in this work-from-home environment is that, that activity is being
driven by increased client calls, e-mails, these virtual meetings, the cross-sell introductions that I talked
about earlier.

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

What we've been quite busy on in Q3 is actually supporting VOLQ and a number of other new products.
And so we've executed a number of high-profile sales campaigns, the Micro E-mini options launch, the
3-year treasuries, Brazilian soybeans as well as we've had hundreds of client calls to prepare for the
successful SOFR basis swap option -- auction that we had earlier this month.

So I think in terms of monetizing that, clients continue to point out to us just the attentiveness,
responsiveness that the team has shown throughout this environment. And a lot of these ongoing
initiatives are there to deliver, not just innovative new products, but also efficiencies.

And the other number I'd just point to is this is an environment where people are capital constrained.
And so when you look at what we've been able to deliver for our clients in terms of portfolio margining of
swaps and futures, today, already in 2020, we've saved our clients $5.4 billion on average, and that's up
from $4.5 billion last year. And so as we continue to deliver those efficiencies and help them manage their
risk, and we believe that's going to be quite helpful in helping them and us navigate this uncertainty.

Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I was hoping we could talk a little bit about dynamics in the WTI markets and recently softer oil trends.
And what, really, I'm trying to get to, I guess, how much of that is related, you think, to sort of lower
volatility, which is obviously outside of your control versus maybe some of the lower production we're
seeing in the U.S.? So any way to kind of help us frame volumes kind of directly related to U.S. producers.

And bigger picture, if we get a blue sweep election, and that results in any sort of incremental curves
on U.S. oil production, how does that impact CME's franchise? I understand the difficulty sort of putting
numbers around that, but just a framework of kind of how oil production translates to oil volumes to CME
would be helpful.

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Alex, this is Derek. Great question. When you look at what's going on in the oil market, effectively, for
the last 4.5 months, what we've been looking at is the market finding a short-term equilibrium between
supply and demand. In August, we saw prices drift higher kind of the 41, 42, 43 level. There were the
agreed OPEC cuts. You saw decline in oil stocks in Cushing and globally, actually, and a weakening dollar.

Now counteracting that is the fact that we still have not come out of the demand destruction mode we've
been in with COVID. Whether you look at the metric of miles driven, if you look at jet fuel demand, I
mean, it's still down 75%. You're just not seeing a return to normal economic activity.

You see it in our own activity. We're not globally traveling. I think we're probably representative of a lot of
firms out there. So the small upticks you've been seeing that would put pressure upwards are being offset
by the demand side of the equation.

So you're effectively looking at a market that's trading in a $4 band. I'm talking about global crude. This
is true of WTI. It's true of Brent. It's true of Murban in the Middle East. We're talking about roughly a $4
trading range. We got a flat forward curve and they get a $2 spread and a stable strip between WTI and
Brent right now.

So these are impacts, I think, as to the point of your question is. If you look at the impact of the global
demand side of the equation, it is equally impacting global oil. This is not a U.S. phenomenon. We are
certainly down on U.S. production. I think we're down from the peak of 13 million barrels a day, down to
about 10.5 million, 11 million.

We haven't necessarily seen exports trail off that much. We were trailing at around 3 -- between 2.5
million and 3 million barrels a day of global exports. That has continued, today, a demand source and

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

a growth driver, where we're seeing domestic production on the WTI side, global demand for Brent has
slowed across the board. So when you see that, we see this as a global impact across all markets.

If you look at the market share from a volumes perspective, year-to-date or even this quarter, we're
seeing CME. If you look at the world of market share of CME, WTI plus ICE Brent, we continue to maintain
roughly 55% of that traded volume. We continue to maintain 45%, 46% of the open interest. That's sort
of the average for about the last 2.5, 3 years. So there's an equal impact across each of these businesses.

So I think the core of the question is, where do we see demand to return? And how would that be
reflected in our volumes? Well, one of the issues we've seen is when markets go slow, you start to trade
sideways. The reality is we've got a superior distribution out into the financial players of the energy
market, whether it's the -- specifically, the hedge funds, buy-side asset managers, retail clients.

So typically, volume pulled back, we see a little bit of underperformance on the WTI side. Now that,
we see as a temporary situation. So as we result in demand returning, we'll likely see that we'll be a
participant in the upswing in volumes globally.

But I think one of the issues that we see in the energy market is natural gas. While it's been negative for
the crude oil market, natural gas is a market where that's really the strength of our portfolio. If you look
at this business, not only is it up, this is the high RPC business that we have. It's $1.15 RPC in futures. It's
$1.52 RPC on the options side.

And actually, when you look at the Henry Hub market share of this business, our volume year-to-date,
our Henry Hub futures business is up 26%. Our options business is up 56%. And why this is important,
it continues to highlight the global nature of Henry Hub as a global benchmark. And that's shown by the
fact that our -- over the course of this year, our non-U.S. volume participation in Henry Hub is up 82%, a
116% growth in Asian hours of our Henry Hub options futures market, and our European business is up
69%.

So within the energy complex, as a whole, we're trading sideways in crude. We're seeing significant
growth in the high-RPC nat gas business. And so we're likely to see that continue.

And finishing, then I'll turn it over to Terry, from a reg side, while you might see some unknown pressure
relative to the fossil fuels business, if you look at the role that natural gas has to play as a clean energy
and an alternative, we see that continuing to grow. So we think we're in a good position there, given the
fact that we own 82% of that market.

With that, I'll turn it over to Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

So let me talk about a couple of things, especially when it comes to a potential blue sweep because I
find this quite interesting on the production side. Let's do a little quick history. Remember who lifted the
ban on the oil export business? It was President Barack Obama's administration. That was just a one-off
administration that go -- that did that, a democratic administration who is very supportive of making sure
that the EU and United States of America will be an oil exporter.

So the rhetoric around politics today, which is always associated around green, this is a great topic. And as
you can see, the democratic nominee's having a little bit of trouble with some of his past comments versus
his current comments as it relates to fracking on some of the eastern seaboard states.

So that doesn't surprise me a bit. I think what you'll see is -- I'm looking for more low-hanging fruit, when
I say that taxes are low-hanging fruit. Now I'm not saying it's going to be corporate or personal or both,
but that will be low-hanging fruit that I think that probably a blue sweep administration will try to address.

Trying to address the production on energy at the Obama administration just supported the first time
in the history of this country to lift a ban on exporting of oil seems to be a bit of a stretch, and I'm
assuming some of the Republican colleagues will remind their democratic friends about who did this and

18

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

why it's important to the sanctity and safety of the United States of America. Now that could change as
Washington always does. So I wouldn't put too much stock into that either.

But I really believe a lot of this is political rhetoric right now. It's going to -- things are difficult to get
done. We've only seen 3 major pieces of legislation in the last 19 years in D.C. So we had Sarbanes-
Oxley. We had Dodd-Frank. And we had the President -- ACA Act. That's it. Everything else is continuing
resolution.

So I think this will be difficult at best. And even the oil -- lifting of the ban was done through a continuing
resolution bill to keep the government open. So you can see how there will be plenty of ammo for people
who want to support energy production in the United States to have arguments against their democratic
colleagues.

That doesn't mean that some of the ESGs and other things that Julie referenced aren't still going to be
front and center and people are going to be doing things. But in the short term, I think it would be very
difficult on destroying the production of oil here in the United States until we have a viable alternative that
the rest of us can use. You can't have 2% of the automobiles be electric, and the rest of us don't have the
ability to get them. So I think it's quite fascinating with the conversation on politics, but I wouldn't bank
on that for the next 12 to 24 months.

Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The Democrats are proposing changes to the tax code, including the doubling of the dividend tax rate for
the wealthy, which, according to the Federal Reserve, own about 50% of stocks in mutual funds in the U.S.
Were the dividend tax to be doubled, as proposed, how would that impact your thinking on the payout of
nearly all your excess cash to shareholders in the form of a dividend? And does your capital management
strategy make as much sense in a much higher dividend tax environment?

And then, I guess, related, in 2012, you brought the payment of your annual recurring dividend to the
fourth quarter when there were concerns over changes to the tax code. If the tax outlook changes after
elections next week, would you again consider pulling forward that payment into the fourth quarter?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

So Ken, it's Terry Duffy. Obviously, your question is very speculative in nature because no one knows. But
on the potential of people trying to tax dividends, I really believe, as I said in my prior comments, I think
they will look for other ways to get tax incentives.

When you look at dividend-paying companies, these are stocks that are traditionally held by the base of
people who voted these people into office. These are not the high-flying stocks of the 5 or 6 banks' stocks
or others that they might be potentially thinking they're going to get a massive revenue off of.

I think it will be very difficult to take a proposal on doubling a tax dividend going forward. I just don't see
that. Again, it would be very surprising to do so.

That being said, our return -- capital return policy will be flexible enough to make certain that we can
return capital to shareholders in the most tax-efficient way that benefits the bottom line of the holders. So
we've talked about share repurchase programs over the years. I'm not suggesting that we're going down
that path right now because we don't even have one in place.

It doesn't mean we can't. It doesn't mean we can't do a lot of other things on how we return capital. But
we will not look at returning capital as the most -- highest-taxed dividend -- on dividends possibly going
out there. So -- but again, I think that is a very difficult proposal for the Democrats in order to raise those

kind of taxes on dividends. I just don't see it happen because it won't affect the companies that they're
trying to affect.

Our next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities.

Simon Clinch
Atlantic Equities LLP, Research Division

I was wondering if you could just flesh out, with the collateral savings, that of $5.4 billion, I think it is,
that you've saved your clients this year, could you give us a sense of how your clients redeploy that
capital? How that might have happened historically and how you'd expect that going forward in terms of
spreading that across -- into other areas of your business?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thank you for that, Simon. I'll ask maybe Sean and then Julie to comment a little bit, and John,
also, if he'd like. Sean, do you want to talk about that?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Sure. I think it's difficult to quantify exactly how much gets redeployed into our marketplace. But we
certainly do see it as making us a much more attractive platform relative to alternatives.

One of the things actually that we're very excited about that we're starting this week is we're starting
to test portfolio margining of Eurodollar options against interest rate swaps. This is going to be a new
portfolio margining opportunity, new facility that we're very excited about, in addition to the current
portfolio margining between interest rate -- sorry, interest rate futures and interest rate swaps.

So we have seen a huge growth, I'd say, enormous growth in both the amount saved as well as the
number of participants taking advantage of it. And we do see, when we offer new portfolio margining
opportunities, that our relative growth to other platforms tends to increase. This is not the only area
where we are looking at efficiencies.

So we've also, for example, a little over a year ago, we introduced compression of our listed equity options
business. We're very excited to say that we've run 27 compression runs since we started it a little over
a year ago. And we've reduced the number of contracts outstanding, which increases efficiencies for our
customers by $8.3 million.

So we're constantly looking at creating new efficiencies for our customers, whether it's the equity
business, the rates business. I'll actually maybe mention on the foreign exchange business. One of
the things we've done over the last year is massively reduced the, across the board, minimum price
increments in our foreign exchange futures. We've also lowered them in the roles for our foreign exchange
futures. This saves participants costs in terms of when they execute the roles and when they trade our
futures.

We're very excited to say that, recently, we saw all-time open interest record in our EUR/USD futures.
We saw an all-time record loans held by asset managers, according to the CFTC in our FX futures. And
we're excited to see the growth in the products and the growth in the use of the products from the greater
efficiencies.

So those are some examples. Where -- when we provide these efficiencies, we do see growth. But hard to
exactly quantify the portfolio margin and its impacts on revenues. I don't know, Julie, do you want to jump
in?

CME GROUP INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

So on that point, I think what's really hard to do, it's hard for us to quantify, for sure. But what we have
seen, historically, and the multiple billions that Julie referenced earlier, actually, it's a little bit north of the
$5.4 billion because there's other part in the swaps market that they achieved benefits as well.

We have traditionally seen them deploy a lot of that capital into managing risk into a whole breadth of
asset classes that we have here at CME. And again, that's a historical perspective, but it's really hard for
us to quantify on a day-to-day basis of how they're deploying that capital. But that's what historically
we've seen.

Great. And I was wondering if I could just follow-up with one question, just a more housekeeping one.
But in terms of looking at the revenue per contract for -- across your different segments, I think pretty
much [ all of them ] ticked lower on a sequential basis. And I know there are lots of moving parts there.
I was wondering if you could help me think about -- how to think about the revenue per contract going
forward, particularly for things like the interest rates as they shift towards those longer-term contracts,
and in those areas where you've got the E-mini -- Micro E-mini futures, which are sort of skewing number
as well.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. Thanks. And John -- before John does it, do you want to -- [indiscernible] good. Okay. John, go
ahead.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thank you, Simon. Great, great questions. So what you see in our rate per contracts, really, is a mix
issues. The [ face ] rates don't generally go down. So it's really a mix of products, a mix of customers, a
mix of venues. So there's multiple different mixes that happen.

And what's great about our business is that we've got an enormous number of products, many different
customer types. And as markets shift and change, different products are used and different customers
utilize those products. So that's what you see, generally, in our rate for contract. They tend to all be mix
related.

So in terms of your 2 specific questions, when you look at the long end of the curve versus the short end
of the curve, generally speaking, the short end of the curve or the Eurodollars tend to be about 14% lower
than the average for interest rates. And treasuries tend to be about the same -- higher than average in
the interest rate quadrant so -- or asset class. So that's kind of the mix there. So heavier -- higher RPC on
the longer end, less on the shorter end.

In terms of the micros, the micros have been tremendously successful across -- primarily across our
equity asset class and our metals asset class. In terms of our equities, sequentially, they grew to almost
2 million contracts a day for the quarter and represented about 36% of the total equity volume in Q3
compared to about 34% in Q2. And also, the RPC for micros increased from $0.125 in Q2 to $0.132 in Q3.

So in terms of equities, in particular, in addition to the performance of the micros, we also saw a higher
proportion of member trading activity as well as a lower proportion of [ EXP ] and BTIC trading activity,
which has a higher RPC.

I do want to hit on something that Sean touched on before, and that's the impact that we're seeing on the
NASDAQ trading. And really, that's really helped our RPC in equities as the NASDAQ trading was up about
24% sequentially, which -- and they have -- the NASDAQ contract has a higher blended RPC than average.

So a couple of other points on RPC as it relates to equities. As I mentioned, the micros, RPC increased
to $0.132 in Q3, and that's up from $0.078 from Q3 last year. And if you take a look at the equities,

excluding the micros, that increased to $0.749 in Q3 versus $0.712 the same quarter last year. So both
the micros and E-mini RPCs increased compared to last year. So again, it's a mix story.

In metals, you're also seeing something similar in terms of the RPC. And metals was our best-performing
asset class sequentially for CME Group. It's up 59% sequentially. A key factor when taking a look at
the RPC, again, which made modeling difficult for you, analysts, and that was the increase in the micro
activity. The micros, again, has been very successful in metals and are approaching 160,000 contracts a
day, and it was up over 110% sequentially.

So micros has accounted for about 19% of the total volume this quarter versus 14% in Q2. And the micro
gold RPC for the quarter is approximately $0.32, net up from $0.27 in Q3 last year. So that's a big impact
relative to mix shifts in metals. But very, very pleased with our micros. Been very successful. And again,
to your point on the RPCs, it's really a mix stories.

And our final question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.

Kyle Kenneth Voigt
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Just a question on pricing really quick. You made a number of pricing adjustments over the past several
years in the futures business. But I also think, in the past, you've stated that typically these pricing
adjustments come during periods of volume growth. Just given the volume headwinds you're facing this
year, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about pricing for futures more broadly, and whether you still
see the potential for pricing increases or adjustments in certain products as we head into next year.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

It's Kyle, it's Terry, and I'll let John comment as well. Obviously, you're correct. We try to make sure that
we have a value-added proposition anytime we use any type of tier changes or pricing changes associated
with our business. That does not prohibit us from other business -- parts of our business that are growing
to take advantage of price increases.

That being said, we will be very mindful of the overall situation, and we will -- we always take pricing into
effect with many factors, whether it's fundamentals in the marketplace, not only here in the United States,
but globally. But we will be very steadfast as it relates to our pricing and how we feel what is appropriate
going forward.

It's challenging. It always is. I'm not going to lie to you saying that pricing is easy to take advantage of.
But at the same time, I've been always of the mindset, and I've said this historically, that we need to bring
a value -- I'd say this to my clients, we need to bring a value-added proposal when we bring in pricing
changes.

And I think when you look at what's going on with the BrokerTec integration and the EBS to follow, these
are all pricing -- these are all the things that are enhancing the experience for the client. So we will cross
that bridge when we get to it. And -- but we won't forgo them. But at the same time, there are many
factors that go into it.

John, do you want to comment further?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, just a couple of quick points. Terry is right. I mean we take a lot of time and put a lot of thought
into our pricing plans. First, we're going through the budgeting process now, and that's a time when we
really take, again, another hard look at our pricing. But really, what's absolutely critical is we want to have
as much velocity going across the platform 24 hours a day. That increased liquidity is beneficial for us,
obviously, because we earn money for it.

But also, that liquidity is very valuable to our customers, to Terry's point. So it tightens that bid-ask
spread. It makes our offering that much more attractive. So we're very careful when we pull the pricing
lever. We take -- we look at things on multiple dimensions to make sure that we create a really good and
robust marketplace for our clients and, really, with the eye of not impacting and enhancing our liquidity.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Kyle, just to add on to that, and I don't want to belabor it. But we're in a -- probably just 7 or 8 months of
the strangest just time in the history of our country or of our world. So to try to put up a pricing strategy
that makes sense during normal times is a little bit difficult. So as we continue to get on the backside of
this, we'll continue to evolve. And hopefully, our -- we'll see a change in the way our business goes.
