DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to Darden's Fiscal Year 2021 First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] The
conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn
the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you so much.

Kevin Kalicak
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Analysis

Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me
on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO.

As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are
described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call,
which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.

Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these
measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2021 second quarter earnings on
December 18 before the market opens followed by a conference call.

This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business
highlights, and then Rick will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the
second quarter.

As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated KNAPP-
TRACK, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. During our first fiscal
quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 26%.

Now I'll turn the call over to Gene.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.

Given the ever-changing environment we continue to operate in, I am very pleased with what we
accomplished during the quarter.

We are focused on 4 key priorities: the health and safety of our team members and guests, in-restaurant
execution in a complex operating environment, investing in and deploying technology to improve the guest
experience and transforming our business model. The progress we made in these areas, combined with
our operating results, gave us the confidence to repay the $270 million term loan and reinstate a quarterly
dividend.

Let me provide more detail on the 4 priorities. First, the health and safety of our team members and
guests remains our top priority. Following CDC guidelines and local requirements, our teams continue
to practice our enhanced safety protocols, including daily team member health monitoring. We also
continue to configure our dining rooms for social distancing to create a safe, welcoming environment while
maximizing allowable capacity. A key part of this work is installing booth partitions to enable us to safely
increase capacity where permissible. At the end of August, we had completed installation in just over 500
restaurants in our total portfolio.

Operating in this environment adds another layer of complexity to an already complex operation, and I'm
proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Second, we are laser-focused on our "Back to Basics" operating philosophy to drive restaurant-level
execution that creates great guest experience, whether that's in our dining rooms, outdoors on our patios
or in their homes. But it's not easy. Executing at a high level is more complex today due to COVID-19
restrictions that vary by market.

Additionally, the constantly changing mix between on-premise and off-premise, plus expanded outdoor
dining that is weather-dependent, leads to unpredictability in sales. This is why the work we continue to
do to streamline our menus and improve our processes and procedures is so important.

Removing complexity from our operations has allowed our restaurant teams to execute more consistently
in this unique environment. Our operators continue to deliver great guest experiences by displaying a
high level of flexibility, creativity and passion every day, and I'm thrilled to see that reflected in our guest
satisfaction metrics.

Third, we are continuing to invest in and implement technology to remove friction from the guest
experience. This includes providing multiple ways for our guests to order inside and outside the restaurant
across our digital storefronts. Additionally, we are deploying mobile solutions to make it easier for
our guests to let us know when they have arrived to dine or pick up curbside order to go. We are
also expanding mobile payment options, providing additional convenience for our guests. For our 3
largest brands combined, more than 50% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital
transactions where guests ordered and paid online.

Finally and most importantly, we transformed our business model. Even with the sales declines we're
experiencing, our restaurants continue to produce high absolute sales volumes. Therefore, we made the
strategic decision to focus on adjusting our cost structure in order to generate strong cash flows while
making the appropriate investments in our businesses. This provides us a stronger foundation for us to
build on sales as sales trends improve.

The first step in this process was to reimagine our offerings. This resulted in simplified menus across the
platform, driving significant efficiencies in food waste and direct labor productivity. Additionally, due to
capacity restrictions, we significantly reduced marketing promotional spending, along with other incentives
we have historically used, to drive sales. We will continue to evaluate our marketing promotional activities
as the operating environment involves.

Finally, we have further optimized our support structure, which is driving G&A efficiencies. The results
of all these efforts to transform our business model can be seen in the fact that we generated adjusted
EBITDA of $185 million for the quarter.

Turning to our business segments. Olive Garden delivered strong average weekly sales per restaurant of
$70,000 while significantly strengthening their business model, resulting in higher segment profit margin
than last year. They were able to capitalize on simplification initiatives that strengthen the business model
while making additional investments in abundance and value. This work was critical to position Olive
Garden to drive future, profitable top line sales as capacity restrictions ease.

Olive Garden same-restaurant sales for the quarter declined 28.2%, 220 basis points below the industry
benchmark. Overall, capacity restrictions continue to limit their top line sales, particularly in key high-
volume markets like California and New Jersey, where dining rooms were closed for the majority of the
quarter. In fact, restaurants that had some level of dine-in capacity for the entire quarter averaged more
than $75,000 in weekly sales, retaining nearly 80% of their last year's sales.

Given the limited capacity environment during the quarter, Olive Garden made the strategic decision to
reduce their marketing spend as well as incentives and eliminate their promotional activity. They will
continue to evaluate their level of marketing activity as capacity restrictions ease.

Additionally, off-premise continued to see strong growth, with off-premise sales increasing 123% in the
quarter, representing 45% of total sales. Thanks to technology investments we continue to make, online
sales made up almost 60% of total off-premise sales, more than tripling last year's online sales. Finally,
Olive Garden successfully opened 3 new restaurants in the quarter, which are exceeding expectations.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

LongHorn had a very strong quarter. Same-restaurant sales declined 18.1%, outperforming the industry
benchmark by 790 basis points. This strong guest loyalty and operational execution helped drive their
outperformance, while they also benefited from their geographic footprint. In fact, same-restaurant sales
were positive for the quarter in Georgia and Mississippi.

Additionally, the LongHorn team made significant investments in food quality and operational simplicity,
which led to improved productivity and better execution. They also took a number of steps to improve
the overall guest -- the overall digital guest experience. Off-premise sales grew by more than 240%,
representing 28% of total sales. Finally, LongHorn successfully opened 2 restaurants during the quarter.

The brands in our Fine Dining segment are performing better than anticipated. While weekday sales
continue to be impacted by a reduction in business travel, conventions and sporting events, we saw strong
guest traffic on the weekends, and believe there will be additional demand as capacity restrictions begin to
ease.

And lastly, our Other Business segment also delivered strong operational improvement with segment profit
margin of 12.8%. This was only 130 basis points below last year despite a 39% decline in same-restaurant
sales. Yard House's footprint in California is impacting same-restaurant sales in this segment.

Finally, I continue to be impressed by how our team members are responding to take care of our guests
and each other. We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage, and I want to thank every
one of our team members. We are succeeding, thanks to your hard work and resilience.

Now I'll turn it over to Rick.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. The encouraging trends and performance we experienced
toward the end of the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter of fiscal '21. Furthermore, the actions
we took in response to COVID-19 to solidify our cash position, transform the business model, simplify
operations and strengthen the commitment of our team members help build a solid foundation for the
future. These actions and our continued focus on pursuing profitable sales have resulted in strong first
quarter performance that significantly exceeded our expectations.

For the quarter, total sales were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 28.4%. Same-restaurant sales decreased 29%.
Adjusted EBITDA was $185 million, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.56.

Turning to the P&L. Looking at the food and beverage line, favorability from menu simplifications more
than offset increased To Go packaging costs. However, beef inflation of over 7%, primarily impacting
LongHorn, drove food and beverage expense 20 basis points higher than last year for the company.

Restaurant labor was 20 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor as a percent of sales improving
by over 350 basis points, driven by operational simplifications. This was mostly offset by deleverage in
management labor.

Restaurant expense included $10 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to COVID-19
claims submitted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding this benefit, we reduced restaurant
expense per operating week by over 20% this quarter.

For marketing, we lowered absolute spending by over $40 million, bringing marketing as a percent of sales
to 1.9%, 130 basis points less than last year. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin was 17.8%, 20
basis points below last year, but particularly strong given the sales decline of 28%.

General and administrative expenses were $10 million lower than last year as we effectively reduced
expenses and rightsized our support structure. Interest was $5 million higher than last year, mostly
related to the term loan that was outstanding for the majority of the quarter. And finally, our first quarter
adjusted effective tax rate was 9%.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

All of this culminated in adjusted earnings after tax of $73 million, which excludes $48 million of
performance-adjusted expenses. These expenses were related to the voluntary early retirement incentive
program and corporate restructuring completed in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Approximately $10 million
of this expense is noncash, and the remaining will be cash outflows through Q2 of fiscal 2022.

This restructuring resulted in a net 11% reduction in our workforce in the restaurant support center and
field operations leadership positions. It is expected to save between $25 million and $30 million annually.
We expect to see approximately 3/4 of these savings throughout the remainder of fiscal '21.

Looking at our segment performance this quarter. Despite a sales decline of 28%, Olive Garden increased
segment profit margin by 110 basis points to 22.1%. This strong profitability was driven by simplified
operations, which reduced food and direct labor costs as well as reduced marketing spending.

LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining and the Other Business segment delivered strong positive segment
profit margins of 15.1%, 11.9% and 12.8%, respectively, despite the significant sales decline experienced
in the quarter. These brands also benefited from simplified operations, keeping segment profit margin at
these levels.

In the first quarter, 68% of our restaurants operated with at least partial dining room capacity for the
entire quarter. These restaurants had average weekly sales per restaurant of $69,000 and a same-
restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. And while Olive Garden and the Fine Dining segment had fewer dining
rooms opened than our average, these restaurants had the highest average weekly sales per restaurant of
almost $76,000 and $90,000, respectively. At the start of the second quarter, we had approximately 91%
of our restaurants with dining rooms open, operating in at least limited capacity.

Now turning to our liquidity and other matters. During the quarter, as we saw steadily improving weekly
cash flows, we gained confidence in our estimated cash flow ranges. We fully repaid the $270 million term
loan we took out in April.

We ended the first quarter with $655 million cash and another $750 million available in our untapped
credit facility, giving us over $1.4 million (sic) [ $1.4 billion ] of available liquidity. We generated over $160
million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 59% at the
end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of below 75%.

Given our strong liquidity position, improvements in our business model and better visibility into cash flow
projections, our Board reinstituted a quarterly dividend. The Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.30 per share. This dividend represents 53% of our first quarter adjusted earnings after tax within our
long-term framework for value creation. We will continue to have regular discussions with the Board on
our future dividend policy.

Our first quarter results were significantly better than we anticipated. The actions we took to simplify
menus and operating procedures and capture other cost savings, along with our choice to pursue
profitable sales, have yielded strong results. And now with the full quarter operating under this
environment, we have even better visibility into our business model.

For the second quarter, we expect total sales of approximately 82% of prior year, including approximately
100 basis points of headwind due to the Thanksgiving holiday moving back into the second fiscal quarter
this year. We anticipate EBITDA between $200 million and $215 million and diluted net earnings per share
between $0.65 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 131 million shares.

In this environment, we continue to focus on building absolute sales volumes week-to-week and quarter-
to-quarter. This may result in variability in sales comparisons to last year as capacity constraints lead
to less seasonality than we would have experienced historically. Said another way, if capacity and social
distancing restrictions remain similar to where they are today, it will be challenging to dramatically
increase our on-premise average unit volumes.

Our second quarter is typically our lowest average unit volume quarter, and our third quarter is typically
our highest. Additionally, as capacity restrictions ease and sales normalize, we will be able to reinvest to
drive the top line and a better overall guest experience.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

One last point before we take your questions. Based on our strong business model enhancements, we now
think we can get to our pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales while still
making appropriate investments in our business.
And with that, we'll take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO.

Andrew Strelzik
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

In the press release, you mentioned on the execution that it was better than expected. I'm curious if you
could just kind of dig in a little bit there more specifically, either by brand or by cost bucket.

And subsequently, how sustainable are some of the cost improvements? If you can maybe give a sense for
how much better you think margins could be if you were to get back to, say, 100% of the prior sales.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

I'll take the execution part, and I'll let Rick talk about the margin piece. I think a lot of our execution is
coming from the streamlined menus. And our ability to put out product with increased frequency of that
product is helping our execution, and our team members are becoming much better at doing that.

When you limit your menu and you focus on key products, the quality of that product just continues to
go up. And I also think it transcends itself into the dining room. And I think, today, we've gotten used to
the complexity of operating with the COVID requirements. And every day, I think we're running better and
better restaurants. Rick, do you want to talk about the margins?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Andrew, I'm going to start with the 90% number that we gave a second ago. We have made
improvements in our cost structure, as Gene has mentioned, and significantly improved our business
model.

As sales improve, remember, we assume that some of these costs will come back, but not all of them. The
90% contemplates some costs returning, along with continued reinvestments. And the 90% -- well, the
90% sales level may change depending on the competitive environment and the economic backdrop. Now
I will say that if we get to 100% and we make some investments, as we've been talking about, we could
see margins improve by 100 basis points, maybe even 150. But again, that depends on the economic
backdrop, the competitive environment and what do we have to do to get to that 100%. So I wouldn't tie
in the 100% to 150%, but I would at least get into the 90% based on our EBITDA -- I'm sorry, getting our
EBITDA back based on 90% of sales.

Andrew Strelzik
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Great. And if I could just squeeze one more in. I'm just curious if you think you've seen at all any
impact from stimulus tapering off, if you've seen that or any other kind of regional or daypart differences
that you've also seen. If you could comment on that, that would be great.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

No, we've seen no falloff with the stimulus. Actually, we're seeing average weekly sales across the system
improve every single week. So we're feeling pretty good about that.

So we're seeing some restrictions be eased throughout the country. So really nothing from a regionality
standpoint. I think you just got to look at the mobility index. And you've got to follow what's happening
with restrictions, and you can see guest traffic move along with that.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies.

Andrew Marc Barish
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just wondering on the kind of comments on on-premise dining and sort of driving same-store sales
performance from here. What would it take to, from a capacity constraint perspective, help that number?
Can you do more booth partitions? And just the impact of seasonality, starting with the outdoor patio
business as well, just try to level set on all those areas.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Let me work backwards to your question. Outdoor capacity is really de minimis for us overall as the
system. The good news is that we haven't really been able to use it, a lot of our outdoor capacity in
Florida. It's been raining every single day here for the last 6 weeks. So we're going to start getting that
back. As we lose outdoor capacity up north, we'll pick up a lot more in Florida than we've been able to
use. So for that, that -- when we think about outdoor capacity, it's really not that meaningful for us.

As far as what's going to drive, in the short term, some more same-restaurant sales is additional capacity.
We need to get California back. We need some other areas to increase the capacity from 25% to 50%.
Once you get past 50%, as long as the 6-foot rule's in place, you're still not going to really be able to
really max out your dining rooms. In some areas, we're getting our bar tops back, which are important to
give us more capacity inside the restaurant.

And so I think it really comes down to just the incremental improvements in the capacity levels. We're
going to probably continue to roll out booth partitions. We'll probably close to double what we have right
now. That gives us 6 to 7 extra tables for restaurant in the jurisdictions that allow us to do that. Not every
jurisdiction allows us to do that.

I think that our teams are being very respectful of the requirements in their operating environment. And
we're trying to create, first and foremost, a safe environment for our team members and our guests. And
we're not trying to push same-restaurant sales and risk that experience at all for our team members and
guests.

So I look at -- I would look at getting -- getting California back is big in Olive Garden. We've got 100
restaurants there.

Andrew Marc Barish
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And just a quick follow-up for Rick, if you could. I mean, the same-store sales and the total sales
gap in the 1Q were basically on top of each other. The 18% reduction in total sales, is there a same-store
sales analog for the 2Q we can kind of point to in terms of a gap?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's pretty close. It's not like we have a lot of new restaurants coming into play. So it's within 100
basis points.

Kevin Kalicak
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Analysis

Marcella, we're ready for our next question.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Nicole Miller Regan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

When I look back to Slide 16 of the presentation, can you speak to the capacity in the first quarter? What
was the average? Was it higher or lower as you exit the quarter? Because that can help us kind of inform
and understand the capacity in 2Q. I know 90% -- 91% are open, but I'm wondering what kind of capacity
mandates or restrictions you're dealing with.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Well, most of the capacity restrictions are around the 50% range, 50% capacity. Some are 100%. But
if you average out our company, when you take the 6-foot rule, et cetera, we're probably at the 50%
capacity range even at the end of the quarter.

Nicole Miller Regan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Okay, super. And then it's not lost on us when you talk about the "Back to Basics," and I think
there's obviously no one better than your team at that. And it's the power of teams. So if you think about
the roles and the functions, for me, like the chief people officer role comes to mind, how are you really
resourcing your team to be effective right now? Can you give us some concrete examples?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think our engagement with our team members goes all the way back to the beginning of COVID. I
mean, it actually goes beyond that, but, I mean, I think how we've handled the situation with emergency
pay and taking care and staying -- taking care of our people and stay engaged with them and paying their
benefits, we invested over $100 million in that short period of time into our team members.

So bringing them back to work has been fairly easy for us. And I think our team members are really
engaged in what they're doing. And so we've had a strong culture for a long time. And our team member
retention is better than ever, which is really exciting to see.

I mean, I'm looking at retention numbers for our hourly team members that I never thought I would see
in this industry. I've been working in the industry for over 30 years. I've never seen retention like this,
which gives us the ability to execute at the highest level.

And as we bring people back to work, we're bringing back our most productive and our most dedicated
team members. So I think the spirit is high in our restaurants. I think people are excited to be out there.
They are making money. I think they're bringing happiness to people that come into our restaurants. I
think that energy is -- in this very difficult time is transferring between the guest and the team member.

And I'm in our restaurants every day. And I'm in one of our restaurants most every day, sometimes twice
a day, I would tell you that the attitude is just absolutely fantastic, and our team members are doing a
great job.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.

Brian John Bittner
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

When you talk about getting back to pre-COVID EBITDA levels on 90% of sales, can you just talk about
your working assumption on that relative to G&A versus pre-COVID in restaurant-level profits pre-COVID?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Well, Brian, I think on the G&A side, we talked about the EV -- voluntary emergency -- I'm sorry,
voluntary early retirement program. And that's going to save us $25 million to $30 million a year on a
rolling basis.

And we would expect G&A to start coming back up as we start getting travel, et cetera. We didn't do a
whole lot of travel in the first quarter. But most of our investments will be back in the restaurant as you
think about marketing spend and labor and other things.

So I would say that if you look at what we say in the 90% range, most of our investments will be back
in the restaurant. Our G&A -- we would hope our G&A would be at least below 5% in the -- for the
foreseeable future.

Brian John Bittner
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And would you ascribe all of LongHorn's outperformance relative to Olive Garden? Is that all
to geographical mix and the 6-feet rule? Or is there anything else that you'd point out as it relates to
LongHorn's performance relative to Olive Garden?

Eugene I. Lee

Well, I think the majority of it is geographic. And I think the brand strength in Georgia's been incredibly
impressive. And I think that it's just a market where there's a lot of loyalty to the brand.

I think the market, Georgia -- State of Georgia trusts LongHorn, and I think people are going to where
they're really comfortable. And so I do think that their consumer may be a little bit better off economically,
but, I mean, the performance is impressive, without a doubt, but it's being driven by Georgia. It's being
driven a lot by their footprint.

And my last question, just with Olive Garden, we talked a lot last earnings call about the capacity
restraints related to the 6-feet rule. Is there anything else -- if we stay in this environment for a
while moving forward, is there anything you are doing to improve the capacity based on the seating
configuration within that 6-feet rule that we should know about?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think we continue to add temporary barriers. I think this team continues to look at, how do you --
can you move a few tables in the dining room to improve the overall capacity? So I think they continue to
try to modify that.

I think the thing -- when you think about Olive Garden, just focus on the absolute volumes at $75,000 a
week. These are healthy, healthy businesses. And the off-premise business continues to thrive, which is a
place that we're going to -- we start putting some marketing back into that business. It would be focused
on trying to drive off-premise, not in-premise.

We just -- we continue to evaluate, what's the best way to go with that investment spend? When is the
right time to use it?

And so the other thing I would tell you is that this can probably be hard for you to believe, but we have
one restaurant that cost us 50 basis points in comps. That's the Times Square Olive Garden. And when
we start every single week, $300,000 in the whole from a comp store basis. We are going to get 25%
capacity back in Times Square on the 30th.

But that -- to me, that's you wake up every day and you're $300,000 short just in that one restaurant.
That's our best restaurant in the Olive Garden system. We do over $15 million there, and now we're doing
$2,500 a day.

And so you got some odd ball things. Getting California back is going to be huge. California is a big market
for us with high volumes. We have a higher check average. And we can see because we're starting to get
some counties back, and we can see the impact on that on a daily, weekly basis.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Co.

Andrew Michael Charles
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Question for Rick, and a question for Gene. The sales leverage on the labor line was quite impressive
during the quarter. I was curious. How would you categorize what you view as permanent savings from
the shift to online pickup and more streamlined kitchen operations and efficiencies versus maybe some of
the temporary improvements that will persist in 2Q from volumes that are below peak?

And then, Gene, you kind of talked a little bit about it, but just to hit it head on, the 100 partitions that
were implemented last quarter to improve seating capacity, I think you said you've doubled it. But curious,
what's been the learnings there? How has that helped? And is that a key unlock for you in terms of where
we are in this -- in the reopening? Or is that just something that's just a small tool?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Andrew, on the labor line, remember, we've got 2 components of labor. One is the hourly labor, which is
where we saw a lot of efficiencies; and the other one is the management labor, which is more fixed in
nature.

We would expect the hourly labor to not be as favorable going forward just because of training expenses.
We didn't have as much training in the first quarter, and we'll continue to -- we're going to start having
some training in Q2 and beyond. But as our sales pick up, our management labor should be leveraged a
little bit more than it was before.

So I think there was a question earlier on where we'd get to at 100%, and that 100, 150 basis point
improvement will mostly come out of labor and some cost of sales.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Andrew, on the partitions, depending on the restaurant foot layout, you're going to get 6 to 8 more
tables. And most of those will be 4 tops, and the average party's 2.3. So, I mean, I wouldn't say it's not
de minimis, but it's not meaningful. I mean, you're getting -- especially on the weekends, you're getting
another 2 seatings on those tables. So every little bit helps because we have the demand for those tables,
but it's not going to move this -- the top line significantly.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital.

Eric Andrew Gonzalez
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just on the promotional schedule, I think it's -- I think we're all sad to see that maybe Never Ending Pasta
Bowl is not being run this year. And I'm just curious, what needs to happen from a capacity standpoint or
a restriction standpoint for that promotion to make sense? And is there a limit, that whether it be 25%,
50%, 70% of dining rooms, reopen where it makes sense to have traffic driving promotions like that one?
And then like later in the year, is that a lever that you can pull and bring it back to drive people to the
restaurants?

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Yes. I think on those high-volume, high-traffic promotions, we're going to have to feel comfortable that
we've got pretty much 100% capacity unless the promotion -- unless we come up with promotions that
drive the off-premise -- and drive off-premise experience. When I think about marketing and the team
thinks about marketing, I think that we want to try to get far along as we possibly can through this crisis
or cycle and then fully understand what the competitive set's going to be, what the economic backdrop is
going to be. And then we'll figure out how to appropriately layer back in all our promotional -- marketing
and promotional activity and our incentives.

We think we can layer those back in smarter and more effective than we had them in the system before.
And now we're -- this is a terrible thing that we're going through, but we're trying to find -- okay, we're
trying to find positives in this to really rethink and how -- rethink we think how we go-to-market with our
businesses. And this is a once in a -- unfortunately, a once-in-a-lifetime option to be able to do things that
we probably couldn't do while we're -- where we were pre-COVID.

So I think long term, we're going to look at the situation and we'll decide when we layer in our best
promotional options. And we may have to reimagine and revisit some of those promotional options to our
guests, so that we can maybe do it at a higher-margin rate. There's lot -- we have lots of questions and a
lot of work to do around that.

Eric Andrew Gonzalez
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's really helpful. And then you mentioned in your remarks earlier that the off-premise mix is a moving
target. Can you maybe dig into that a little bit more and talk about what sort of the cannibalization rate
looks like as dining rooms reopen or maybe what happens when restrictions are put back in place?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. There's nothing concrete there because each market is behaving differently. And so when you see
restrictions change, and maybe your capacity goes from 25 to 50 in certain markets, those -- that volume
just switches from off-premise to on-premise. In other markets, it doesn't. It depends what's happening.

We believe there's a good percentage of our off-premise today is being generated by people coming
to the restaurant that can't get in because the wait's too long, and there's no place to wait inside
our restaurants. And so we think that those people have a tendency to just opt into the off-premise
experience. So we really can't quantify that for you because every market is different.

Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird.

David E. Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I have 2 questions. First, on the second quarter guidance, I just wanted to clarify the guidance on the
top line. Is that similar to how you're running quarter-to-date? Or are you expecting to see further
improvement as states like California start to open up?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, David, our guidance for sales for Q2, remember, it incorporates a 100 basis point headwind for
Thanksgiving. So we are running a little bit better than that quarter-to-date, but not by much. And so we
do anticipate an increase of about 10% on average weekly sales for quarter 1. It doesn't contemplate any
significant change in capacity restrictions, other than the ones that we already know, other than the ones
that have already been approved. But it also doesn't contemplate any significant change in sales due to a
second wave or a vaccine approval.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

So that we thought 82% was fairly prudent. It's slightly below where we're running today, but it does take
into effect the 100 basis point swing from Thanksgiving.

David E. Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then, Gene, I was wondering, just philosophically, how you think about what Darden might
look like as we exit the pandemic. And I guess, what I'm specifically wondering is, is it your goal to drive
the sales volumes back to 100% of where you were before the pandemic? Or do you think you'd take less
sales with a better, simpler operating model that's easier to execute?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

We take -- I want both. I want a simple operating model, and I want higher sales. And I think that we are
setting up for that because there's a few dynamics that are in our favor.

Number one, there's definitely been a capacity. There'll be capacity coming out of the system, and we
believe that we're well positioned to take share. And we think that the simplified operations will help us
improve execution. We'll get better throughput. And so we think there's a pathway to both higher sales,
better margins.

I think our teams have done an incredible job of reimagining almost every aspect of their business through
this, and I see a pathway to get there. We're -- I think Rick keeps bringing you back to the 90% only as
a way to communicate where we think margins are going to be at a future sales level. We're not setting a
target saying that we'd be happy with that. We see a pathway for our sales to get above that, and we see
a pathway for our margins to be above pre-COVID levels at that time.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.

Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. One follow-up and then a separate question. The follow-up just on the comments you made a
moment ago regarding your guidance for fiscal 2Q does not assume any second wave of reinfection. I'm
just wondering, as you think about it in the short term, what are you seeing with comps in markets where
there are spikes in infection rates, whether you see a step back or whether you see capacity pullback?
Trying to get a sense for the worst-case scenario if we were to see a second spike in terms of what you're
seeing thus far or what learnings you've had. And then I had one follow-up.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

So, so far, Jeff, we've seen no change in demand based on COVID levels in a market, unless capacity
restrictions change. So if you're -- your example, we're in South Florida, when we had the spike after the
4th of July, and the restaurant restrictions were very limited, we definitely saw -- we saw demand drop.
But that was not because of the consumer, it was more because of the restrictions the local municipalities
put on us.

We see a pretty resilient consumer out there. I know that's hard for you guys in New York to imagine, but
the rest of the country is not operating that way. And so I would tell you that what we're seeing is it's all
being controlled by the local municipalities that they're managing demand more than the consumer.

Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Interesting. And then the other question was just on the -- I think you alluded to it earlier in terms of
what the industry is going to look like and capacity going forward. So I'm just wondering, as you think
about the independents and the crisis that are all going through, what are you seeing thus far in terms

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

of, I guess, you'd call it permanent closures or the impact you see for the industry going forward, maybe
the supply demand imbalance or whether it's real estate availability or market share opportunity? Just
trying to get a bigger picture thought on what you're seeing thus far for the outlook for primarily the
independents.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think the independents have -- obviously have a tough time, right? And as we think about it, we
think somewhere between 5% and 15% of capacity will come out of the system during this, maybe a little
bit more, but a lot of people will get recapitalized quickly and get some of these boxes back open.

Obviously, that's going to benefit us in the short term and the long term. As far as real estate so far has
been one of the things that my hypothesis has been -- I've been a little bit off on. We've yet to see a
meaningful change in what we can acquire real estate at.

I thought that being one of the only bidders out there that we would see costs come down. I think we're
still going through the price discovery process on that, and we'll see how that plays out long term.

I've got to believe that we will benefit from availability and, hopefully, price. Availability is already there.
It's just trying to get to what we think the property is worth versus what the reader or the landlord thinks
the property is worth. So that's going to -- that will have some impact and help us grow -- get to our 2%
to 3% new unit growth over time.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.

John Stephenson Glass
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

One of the biggest -- 2 of the biggest shifts, I guess, during COVID, right, has been this growth in the off-
premise business across the industry, and second has just been the pickup in delivery -- not delivery, but
the digital business overall.

So could I first just talk about the off-premise business? How do you think you need to or do you need to
change the format of the restaurant or the -- or some other sort of structural change that you think that
can facilitate a better off-premise experience? Or is what you're doing kind of working and the operational
changes that are working? Or do you think there's more sort of either pick-up windows or some other
permanent changes to the way the restaurants are structured to facilitate that?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

That's a good question, John. I think that going into this that we did the majority of our pickup with
someone coming into the restaurant and picking up the food. We set up our process because we believe
and we have proved out that accuracy and on-time were the 2 most important things that the off-premise
consumer wanted.

Through this, we had to go to a different experience, which was we morphed very, very quickly to
curbside. And we -- what we've learned through this is that curbside's a better option. And that the
burden of on-time and accurate needs to get on us, and we need to have better systems to be able to
deliver the same level of accuracy that we were delivering pre-COVID.

And what that means is a lot of our restaurants were on a path to build better capabilities to handle the
in-restaurant pickup. And now, as we pivoted to curbside, the capabilities that we need to build inside are
different. The good news is that they're cheaper because they're really not consumer-facing. And so it will
cost us a lot -- cost us a little bit less to be able to create those capabilities.

But the technology and the expectation of the consumer is for our curbside experience, and we've taken
a lot of friction out of that experience over the last 12 weeks. And we're in the middle of really rolling

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

out some technology today to really make that experience a whole lot better as just that notification
when you're in our parking lot versus we had a very manual procedure that we had to implement in the
beginning of this. And eventually, we'll get the geofencing, and we'll catch up to what some of the bigger
retailers are doing.

So we actually think that there's a big benefit in this consumer shift because we're going to take all these
people that were in our dining room in our front door picking up food. And they will never enter our
building again, which makes it a better experience for our dining guests. So that's really the big change,
John, that has to happen.

And right now, we have the benefit of some of our -- having the extra space inside our restaurant that
enables us to stage some of this off-premise work. But as we gain more capacity, we will need to modify
some spaces and actually add some -- like in the long haul, we're going to have to bump out of the side of
the building to be able to handle this extra demand.

But I see it as all positive. We think we can do curbside much more cost effectively than we can do picking
up the food inside the restaurant.

John Stephenson Glass
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then just picking up on the second thread on digital. So you've got a significant amount of growth
in the digital business, particularly on the To Go business. What have you learned from that? Is this a --
are these different consumers, for example? Do you think about now your promotional -- your marketing
spend differently because digital has just grown so significantly as a channel?

And I am also curious being just your view on other brands have decided to use digital in various ways
through delivery as a way to expand the restaurant into other brands, adding products, adding new brands
that's specific to a category that doesn't relate to their existing brand. Is that a viable path for Darden?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

So there's 2 questions in there, John, and I'll get to the virtual brand in a second. The first question is,
obviously, the data is richer when we're capturing the data from our digital guests, which feeds into our
huge database and our ability to market to them. So we can figure out through that and through our
tokens that these are our off-premise guests only, and we can tailor all our marketing towards that guest
and towards that experience.

We understand what they are buying and what they want to buy. And so we can get smarter with that.
We were pretty smart prior to this. We just have more information today. And we'll be able -- our data
scientists will be able to use that and market effectively.

Let me just pivot to virtual brands. I'm shocked that it took this long to come up, but I'll be giving you
my take on this. Everybody around the room's very nervous right now, but I think people are in different
places, and they're trying to approach this and deal with this moment in time differently.

For us, this is not the right approach. We want to focus on brands that we've got 20-plus years and
hundreds of millions of dollars invested in trying to build. And we want to make sure that they're
executing at a high level. I think brands are going to matter, and I don't think you can -- I think brands
are developed over a long period of time around delivering a promise to -- a consistent promise to a
consumer. I think you have to have a functional need and an emotional need.

And I think that's what our brand builders have done for decades. And to get out on a digital platform and
try to do that, I think people probably do what they want to do. I'm not saying it's a good idea or a bad
idea. It's not for us. Brands are going to matter, and we think it's a distraction.

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. Wondering if you could talk about where sort of customer satisfaction scores are at the moment.
I think you might have alluded to it earlier, but kind of just based on some of the technology, the other
friction-reducing initiatives and maybe some of the other customer experience investments that you spoke
to, if you're getting credit for that, if you've seen a notable increase there and kind of to some extent how
that's driving some of your go-forward thoughts on share gains, et cetera. That's question one.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll be very clear. Our guest satisfaction scores are improving dramatically. So I want to put some
context around that, which is what we don't understand is, is it just the consumer expectations are maybe
different through this experience? So we're happy directionally where they're going, and we're happy
directionally where they're going compared to our competitors. But at the same time, we really -- we're
not patting ourselves in the back too much because this is definitely a different environment, and the
consumer feedback is different.

So we don't know what the expectations are. But we are very pleased directionally where we're heading
with our own internal and some of the industry stuff that we're seeing and how we're comparing to
competitors.

Dennis Geiger
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. And just kind of as a follow-up to that. No, it's not the biggest needle mover right now, but just as
it relates to Cheddar's and kind of any improvements that you've been able to make in this environment
and then whether that's resonating, just curious if you could speak to that at all. And more broadly, if the
current environment at all has -- and emerging from the current environment and your thoughts there, if
that changes at all, how you're thinking about future M&A strategy in any way. If you're able to speak to
that.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Okay. You guys are getting really good at getting multiple questions in one question. Now let's talk about
Cheddar's first, and I'll come back to thoughts on M&A.

Cheddar's is -- from a business model standpoint, Cheddar's has had the biggest transformation. The work
that John Wilkerson and his team have done has been transformative, and I couldn't be more excited
about directionally where they're heading.

Tactically, one of the biggest changes and one of the things that we had to really speed up was off-premise
capabilities. We had very limited capabilities going into COVID. We only had 2 phone lines going into most
of our restaurants. We couldn't even take the demand over the phone. We didn't have online ordering.

So the team rallied. This was supposed to be an initiative that was going to go all the way through fiscal
'21, really wasn't supposed to be fully operational to '22. They got together, and they've been able to real
quickly upgraded their phone lines. They have 4 phone lines coming in. We now have online ordering. New
packaging's being rolled out as we're speaking, and they've developed a native app that is actually getting
some pretty good adoption.

And so that piece of it has been really exciting that they've been able to move as quickly as they possibly
can. Their in-restaurant dining has held strong. They still don't have a huge, robust, off-premise business,
but we need to build that. It wasn't something that people thought of Cheddar's for, but we think there's
a big opportunity there. So I'm thrilled directionally with what they're doing and the transformation they
have made in their business model.

growth targets and our value creation metrics with the portfolio that we have. We believe there's great

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carril from RBC.

Christopher Emilio Carril
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So I just wanted to circle back to margins and specifically on Olive Garden. So the margins at Olive
Garden were particularly impressive this quarter despite the sales decline. So how are you thinking about
the margins for that brand longer term?

Obviously, as the marketing and potential reinvestment spend builds, that will create a drag. But how
much of the savings that you found do you think you can hold on to?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Chris, as we mentioned, Olive Garden's segment profit margin was 100 basis points better than last
year. We've got a pretty good improvement in cost of sales, partly because of the question I was asked
earlier about Never Ending Pasta Bowl. That actually drags a little bit margin for us. The cost of sales was
a little bit better. We improved our food waste significantly because of the operational changes that we
have made.

That said, a 22% margin on the sales levels they have, we're going to get -- we're going to start
reinvesting eventually. We've got marketing that was down about $20 million year-over-year for Olive
Garden. And as capacity starts to come back online as Gene mentioned, we will look at our promotional
cadence and our marketing cadence.

But 22% is a pretty strong margin. So I wouldn't anticipate us significantly getting better than that as we
continue to reinvest to get back to a point of getting back over 100% of our sales. Our goal is to drive our
sales profitably, and we have enough room to invest to drive those sales profitably.

Christopher Emilio Carril
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And then, Rick, in the estimate of recapturing pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at 90% of pre-COVID sales,
how does off-premise versus on-premise mix factor into that estimate? Does that contemplate higher off-
premise mix versus pre-COVID levels?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

It does contemplate higher off-premise mix in pre-COVID, but not significantly higher. I mean, as Gene
mentioned, Cheddar's should be higher. Olive Garden should be higher, and LongHorn Should be higher,
but we're not going to be at 40% or 50% of sales premise when we've got full capacity dining rooms.

As you -- as we open, as Gene mentioned, as we open dining rooms, we start seeing that To Go business
shift back in restaurant. But we still are -- right now, we're still retaining 60% of our peak premise sales.

How much higher do you think To Go sales might be at your big 2 brands after the COVID crisis? And I'm
wondering if you have any clues that you'd care to share in terms of informing that thinking, such as these
To Go sales being new customers or perhaps how that off-premise mix fades in the reopened states as
your on-premise rebuilds. And I have a follow-up.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes, David, my -- and I've got no empiric evidence to support this, but my theory is that once we open
up the dining rooms and, say, we get back to a normal environment, where we have concerts and
everybody's going to football games la-di-da, I actually think off-premise will dip down below where it
was. I think there's going to be a huge surge for on-premise dining.

I think people are tired of this experience. They'll utilize this experience right now. But when I talk to
people and when we do some research, people want to get back out and socialize. I do think then it comes
back. It comes back higher than where we were. I think our thought process is it's a little bit higher, but
not terribly higher. And it will continue to grow over time, as it has been.

But I don't think that this is some big change that we're going to wake up, and Olive Garden's going to be
doing 35% off-premise if we're going to concerts and having football games.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Wow, that's an interesting take. I wonder, just on the -- on -- and how you communicate with consumers,
you've obviously made a lot more connectivity digitally with those consumers. Are you going to advertise
less on TV after this is all over? Is this a source of margin leverage for you going forward?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

I think that we have to go back to -- and go back to what I said earlier. We have to understand what the
competitive set is. We have to understand what the economic backdrop is. We'll have to analyze how well
we can get to our consumer through television. We still believe that we can do that.

We participate -- still participating in the upfronts. We think it's a good mechanism for us. And that's
part of our scale benefit with Olive Garden, right? We can advertise on a national platform, and we have
some efficiencies. And I think that we will still use that in the near term, but it will all depend on what
the competitive set is and the economic backdrop. If we pull enough restaurants out, we may not have to
advertise for a while.

And as I mentioned earlier, Q2 is our lowest seasonal quarter, and Q3 is our highest. So it does take a lot
of increase in average weekly sales to get the same comp level Q3 as Q2.

But what we are going to do and what we continue to do is evaluate the situation as restaurants open,
as dining room capacity is open. I mean, as Gene mentioned, if dining room capacities don't continue to
expand, we still have some levers to pull on the off-premise side.

So that's what we will do. We will continue to advertise off-premise if it's what we need to do to continue
to build sales. But as long as we do that profitably, our intention is to grow our sales profitably from where
we are today. And so that's what we'll do. We'll continue to focus on off-premise. Now if dining rooms
reopen completely, we should see an increase in sales.

Patrick Lee Johnson
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

That's helpful. And forgive me if I missed this, but it sounds like menu simplification is -- it sounded
relatively permanent. And so I was wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on exactly the margin
improvement you're seeing from that initiative in particular. And then how do we think about, as sales
normalize moving forward a little further into the future, should we expect to see some adding back to
the menu and some additional complexity come back on? Or is this something you're thinking of just
completely permanent even as sales normalize?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, the biggest driver of the cost savings is waste. And that's menu. That's lack of promotional activity.
There's some other things that are influencing that.

I think that the challenge for the teams is if they need to add menu items to fulfill a need, can they do
that without adding complexity? I think they have -- I think in their calculus prior to this, there wasn't
enough weight put on the complexity of adding new menu items. There wasn't enough -- no one thought
about that.

And I think, today, that's the part of the thought process as they think about adding something. How do
we do this and make sure we maintain our productivity and don't increase our waste? So I think a better
way to say that is as we do menu development, it's going through a better filter today that I think will
have a long -- longer -- have a long-lasting impact on our ability to maintain these cost savings.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG.

Peter Mokhlis Saleh
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Great. Gene, can you just elaborate a little bit on where the cost savings are coming from for doing
curbside versus the in-store pickup? Is it cheaper labor? Or is it just less spend on CapEx in the store to
build out the area for pickup? Just trying to understand where the cost savings may be coming from.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's a technology that's creating it. It's no one taking the answer on the phone. We're dropping -- the
consumers letting us know when they're in the parking lot, and we're just dropping the bag in their car. So
there's just a lot less interaction there.

Just the cost is just purely productivity efficiency, thinking about a line of 5 or 6 people at a desk or at the
bar top in a restaurant waiting to get To Go versus having someone just pull up through a car and put a
bag in a trunk. That's where the efficiencies come, and technology's enabling all that.

Understood. Okay. And then just on fine -- the Fine Dining segment, I think this quarter, you guys
mentioned that the weekends you saw strength. I think that was also similar to what you saw last quarter.
Are you seeing any sort of change in consumer behavior in fine dining during the week? Or is it more of
the same?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think that obviously, we're missing the business travel and those types of dinners. So I mean, that
was a big part of capital growth. And especially in the essential business districts, you're always soft in
your suburbia restaurant during the week, and you made up for on the weekends.

I think when you -- just another interesting tidbit is that when you look at capital growth comps, you're
starting every week with over a $1 million shortfall just in the 3 restaurants in New York. We're doing
$3,000 a day there with our 10 seats. Those restaurants do well over $1 million a week.

And so you just -- there's just so much geographical differences in those businesses. We have some
capital growth that are performing fairly well, especially in suburbia. But I'm confident, as I see the sales
volume on the weekends, I know we're turning away a lot of people. And as soon as we can get a few
more tables, we can continue to grow that business. And I'm confident that they're -- I'm confident those
businesses are going to be cash flow positive going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett.

Jeffrey Daniel Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions very quickly. So what level of same-store sales
performance are you seeing in California? And if you don't want to get that specific, I'm just curious
potentially what the headwind for Olive Garden consolidated same-store sales are related to the California
partial closures.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Jeff. For the quarter, we were down somewhere around 50% in California. Now, remember, they were
open for a little bit of time, and then they reshutdown. But we are seeing some pretty good unit volumes
in California, and I was talking to Olive Garden more than any other brand.

But -- and as Gene mentioned, Yard House is significantly impacted in California, but we were down. And if
you take California out of Olive Garden, it's a 200 basis point swing for the quarter.

Jeffrey Daniel Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. And then as a follow-up, I think this was touched on earlier, but I asked you this in late June, and
I believe you guys said that there were about 10 to 15 restaurants that were posting positive same-store
sales even with that 50% capacity constraint in place or limit in place. Where does that number stand
now?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would -- what I would say is, instead of getting into individual restaurants, let's talk about a couple
of states. I mean, LongHorn was positive in Georgia. The entire system was positive in Georgia for the
quarter.

We have a lot more restaurants that are positive now than we did going -- earlier. The last couple of

contemplated in our guidance for Q2. And so I'd rather leave it at that.

Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from MKM Partners.

Brett Saul Levy
MKM Partners LLC, Research Division

When you think about the great job you're doing right now in terms of managing the hourly labor, when
you think about labor just overall, what are you seeing in terms of inflation, your ability to hire? And also
the integration of all of the different tests you've talked about on the technology front. You've spent a
lot of time talking about the customer facing, but what about on the operational side? And then just the
managing of how you're balancing the in-store and the off-premise, is it the same servers? Is it the other
front of house? You've had one of your competitors talk about how the off-premise transaction is an hourly
as opposed to a tip. So I'll stop there for now.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Well, Brett, you've got a lot in there. And that -- first, if you've got more, I can't wait. But let's talk
about hiring. Hiring is very local. There are different pockets of the country that are more stressed than
others.

I will make a global comment. So I've been amazed at how well the hospitality workforce was absorbed
in other areas during COVID. And so there hasn't been like this -- there's still stress in that environment.
We're still seeing -- we still expect wages to rise somewhere between 3% and 5% for the year.

As far as technology, technology goes, and the adaptation is easy today, right? And we're doing that. We
haven't done -- we haven't focused a lot on improving technology in restaurant. All of our stuff's really
been -- all of our effort has been focused on the consumer right now.

We do have some -- we will get back to some projects that will or modernize some of our tools in
restaurants that will hopefully help increase productivity. And as far as off-premise, I mean, we're using
for -- off-premise for us are tipped employees. They've got a higher average weight, but they do collect
some gratuities on their service.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

A follow-up on your commentary regarding industry closures. Are you seeing any noticeable difference? Or
do you expect to see any difference in the level of closures in states that reopened earlier or maybe urban
versus suburban markets? And how is that informing your future development pipeline?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think that the markets that have had the tightest restrictions are going to have the most closures
because I think that's where -- I think in some of these urban environments, they just don't have the
capital to hang on. I don't think it changes our development philosophy at all. I mean, I think good trade
areas are good trade areas.

I mean, we -- there's a lot of talk about migration out of some of the bigger cities. We'll see how that
plays out. I think that -- I think, eventually, we're going to have some really good opportunities to do
some work in Manhattan as an example.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

I think that it was very difficult from a cost standpoint pre-COVID to justify building more restaurants
there. But I think post-COVID, we might have some opportunities. So I don't think from a development
standpoint it has a tremendous amount of impact.

We'll continue to look. We know where we have holes in each brand from trade areas, and we're going to
try to fill them.

Lauren Danielle Silberman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And you touched on this a bit, but with regards to the Fine Dining brands and maybe the Yard
House as well, to what extent are these brands driven by tourism or large business conventions? And how
are you thinking about that recovery? And do you need some of these exogenous factors to return to a full
sales recapture?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Absolutely. We've got a bunch of Yard Houses tied to baseball stadiums and football stadiums. And LA
LIVE's our best Yard House in the system, and that's been decimated because of what's happening with
sporting events.

So yes, I mean, there's a few of our brands that -- a few of our restaurants that are tied to that. And
they'll come back. I'm a big believer that we know we're going to get back to normal. These are going to
be great restaurants. But for the time being, we just have to run them as efficiently as we possibly can
and do the best we can with what we have.

Your next question comes from the line of James Rutherford from Stephens.

James Paul Rutherford
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So a quick question on the capacity bottlenecks at Olive Garden specifically. And it seems like it would be
key to drive traffic at nonpeak times, and certain there's things you're doing around that, but are there
any kind of incentives you can do to bring people in during those shoulder periods? Or is it a situation
where you're really fully utilizing that capacity already during the off periods as well?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

No. I mean, I think that's something we face pre-COVID with, how do you increase your capacity at
certain downtimes of the day? I think that's a high-activity exercise with very low payout.

I think that one of the important things about our restaurant is that downtime to help you prepare for the
break between lunch and dinner is important, so you can get ready for dinner. I mean, there's parts of us
-- we have cycles in our business, and they're important.

I think we would -- I think that we've been very disciplined in this process to make sure that we're not
chasing what I would call this low-return activity. And so I don't think there's a whole lot there.

I do think that what happens is as your business starts to improve, especially midweek or early week, is
that your lunch lasts 15 minutes longer. Your dinner lasts 15, 20 minutes longer. That's important. Trying
to drive people into your restaurant 2:00 in 30 years I found that to be a waste of time and money and
effort.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I had a sort of a related question on that, and quick on Cheddar's. But on the capacity, I guess, as I think
about 50% capacity across the system, that seems pretty standard for a lot of restaurants. I mean, I
appreciate California's 50 basis points. That's sort of helpful. How should I think about 50% capacity per
se in Olive Garden versus maybe competitors? I guess I'm just sort of thinking, if you all go to this internal
reviews, a higher -- you just have higher than some indiscernible] capacity reduce incentives than last
year and maybe over 50% of the capacity begin. I guess do you have [indiscernible] how we think of that
[indiscernible] being delivery that we all know historically used -- have been more at capacity than most
of the other competition. I don't know if there are any numbers about that. And then, I guess, I'll get just
have a quick follow-up on Cheddar's, please.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Sara, it's Rick. You were breaking up quite a bit. So let me see if I got the gist of your question. I think it
was about most restaurants are at this 50% capacity level, but how does that impact Olive Garden versus
competitors?

And I think the way I would frame it is just average unit volumes. Olive Garden last year was probably
using a lot more of its capacity than some of our competitors were using at that time last year. And so as
we think about AUVs and think about the comp differential maybe even between KNAPP-TRACK, we think
that some of the impact is that while we're at 50% capacity today, and we were at 100% capacity last
year, we were using much more of our capacity maybe than someone else.

I think that was the gist of your question, but it was really hard to hear. And if -- I think you also had a
question on Cheddar's?

Sara Harkavy Senatore
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes. That was actually exactly my question, but I wasn't sure if you had any sense of what the average
capacity might look like for the industry. Just to help us sort of think through that.

But the real question on Cheddar's is you talked about off-premise. That had been sort of slow to turn. I
think we were starting to see some improvement in the comps, and then this -- the pandemic hit. Could
you talk a little bit about any kind of metrics? And maybe in particular, I think that's where you've seen
a lot of friction moving to. Is there any sense of, can you kind of quantify the [indiscernible] 150 basis
points. It's a pretty big [indiscernible] just a little bit more color on that.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Sara. Breaking up again. I think I caught most of it until the end. I think you were asking about the
impact for Cheddar's and how we've improved margins at Cheddar's versus maybe the rest.

And Gene mentioned -- I think that was your question. So Gene mentioned that Cheddar's had the biggest
transformation in our business model. On an hourly labor basis, we said we had about 350 basis points for
Darden improvement in hourly labor. Cheddar's was close to 3x that.

And so it was a very big improvement at Cheddar's in their margin structure because of the simplification
they did and the work they have done, and the fact that they went from maybe less than 5% To Go
sales to over 20% in a short period of time. And we think we'll continue to build that To Go volume, but
Cheddar's did make the biggest transformation in their margin structure, and we think a lot of that will
stick.

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

The question I had was back on the margin that is probably for Rick. I think you've talked in the past
about margins at Olive Garden above 20% at the level at which you reinvest. And I think you were there
-- right around there pre-COVID. And so as you think about the 100, 150 basis points of margin upside,
is that going to be spread relatively similarly across brands? Or I mean, do you think it overweights to the
LongHorn and other businesses, just given where the segment margins were pre-COVID?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Greg, yes, I think it overweights to other brands. I mean, we should still see a little bit of margin
improvement at Olive Garden just because the environment's very different today than it was pre-COVID.
I mean, I think a lot of brands are out there improving their margins in some way, shape or form with
simplification. And we just want to make sure our gap to the rest of the industry doesn't grow significantly.

But we do believe that Olive Garden will see a little bit of margin improvement from where they were
before. We just think that the improvement will come even greater in some of our other brands, Cheddar's
and some of our other brands in the other segment.

Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.

John William Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Gene, your answer to David Palmer's questions on off-premise is -- I think it's going to be like one of
the great discussed topics probably of this month. The question -- gosh, and thanks for the long call. It's
helpful for all of us. It's -- I would imagine it's nearly impossible to get a staffing model right just kind of
anticipating how customers are going to come back, what have you, especially with the amount of labor
hours that you took out of the store. I just wanted to see like how honed in that model actually is.

I mean, what are you kind of seeing in terms of the variations of margins relative? So are you having
too much labor at any point in time? So I can't imagine too little labor at any point in time where, gosh,
you're just not zapping the amount of customers that for whatever reason decided to come in at 5:00 on a
Tuesday that maybe could have led to some longer table times. They could have actually -- in some way,
actually impaired your ability to drive the traffic that you could have until that labor model gets more fine-
tuned.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes, John, I think for Olive Garden -- because we're not doing a lot of outdoor dining, we don't have the
capability there. That business is a little bit easier to predict. We've been -- the leadership of all of our
business is erring on the side of more labor than less. And we're tracking number of servers per restaurant
per day, trying to understand as the business starts to grow, making sure that we have the appropriate
staffing.

Where it gets more difficult is in some of the Yard Houses, where we have some -- a lot of outside dining
that didn't have any covers. And if it starts to rain, if it doesn't rain, I mean, that's where life gets a little
bit more difficult for our operators.

But I would say in the 2 big casual brands, they've gotten pretty good. And they need a -- what I would
say, a change in what's happening in the environment. In other words, if we go from 25% to 50%, that's
going to change the flow of mix. That's going to change what's on-premise, on-premise. And it takes them
a few days to figure that out.

But we're erring on the side. Believe it or not, I know our labor results are really strong. But we're erring
on the side of more labor, not less.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim.

Matthew James DiFrisco
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

My question is with respect to Georgia and the positive comps there. Could you -- I guess, it sounds like
you were saying the consumer -- obviously, we've known this for a while. The consumer's a little different
than New York. However, is that also a by-product of PPP sort of slowing down and having a lift? Or have
we seen some closures happen there? I'm trying to get a picture of Georgia being a positive -- is it a
positive market? Or is it just positive for Olive Garden and LongHorn?

Or is the entire -- or dollars up for restaurant spending in the State of Georgia year-over-year? Or is it just
a smaller pie, and you've won, consolidated a lot of that share?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, a couple of things. First of all, the majority of the restaurants that are positive in Georgia are
LongHorn, not Olive Garden. Olive Garden's performing well in Georgia, but nowhere near what Olive
Garden -- I mean what LongHorn is.

And LongHorn has had a strong footprint. And we've got 45 restaurants in the City of Atlanta, where,
every 3 miles, we've got a restaurant. And we've always done extremely well there. And the brand is
beloved there. So the brand strength there is fantastic. That's one component.

The other component is that, especially when you get 15 miles outside of the city, life is pretty -- is normal
there. It's not pretty normal. It's normal there. And I went in an airport the other day and not one person
had a mask on.

I know -- I was in a hotel. I went up to a rooftop deck, and it was too deep at the bar. I mean -- so, I
mean, it's just a different life in Georgia. I know it's hard for you guys in New York to even imagine that,
but you still can't get around Georgia. There's so much traffic around the City of Atlanta.

So I mean, in the city area, there's a little bit more. But I would tell you that -- and I think if you look at
other parts of the country in different states, behavior is fairly normal.

Matthew James DiFrisco
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So I guess, that would be then the industry on a year-over-year basis also for -- or the peers. It seems
like it's a rising tide. They just haven't taken as much of a dip down?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think they haven't taken as much dip down. But I think LongHorn's significantly outperforming
most people in that market. And they always have, John. I mean, they've always -- it's always been the
core of that brand.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

And one other thing. Remember, Georgia was one of the first to open, right? So they've been dealing with
reopen for a long time, a lot longer than other states. So the longer a restaurant or a market is open, the
more people start getting a little -- feeling a little bit more comfortable.

-- what your outlook is for the potential of amount of seats maybe to leave the casual dining market? So,
say, when we are in this time next year, how many seats might have exited?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

We're comfortable and believe in somewhere between 5% and 15%. I think there's some other industry
folks saying more than that. But I think 5% to 15%, I think you remember, once it's a restaurant, it's a
restaurant. A lot of these will get recapitalized in the next few years, but I definitely believe that we'll be
competing against less competition on the other side of this crisis.

Jake Rowland Bartlett
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I really had 2 quick ones. And the first, on the menu simplification, can you quantify how many less items,
for instance, that is? Just going to a have a sense as to the scale of the simplification.

And then, Gene, I'm not going to ask you about third-party delivery. I think I know the answer, but I'm
curious about your experience with in-house delivery and lowering the minimum check or the minimum
order, for instance. Is that something you want to lean into a little bit, maybe continue to lower that to
increase your in-house delivery?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

I think on -- the answer to the second one is that we'll continue to evaluate that. We don't -- but we don't
see a big upside there. What was the first? Percent of menu simplification.

Each brand is very, very different. We range somewhere between 20% reduction to 40% reduction in one
brand. The easiest thing to do is to go find the menus.

how you expect those costs to come back? And then would you be willing to provide the fiscal 1Q comps
for the individual brands within the Fine Dining and Other Business segments?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. On the restaurant expense line, I just want to give you a couple of tidbits. One, we talked about
business interruption of $10 million. That was a proceed that we got. That hit our restaurant expense
lines.

We did have some rent reductions in the quarter. Cash rent reductions were bigger than the P&L impact.
The P&L impact was about $3 million. We had some -- most of our savings are in utilities, in smallwares
and repairs and maintenance. And we would expect that as dining rooms start to reopen, as they get busy
again, we'd have R&M start to increase as well as smallwares and utilities. Those savings are maybe not as
permanent, right, because those are just because their volumes are down.

Your last question comes from the line of Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs.

Jared Garber
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just a quick one for me. As you think about longer-term capacity, maybe if we just focus on Olive Garden,
is there a level of average weekly sales or AUVs, however you want to talk about it, that's sort of a limit
for Olive Garden? Obviously, the off-premise business can be quite additive. But as you get back to sort of
that 100% in-dining room capacity, how should we think about the longer-term sort of cap, if you will, on
AUVs in that brand?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think there is no cap. I mean, I think that if you reached your -- if you start to reach your capacity
for guest count, you have pricing power, and you can move your AUVs that way.

I think pre-COVID, we were getting close to over $5 million average unit volumes. So I think that we
definitely -- hopefully, we can get back there and get past that.

I don't ever think of a cap for a concept. Now we know that when you start adding new units, they're not
going to come on at the average. Usually, we can create a strong IRR with restaurants that come in a little
bit below the average. And -- but over time, we've been able to get that average to a pretty good level at
$5 million.
