Presentation

Operator

Good day. And welcome to the Cabot Oil and Gas Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the
conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Allison, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter
2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements based on
our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial
measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release. Despite the
ongoing global pandemics impact on natural gas demand during the second quarter, which contributed
to the lowest average quarterly NYMEX price since the third quarter of 1995, Cabot was still able to
generate positive net income of $30.4 million or $0.08 per share. These results demonstrate our uniquely
advantaged low-cost structure that we have continued to improve upon year after year, allowing us to
deliver profitability and positive returns on capital even the very trough of the natural gas price cycle,
which is where we believe we are today.

While we are seeing green shoots emerging in the natural gas market, which I will get into in more detail
later in the call, I want to commend our team for delivering another profitable quarter in the face of the
recent headwinds across our industry. Operationally, our team delivered another strong quarter with our
daily production of 2.229 Bcf per day, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our realized prices
before the impact of derivatives represents a $0.30 differential to NYMEX, which is in line with the low end
of our full year guidance range and is a significant improvement relative to a $0.44 differential in the prior
year comparable period. Additionally, all of our operating expenses were in line with or below our guidance
ranges for the quarter, demonstrating our continued focus on cost control.

In the second quarter, we generated our first quarterly free cash flow deficit since the second quarter of
2018, but it's the only -- our second free cash flow deficit in the last 17 quarters, given the historically
low natural gas price environment during the first half of this year, in addition to the combination of our
first half weighted capital program and a second half weighted production profile. Our plan for 2020 was
expected to generate a slight free cash flow deficit during the first 6 months of the year before turning to
a free cash flow positive program in the second half of the year. Ultimately, at the current strip, we still
expect our capital program for the year to be fully funded within cash flow and to generate enough free
cash flow to cover the majority of our regular dividend.

Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with a net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDAX ratio
of 1.2x at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we use cash on the balance sheet to
repay our $87 million tranche of senior notes, which matured this month. It is important to note that
while we have seen a moderate expansion in our leverage metrics this year as a result of trough natural
gas prices, we anticipate a significant compression in our leverage ratio next year at the current strip.
This compression is driven, not only by the expectation for higher EBITDAX resulting from improved
price realizations, but also from lower absolute debt levels as we continue to pay down our near-term
maturities with free cash flow. In yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our full year production guidance
range of 2.35 to 2.375 Bcf per day, with the midpoint of the range implying a flat production levels year-
over-year. Additionally, we have reaffirmed our capital program of $575 million. We also initiated our third
quarter production guidance range of 2.4 to 2.45 Bcf per day, which represents a 9% sequential increase
in daily production. Midpoint of our guidance range for the third quarter and full year imply that production
volumes in the fourth quarter will be roughly flat to the fourth quarter of last year.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

On the capital side, we expect spending to sequentially decline in both the third and fourth quarters,
driven by a reduction in our completion activity during the second half of the year. The macro outlook for
natural gas markets is obviously top of everyone's mind, especially given the stark contrast between the
current market conditions and where we believe these dynamics could be during the winter withdrawal
season.

On the demand side, while LNG exports have continued to disappoint this summer, we believe that
July and August will likely mark the trough for the export levels, resulting in a gradual improvement
in LNG utilization rates beginning in the latter part of the third quarter as the U.S. experiences fewer
cargo cancellations. Our base case expectation is that as we move into the winter, higher global gas
prices will put U.S. LNG back in the money leading to significant improvements in utilization rates and a
corresponding increase in export-related demand for natural gas. While we anticipate some reduction in
power burn this winter due to reduced coal-to-gas switching, we would expect stronger residential and
commercial demand year-over-year, assuming normal weather, which should offset any power-related
demand loss.

On the supply side, we continue to see the potential for over 6 Bcf per day reduction in production year-
over-year this winter, driven only -- driven not only by the sizable activity cuts in natural gas focused
basins, which we think is good, but also from steeper cuts and oil-focused basins, resulting in the
expectation for continued structural declines in associated gas production. Given the ongoing focus across
industry on capital discipline, including the prioritization of capital allocation on debt reduction and return
of capital to shareholders over growth, we believe any future recovery in natural gas supply will be much
slower than in prior cycles. And ultimately, the market will need to see higher prices to either incentivize
more production or to disincentivize LNG exports and economic coal-to-gas switching. While there are
certainly risks to this thesis, we remain cautiously optimistic about the natural gas market heading into
this winter.

We remain acutely focused on executing on a risk management strategy for 2021 that optimistically
locks in hedges to protect against potential downside risk, while also remaining exposed to potentially
one of the most favorable setups we have seen for the commodity in years. While we have yet to
formulate official plans for 2021, in our release yesterday, we highlighted that based on 2021 NYMEX price
assumptions of $2.75 per MMBtu, which is roughly in line with the future -- current futures. We can deliver
similar production levels as 2021 from a modestly lower capital program while delivering a free cash flow
yield of approximately 8% and a return on capital employed between 19% and 20%. As we disclosed
previously, every $0.10 improvement in NYMEX natural gas price is expected to increase our 2021 free
cash flow by approximately $55 million highlighting the upside potential if the natural gas market does,
in fact, reach a point of inflection this winter. As we anticipate a significant expansion in free cash flow in
2021. We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation with a focus on balancing the deployment of
our free cash flow next year between returning capital to shareholders and repayment of our $188 million
of senior notes maturing in 2021.

Our capital return focus will be grounded in our base quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share or $0.40
annually and further supplemented by optimistic returns of capital, including special dividends and/or
share repurchases. While 2020 may ultimately deliver the lowest average NYMEX price on record since
1995, I am proud of Cabot's resiliency, highlighted by our ability to deliver positive free cash flow and
positive corporate returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet even in the trough of the commodity
price cycle.

We will continue to execute, deliver on our plans for this year, which was formalized in February before the
widespread impacts of the global pandemic, and we remain optimistic about the potential for an inflection
point in natural gas markets this winter and the corresponding expansion in our free cash flow, return on
capital employed and return of capital to shareholders in 2021.
And Allison, with that comment, I will be more than happy to answer any questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question today will come from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Chase.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Dan, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color around your thoughts on modestly lower
CapEx for '21? Maybe give us a little bit of thoughts on that.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well we have indicated that our 2020 program was front-loaded. The remainder of 2020, we're not going
to spend as much capital. We're also in the midst of negotiations with rigs and frac crews. And looking at
the efficiencies we've developed in our program operationally and what we're seeing and what we think
will occur with our execution contracts in the 2021 -- for our 2021 program, we think we will see that
modest reduction in that program.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. [indiscernible]

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. If you wanted a ballpark, 5% to 10% as a number right now might be a useful number.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Got it. So something maybe in the $540 million type of range, something like that?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Yes, that would seem reasonable.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. I did want to maybe see if you could elaborate on, call it, some of the outlook comments on '21,
obviously, assuming a $2.75 strip, you cited an 8% free cash flow yield which would suggest on our
math, call it, $580 million in free cash flow. Your annual dividend is about $160 million. I think there's a
desire of the company to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. So that would suggest
maybe another $130 million. But just maybe wanted to get your thoughts on, let's assume $2.75 is a
good number next year, what kind of magnitude of cash return could we see to shareholders above your
dividend, again, which is around $160 million a year?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We have -- I think we've set a pretty good clear track record of what our desire is, and that is to
return as we've catched, 50% of our free cash flow back to shareholders. We have our debt we're going
to take care of next year. We have the dividend also. And some of our decision and what we elect to do,
we would -- I'm speculating here a little bit, but we would probably maintain our dividend where it is.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

We'll talk about it throughout the year, and we'll look at a macro market as we look out forward. But we've
also talked internally about special dividends, and we haven't changed off of our position to return cash to
shareholders.

Operator

Our next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.

Jeffrey Leon Campbell
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

Dan, I want to ask for a little help on 2 ideas from the press release together. First, Cabot said that it can
maintain the flattish production in 2021 with the lower spend, we just discussed that. And then as with
your preamble, there was the note that improving demand and diminishing supply imply tailwinds for
nat gas pricing in 2021. One view seems quite conservative, and the other one is more bullish. So I was
wondering how do we put these 2 contrasting views together to think about what may be more probable
or less probable for Cabot in 2021?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well it's still early. We've -- as you read, or typically, as we do, we released in February what our outlook
on 2021 is going to be. We have the advantage at that point in time to be able to see what the winter has
done, look at what the strip is at that particular time, and we'll forecast then a much clearer definition
of what our 2021 CapEx will be and what we're -- how we're going to set our expectations. When we
look at the market and at this time, we are conservative by nature, we have a -- what I think is a great
setup for our shareholders to deliver a great deal of free cash flow. We'll deliver that free cash flow to
our shareholders versus the banks. And I think that is going to be attractive. And we have a conservative
program, which hopefully, it turns into that conservative program with the commodity price expectation
we've stated, plus or minus $2.75. And we're comfortable with that right now. If we see continued
discipline in the market, and we see continued increases in demand. The LNG market comes back strong,
we do have the ability to increase our program, but we're comfortable right now messaging that our lower
CapEx program in 2021 is going to deliver the same volumes.

Jeffrey Leon Campbell
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

And just to follow that up real quick. And I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like what
you're saying is we've got a conservative program set up, it's already going to generate attractive free
cash. And if the market goes our way and we get better pricing, first and foremost, we're going to make
even more free cash. And then maybe at some point, depending on signals, we might increase the activity
as a follow-on. Is that fair? Or am I reading too much into it?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

I wish I could have said it as well as you did, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey Leon Campbell
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

Okay. Great. And I'll ask a follow-up, this is a lot more specific. I just want to get your view on the
cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the likely completion of the Mountain View pipeline. And how
you see that affecting the nat gas market in 2021, both macro and maybe on Appalachian basis as well?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Jeffrey. And Jeff Hutton is on the edge of his seat.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

Senior Vice President of Marketing

Jeffrey, there's a lot to take in with the [indiscernible] that project. But in the grand scheme of things on
pipeline development and also on specific projects. We always felt like that project was fairly long put
because of the 600-mile way, how many states they went through, et cetera, et cetera. And quite frankly,
the higher cost of that project, but also where that project lands. It does tie in the Transco for down to
station 165. We felt like that's quite a bit of gas we go into that market. Obviously, there were some
shippers that were optimistic that they'd be able to develop some more gas-fired generation down there.
And I still think that's the case. But I think there's also ample supply on the Transco system to satisfy that
demand. So initially, and even today, we still think that, that was too much gas in that region. We were
somewhat concerned that it would saturate the market to the point that it would bleed upstream into the
D.C. area where we're actively marketing gas. And so quite frankly, the cancellation of that project is --
gives us more of an optimistic view on pricing for that region.

Our next question today is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to follow-up on a couple of the points raised here earlier. First, on that mechanism to return
cash to shareholders. How are you thinking? And you talked about the special dividend, but how are
you thinking about more of a -- more codified variable dividend versus special dividend versus share
repurchase when that time comes?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We're socializing that now internally, Brian. We have not put a framework around a formulaic delivery
of that special dividend or variable dividend. As you've seen in the past, we have, as -- similar to our
buybacks, we've made those decisions when we feel comfortable about the market. We see the near-term
support in the market that allows us to generate, out in front of us, x amount of incremental free cash. So
we're comfortable delivering a certain portion of that and in some cases, all of it back to shareholders. So
I'm sorry, I'm not specific on the formula, but we have not gotten to that formula internally.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Understood. And then my follow-up is with regards to in-basin gas demand. Can you give us the latest on
what your expectations are for that market? And how that also sets your view more broadly on what the
outlook is for U.S. domestic gas demand, particularly from the power and industrial sectors?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I'm willing to make a comment, then I'm going to turn it to Jeff, Brian, because it is an area that
we are spending a great deal of time and focus on in-basin demand projects. But one of the most recent
impetus and catalyst that is, I think, driving now more attention to Northeast PA as a location for demand
projects has been the agreement of tax credits that Pennsylvania will allocate to at least 4 projects that
bring a large manufacturing or natural gas demand project to state and spend x amount of money, employ
x amount of people, then they would receive hundreds of millions of dollars over the next 10 years of
tax credits. That is a tremendous opportunity. It is out there and now in the books with the governor's
signature. And we have had discussions with in-basin demand projects, and we have had for a while, a
business development group that is working this opportunity for us. We like the idea of in-basin projects.
We can hook that up on the tailgate of our gathering system. And it is an incremental realizations to
Cabot.

I'll let Jeff talk a little bit about his thoughts in this regard.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

Jeffrey W. Hutton
Senior Vice President of Marketing

Brian, the -- just a quick recap. In-basin demand in the Northeast corner of PA has picked up quite a bit of
load over the last 4 or 5 years, somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 Bcf a day of new demand. And as
you spread and look across the entire state of Pennsylvania, a lot of projects that are being built or have
been built that are utilizing natural gas from the Pennsylvania area. So it's all good, whether or not it's
a Cabot-linked project or with others. But specifically, we've talked about this in the past, where we've
identified a number of sites and locations with different acreage and terrain sizes with water, with rail, with
power and obviously, with our gas supply. And we continue to talk to industries that are located in the
Northeast, already have markets in the Northeast. There's been some new technology developed for some
very unique projects that are good year-round loads. And so nothing to announce today.

Obviously, we have a huge amount of activity with different manufacturing associations and associations
throughout that region, including local and county market development people. So it's an ongoing process.
We found some -- we have some ideas that we're working toward, nothing definitive, but we're really
happy with 0.5 Bcf a day LOE that we currently have up there. And most of those deals, of course, are
long-term in duration because of the nature of their locations.

Operator

Our next question will come from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I was hoping to follow up a little bit more on the kind of risk management/hedging strategy. Kind of as we
sit here today, I mean it looks like futures curve in '21 is offering a little bit north of $2.65, which seems
like a very robust price compared to where we sit today and certainly one where I think Cabot's economics
would be outstanding. Why not try to maybe put some kind of call or structure in place to protect some of
that downside at this point. Certainly recognize your bullish view on macro. But as you guys know, you're
always kind of a warm winter away from potential challenges in the gas market. So any thoughts you kind
of have on that would be great.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

We have certainly a discussion regularly internally with our hedge committee. And the price we see out
there in 2021 is actually north of the $2.65 that we see today. It is our intent to mitigate, as you say, the
downside of the macro market. We have all been disappointed in the past, more so disappointed in the
recent past than pleasantly surprised.

We do think that there are some fundamental points that we made in my remarks that are constructive
to a supportive underpinning of the market. And yes, it can go down. And as I mentioned, that the risk
of that type of downside, we're fully aware of. We think our program would deliver very well at $2.65. It
is our intent to participate in the 2021 financial hedge market. And we'll do that appropriately with the
vehicles once we make the decision amongst the committee to do that. So we're thinking alike, Leo, we're
pleased with where the market is right now. And we are, again, looking forward to participate in the hedge
market. I can't tell you when in advance we plan to do something, but we do look at it every day.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's great color. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments regarding 2021. I know it's not
guidance and just sort of an outlook. But I guess flattish year-over-year production next year on my math
kind of implies around a 4% decline versus fourth quarter '20 levels. I know you guys certainly said that
you think about this in a conservative way. I guess would that end up being a similar shape to what we
saw in '20, where your production was down a little bit early in the year due to lack of winter fracking and

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

then maybe pick up from there? Just trying to understand the dynamic as to why you'd kind of be down
versus 4Q if gas is strong next year.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We're -- that's fairly granular to be able to give you the cadence quarter-to-quarter right now, Leo,
I'm sorry. But overall, right now, I'm comfortable just with our outlook being what it is, and it's flat with
lower capital in 2021 and the cadence, we do try to manage the cadence, and it's a result of just a number
of different things, the size of pads we have some of the winter season, the expectations on how the
market is going to the macro market is going to look. We have not nailed down exactly the cadence for
the quarters. One thing I would say that right now, if you look out in this summer, we had $1.60 gas,
$1.70 gas in the say, the April to October. And if you look out in 2021, if we're even partially right about
the lower supply, higher demand running through this winter, then you ought to be able to look out at the
period between the April and October and say that, that market right now might be about a $2.60 market.
So there is an effect, almost a dollar difference during that period of time. So the cadence is still -- we still
have a discussion going internally. But those are some of the things that we look at.

Operator

Our next question will come from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Dan, I wanted to -- this isn't something you guys really made a point this quarter, but I wondered if you
could give us an update on the evolution of your -- of the Upper Marcellus in your views. And I think
the last time you guys really dove into it, we were talking about EURs that were about 90% of what the
Lower Marcellus is. And so I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on if that view has evolved
anymore. And if you're -- if you have any plans for iterating on that zone or doing some more extensive
testing in that zone, either in the back half of this year or in '21?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And we have drilled some upper wells this year. The number though, Charles, for comparison between
the lower is more 70-plus percent EUR, not 90%. And that's in our...

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Always been the case.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, that's been our material, and that's always been the case. But the wells that we have drilled this year,
and we've actually drilled uppers on 3 different pads. And the wells in different locations in the field. And
collectively, I'm not going to get granular on it because a couple of wells have been on longer than the
other wells that have come on more recently. But collectively, what we have seen is that our type curve on
the upper is running slightly above, collectively, the type curve that we're using as our risk tight curve out
there in the field for the upper.

You want to say -- Steve might say something?

Steven W. Lindeman
Senior Vice President of EHS & Engineering

Yes. So basically, what Dan's saying is that when you look at those pads currently, they've been on for a
short period of time, but they're outperforming our projection for what the type curve would be for in that
area. So we're very pleased with those results.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Yes. Got it. That's the kind of color I was looking for. I guess I was misremembering and miscalibrated on
that, but thank you for straightening me out. Dan, I recognize that maybe this is a bit of a long shot, but
is there anything -- any comments you would -- you'd care to make about the case that the Pennsylvania
AG uncorked earlier this year with you guys?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well the AG has -- a number of companies have now been recognized by the AG. And through their
investigations. As you're aware that the charges are, of course, disputed matters. But nonetheless, Cabot
is cooperating with the AG, and we're -- we have provided his staff with facts and data addressing the
allegations directly. We are certainly telling Cabot's side of the story. It's undisputed up there that natural
gas is naturally occurring in all the areas of Northeast Pennsylvania. And methane was up there in the
rock prior to the oil and gas industry ever going up there. When we moved up there, it was a greenfield
operation, no drilling had taken place, no production, and there was natural gas in the water systems up
there. So we'll continue to work with the AG. We're always employing our best practices to protect the
environment and its operations and continue to be a leader in that regard. We do intend to be able to
resolve this matter, that is positive for all stakeholders.

Our next question today will come from Josh Silverstein of Wolfe Research.

Joshua Ian Silverstein
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just following up on a question before about the Upper and the Lower Marcellus. You talked about 2
decades of inventory. I just wanted to see how you could split that right now between the upper versus
the lower? And at what price deck that would be using?

Our -- on our drill cadence, if you look at kind of how we've laid out our long-term program. And we have
shown in a deck in the past, we've shown our production and drilling going out into the 2040 period. We
have go out into the latter part of 2020 decade with our lower drilling. And then subsequent to that, we
move into the Upper Marcellus drilling. And we have that drilling out into the 2040 period.

Got it. So it's kind of 10 years for the lower, at least of right now, kind of this maintenance cadence?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

It's slightly less, John, than 10 years, but it goes out towards the end of the 2020 decade, yes.

Joshua Ian Silverstein
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got you. Okay. And then maybe just talking about that maintenance cadence. One of the benefits of
staying at this lower level and not growing is that you can actually lower your base decline rate. I wanted
to see where it was at the end of last year, where you think it might be at the end of this year? And if you
were to just kind of hold things flat, where that might be at the end of next year?

Yes. We have -- our decline rate right now is 29% to 30%. And I don't have the number. And Steve
Lindeman might be able to get me towards the cadence of our decline, as he's looked at our reserves
towards the end of 2021.

Steven W. Lindeman
Senior Vice President of EHS & Engineering

Right. So what -- like Dan said, right now, we're kind of running in the 29% to 30% range. As you go out
3 or 4 years and add to the base, we'll probably be running in the 25% -- 24%, 25% range.

And our next question today will come from Kashy Harrison with Simmons.

Kashy Oladipo Harrison
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

So Dan, you highlighted the 8% free cash flow yield in 2021 at $2.75. I was looking at your 2019
financials. It looks like you guys were able to do $1.35 billion of discretionary cash flow at about $2.60.
I know that had about $150 million of hedge gains. But just doing the simple math there would get you
to about $1.2 billion. And then if I took your -- the implied CapEx that was discussed earlier in the call, it
feels like we should be much higher than 8% at $2.75. And so I guess my question is, is that conservatism
on your part? Or should we be thinking about basis expansion or maybe cash income taxes as you look
toward a higher-priced environment?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I'm going to pitch the ball to Matt.

Matthew P. Kerin
VP of Finance & Treasurer

Kashy, yes, I think you nailed it with the cash tax piece. Obviously, last year, we also had the benefit of
higher -- significantly higher deferred tax add backs because of some tax reform, et cetera. So as we
move forward now that we've maximized all the utilization of our NOLs and AMT, we're just not going to
see those same tax benefits in the future.

And I'd add, of course, there's always conservatism in our guide as well, as you know.

Kashy Oladipo Harrison
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Got it. Very helpful. I guess there's high-class problems. And then as you think about capital spending,
as you look at your capital spending or as I was looking at your capital spending, it seems like you guys
have spent just under 60% of the budget, but you've completed well over that proportion of your targeted
wells for the year. And so I guess my follow-up question was, are you guys seeing some sort of -- some
efficiencies or cost improvements? And is there anything to read-through for implications to the full year
budget? Or is this just more so timing-related?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

We have efficiencies in our program. We decided to maintain our $575 million CapEx. It's midyear right
now. It might be a conservative position, but we wanted the least noise in the release as we could deliver,
and we thought that was appropriate.

Kashy Oladipo Harrison
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And if I could just sneak one more in and just follow-up on some earlier
questions on the Upper Marcellus. I was just wondering, I know we've always talked about the 70% of --

the upper 70% of the lower on the well performance front. Have you guys ever talked about just how to
think about the difference in well costs between the 2 zones?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we haven't -- we've talked about it maybe more indirectly, but we have made comments regarding
our full development case of our Upper Marcellus. And to not make this a long-winded answer, Scott has
told me sometimes that I talk too long on my answers. But when you look at the full development of
the Marcellus, you can really -- Upper Marcellus, you can really look at the Upper Marcellus, it's a blank
piece of paper for the most part. We intend to -- particularly with the legislation that has been passed
recently about longer laterals and how you drill within or across units, it is our intent to lay out the sticks
for the Upper Marcellus with longer laterals on average than we've been able to drill in the Lower Marcellus
program. With the drilling of the longer laterals, and I'm talking about kind of the 12,000 foot type laterals
in the Upper Marcellus, there's efficiencies inherent in drilling longer laterals than shorter laterals.

With our currently -- even in the lower, in our longer laterals, if we drill 11,000 or 12,000 foot laterals,
and you look at our completion efficiencies or some represent their -- the cost of development in what
the cost is per foot in our -- even in our lower, we have a, say, a 700 -- slightly over $700 per foot cost
in our 11,000 foot type of lateral that we drill in the lower. And we have those as actual costs that we
have seen in first and second quarter of this year. There's another thing on the efficiencies that we see in
those -- in that cost Cabot also loads in -- of our cost per foot. We also load in our -- all our facilities in
that cost, and we load in all the construction associated with our pad sites into those costs. That is, again,
all-in cost for us. And the other thing we do is we have what we think are very efficient completions. We
have 2,500 pounds of proppant we use in our completions versus, I know some other companies might
use less proppant. So their cost for proppant is going to be maybe slightly less than ours, but we do like
the amount of gas that we have coming in -- out of our wells and so our recipe, we think we have dialed
in, is very efficient. So there is going to be, overall, considerably less cost attached to the development of
our Upper Marcellus, including use of roads, reuse of pad sites. We hope reuse of some of the equipment
so we would take -- even though the -- it might be a 70-plus percent comparison to the lower, we think
on a return profile basis because of what I'm just mentioning, our upper development is going to be in an
extremely good return profile.

Kashy Oladipo Harrison
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

That's excellent color.

Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the
conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Allison. And once again, I would just like to say thanks again to those dedicated shareholders
of Cabot, but also their gratitude to Cabot's team. They have been out there through this very difficult
environment. Many of our field operators have been going to work every single day, even though some of
the corporate headquarters at office in Pittsburgh have honored the stay-at-home edicts because of this
pandemic. But those guys and girls out there in the field have gotten up every day to head out and do the
work. And as you can see by our numbers, we've been able to deliver on our program, and I'm very proud
of the group. So thanks again for the attention. Look forward to next quarter's call.

Operator
The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now
disconnect your lines.
