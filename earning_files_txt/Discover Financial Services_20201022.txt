Presentation

Operator

Good morning. Good afternoon. My name is Maria, and I will be your conference operator today. At this
time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Craig A. Streem
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's call. We will begin this morning on
Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations
website, investorrelations.discover.com.

Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding
forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and presentation.

Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial
Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for question-and-answer session.
During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question. And if you have a follow-up, please queue
back in so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.

Now as always, it's pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In these uniquely challenging times, I'm
pleased with Discover's results and how well our business model has performed.

In the third quarter, we earned $771 million after tax or $2.45 per share. We clearly benefited from the
actions we took in the first half of this year to protect employees, manage credit risk and control costs
while preserving momentum on long-term investments. While significant uncertainty remains as to the
extent and timing of a recovery, we were pleased to see the return to year-over-year sales growth in
September.

Managing credit remains a top priority. We entered this recession from a strong credit position due to our
traditionally conservative approach to underwriting as well as actions taken over the past few years to
reduce our contingent liability and tighten credit at the margin. We quickly implemented changes to credit
policy at the onset of the pandemic, including tightening criteria for new accounts and line increases and
additional income verification.

While we saw very strong credit performance this quarter, we expect to see deterioration in the coming
quarters as the prime consumer may be impacted by increasing permanent white collar unemployment.
That said, we believe we have taken the appropriate credit actions and don't see the need to make
significant changes at this time.

The improvements in sales volume continued during the quarter, with a return to growth in the month
of September. Sales have improved across all categories, with particular strength in online retail, home
improvement and everyday spend categories, partially offset by continued weakness in travel and
entertainment spending.

Loan growth continues to be affected by the pandemic, with total loans down 4% year-over-year, including
card loans down 6% and personal loans down 5%. The drop in spending during the pandemic and our own

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

credit tightening has impacted loan growth, but another driver has been significantly higher payment rate
in our card and personal loan portfolios.

Consumers have had improved household cash flows due to reduced spending and government stimulus
and have taken this opportunity to boost savings and make larger payments against their loans.

In our student loan business, originations in the peak season were down year-over-year reflecting the
large number of students who chose not to enroll this fall. Even in this challenging environment, our
organic student loans were up 7%, reflecting innovative features like our multiyear loan and our strong
competitive position.

In terms of operating expenses, we remain on track to deliver $400 million of cost reductions this year,
while continuing to invest in core capabilities such as advanced analytics to increase efficiency and drive
long-term value.

In conclusion, this quarter, our business generated high returns as we remain focused on disciplined credit
management, profitable growth and an industry-leading customer experience supported by our 100%
U.S.-based customer service. The economic environment remains uncertain, but our strong capital and
liquidity and actions we've taken to strengthen the business position allows us to continue to drive long-
term value for our shareholders.

I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll walk through our results
starting on Slide 4. We earned $2.45 per share, driven by solid credit performance of our portfolio and
significantly lower operating expenses. While total revenue was down from last year, reflecting the
slowdown in the economy, sales volume turned positive in September and net interest margin expanded
nicely.

Net interest income was down 6% as the impact of lower market rates was partially offset by lower
funding costs. In addition, average receivables were down 3%, contributing to the decline in net interest
income. Noninterest income was down 10%, driven by lower fee income reflecting fewer late fee instances
and the impact of lower overall spending on cash advance fees. The decrease in net discount and
interchange revenue was driven by sales volume in the quarter.

The provision for credit losses improved by nearly $50 million from the prior year as a result of a decline
in net charge-offs and a lower reserve build. Operating expenses were down 9% year-over-year, driven by
marketing expenses and professional fees.

Turning to loan growth on Slide 5. Total loans were down 4% from the prior year, driven by a 6% decrease
in card receivables. Lower card receivables were driven by 3 factors: a higher payment rate as customers
continue to be mindful of their debt obligations; a decline in promotional balances as a result of credit
tightening, which will benefit net interest margin going forward; and third, lower sales volume. In the
quarter, sales were down just 1% on a year-over-year basis.

Sales returned to growth in September, up 4% year-over-year, with improvement in all categories.
Grocery, retail and home improvement were very strong. The trend continued through the first half of
October, with sales up 7%. In our other lending products, organic student loans increased 7% from the
prior year, and personal loans decreased 5%.

Moving to Slide 6. Our net interest margin bottomed out in the second quarter and improved 38 basis
points to 10.19% in the current quarter. Relative to the second quarter, NIM increased primarily due
to favorable consumer deposit pricing. Since June 30, we have decreased our online savings rate 41
basis points, down to 0.60%. Approximately 2/3 of our consumer deposits are indeterminate maturity
accounts, primarily savings, which has provided an immediate benefit from deposit rate decreases.
Average consumer deposits were up 22% year-over-year and up $2.7 billion from the second quarter.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Looking at Slide 7. You can see how our funding mix has changed over time. We're also providing details
on our funding maturities and corresponding rates over the next couple of years. Given our current excess
liquidity position, we expect to issue very little wholesale debt in the near term. The majority of our new
deposits have been in online savings, and we would expect this trend to continue in the current low-rate
environment. As we move towards our target at 70% to 80% of funding from consumer deposits, we
expect to see continued benefits to net interest margin.

Turning to Slide 8. Total operating expenses were down $102 million or 9% from the prior year. Marketing
and business development expense was down $90 million or 39%. The bulk of the reduction was in brand
marketing and card acquisition.

Professional fees decreased $38 million or 20%, mainly driven by lower third-party recovery fees related
to court closures as well as favorable vendor pricing adjustments. Employee compensation was up $32
million or 7%, driven by staffing increases, mainly in technology as well as higher average salaries and
benefit costs.

To date, we've realized approximately 90% of the targeted $400 million of expense reductions we
discussed over the past 2 quarters. We're on track to deliver the remaining 10% in the fourth quarter and
continue to review the business for efficiency opportunities.

Turning now to Slide 9, showing credit metrics. Credit performance remained very strong in the third
quarter. Net charge-off dollars actually came down $7 million, while the rate increased 13 basis points.
Sequentially, the card net charge-off rate improved 45 basis points. The 30-plus delinquency rate
improved 59 basis points from last year and 26 basis points from the prior quarter as credit performance
of our card portfolio continue to be stable, demonstrating the strength of our prime revolver customer
base.

Our private student loan portfolio had another quarter of strong credit performance, with net charge-offs
down 1 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding purchased loans, the 30-plus delinquency rate
improved 37 basis points from the prior year and 8 basis points sequentially.

Credit performance in our personal loan portfolio continued to be very strong this quarter, reflecting our
disciplined underwriting and the benefit of credit actions implemented over the past several years.

Net charge-offs improved 130 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 39 basis points
from the prior year. While overall credit performance remained strong through the third quarter, we expect
the economic environment to lead to deterioration in consumer credit, with delinquencies likely increasing
in 2021. The timing of the rise in delinquency and subsequent losses could be impacted if there is a
second government stimulus program or economic trends shift materially.

Slide 10 shows our allowance for credit losses. In the quarter, we added $42 million to the loans driven
by a $354 million increase in organic student loans. Other loan products were generally flat from the
prior quarter. With the backdrop of an uncertain but improving macroeconomic environment, we modeled
several different scenarios and maintained a conservative view in the quarter. Our key macro assumptions
were an unemployment rate of 11% at the end of 2020 and slowly recovering over the next several years.
We also consider the current trends in unemployment and the increasing number of COVID cases.

Moving to Slide 11. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased 50 basis points sequentially, primarily due
to the decline in loan balance. In March, we suspended our share buyback program in response to the
economic environment at that time, and it remains suspended. We have continued to fund our quarterly
dividend of $0.44 per share. We are in the process of preparing our second stress test submission and will
determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subject to the final stress capital buffer, regulatory
and rating agency expectations and Board approval.

In summary, solid results in the third quarter. The portfolio remained stable with improvements in overall
delinquency levels, reserves were flat except for those pertaining to student loans where the balance
and commitment levels increased. Net interest margin improved from the second quarter and is trending
positively as a result of our aggressive deposit pricing. And finally, strong execution on our targeted
expense reductions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.

Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Appreciate all the color on reserves and provisions. Roger, clearly, there's nothing that we see within the
credit metrics that suggests weakness outside of the headlines on potential white collar layoffs. Are there
any specific signs you're seeing inside the portfolio that leads you to be concerned? And how significant
the change in the environment would there have to be for you guys to have to build reserves again?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

So I'll let John cover the part about reserves, Sanjay. But in terms of the environment, I think the jobless
claims numbers, and we'll see what this week has, but 7 straight weeks, over 800,000 and more and more
of that permanent unemployment in white collar is a reason for ongoing concern. But I think as you look
at our portfolio, I am very pleased with the performance across all products. And you can see that from
the broadest metric, we disclosed the 30-day delinquency rate.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And Sanjay, in terms of reserving, we modeled a number of different assumptions and took a
conservative approach across the Board. What we saw was, actually, as Roger said, excellent underlying
portfolio performance. There is that level of concern in terms of jobless claims and the impact on prime
consumers. But to date, we don't see anything that -- that's out there that would suggest that reserves
are, I'll say, weak or deep strengthening at this point. We did model a second round of stimulus. We don't
know if that's going to happen. There's some reason to be optimistic, but no one can tell on these sorts of
things these days. So we'll see. But we'll look at it through the quarter, the fourth quarter and make the
call in terms of what's appropriate from a GAAP standpoint.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane, JPMorgan.

Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Look, we're entering what's historically the most important part of the year in terms of spending in
consumer behavior. I'm curious, 2 things. You're seeing an uptick in spending, which is a good sign. I'm
curious how you will approach this from a marketing and rewards perspective. We know you pulled back a
little bit to this point to manage expenses. But given the consumer seems to be rebounding, will you be a
little bit more aggressive on rewards and marketing as we head into the holiday season?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Rick. In terms of marketing, while we did cut expenses in line with the economic
environment, we have continued to market across all of our products and have been very excited actually
about the quality of new accounts we're bringing in on the card book as well as some of the costs we're
seeing as competitors pulled back more aggressively.

Now I do expect some of that to normalize over time. But again, we're going to continue marketing
through the fourth quarter. In terms of the rewards program, our program is well suited to this
environment. Consumers prefer cash over miles. I think a lot of the miles programs I see in the

marketplace are struggling to add relevance and redemption options. In particular, our strong partnerships
with PayPal and Amazon, some of the programs we're already putting in market with Amazon will serve us
well in the fourth quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.

Donald James Fandetti
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So Roger, I mean, these are the times where you can potentially step in and gain share and be
opportunistic. We saw American Express buy Kabbage. Do you have any thoughts on your position of
strength? How you could use that, maybe on acquisitions? Or are you going to just sort of hold tight given
the uncertainty?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think we are leveraging that position of strength. I believe we're gaining share, both in terms of
sales and loans and card, and had a very strong peak season for student loans. Acquisitions are a little
more challenging. And so as we think about how we use capital, the top priority is supporting organic
growth. Next comes a mix of dividends and buybacks. Acquisitions tend to be a distant third.

Our primary interest is in the payments space. But while valuations have come in a bit, especially where
cross-border type companies, they're still very high. And so a lot of what we're seeing are opportunities
for either investments, partnerships. So we'll look at it. But I think we're probably more likely to be
aggressive on the organic side, subject to our conservative credit policy than making acquisitions.

Donald James Fandetti
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And just one quick clarification. What percentage of the portfolio is promo right now? Because it
sounds like that's going to help on the card yield going forward.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's come down recently. We've been intentional about that in terms of taking a look at promo
balances as well as balance transfers, so.

Donald James Fandetti
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And so where does that -- I think usually, you guys are in the mid-teens or somewhere in that range?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's right around 15% or so.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

It's encouraging to see positive operating leverage in this environment. That's consistent with what we've
seen over the last decade plus from you guys. But there had been some concern among investors when
you guys gave guidance earlier this year, pre COVID, that Discover lost its expense discipline. And that's
the reason that you guys had, at the time, guided to negative operating leverage was due to years of

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

chronic underinvestment. Roger, understanding that there will always be one-off investments that need
to be made. Put that aside, can you speak to your confidence level in being able to continue to generate
consistent positive operating leverage as we look to the other side of this?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Bill. So first, having been here for over 20 years, I have to maybe disagree with the phrase
chronic underinvestment. I think our investments have been appropriate. But at the beginning of the year,
we saw an opportunity to invest more. And so I would characterize it that way.

Clearly, the year changed dramatically. And hopefully, you've seen very strong expense discipline in terms
of the target we put out there and how well we're progressing against that target. It's a little challenging
just to look at operating leverage because that includes, what I'll call, sort of day-to-day corporate type
expenses that we're always trying to bring down but then also marketing investments that drive profitable
growth and high-returning accounts. And so it's a blend of those 2.

But again, I think you can expect to see the continued expense discipline that I think has always been
a hallmark here at Discover our overall lower-cost operating model, but we will invest according to the
opportunities we see in the marketplace. And I guess I'd point to the returns we're generating as an
example of the effectiveness of that business model even through extremely challenging cycles.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.

Ryan Matthew Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

John, on the net interest margin, you saw some really nice expansion. You talked about the benefits that
you're seeing from lower promo activity. Can you maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes from
here? Asset yields are obviously going to be improving. And it seems like the funding tailwinds are sizable
over the next couple of quarters. So if we had peaked out in the low 240s, could we actually potentially
see the margin somewhere in excess of that over the next few quarters?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we were mindful in terms of what we included here in the presentation as well as in terms of
the comments to provide, frankly, an additional insight in terms of what's happening to the funding mix,
the maturity profile and the cost of our debt stack. And what you can see there is based on the maturity
profile and the cost we're seeing versus online deposits that there will be an opportunity to expand net
interest margin.

Now that's subject to a lot of different things, right? Obviously, there's one piece, which is the health of
the portfolio, and that's been strong. Certainly, the mix of revolvers and transactors will also have an
impact and typically impacts the fourth quarter a bit. But overall, as you look at where we are this quarter,
I see some upside from that from my vantage point today.

Ryan Matthew Nash
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And maybe if I can ask a follow-up question from a topic that was hit on before. So John, I think in
your prepared remarks, you commented that you're looking for additional efficiencies. Maybe can you just
help us understand and maybe Roger can hop in on this, too. Of the 90% of the $400 million that you've
said, how much of that was -- is just investments that have been deferred versus actual core efficiencies
that you guys have identified and taken out? And what could this mean for the trajectory of the cost base
outside of marketing as we look into 2021?

John Thomas Greene

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So thanks. So I would characterize it this way is the $400 million of cost savings from the previous
guidance, I wouldn't necessarily call that a deferral. What I would say is we took a look at the economic
environment and took $400 million of our planned spending.

Now as I said in the remarks, which you clearly picked up on, Ryan, was that the bulk of that has been on
marketing and brand. Now as we look through the balance of this year and some of the actions that we
took, we saw benefits across a host of P&L lines, expense lines specifically. And we're going to use that,
frankly, as a new benchmark in order to really make some determinations on what we need to spend in
2021 to ensure that we continue to grow profitably.

I would say this. If the economic environment continues to improve, it's natural that we're going to spend
more money on customer acquisition in order to drive profitable growth into the future. But the other
expense lines, professional fees, information processing, other miscellaneous expense, we're going to keep
a foot on those to ensure that we're disciplined about how we're spending the dollars.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Crédit Suisse.

Moshe Ari Orenbuch
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I guess, I sort of am struck by the
fact that the efficiency ratio in the quarter was actually better than it was in 2019. And you're kind of
demonstrating certainly likely to be the best growth in spend volume and one of the better growths, if not
the best, in receivables or smallest decline.

And I guess I'm also struck by stuff we see in the industry that there's continued more cash back mail
from some of your big competitors where that wasn't as big a focus. And so kind of maybe some of this
has been discussed already, but I'm sort of struck by that. It seems like you have an opportunity. And
where does -- where can you direct that attention? And how much do you have in kind of available,
whether it's spending on rewards or marketing? Like, what are the tools? And how are you going to use
them over the next few quarters, particularly now as we're going into the holiday season?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Moshe. We're using all the tools we have available. I would point out, there still is a good
amount of economic uncertainty. And so we are not changing credit policy on the card side. I think we
want to see more and more signs of sustained recovery. But the cash back program is resonating well, as
I said earlier. And there's always a lot of competition in cash rewards from major issuers. So I wouldn't
necessarily characterize it as more intense than ever. But it is a time where consumers are rethinking
which cards they want, do they really need another frequent flyer mile at this point?

And then the other part is the only major issue was no fees on any of our card products. But knowing a
fee message resonates surprisingly well. But then probably a point we're seeing great strength on the
other side of the balance sheet on the deposit side, where we compete the same way, right, good value,
but an outstanding customer experience. So we're really excited. Certainly, uncertainty as to what the
holiday season will bring, as I talk to retailers out there. But I feel good about our ability to continue to
gain share.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

I'd just like to follow-up on some of the NIM comments. I mean, you're seeing some -- a little bit more
resiliency on the asset yields, in particular, some of the personal loans and card rates. Could you talk
about the competitive environment in both of those products and your expectations for those yields, at
least in the next couple of quarters, just given the resiliency that we've seen in the near term?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we look at the card yield. They'll overall be relatively stable, subject to kind of the mix of balance
transfers and promos. And as I said earlier, we're going to be mindful in terms of those sorts of decisions.
If we can do that, do some promos or balance transfers safely in a credit environment, we'll do that
because it would be high returning customers. But the leverage that we're going to get in future quarters
will come out of the funding base.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And Kevin, maybe one thing I'd add, too. As we set pricing, given how hard it is to reprice cards after
the CARD Act, we're not reacting to specific competitors in a given quarter. We're taking -- working closely
with financing, very disciplined through the cycle look. And so it's really where our growth is occurring and
that promo mix that will drive it as opposed to reacting to competitors.

Kevin James Barker
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes. That all makes sense. And then regarding the liability side, the order of magnitude in the drop and
liability costs over the last couple of quarters are obviously very strong, just given the rate environment, I
mean, how much more room do you feel like you have to bring deposit costs lower, just given the current
rate environment and the outsized amount of liquidity on your balance sheet?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we continue to look at that. And the decision would be subject to two factors: One, the amount
of liquidity we have on the balance sheet, and right now, we're in a situation where we have excess
liquidity; and then the second piece of the equation is the competitive landscape; and then third, which
is a consideration of this business is certainly the customer relationships and ensuring that our long-term
good-quality customers aren't feeling like they're impacted in a way that's unfair.

Now with all that said, I'm seeing a persistent low-rate environment. And with a persistent low rate
environment, I do believe that there is some amount of room to price downward. But again, it's caveated
by all those points that I just mentioned.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair.

Robert Paul Napoli
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Just wondered what your build -- what you built into your reserves as far as the trajectory of charge-
offs? And I would expect -- I mean, I guess, you're not -- really, given where delinquencies are, you're
not expecting to see charge-offs move up much in the fourth quarter and then more back half weighted to
2021.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I would start off by stating that the portfolio performance versus what we thought it potentially

certainly a push from '20 into '21. And the absolute quantum of that will obviously depend on all the
factors that we've built into our reserve calculation: GDP, unemployment, new jobless claims, stimulus or
lack thereof.

So we will -- we're going to monitor the portfolio. But just to kind of net it for you and the other folks on
the call, '20 looks super solid, '21 level of uncertainty, and we expect the bubble to push through into
certainly beginning maybe in the midpoint of the year into the second half of '21.

Robert Paul Napoli
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. And then a follow-up, just the jobless claims 787,000 this morning, a big improvement, but
ridiculously high report of that sort. But I mean, direct bank your position, Roger, as a direct bank, gives,
I think, is the right strategy for the long term. Are there new products or services that you're planning
to build through that direct bank. I mean we have, obviously, a lot of these neobanks that are delivering
different products and maybe to a different demographic than Discover focuses on. But where do you see
opportunities to leverage off of your direct bank strategy?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

So in terms of positioning ourselves as the leading digital bank, I think we're in great shape. And it's
leveraging the products we already have. I don't see the need for expanding our products. If you look at
the breadth from home equity to a broad range of deposit products, including checking or debit accounts,
great strength, of course, on the card side and personal loans. So we have the products. I think the
opportunity is building awareness of the products we have and that can drive a lot of growth.

So I'm very excited about where we're positioned. I'd say maybe one of the big differences versus the
neobanks is perhaps a different focus around profitability. So we'll see how that plays out over the long
term. But I couldn't be more excited about where we're positioned.

Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America.

Mihir Bhatia
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

First, I just wanted to clarify, did I hear correctly, you said you have modeled the second round of stimulus
in your modeling for credit?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, we did. There is an input in our modeling, reflecting a second round of stimulus.

Mihir Bhatia
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Understood. Okay. And then just one quick one on the -- I was hoping that you guys operate more in the
network business. Specifically, I was looking at -- it looks like your volumes are growing pretty nicely in
both PULSE and Network Partners. But yet, you attributed the revenue decline to both those businesses.
So I was just wondering, what is happening there? Is it just competitive factors? Is there a mix issue? Just
hoping to get a little more color there.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question. So it was actually a combination of 2 things. So there was a bit of a mix shift
to some products with lower fees and rates. There was also some higher incentives that came through
based on the mix that we enjoyed in the quarter. I would say that in terms of overall volume, it was up

16% year-over-year, at least for PULSE. And certainly, we are happy about that. We are continuing to
look at the mix and incentives to ensure we're driving appropriate level of profitability for the investments
we're making there in the payments business.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Couple of questions. Just first off, on the outlook for growth, I know, typically, it's a function of account
growth and balances per account. And obviously, you've had some shrinkage recently because of the
spend levels that we all know about. I'm just wondering if we could dig into the account growth aspect of
that equation just to understand how account growth has been going. What COVID has meant to account
growth? How you flexed? And do you see any opportunity to accelerate account growth from here as we
go into the back half of the year and into '21?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So just -- one thing on the receivables growth. The higher payment rate is a big factor as well. So
good news on what it's doing on the deposit side of our business. But that is having a significant impact on
loan growth for both card and personal loans. In terms of new accounts, while we don't disclose a number
on that, what I would say is that we think we probably sustained new account marketing more than a lot
of competitors as I look at industry metrics, and so we feel good about that and kept our marketing spend
sort of appropriate for the environment and for our somewhat narrowed credit box with the changes we
made earlier in the year. So I would not expect dramatic changes until we get more certainty in terms of
the pace of recovery, but we've continued to market across all of our products.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. So you've been pleased with your account growth that you've generated over the past couple of
quarters. That's what I'm hearing from you, Roger. Is that right?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And in particular, I think we called out on the last call some of the cost per account that we were
seeing in different channels as competitors pulled back more.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Right. Okay. And then just separately on credit and the outlook for credit here. One of the questions is
around stimulus, and if you don't get it, how much does that impact potential changes in the reserve?
And then the other piece is on the mortgage forbearance. I think I believe a majority of your customers
have mortgages. And I'm wondering if you know through credit data checks how many of those people are
benefiting today from the mortgage forbearance? And does that feed into your reserve analysis as well?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Yes. So I'll talk about the credit outlook and then handle the mortgage question on the back end. So
in terms of the stimulus that we modeled, and it is one of many inputs, and we'll look at what happens in
the fourth quarter and see how the roll rates are progressing in the portfolio through the quarter to get,
I'll say, a bottoms-up view of actually the impact there. So no specific information on that other than to
say that underlying roll rates are far more positive than we thought they would be at this time.

And if another round of stimulus doesn't come in, I think that's going to be tough for a number of people
that have been impacted by the pandemic. And progressively, it will start to impact the prime revolver
base. And that's why we're conservative in terms of our reserve outlook here for the third quarter. But
overall, we're -- again, we're pleased with our positioning.

Now in terms of the mortgage forbearance, I see, we really don't have any data on that. What we are
seeing is our home equity business continues to -- it's open for business. We -- our underwriting standards
have tightened mildly through this, and it's positioned pretty well and open for business.

Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank.

Mengxian Jiao
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I wanted to take a look at capital trends and the buybacks. And I know that you guys are in the midst
of preparing your second stress test submission. But I was wondering in terms of timing as to when you
would get a better sense of the economy in order to possibly execute the buybacks one more time? Is it in
the back half of '21 into -- more into '22? Just any thoughts on when you guys feel you would have more
clarity in terms of the economy in order to reinstate that buyback program?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Great. Thanks for the question. So we're submitting our second round of stress test in November, and
included in there are a number of judgments. I'm not going to get into the details. It'd be premature
on that. I would say, as you take a look at the capital trends for the business, they're super solid. Our
capital levels are higher than our targeted levels. And Roger was specific in terms of our tiering of capital
allocation priorities. So there's no change to that, and we're going to work through kind of the details with
the Fed, other regulators, rating agency and then report. Sorry, I can't be more specific than that at this
point.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.

Mark C. DeVries
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wanted to drill down a little bit further on the funding tailwinds. Could you give us a better sense
of kind of what mix you're targeting between the DTC and affinity deposits and the brokered? Is there
a minimum level of brokered that you want to maintain? And also, kind of what's the funding difference
between those 2, just to give us a sense of how much your deposit funding on average could compress?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we want to keep the broker CD channel open. So we'll continue to kind of test that. The relative
change or difference between the direct-to-consumer and the brokered deposits narrowed significantly.
In the early stages of the pandemic, there was a substantial difference, and the market took care of that
and narrowed the gap. We do enjoy a slightly better pricing if it's a direct relationship versus through a
broker. So that -- that will be our focus. In terms of overall kind of mix of those, I would expect the broker
channel to continue to contract a bit and the direct channel expand.

Mark C. DeVries
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. In the -- with such low funding on the ABS, why not maintain that or expand it? Or are there like
liquidity concerns of having assets unencumbered that you're managing to? Or is there something else I'm
not thinking about?

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, the cost there on the ABS that's reflected is net of the hedge impact. So fortunately, we hedged
those and have a nice benefit coming through over the next couple of years. The actual, I'll say, contract
rate on those ABS transactions, quite a bit higher than that. So that would -- frankly, that was -- the rates
we're enjoying there, it's just good work on the part of our treasury team to hedge that. So we'll continue
to ensure that the ABS channel is there and present and available to us. But it will certainly come down as
maturities profile indicates.

Our next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.

Dominick Joseph Gabriele
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to see if we could kind of square the circle around unemployment and where the
unemployment rate is and the kind of liquidity that the consumer has been given up until this day. And
it sounds like, obviously, we both agree that delinquencies probably, given this liquidity, don't even start
rising until the first of the year. And so when you think about your expectation for unemployment at 11%
by year-end and then where we are and the idea of a white collar rush of unemployment, that would be
quite the rush of white collar unemployment versus the amount of people that are unemployed now versus
a steady state. And so can you just talk about where the -- perhaps the job losses come from? And why
such a large magnitude of white collar versus the still unemployed call it, blue collar that we saw now and
how that's influencing your outlook for the 11% unemployment rate?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Dominick. So you touched on a lot there. And I would sum it up by saying there's a level
of uncertainty around what actually will happen on unemployment. Now the 11% does feel at this point
like, I'll call it, a robust number. But what we're trying to get good clarity on is as the service workers who
initially were impacted by the pandemic containment activity went to the unemployment ranks, some of
those have returned, we certainly have seen some indications across the economy that across the nation
and, frankly, the world that it could be a tough winter here from a COVID standpoint. So that's going to
further impact not only service industry, but the entire economy.

And so as we sit here today, we're mindful of that as a risk and continue to kind of maintain the reserves
where they are. So we don't expect there to be a rush of white collar unemployment. But what will be
clear, and we've seen some of this already is businesses are sizing both their professional staff and the
blue collar staff for the business at hand. And there's enough indications today that there could be some
contraction. And as such, the unemployment, numbers not exactly an easy number to predict, but we feel
like as an input to our model, it's appropriate at this point.

Dominick Joseph Gabriele
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And if I could just have one follow-up here, I really appreciate that. And if you look at the other
expenses on the expense base, it looks like the acceptance incentives came down as well as fraud, even
though we're kind of in this more online environment. Could you talk about what you're doing on the
fraud side and how that was -- and did you negotiated in the global acceptance? Or is it a function of
just volume and mix year-over-year versus the third quarter of '19 on how your expense base and other
expense came down?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So in terms of fraud, it doesn't reflect any renegotiations with any of our merchant partners. Fraud is
one of the areas where we're deploying advanced analytics and next-generation modeling and leveraging

additional information sources. So I'm really excited about the progress the team is making there. And it's
part of why we're so committed to continuing to build out our analytics capability.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And then I would just add in terms of the other expense line. So we did see lower global acceptance
expense in the quarter. And that's a function of 2 things. A little bit on the economy and liability associated
with some of our partners executing on kind of terms associated with previous incentive agreements. And
then, frankly, just a level of uncertainty that's caused us to be cautious on, I'll say, signing up new rich
incentive deals.

Now we're still doing that where it makes sense. But in terms of timing, a little bit cautious on that one.
But we've seen actually great effectiveness from our procurement team, driving year-over-year savings
on the entire indirect cost base. And we're still, as we said in the remarks, investing in advanced analytics
and some digital capabilities that's driving up the information processing. But my expectation is that we
continue -- that we are and we will continue to get more efficient in overall information processing and
technology spend.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

A quick follow-up on credit. There had been a lot of consternation around booming credit headwinds in the
TDR portfolio. Can you discuss how that's been performing?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So thanks for the question, Bill. So you folks don't have the TDR disclosures, but they'll come out in
the Q when it's published. And what you'll see there is relative to the first quarter, TDR volumes will be
substantially down. But there is also the impact of the CARES Act with a regulatory exclusion for certain
modifications that banks such as ours make. So if you put those 2 together and compare where we are
in the third quarter versus where we were in the first quarter and call the first quarter pre-pandemic,
relatively stable. So the point there is that there's not an abundance of activities or a massive jump in any
sorts of activities there that's impacting delinquencies.

We do these programs to improve the cash flows of the company and ensure that when there's a
temporary issue with a customer that they can manage through it and return to paying their bills. So from
a credit standpoint, TDR standpoint, there's been good execution from our customer service teams.
