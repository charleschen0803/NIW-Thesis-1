Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Synopsys earnings conference
call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being
recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.

Lisa Ewbank
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Laurie, good afternoon. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of
Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will
discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial
results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance
as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight
during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC
reports and today's earnings press release.

In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their
most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in
the earnings press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items,
plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the
prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to
Aart de Geus.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Good afternoon. Q1 was an excellent start to the year as we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets.
Revenue was $834 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.67 and non-GAAP earnings above our
target range at $1.01. In December, we communicated our fiscal '20 guidance: high single-digit revenue
growth, substantial ops margin expansion, mid-teens non-GAAP earnings per share growth and more than
$800 million in operating cash flow. We are reaffirming our guidance for the year. Trac will discuss the
financials in more details.

Looking at the overall landscape, ongoing geopolitical tension and the recent coronavirus outbreak have
generated heightened uncertainty around the world. Regarding the virus outbreak, our first priority
has been the safety and health of our employees, customers and partners. We continue to monitor the
situation and support our China teams as they continue to drive business execution. Undeterred by those
challenges, electronics companies, ranging from traditional semiconductor and systems companies to new
startups and hyperscalers, persist in designing ever more complex chips and devices with a high degree
of market urgency. Driven by AI and machine learning, automotive, 5G, IoT and cloud expansion, the
proliferation of smart everything is and will be the central driver for years to come. As a result, robust
demand for our solutions has continued in 2020.

Our innovation and technologies, spanning the spectrum from silicon to software, absolutely central
to the ambitious products and systems being built. Let me share some product highlights from the
quarter, starting with EDA. An important differentiator for Synopsys continues to be our leading position in
enabling manufacturing process development. With highly sophisticated simulation of new technologies,
new transistors and the structures needed for the most advanced fabs in the world, we not only assist our
manufacturing partners but we also lay the groundwork for our design tools to be tuned and ready well
before these technologies go into production design.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

On top of that, over the last several years, Synopsys has pioneered a new approach called Fusion that
literally fuses algorithms from different tools, resulting in faster and lower power chips in far less time.
A showcase example of this is our Fusion Compiler product introduced about a year ago. Within just a
few months of its introduction, Fusion Compiler revealed itself as a revolutionary product. It is winning
head-to-head benchmarks with consistently superior performance, power and area results across a broad
set of applications. Results thus far are ahead of our initial plan, with many customer [ engagements ]
progressing very well from exploring the tool to usage on a few life design blocks to production rollout.

In Q1, we built upon several breakthrough competitive wins ranging from the largest global
communications process and graphics firms to high-impact cloud hyperscalers to multiple influential
system houses. For example, AMD chose Fusion Compiler for its full flow digital design implementation of
its next-generation processes. Fusion Compiler is displacing the competition at a large hyperscaler for our
next-generation ARM core-based graphics design at 5-nanometer and below. We achieved a significant win
at a large multinational consumer electronics company on next-gen ARM CPU core.

We're expanding displacement and deployment at a leading mobile company for critical 5G designs at 5-
and 4-nanometer. A leading U.S. semiconductor company is deploying Fusion Compiler on all new graphics
designs, taking advantage of better run time and quality of results. We displaced the competition for ARM
core designs at a leading automotive semiconductor company, and we expanded proliferation at a large
U.S. semiconductor leader with a new win in wireless design.

While still relatively early in our multiyear product cycle, these important wins represent significant
momentum and usage share gains, which will flow into revenue over time. The Fusion concept is very
powerful and is getting great results across Synopsys as our innovation continues at a rapid pace. Stay
tuned for some exciting new product announcements as we approach our March Silicon Valley user group
event.

Let me now turn to custom design, a product area that underwent a multiyear innovation push and has
seen excellent progress over the last 18 months. Not only are we now highly competitive for advanced
nodes, we continue to see a growing number of displacements and full flow engagements. Our expansion
is driven by fresh innovations focused on maximizing designer productivity. Customers are experiencing
this benefit, and we saw excellent growth in revenue from our Custom Compiler product again this quarter.

For example, a high-impact global systems company expanded its full flow usage of -- in Q1, proliferating
after a significant competitive displacement. Additional Custom Compiler wins include a leading silicon
photonics developer and a CMOS image sensor company.

Let me now move to our Verification Continuing Platform, where we maintain our #1 market share
position. In verification software, we gained share in Q1 at a large global hyperscaler, driven by their
growing needs for verification capacity across our platform. Meanwhile, demand for hardware-based
verification is high across the board, driven by continued complexity growth in new designs. The speed
and capacity of our solutions are particularly well suited whenever software bring-up is involved.

While a strong Q1 last year makes for a tough year-over-year hardware comparison, we continue to gain
momentum with both new and existing customers. In Q1, we gained 9 new logos and 34 repeat orders,
including very high-profile systems and semiconductor companies. NEC, for example, chose our ZeBu
emulation system over the incumbent for their high-performance compute solutions due to our superior
performance, very fast bring-up time and unique debug visibility. In Q1, we also announced the acquisition
of the DINI Group, which further expands our HAPS FPGA-based prototyping portfolio.

Now to IP, which continues to deliver strong results. As the #1 provider of interface, embedded memory,
analog and foundry-specific IP, we provide the industry's broadest portfolio covering all key markets: AI,
automotive, cloud, IoT and 5G mobile. Our demonstrated strength in high-performance cloud computing
applications is evident in several areas. We've already achieved more than 60 design wins in PCI Express
5.0. Our new die-to-die 56- and 112-gig SerDes continues to gain market traction. We also had a
significant IP portfolio win with a major China e-commerce company for micro server applications.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Our leadership position in USB led to multiple Tier 1 processor semiconductor companies adopting
our newest generation USB 4.0 IP in a leading 5-nanometer process. We're also seeing unmatched
leadership and momentum in automotive where our automotive-grade IP is being used by 10 of the
top 11 semiconductor suppliers to that industry. One notable example is Qualcomm, which selected our
automotive IP portfolio including interface, ARM processors and embedded test and repair solutions for the
new Snapdragon Ride platform for autonomous driving.

Finally, we continue to expand our IP portfolio with the acquisition of technologies from eSilicon and
INVECAS, the latter closing just last week. Along with valuable technology, these acquisitions also enable
us to further scale our IP development to meet high customer demand across growing markets.

Now to software integrity, the tools that test software code for security, vulnerabilities and quality issues.
We delivered a solid beginning to the year with business levels up more than 30% over the same period
last year. We see -- we saw continued progress in driving multiyear, multimillion-dollar agreements,
booking several across multiple verticals. As I mentioned in December, we have entered Phase 2 of our
strategy, scaling into the $500 million to $1 billion revenue space.

To accomplish this, we're focused on 4 areas: one, expanding our cloud-based Polaris Software Integrity
Platform through additional product integrations; two, scaling consulting engagements to fully leverage
a key differentiator in the software DevOps market; three, refining our channel to better serve large
enterprise customers, key market verticals and new regional business; and four, evolving our management
team for the complexity and size of a larger business.

We're moving fast on all of these. Just last week, we announced the expansion of the Polaris platform,
bringing static testing and software composition analysis directly to the developer's desktop. This first-of-
its-kind solution enables developers to seamlessly find and fix security weaknesses in proprietary code and
known vulnerabilities in open source code, all within their desktop development environment.

We also added the team and products from Tinfoil Security, broadening our product offerings for Dynamic
Application Security Testing or DAST and adding API scanning capability. Our scaling efforts in the field
are also progressing well as we've ramped up hiring activity and are excited about the sales energy in the
organization.

A good example of the power of the combination of products and consulting is one of the largest
pharmaceutical companies in the world. A relationship that began with a small initial service engagement
to help them respond to a security breach has grown to include both product purchases and now
additional services to help them proliferate our solutions.

We're also moving fast to scale our leadership and management team to the next level. We have launched
an external search for a new general manager to lead the organization into the $500 million to $1 billion
level. While these efforts will flow into revenue over time, we're encouraged by the positive start. There's
a tremendous opportunity in this space, and we're well positioned to enable companies to improve the
security and quality of their software with a combination of high-value products, a great new platform and
enabling consulting services.

In closing, Q1 was a very good start to the year. We delivered strong financial results and are reaffirming
our outlook for fiscal 2020. Even with some caution around global markets, electronics companies continue
to invest in critical chip and system designs as well as immense amounts of sophisticated software. Our
innovation engine is prolific. And this quarter, we will be introducing a number of exciting new products
and differentiating capabilities. We are committed and on track towards our mid- and long-term growth
and margin expansion targets.

Finally, let me thank our customers for their business and our employees for their dedication and hard
work in delivering continued strong results. Trac will now highlight the financial perspective.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong start to the year, meeting or exceeding
our guidance targets for the quarter and we are on pace for our full year plan. We remain relentlessly
focused on execution, generating revenue for the quarter at the high end of our target range and non-
GAAP earnings per share well above the range. We produced another quarter of strong collections, which
contribute to positive cash flow in a quarter that's typically an outflow due to variable compensation
payouts, and we launched a $100 million share repurchase.

Our increasingly diverse customer base and strong product portfolio combined with our nearly 90%
recurring revenue model, position us for success in periods of high demand as well as those of greater
uncertainty. Multiple factors, including the entity list export restrictions and broader trade tensions as well
as the coronavirus situation have added to market volatility. Based on our current view and the strength
of our business, we are confident in our ability to manage through this uncertainty, and we are reiterating
our guidance for the year.

I'll now review our first quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We
generated total revenue of $834 million. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $749
million, with strong growth in IP and a tough hardware comparison over a strong Q1 of last year. Excluding
hardware and the impact of entity list trade restrictions, EDA software results remained within our long-
term target range of mid- to high single digits.

Software Integrity segment revenue was $86 million, 10% of total, and business levels for the quarter
increased more than 30%. Because of our largely time-based model, the associated revenue will be
recognized over the life of the contracts.

Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $747 million, which includes approximately
$9 million in restructuring costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $647 million, resulting in a non-
GAAP operating margin of 22.4%. Our Q1 margin reflects revenue profile this year as well as a change in
the timing of general salary increases now in Q1. We are on track to generate approximately 200 basis
points of op margin expansion for the year. Adjusted operating margin for Semiconductor & System Design
was 23.9% and Software Integrity was 9.4%. Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $0.67 and non-GAAP
earnings per share were $1.01.

Turning to cash. We generated a $10 million in operating cash flow. Including the $100 million Q1 ASR,
we've repurchased $1.9 billion of our stock since 2015 or approximately 80% of our free cash flow
returned to shareholders over that period. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $700 million and
total debt of $331 million.

A couple of comments before I move on to our targets. As I've noted, we delivered a strong start to the
year and we are reiterating our full year guidance. We are maintaining our first half-second half revenue
split of roughly 45%-55%, which reflects forecasted timing of IP and hardware deliveries as well as
general prudence, given the uncertainty around the unfolding coronavirus situation.

For fiscal 2020, we are targeting revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses
between $2.95 billion and $3 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.63 billion and $2.66
billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%; GAAP earnings of $3.68 to $3.87
per share; non-GAAP earnings of $5.18 to $5.25 per share; cash flow from operations of $800 million to
$825 million and capital expenditures of approximately $180 million. We expect capital expenditures to
decline in 2021.

Now to the targets for the second quarter: revenue between $820 million and $850 million; total GAAP
costs and expenses between $724 million and $758 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between
$645 million and $665 million; GAAP earnings of $0.49 to $0.62 per share and non-GAAP earnings of
$0.96 to $1.01 per share.

In conclusion, our focused execution enabled us to again deliver strong results, meeting or exceeding our
targets. With a very good start in Q1, we are reaffirming the full year guidance provided in December. We
are also tracking well to our goals of high 20s operating margin by 2021 and profitability at 30% range
longer term as we move towards our next milestone of $4 billion in revenue.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

And our first question from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Our question on Software Integrity. So you mentioned you had very good business levels. I think you said
30% increase in business levels, but it looked like revenue decelerated pretty sharply in the business. I
just wanted to understand if business levels refer to bookings, and why the deceleration in revenue and
what might drive that to reaccelerate.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

So you're correct. Business levels refer to bookings. And you may recall that last quarter reported that
2019 had been relatively weak in terms of bookings. And so what you saw is the result of that plus
whatever was transacted during the quarter. And so our objective obviously is to now build back to a high
level and we will actively pursue that.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Any thoughts or commentary on when that business might reaccelerate sort of into the double digits or
teens?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, I mean, we just finished what we thought was a strong quarter, so it's easier said than done to
just keep doing that, but that's obviously the objective, right, is to invest in some of the channel areas
specifically that I think can be more balanced for the opportunity space and make sure that we move fast
on the deployment of the Polaris platform and the integration of new capabilities. Those are sort of some
of the cornerstones to the success of the long-term business.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Rich, just keep in mind that in December, we also highlighted that the -- in December, we highlighted the
long-term growth for this business over a multiyear period is 15% to 20%. And we are committed to that
and we should be able to grow at least with the market or faster.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Just a quick follow-up to that. Aart, you've talked about the sales force realignment and it sounds
like some new personnel being brought in. Where do you think that both that sales force is in terms of
structure and personnel relative to where you want it to be? Is there more you need to bring in? You think
you feel like you've got pretty much the sort of the headcount you need to drive the business forward?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, we're now in active hiring. We have hired a number of people. It's both a combination of tuning,
meaning putting it in the right organization and simultaneously filling the holes as we see opportunities,
and there are plenty of opportunities. So no, we are far from done but we have a good start. And actually,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

some of the changes that we made in '19 appear to have generated quite a bit of energy on the part of
the sales force that feels that they have a better shot this year than last year.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

I'd also reiterate that as part of our plan, we did contemplate the hiring, the additional hirings in that
business. We'll continue to invest in that business as it scales. And as we said in December, which we're
still on track for us maintaining margins relatively flat year-over-year. So all the commentary that we
described is consistent with how we're managing the business.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Yes, the bookings sound encouraging. Look forward to seeing the progress there.

Operator

And our next question from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

That's one of the easier questions. It sounds like we have no connection, operator.

Operator

We'll go to our next person, Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

The first 1 I kind of wanted to point to is for Trac. So given the coronavirus, some of the other macro
concerns, my question is since you guys beat pretty nicely in the first quarter, would you have raised the
full year, assuming that there was no macro change? Or do you believe that this is already encapsulated in
your full year guide?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

It's affecting our guidance. I would say that it's not a meaningful impact to the year. We did get a very
strong start to the year. So after 90 days, we feel very good about the outlook for the business on a full
year basis. As we typically do describe, after 1 quarter, it's a good start and it gives us good progress
through the year but there's still a lot of business left to book.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

If I may add to that, our business is actually mostly multiyear. And so we have actually a fairly high
degree of stability in our business towards events like this. At the same time, it is clear that some of the
customers or the customers' customers are impacted because they may not be able to ship products.
And so it remains to be seen if that makes its way all the way to us. But mostly, we're quite isolated or
insulated, I should say, from these type of problems.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Got you. And then for my second one, just on the core EDA business, you guys have talked about
mid- to high single-digit growth. But if I look at this, it looks like for the last about 6 quarters now, it's
been below about 4%. So I guess, why is the time-based revenue flat year-over-year if EDA software
is still growing mid- to high singles? Is that just going to accelerate in the back half? And if so, I'm just
trying to understand why that would be the case.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Mitch, I would separate the -- that question to 2 parts. The first part is, keep in mind that emulation
does show up in the EDA line. So from a product perspective, we've continued to grow very nicely in
hardware, and that tends to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter but is continued growth on a multiyear basis,
that will affect the comparison. The second part, which you're trying to connect to is this license type of
time-based. Remember that last year, we did transition to 606. And the mix that you're going to see in the
time-based versus the upfront line is affected by that revenue transition.

As we described, the numbers and the comparisons for EDA is colored by the timing of hardware this year
as well as the entity list that was affecting both the EDA and IP line. But we still feel very comfortable
about our long-term and -- our model to drive in the mid- to high single digits.

Operator

Go back to Joe Vruwink's line. He is with Baird.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Can you hear me now?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

We can.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to revisit the last question just regarding EDA performance. And I think obviously appreciating
the market uncertainty, but your customers seem to have a more optimistic view on their R&D activity in
2020 and, I would argue, 2021. If that acceleration does come through, is there any reason why your EDA
business wouldn't participate in that trend?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

No. There's no reason it would not participate because we -- as I think somewhat mentioned in the
preamble, we see customers be quite aggressive in what they're designing. And so fundamentally, we are
in a good market, and therefore, participation, be it in EDA or IP in that, is absolutely part of where we
should do well. I think we're cautious just because there's been so many changes in the global market that
have had some impact. As we gave out the numbers, we encompass the fact that we thought there would
be no change to the entity list. And so those are the type of things that we're dealing with for the year.
But fundamentally, actually, I think that we are in a long-term good market, leaving alone massive GDP
fluctuation or anything like that. The technology needs are high for us and that's very encouraging.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then if I can follow up on Software Integrity and maybe trying to reconcile the comments a quarter
ago that orders were a bit softer to what seems really like a snapback to this 30% type number. Is that
just the actions you outlined a quarter ago and you started out the call talking about? Are those beginning
to bear fruit already or are there some other things going on?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, partially, the answer is definitely bear fruit because we have invested and made quite a number of
changes certainly in the latter part of 2019. At the same time, I don't want to set the expectation that

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

over 30% is the norm for every quarter. That's not what we're guiding towards. But the fact is, this was a
very good quarter from an orders point of view, and so that will manifest itself in revenue over time. So I
think we have a lot of opportunities to evolve the business, to be capable of rising above the $0.5 billion
mark. And then you're sort of in a different league of management. And so many of the investments that
we're making are really all aimed at the scale of scaling to that next level.

Operator

And our next question from the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The first 1 is on hardware. So coming out of last year, you mentioned that some large hardware deals
slipped, and I'm not sure if we heard an update on what the expectations are for the timing and delivery
of those now in 2020.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, we typically don't give a specific timing of shipments because some people try to understand which
customer did walk to whom. But the bottom line is one of the reasons that we think we have a strong year
overall is that hardware will be strong and actually, the demand continues in that direction. It is also true
that the delivery is lumpy, and that in itself is visible somewhat in the first half, second half of the year.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. I think I can follow the breadcrumbs there. And then just a follow-up on the Fusion wins, the
competitive wins, specifically where you were -- where you mentioned you were displacing a competitor.
Can you just give us a sense, either a mix or just identify some of the wins, whether these were brand-
new customers to Synopsys or whether they were re-winning or winning back a customer that had maybe
shifted away in the past?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

The answer is yes, yes and yes, meaning that they fall in all categories. In the past, it has been relatively
rare that there would be brand-new customers because the semiconductor industry was relatively stable
and actually partially consolidating. That has changed substantially in 2 ways: one is a number of the
hyperscalers are becoming interestingly -- strongly interested in doing chip design; and secondly, there's
a plethora of IP companies that are doing extremely advanced design on an extremely aggressive time
scale. And for those, the utilization of our tools is just imperative to be able to succeed. So we have
opportunities in all fronts. And the bottom line is we have to continue to push hard on the technology. But
right now, it's very, very strong.

We'll go to Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America Securities.

Adam Gonzalez
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

First, I just wanted to ask about the China market, and can you just discuss trends there, excluding
Huawei and how you see that market moving forward? And then if you see any potential impact from the
proposed changes to the regulatory outlook, whether that's changed to the de minimis rule or the foreign
direct product rule.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Sure. Well, if you take away the entity list, then I would say no change, meaning that China continues to
be very active, moving forward at a rapid pace, adopting new technologies and our business is strong.
Regarding the entity list, we had assumed and somewhat predicted that there would be no radical change
in the near future. So far, that has turned out to be true. But as we all know, things can happen in
unexpected ways depending on how the tensions between the countries evolve. We do not expect that any
part of the specific rules would have major impact on changes in our business because bottom line is to
the entity list, we are not shipping. So that is sort of an all-or-nothing type situation already today.

Adam Gonzalez
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And Trac, just wanted to follow up on the second half revenue outlook. Can you maybe give a little
more detail about what your expectations are for a split between Q3 and Q4? And then I think on the
prior call, for the SIG business, you had outlined that you expect to ramp up spending this year such that
margins would stay relatively flat throughout the year. Is that still the goal?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. That's still the goal. So the -- let me start with the first question, this first half, second half. We
do expect Q4 to be our directionally the largest quarter for revenues and EPS. That's consistent with
the guidance. With regards to SIG, we do expect the hiring ramp to continue throughout the year, and
that's reflected in the 200 basis point improvement. But quarter-to-quarter, you can get a little noisy but
generally flattish with last year.

Operator

And we'll go next to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Aart, my first question, the word North American CPU guy where you found historically a pretty good
position seems to be going to kind of a fundamental change, and they've been buying philosophy over the
next couple of years, where we're going to move away from doing everything, their own IP to maybe using
some more off-the-shelf block IPs within their design. I'm kind of curious, what are the puts and the takes
or the opportunities that, that might create for you or the EDA space?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

John, my apologies but we sort of understood every second word. And so we sort of made out the words
IP and the word trend, I think. I apologize. Is it possible to try to summarize just sort of the 3 or 4 words
that are most interested to you, and I'll try to fabricate a response to that?

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Does this sound better?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Yes. There's sort of this wobbling sound as if you were underwater.

John William Pitzer

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Marginally so. Did I get the word IP correctly?

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. The question is that the large North American CPU guy is moving to kind of a different design
philosophy methodology, where they're going to be using less of their own kind of internal IP design or off-
the-shelf blocks. I'm kind of curious as to what that means for you or the EDA space?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

I think I understand the question. I'll try to reask it a little bit, which is essentially of the North American
CPU guys, are they changing their design methodology to use more reusable IP? Well, I want to broaden
the question slightly because answering for -- there are not that many North American CPU guys, and it's
not appropriate for me to answer in a fashion that recognizes the customers.

But what I can say in general is there's no question that around CPU design, and I'll include in that
GPU and all the views that are specialized for AI, the design methodology is definitely evolving. There's
certainly some people that continue the old way to massively optimize for the last gigahertz, but for a
majority, there's definitely a drift towards applications that use much more data so that tend to be more a
machine learning-oriented. And with that comes architectures that are very much focused on getting data
in and off chip.

And so that in itself brings about a natural increase of potentially reasonable IP. And yes, I think the
quality of the IP, the advanced nature, meaning the advanced nodes that our IP is available today and the
close collaboration we have with all of these customers has made it possible that they're now counting for
design methodologies that use substantially more IP than they did in the past. We expect that to continue,
and we also expect to continue that the IP will become more complex because with the smaller nodes, it
really takes a lot of effort to make them work very well. But it is now absolutely a distinguishing capability
of the company.

So essentially, what I'm trying to express to you is the IP business is difficult, but it is a great business for
us to be in because it will continue to grow. It will continue to be demanding and therefore, a good area
for us to be in. And we have long-term relationships with these customers where they acquire more and
more pieces from us.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. As my follow-up, Trac, you said there was no impact from the coronavirus on the full
fiscal year and that's understandable. Is there any cushion that you're embedding in the current quarter
guidance? And to the extent that Software Integrity is not a part of the op margin expansion during this
year, how do we think about that business going into 2021? And kind of at what leverage levels would you
expect there to be a significant inflection in op margin for that business?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

So. So the question is -- the first question is related to Q2. Our -- my comment on the coronavirus to the
numbers is consistent with Q2 and the full year, it's not meaningful. This is our best outlook for the year
and I think it's pretty consistent with how we've been planning the year. With regards to SIG margins, we
should be improving margins in FY '21, and that's going to be a combination of us growing that business
and continuing to scale that up and be more productive with the investments.

And our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

Aart, for you first. In your answer just now to a question regarding the evolution of design methodologies,
you put it largely in the context of the role or adoption of IT. Could you also speak to that in terms of
core EDA and in terms of how customers are differentiating themselves vis-à-vis design process and the
employment of the tools? I'm sure this has been the case since the primordial days of EDA 3 decades ago.
And -- but when you look at the multiple applications and needs that you talk about, in what way do you
think core EDA design flows, processes, methodologies are evolving or need to evolve for customers to
continue to distinguish themselves aside from your incorporation of standard IP?

For you, Trac, with regard to IT. In fiscal '19, according to the 10-K, there was a $235 million positive
impact from upfront IT revenue although total IT revenues increased by just over $100 million. How are
you thinking about those wonderful 606 mechanics in 2020 with regard to the tough comp you would have
on IT upfront revenue versus perhaps a somewhat easier comp on IT subs revenue?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Okay. Let me start. Of course, your question can lead to 0.5 hour dissertation, which I will not do. But
the first thing to start with is that there's still a continuation of adoption of extremely advanced nodes,
and with that comes a nonstop demand for all of our tools, all the ones reaching deep into the physics
and certainly all the physical design tools to be up to speed with these nodes. And by the way, their
development is less clearly defined in time, meaning that a new node comes out, and then within 3
months, there's another version of that node and another -- [ 3 ] months, another version. And so there's
constant adaptation as people are really squeezing out the max.

Now in parallel to that, maybe less relevant but still worthwhile to note is that some of the older nodes are
also being put more to use as people figure out that was the new tools, they can squeeze out more value
out of those nodes and not all the products need the most advanced capabilities.

Having said that, on the advanced capabilities, if there are 2 or 3 trends I could highlight for the tools, one
is this notion that the capacity of the tools needs to continue to increase, because on Moore's Law, the 1
factor that really has not slowed down is the notion of increased density. Still more transistors per chip
and that adds a lot of value for what you can do. In order to do that, we need to make sure that our tools
interact well with each other. And so the notion of Fusion is really profound because it attempts to have
every tool understand somewhat what the other tools will do and essentially have better team play, so to
speak.

What comes on top of that is that now the application of AI is absolutely deeply anchored already in our
business. And we have capabilities in every one of our tools that are impacted by improvements through
AI and increasingly, [ we'll see ] capabilities between the tools. The last comment I'll make is in the
verification space, where a trend that we had diagnosed early on continues at high speed, which is with
the strengthening of the chips and the combinations of chips, and I'm looking here at things that are
assembled in a 3D fashion of multiple chips talking to each other such as processors and memories and
maybe sensors, the importance of being able to verify both the hardware and the software at the same
time continues to grow because whichever is the slowest or the worst of in quality will determine when
something goes to market. And so that is the area where advanced stimulation techniques, emulation,
prototyping play in. So those are sort of the forces that govern what we do. And I can bet that by next
week, there will be yet another demand for something to keep going because there is no deceleration in
sight.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

So Jay, on your question regarding IP, let me start by saying that we're very positive about our IP
business. This is a -- as we described, a low double-digit growth business. And everything we're seeing
in the marketplace and our bookings continue to reflect that outlook. That said, the 606 transition does

introduce more variability to the numbers on a quarterly basis. But on a full year basis and on a multiyear
basis, this is a very good growth business for us as reflected in the guidance for the full year.

Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

Also Trac, could you update us on your backlog number?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Well, I know you're going to read our Q that's coming out shortly, and you'll see that the backlog is -- it's
pretty steady at [ $4.4 billion] and directionally up versus last quarter. And then within that, the run rate
that we -- the business that we book was actually very positive.

Operator

And our next question from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Jason Vincent Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

The acquisition of Tinfoil fills a nice hole in the dynamic testing side for your SIG portfolio. Can you talk
about how that acquisition came about? And maybe any other small holes your current offering has?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

It is a very nice acquisition. And in these new markets, everybody knows everybody. And so then the
question is always, are there some acquisitions that are both timely, that are economically reasonable
and where we can integrate rapidly in a broader solution? And of course, we have had experience in this
EDA business for many really decades. And so there's some similarity in that. And what was particularly
intriguing is that Tinfoil fits so nicely in the Polaris platform. Of course, we have to do the integration.
But this is exactly the type of capabilities that we'd love to have there because it makes the platform
more useful, more versatile for our customers as they adopt it, and it was designed to make these type of
integrations possible and not too costly.

So if I add to that, the fact that Tinfoil is truly remarkable, high-quality company with some stunning
individuals in terms of their ability to look at the future. We -- and by the way, the locals that makes it
easier to integrate. So far, it looks really promising.

Jason Vincent Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then similar topic, the acquisition of the IP assets over the last few months. How should
we think about those as far as complementary to the growth opportunity in IP or kind of the margin
expansion opportunity in IP?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Very good question. So our IP business is really 2 components: one is to continually drive both the
breadth but I would say just as much the depth of what we do in IP. And depths would be the new
technologies new versions of the technology, et cetera. But the other part is that actually, IP does require
quite a bit of work. They are very often statement of works on delivering IP that fits exactly the needs of
a customer, so maybe some small variations or some tuning for a specific technology. And so continuing
to grow a workforce that can do this is just part of continuing to scale it overall. And so in both the cases
of INVECAS and eSilicon was a combination of some technologies, and -- but most importantly, also a
workforce that was very well suited for the type of needs that we have. So we see it as essentially just
another way of continuing to broaden and grow our business.

[Operator Instructions]

We'll go next to Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I had 2 of them. First 1 for Aart. Aart, if you look at it, like high-performance computing over the last
several years has swung from being centralized cloud and now it's more distributed towards the edge.
Kind of curious, how does this change the EDA landscape, if at all? Did requirements for EDA change at
the edge? I'm just curious on that, and then I had a follow-up for Trac.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, most of the super high-performance computing is reasonably centralized. But it is true that a number
of the edge application, if you call a car an edge, there's a lot of computation that's going into that. And so
I would say in general, the difference of design is not that marked unless you have 2 things that changed:
one is the need for low power, i.e., battery-operated type things. And so there, you have the never-ending
challenge of how much performance can you squeeze out without draining the battery in no time. And
that's not a new problem. It really started to come up when mobility came up in the early 2000s. But
the other thing is that in a number of edge applications now, these computational devices can be used in
machines that can actually be lethal. And a car is definitely potentially lethal but so could be a robot or so.

And so with that comes a whole set of other rules that one have to serve in the design of the chips such
as having the capability for a chip to diagnose itself as faulty, and in some cases, to diagnose itself and
at least temporarily repair itself by having, for example, duplication of some capabilities. Now it took
us a while to catch up on all those rules because many of those rules are very old. They come from the
automotive industry. But now, and I think we highlighted maybe in the script on automotive, Synopsys is
really well on top of this. And so much so that we now participate in the [indiscernible] where the next set
of rules are being developed and pioneered.

So those are sort of the differences. But for the rest, it's like it's never good enough, it's never fast
enough. It's never low-power enough. That continues. And while these sound like negative words, they're
music to our years. A lot more opportunity for us.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful, Aart. And then a quick follow-up for Trac. It looks like your fiscal '20 revenue
guide is largely unexpected because of the virus. I understand the stability of your revenue stream, but
I would have thought that there would have been some impact on the hardware innovation business,
given that's a little more variable. Kind of curious, are you not seeing any of that impact in hardware or
emulation?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Well, our guidance reflects the best information we have right now, and the demand from our customers
continues to be very strong. I think part of it is that it's going to be -- the variability is going to be mostly
on the timing of it, but that's contemplated in the guidance. As far as growth goes, keep in mind every
year, we look at the year and we say that it's going to be hard to grow off of a record year, which is what
we had in 2019. But we feel very good about where we are and the pipeline that we've got in place.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2020

Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

First, on Software Integrity, just how many months are left on the total Polaris rollout? What key
functionality remains to be integrated? And should we expect a step-up in margins once the platform is
fully rolled out?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Maybe it's strange thing to answer, but that rollout will continue, hopefully, for a long, long time, meaning,
many years. The reason being that the basic capabilities of Polaris as a platform are there. Now the
question is, how well do we integrate multiple applications? And the power of a platform is precisely
because it handles multiple applications in a way that makes life much easier for the user instead of
having to deal with different products that may have different interfaces, data representations, et cetera,
et cetera.

So what is encouraging is that we now have already multiple capabilities on there. And you may realize
that, I mentioned that the Tinfoil acquisition is slated to be integrated next. And so that's a good way to
think about it. Hopefully, we can do many more things. Now the platform itself will continue to evolve.
They all do and it's hard for me to say what's the life cycle for a platform in this area, which is still new to
us. But if you look at sort of EDA, our platforms typically have lasted somewhere between 10 to 15 years.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

And [indiscernible] helped drive margin expansion over time as we ramp up on the platform. But it's going
to come across from a variety of things, both revenue growth, operating efficiencies and then getting the
benefit of the platform.

Joshua Alexander Tilton
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

That was helpful. And then just following up on Fusion Compiler. Has it been going up head-to-head
specifically against Cadence's full digital flow? And if so, how have the win rates been there?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, we really have mostly 1 competitor in that area and it's a very worthy competitor. So yes, we
compete all the time against Cadence. Let me just leave it at the fact that, I think right now, we have a
very, very strong capability.
