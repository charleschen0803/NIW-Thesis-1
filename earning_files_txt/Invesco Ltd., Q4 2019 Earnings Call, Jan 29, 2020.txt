Welcome to Invesco's Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference
is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of
Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director, Investments.
Mr. Flanagan, you may begin.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Thank you very much, and thanks everybody for joining. This is Marty Flanagan, along with Loren Starr,
our CFO; and Andrew Schlossberg, Head of the Americas.

And if you're so inclined, the presentation is on the website, if you want to follow along. That said, we're
going to follow the format that we did last quarter where much shorter prepared remarks so we can get to
Q&A, Loren will give a brief overview of the business results before we get into the questions, though.

And as we've discussed on previous calls, we view this combination with Oppenheimer as a multi growth
-- a multiyear growth story that deepen our relationship with those clients, expanded the capabilities we
offer globally, scale the business for both the benefit of our clients and shareholders and we're already
seeing that. This expansion meaningfully enhances our ability to grow our business, achieve very strong
operating results and compete in the ever-increasing dynamic market environments. Importantly, this is a
long-term growth story. That said, we are seeing real and meaningful signs of the power of the combined
firm.

We ended the year with just over $1.2 trillion in assets under management. That's a 38% increase year-
over-year. That's a record high for the firm. We also have higher assets under management across all
channels and all regions as we ended the year.

Long-term outflows for the year were $34 billion. That's an 11% improvement from the prior year. We hit
record levels of revenue and record levels of operating profits for the year ended 2019.

We also achieved significant expense savings, delivering ahead of schedule and at $501 million is more
than $25 million ahead of the synergy target that we talked about at the time of the combination, and
we'll continue to look for additional synergies in 2020.

Lastly and importantly, we did return $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2019. And looking ahead, we believe
we are well on the path to continue to make progress to move into positive flows. In 2020, the key factors
that we look at are improving equity performance and several capabilities where there has been high
demand, continued very strong fixed income performance, meaningful progress in the integration of our

U.S. sales team, strong momentum in our growing China and ETF business, a very strong institutional
pipeline including large wins and solutions; and finally, the clarity on Brexit will help investors move back
to a risk-on mindset, and we are beginning to see that.

So I'm going to turn it over to Loren to talk about the results.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Thank you, Marty. So I'd like to spend the next few minutes highlighting some of the key items for you on
the topic of flows, expenses and capital management.

So starting on flows. As you can see on Slide 7, we're seeing year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter
long-term net inflow improvement in the regions of EMEA ex U.K. and our, Asia Pac area. The Q4 net flow
growth in EMEA ex U.K. was driven largely by our ETF business as well as our direct real estate business.
We saw, for example, $0.9 billion in the S&P 500 USAA ETF and $0.7 billion in real estate.

The Q4 growth in Asia Pacific is largely centered in Greater China and is driven by strong flows into our
joint venture. The JV flows were $2.6 billion across many asset classes with fixed income contributing $1.7
billion followed by balanced at $0.8 billion. We are also seeing quarter-over-quarter improvement in our
U.K. business. We had positive net flows in our institutional business and that was driven by direct real
estate, primarily, but also fixed income where we had $1.3 billion in real estate and $1.1 billion in fixed
income.

Our retail flows do remain somewhat challenged. You'll see the majority of the $16 billion in net outflows
in Americas was attributable to the retail business and that was driven by $9.4 billion in outflows from
some of the legacy OFI funds, some of the largest outflows included OFI global equities, so there was $3.9
billion there and the OFI senior loans, $2.2 billion. But we did see a natural redemption out of the maturity
of our BulletShares. There was $1.7 billion out of that activity.

$0.8 billion came from Invesco International Growth, $0.7 billion from stable value and $0.6 billion
from global asset allocation. I'd like to note, though, that about $2 billion of these outflows is due to the
previously disclosed New Mexico 529 plan. There was a deal-related redemption that we had discussed
earlier.

So on the next page, let's drill down a little bit on net inflows in the Americas. So you'll see on Slide 8, we
show the 2019 history of AUM monthly gross sales and net flows for the Invesco and the OFI U.S. active
retail products combined, which includes periods, both pre- and post-close. Said another way, this reflects
the 2 firms together over the entire period, including the pre-acquisition period.

So these tables highlight a few points. So first, both the legacy Invesco and Oppenheimer funds have
maintained AUM levels aided by the market. Net revenue yields are stable across the time frame.

Second, you'll see our gross sales post-close are still well below the pre-close levels and they did dip in
Q4, although we did see a stronger December.

We've made progress with the integration of the 2 sale teams, and we work to provide the teams with the
tools that they need to hit the ground running in 2020, but we are not fully operational yet. We do have
Andrew Schlossberg, as Marty mentioned, the Head of our Americas business, here with us on the call
today, and he'll be able to elaborate on this during the Q&A session.

Third point I'd like to make is net outflows have been elevated post-close, and this is largely a function of
the abnormally low gross sales levels in conjunction with performance challenges we have in some of our
active equity portfolios.

As you can see on the chart, in Q4, outflows were impacted due to the previously announced $2 billion
deal-related redemption of the New Mexico 529 plan. As we get to the second half of 2020, we expect the
U.S. retail net flows to be on an upward trend. And this should be driven by improved gross sales levels
and moderating redemption rates on many of our portfolios that have recently seen a significant step-up
in investment performance.

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

So next, let's get to expense management and the P&L. So on Slide 9, we set out our revenues and
expenses. You'll see revenues included $52.2 million in performance fees in the period compared to $18.7
million in Q3, and that was largely from our real estate business.

Of particular note, expenses were up $36 million in the quarter. That was driven by several factors, among
which the most significant was the movement in foreign exchange rates and global markets in the quarter.
Despite these factors, we've maintained our focus on expense management and achieving our expense
synergy targets discussed last quarter.

So on Slide 10, we provide additional information about our expenses to highlight the foreign exchange
and market impacts and the other factors that drove Q4 expenses above Q3 levels. I'd like to walk you
through briefly of these variances that are shown in each of the columns on Slide 10 before turning to the
impact of these items on our 2020 expense run rate.

So first, foreign exchange and market. The FX and market, both increased expenses in the quarter by
$21 million. We saw a strengthening of the pound and the euro against the U.S. dollar during the quarter.
Pound was up 7%, euro was up 3%. We also saw other currencies like the renminbi up 3% in the quarter.
Additionally, markets increased significantly where we had the S&P 500, up 8.5%; MSCI Emerging Markets
Index, up 11.4%; Russell 2000, up 9.5%; MSCI All Country Index, up 8.5%. All that impacted our variable
expenses.

The next column is our integration impacts, and you'll see that we realized $3 million in integration
savings in the quarter. And there were $9 million more in savings related to compensation. That was
largely the result of the decline in our bonus pool related to the transaction and integration departures in
connection with the confirmed exits of employees in Q4. These savings, however, were offset somewhat
in the period by about $6 million in property office and technology costs. And that's related to the step-up
in outsourced admin costs, some of which will go away when we get to a single operating platform by the
end of 2020.

The third column to talk about is seasonal expenses. We had about $9 million of our operating expenses in
Q4 were due to elevated seasonal expenses primarily related to marketing spend.

And then the fourth item is nonrecurring items. So we saw about $9 million in expenses fall in the quarter
or occurred in the quarter that were nonrecurring and that's largely in the G&A area with the small
amounts in property, office and technology. These expenses include regulatory, legal settlement, security-
related expenses as well as product launch costs.

So let me next move to the 2020 expense run rate. So if you'll recall, we indicated in the Q3 -- in the third
quarter that our operating expense levels of $726 million would be a good expense run rate for 2020, but
that was assuming FX and market levels consistent with those at the end of the third quarter. So if FX and
market levels remain consistent with the 12/31/19 levels or end of year levels, a revised 2020 quarterly
expense run rate will be $755 million per quarter. And that's comprised of starting with the baseline of
$726 million, as discussed from the third quarter, adding in the fourth quarter FX and market impacts of
$21 million, adding an incremental full quarter run rate expense impact of $9 million resulting from the
FX and market levels at the end of year-end 2019, then you add in the savings related to integration of
$3 million. And then 1/4 of the impact of the seasonally high expenses that occurred in Q4 since that will
probably happen again since they're seasonal.

So the resulting $755 million represents an average quarterly run rate for the operating expenses for
2020. And realistically, I mean, there will be some quarterly variation around this average. A good
example of the quarterly variation is the Q1 increase that we often see or we always see in compensation
expense due to the seasonal payroll taxes, which we'd expect to be about $15 million to $20 million for
the combined organization in Q1 of this year.

The full year 2020 guidance for operating expenses based on year-end 2019 market and FX levels is
$3.02 billion. And we're confident with our -- with our confidence in our ability to maintain this level of
expense based on year-end 2019 market and FX levels, which means that we're achieving our targeted

cost synergies of more than $500 million, and we will continue to update you with respect to our ability to
generate more and greater cost savings as we move through 2020.

So next, let me move to Slide 11 and talk about the increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter.
That was offset by some large movements below the line. In fact, nonoperating net expenses impacted
our EPS about $0.07 quarter-over-quarter, driven in large part by 2 big noncash items. So the first was
that we recognized $15 million in negative valuation adjustments on our co-investments related to our
CLO holdings. These marks are booked on a 1-month lag and so the pickup that we actually saw in the
bank loan market in the month of December was not reflected in these results. But importantly, this is a
noncash item. This is really just mark-to-market activity.

And then additionally, we saw a positive market gains on our seed portfolio, as you might expect, with the
strength of the markets in the quarter. But that was offset in other gains and losses by the FX impact of
the settlement of an economically hedged cash transaction we had in place related to our intercompany
dividends.

Basically, this item is really just the FX impact on an intercompany loan. This represented by the $27
million swing quarter-over-quarter. And then once again, this is a noncash item.

So let me move to capital management, and you'll see on that slide, Slide 12. I think that we did have
-- did not have significant buyback activity in the quarter. I'd also like to note that we paid down our
credit facility balance to 0 and then after completing about $975 million in stock buybacks since the
announcement of the Oppenheimer deal in October 2018, you'll see that we've transitioned to a more
balanced approach to our capital management with a greater focus on our -- strengthening our balance
sheet.

So let me just, in summary, say, we remain diligent in our approach to expense and capital management.
We continue to pursue greater cost synergies related to the Oppenheimer transaction. We are focused
very much so on increasing gross sales in the U.S., and we believe that our sales teams are now
positioned for 2020 with the tools that they need to succeed.
And with that, operator, I think I'll now ask you to open up for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Maybe despite the sort out -- with -- in talking about kind of the trajectory of new sales in the U.S., I
mean, obviously, you've talked about the integration of the sales force and product performance, but could
we maybe -- I'm just kind of curious -- how long do you think the lag is between you -- you've had the
combined forces now for, I guess, going on about 6 months? And what's kind of the lag between when you
get it together and you get out in the field and they start talking to advisers that you think you can really
start to see get back to where the combined firms who are pre-deal?

And then maybe also a little more granularly, if there is, in the U.S., kind of the handful of products that
you think could really kind of drive that demand where you think you could really kind of leverage sales?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Great. Andrew?

Andrew Ryan Schlossberg
Senior MD & Head of the Americas

Thanks for the question. Maybe it's, Robert, important to kind of take a step back for a minute, while we
did put the 2 companies together 6 months ago, it was one of the largest asset management transactions
in history, as you know, and we started putting the teams together then, and we're just kind of getting
them on the field now. One of the really important strategic decisions that we took when we integrated the
companies was to rapidly change the distribution force to meet where client needs are moving to. So we
took a very holistic look at all of our resources and took a real sense of urgency to make change into fully
integrate them, systems and people. So that was something we wanted to do swiftly and right at close.

So the last 6 months, we've made a lot of -- we've had a lot of progress since then. And we positioned
ourselves to start to hit the ground running here in 2020, start to see the progress throughout the year.
And as Loren said, I think getting to the back half of 2020 in a real way.

Maybe to get a little more specific about your question, though, I think there is 3 key reasons why we're
confident in the progress we've made. I think, firstly, we've established what we believe is the leading
distribution force in the U.S. wealth management intermediary industry. As I said, the second reason
is that we've built out a single fully integrated team and product line by end of 2019. And that's pretty
important that we were able to do that. And then lastly, I think we created a truly relevant platform for
top U.S. wealth managers that we serve. And as you know, they're consolidating those relationships pretty
rapidly at the asset management level.

Let me just put a little color around each of those and then I'll pause and get to your second question.
In terms of establishing a leading distribution force, at close, we selected the team and we were about
50-50 from Oppenheimer and from Invesco. So we've got the top talent. We also achieved the synergy
targets that you're familiar with. But we also repositioned the firm toward growth trends. So we positioned
towards high net worth, RIAs, wealth centers, digital data, things like that, while focusing on core key
clients and segments like regional broker-dealers, home office platforms. So we think we've got that
leading team in place now, resources repositioned towards the things I mentioned. I think we feel like
we've built out an integrated team and product line by 2019. We announced the mergers of our products,
ETFs and mutual funds in December. That was a big milestone. It gave clarity to analysts that cover our
products on where we're going. And I think that was an important thing to do. We've also got territories
and training in place. We did a lot of that during the back half of last year to get running for 2020.

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

And then lastly, in terms of having relevance at the top of U.S. wealth managers, we have a significant
seat at the table. I mean now we have over $600 billion with client AUM. With U.S. wealth managers, we
have half a dozen clients greater than $25 billion in AUM and a top 10 position in the largest active fund
categories and the largest sort of alternative beta ETF player out there. So we've got everything served
up, we think, for success into 2020.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Maybe just a quick -- I mean, maybe, this is a little old fashion way to look at it. But I guess I've always
historically thought that any distribution forces, I know, some number, half dozen -- 10 strategies,
products, so you can kind of focus on and really drive. So just kind of trying to get a sense of what you
think those are this coming year?

Andrew Ryan Schlossberg
Senior MD & Head of the Americas

Yes. No, thanks. Probably 3 things I'd mentioned. I think the first and biggest driver of our net flow
success in the U.S. is going to be in the fixed income space. Net flow is active and passive. So as Marty
mentioned, you can see in the deck, our fixed income performance is quite strong across the board. Those
products are capable and ready and in particular, in the muni space, core plus, multi-sector, again, across
active and ETFs. That's a big area of focus for us and where we think we'll see success.

I'd say the second is ETFs, in general, and factors. We had strong momentum in 2019, then we did around
$16 billion positive net flows globally in ETFs. And both income and volatility mitigation strategies that we
believe is going to continue to be important. So that's probably the second area.

And then lastly, I'd say, on the redemption side, just slowing the redemptions on the active equity
strategies, improving performance is common international equity, certain U.S. equity strategies. And we
think coupled with that product integration clarity that I mentioned and the sales team focus on those
redemptions that should be a point of improvement in 2020.

Operator

Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.

Patrick Davitt
Autonomous Research LLP

I think there's been a little confusion on the comment you made in December on inflows and kind of what
you said today. So is the view that you could be an inflow by the end of 2020 or the full year could actually
be an inflow year?

And more specifically, I think you mentioned earlier a strong pipeline and solutions wins, could you maybe
help frame that a little bit more specifically? And within that, how should we think about the $11 billion
solutions when coming through over the next few months?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's a great question. So we're not talking about the end of the year. We look at it as 2020. We see
line of sight for inflows for the year with everything that we've just been talking about today. So it's not --
you'll start to see it pretty quickly here.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes. And I think in terms of institutional pipeline, we've seen continued growth in the pipeline quarter-
over-quarter. It grew about 4% to 5%, both in AUM and revenue basis. A lot of that is being driven by
real estate and other traditional areas, but we're now competing in RFP businesses or opportunities

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

around solutions that we [ hadn't ] in the past. And so as a result, we're actually seeing larger scale win
opportunities, and we've ever -- never -- haven't seen those in the past.

The one that you referenced, the $11 billion is going to happen probably in the second quarter of this
year. I think it was just in -- we said it's in the first half. It's probably more likely to happen in the second
quarter. We are seeing similar opportunities like this of similar magnitude, plus or minus that we expect to
also be generated as an inflow in this year. So more to come on the solutions, but we really, I think, are
seeing significant success now, bringing our solutions capability to clients in a way that we haven't in the
past.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets.

Kenneth S. Lee
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just a follow-up on -- wondering whether you have any updated thoughts on potential incremental
expense synergies? Just wanted to gauge any relative confidence you have potentially on achieving
incremental synergies? And also as well, when you recently broke out the categories for the synergies,
there are some longer tailed categories such as property and office as well as G&A. Just wondering
whether those are the particular areas where you could see some potential incremental synergies.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes. So Ken, thanks very much for asking. Yes, absolutely. Because when we first talked about this
transaction, as you remember, we said that there was a long tail to the integration that would take us
through the full year 2020. And they were related largely to some of these technology and back office
elements. And I even referenced, obviously, there was $6 million that stepped up in this quarter related
to outsource admin costs and some of that will go away as we get through the end of this year, full
expectation. So order of magnitude is, there is something there, probably if you look at the numbers, it
was in the order of magnitude of sort of $10 million to $14 million that could be possibly generated.

We still feel very confident that those numbers will get delivered. I think as we've said in the past, we still
are evaluating how much of that might drop to the bottom line, I guess, versus getting reinvested in some
of the high-growth areas that we've talked about, like China or digital, but we are absolutely through the
course of 2020 going to give you full line of sight as to what we think can drop versus what we feel we
absolutely need to use for reinvestment.

Kenneth S. Lee
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And just one follow-up question, if I may. Just on that slide showing the U.S. retail active net
revenue yield ex performance fees looks as it's been pretty stable recently. I wonder if you could just give
us some color on any relative impacts from either mix shift or changes to gross fee rates.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes. Again, so the one thing I would say that, obviously, this is just an ex ETF. This is really just the core
mutual fund products, additional products. There isn't a huge amount of shift that happens between the
mutual funds. The biggest shifting that we've seen really has been the mix between mutual funds versus
ETFs. This we don't think is going to change. I mean even with the sale of more fixed income, I don't think
this could have a massive or sort of material impact on these types of fee rates. But probably as we do sell
and continue to look at ETFs that will have a bigger impact overall. And so I do think there is still some
amount of expected fee decline for the firm as a whole as we continue to sell ETFs at a higher rate.

Martin L. Flanagan

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Yes, but I think an important point that often gets lost is don't correlate levels of fee rates and profitability.
The ETF business is very, very profitable for us.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Can you talk a little bit about the balance sheet? Loren, I think you mentioned the paydown of the credit
facility and you talked about reprioritizing the balance sheet with regard to capital management. What
does that mean? How aggressive do you want to be here on the balance sheet? Are there any targets
or goals that you can share with us sort of deleveraging or debt paydown or capital ratios that would be
great?

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes. So I think you should expect us to live up to our commitment of the buybacks, which we talked
about, $1.2 billion. We've got about $950 million completed through when we first announced, so there
is some $200 million left that we're looking to complete in this year 2020. Again, we can do more or less
depending on how markets react. But in terms of kind of what you should expect from us is probably a
much more sort of steady normalized buyback pattern along the lines I'm just mentioning versus sort of
the very accelerated front-end loaded buyback that we were doing when a deal was announced.

What we want to do is be able to build up some cash. As we've said, we want $1 billion in excess of
regulatory capital levels. Generally, we're not quite there yet. So there is still opportunity for us to build
some more cash. And we do want to have some flexibility come 2022 when some debt is coming due.

There is $600 million to potentially allow that to be paid down or we might grow it, but having that
financial flexibility by continuing to build a little cash is we think prudent.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just following up on some earlier questions on the Oppenheimer deal. I think the
original target was organic growth of, say, 1% to 2% for Oppenheimer for 2020. Is that still a realistic
target? And if it is, can you kind of walk us through either by distribution channel or maybe a couple of the
big products, like how do you get from sort of the bigger outflows that we've seen more recently to that
flip to 1% to 2% organic growth?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes, let me make a couple of comments and then maybe Andrew can pitch in. So it's really -- we still think
it's -- that is very difficult, the issue will be timing, right? So what you can't foresee when you -- at the
beginning, these things have relative performance. And Loren hit on 2 important areas, the headwinds
around bank loans that came over and one of the international funds. The performance in international is
improving. I think it was -- Andrew has talked about you first come up with slower redemptions, but when
you look through the totality of what's on that platform, we feel very confident about the opportunities.
And we're also seeing opportunities outside of the United States already institutionally and also retail in
EMEA. So again, what we saw at the beginning is something that we still feel very confident, and it is
going to be an issue of timing.

Andrew Ryan Schlossberg
Senior MD & Head of the Americas

Yes. I mean, maybe, the only 2 things I'd add is, we saw, I think, through some of the disruption that I
-- that we mentioned earlier in combining the distribution forces, we can look back at Page 8, we're still

operating pretty well below our gross sales that we had as 2 individual companies. And just getting back
to that level, which we think will happen sooner than later, then lets us sort of go into that acceleration
mode. So I think you'll see it -- we're going to see it on the gross sales side, I think, to make that pickup
happen. The other thing I would mention is, we've been focused a lot on the active U.S. retail position on
Page 8, but the ETFs are going to be a really important accelerant. And with this stronger distribution force
together, we have a lot more energy and resource against growing that business rapidly as well.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

And obviously, some of this has to do with the performance of the products. And we've seen some
improvement. Obviously, we continue to see an improving trend on some of the core products like
international growth is a good example. That's going to really help us achieve those levels, but probably
realistically within 2020, getting to 1% to 2% is probably not realistic at this point. And I think we have a
path to it.

Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.

Sean Colman
Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited

This is actually Sean Colman on for Mike. Just going back to the product offerings. In 2019, we saw a
significant pickup in the industry ESG flows. And it looks like more of a -- there's going to be more focus
on this from competitors and investors. So I'm just wondering what your current offering is there and
what your plans are going forward.

Andrew Ryan Schlossberg
Senior MD & Head of the Americas

Yes. It's Andrew Schlossberg. I'll jump in on the first instance. We've been, like many others in the asset
management space, investing in the ESG space for some time. So our first focus really is making sure
that sustainability and other ESG factors are incorporated into our active strategies as a factor that they
look at. Most of the demand we see from clients, including in places like Europe, is for inclusion portfolios,
not exclusion. So our first protocol is to make sure that we're contemplating that. Where we anticipate
seeing some increased demand, though, is in ESG portfolios and things that -- that's the core focus of it.
We've incubated and put strategies in place across our entire platform. One area of note and then maybe
Marty can pick up more fully, but in the ETF space, in the U.S., we've been sort of running sustainability
focused ETF since 2005. And they're in place. We have, I think, 6 or 7 of them, and we're starting to see
more demand. We expect to see more demand into next year. And likewise, in Europe, we listed a set of
strategies last year to address the same set of challenges and opportunities.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And look, I -- there is -- if you look at where the impact is, where it's been real, it has been on
the continent. If you're not absolutely engaged and focused on ESG inclusion, you have a real business
problem regardless of what you think about it, and you can tell in the United States, where, from my
perspective, it's been more of a

[Technical Difficulty]

pickup. So it is definitely a real opportunity. And really, frankly, something that is going to be absolutely
pervasive, I'd say, throughout the whole industry globally, which is a good thing.

Yes, just, I mean, in Europe, in particular, I mean, we just launched some new ETFs that were ESG
focused in Q4.

I know we have a bank loan capability that's all ESG focused, that is also being sold and doing well.
And the big solution win that we had in the U.S. that we talked about was actually focused around ESG
offerings. So we have the capabilities to deliver on ESG, and we're actively pursuing those.

Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Maybe just to go back to the organic growth trajectory and that flipped to positive and sort of the
timing of that. So you mentioned, Marty, the institutional pipeline with strengthening. Of course, we've
got the -- I think you said now it's an $11 billion mandate that's funding in the second quarter if you could
just sort of go into the different components of that. Obviously, you mentioned Brexit is a little bit more --
the situation there is a little bit more favorable. And if you combine the new -- maybe you can talk about,
actually, the new products that you plan to launch on the Oppenheimer strategies during the year in terms
of the institutional products and then the launching of maybe euro domicile funds. How that plays into
that trajectory of positive organic growth? Certainly, looks like the second quarter you can achieve that
with the funding of the mandate? Do you think you can possibly achieve that in the first quarter given the
trends you're seeing so far?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

The answer is yes. And so let me try to hit the highlights. So you're seeing continued rapid growth in
China. We expect that to continue. The ETF business, what Andrew talked about globally, we continue to
see that positive flows and increasing. The -- there is more as you embrace it, but round 1 has actually
been very important. You can already start to see more positive activity on the continent. You did see
some improvement in our U.K. business just in the fourth quarter. So those are 2 areas where they were
very strong contributors to our business a couple of years ago, but as Brexit became very real like you just
saw an incredible drop off in any real activity as people went to the sidelines. So those are all very positive
along with the institutional business that you talked about. So again, this is -- you're going to start to see
very quickly here all these things starting to show up in the numbers.

And it's quite broad, it's not one area.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

And I mean what we're just seeing is, I mean, solutions is by far and away the fastest-growing part of
our institutional pipeline. The other parts that continue to grow direct real estate and bank loans are their
fixed income as well would be in the areas that proceed to growth in interest.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

And you talked about the Oppenheimer. So right now, I think it was Q4 introduced 4 different
Oppenheimer capabilities into the use of products on the continent. And they were often road shows
in Q4. So again, that's the beginning of that. And also where we've seen interest is in global equities,
merchant markets equities, emerging markets debt, all outside of the United States institutionally. So
again, they're longer tailed engagement institutionally, but they are well known, well recognized, and
there is real demand for the asset classes.

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just to flip to expenses real quick. I missed the comment about
the incremental cost saves in 2020 on that $3.02 billion. Maybe if you can just rehighlight the, first of all,
the $3.02 billion, does that include additional market returns in 2020? And then I know you're still sort
of wrestling with when you get cost -- incremental cost from the deal you may reinvest them. So -- and
maybe just a little bit more color on if that $3.02 billion could be improved by additional cost saves from
Oppenheimer?

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

So on the first question you had, it does not include any incremental market returns that have already
happened in 2020. So there may be some lift depending on where what and how the quarter comes
through. It's really based on year-end levels, December 31 levels.

In terms of incremental cost saves, again, there is probably 10 to 14 that we easily see in terms of
opportunity to deliver more synergies. And so that is something that we will, as I mentioned, so to be able
to talk through, as we get through 2020 as to how much of that could drop to the bottom line versus not.
But the $3020 million does not include any incremental saves at this point. It is really consistent with the
$501 million that we originally talked about.

Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.

Christopher Meo Harris
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a follow-up on the 2020 expense guide. How would equity markets up, say, 8% or so affect the
outlook?

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

So again, I mean, we -- you can kind of look at what happened in this current quarter to get a gauge,
where we did have equity markets sort of similar levels. So again, there may be some parallel there. Now
about the market in FX, about half of that was market and half was FX of the $21 million that we are
showing. So you can get a sense as to roughly $10 million that could be due to an 8% lift.

Christopher Meo Harris
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. Helpful. And then I do want to talk to you guys a little bit about Brexit. So on the one hand,
actually signing a deal would remove a layer of uncertainty, but I guess there is additional uncertainties
regarding how the new Brexit situation might affect the local economy. So like what are you guys seeing
and hearing from your investors? I mean are you actually seeing some folks saying, "Hey, look, once this
deal is inked that might remove so much uncertainty that we can get involved in equities again?" Or I
guess I'm just kind of hoping to get some thoughts about what's driving the confidence there.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes, and it's a very good question. And people are quick to point out, there is -- the second part of Brexit
is a trade deal and how that's all going to turn out. You could absolutely sense the incredible sign of relief
on the continent and in the U.K. with just around when Brexit being agreed. You can start to see that
in the activity on the continent, in particular, in fund flows. It's trailing in the U.K., but again, it's just
a total sense of relief that there is a pathway forward. How high will that enthusiasm be is unclear, but
everybody that you talk about -- talk to there are record levels of cash on the sidelines in the U.K. and on
the continent, and you're not making very much money at all, needless to say, with the rate environment
in negative rates in particular. So that's why you're starting to see some sort of activity emerge.

Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So a follow-up on expenses. And I understand you're talking about synergies and incremental savings. But
if I were just to look at core Invesco when we are sitting here today after the kind of the results and the
flows you're seeing, I think we would be talking about cost-cutting or other ways to curtail investments.
So could you talk about -- obviously, you have the integration and what you've outlined and you've
achieved that, but at the end of the day, the businesses are doing worse than you expected.

So what are you doing, I guess when we think about incrementally to adjust for an environment that
we are now? And I think you've talked about any additional savings or expenses being -- have to be
reinvested in the business. So can you help us think about market backdrop, maybe that's not as
favorable, what you can do or other things beyond just the integration that are keeping expenses under
control?

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes, great question, Dan. So I mean we have been very focused on this deal and the synergies coming
out of this deal. But honestly, it's not where our focus stops. So there is a greater, larger focus about
what happened sort of day 2 kind of ideas around how can we make the entire firm more effective, more
efficient. And there is work being done completely separate from the Oppenheimer transaction about
looking at how can we simplify some of our technology and systems, particularly sort of some of the
systems that may not be directly back office or middle office, but others that sort of getting more into
investment support and other things that could simplify the way we manage our various capabilities. And
that's just as an example of something that is interesting to us because, still, obviously, we do have a fair
amount of technical debt associated with supporting multiple teams. There may be opportunities for us
to sort of streamline some of that infrastructure. So that's a good example of an area that could be quite
large. Other things that have been clearly talked about beyond Invesco, but we're actively pursuing is
how can we move more to the cloud. Having things that are on premise is very expensive due to a lot of
maintenance and support required for that kind of physical maintenance. And so if we can move more to
the cloud, there really is a significant opportunity to sort of eliminate a lot of cost, data centers and other
things that are just not necessary anymore. So those are things that we're working on through 2020,
probably as we get through it, it is more of a 2021 opportunity for us, but we absolutely will want to talk
further through 2020 about some of these ideas as well, not just the Oppenheimer ones.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then can you expand upon the mass mutual relationship and what has happened or what you
are planning in terms of 2020 from a contribution through that channel of those advisers and what kind of
the potential could be there?

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'll make a couple of comments, and Andrew can chime in. So obviously, in the first quarter call,
there's -- there are 8,500 advisers. And literally, it's onboarding capabilities that they couldn't make
available historically looking at areas of alternatives that could be made available to that sales force. Also,
and some conversations going on, looking at their general account around the portfolios capabilities that
we have that they will take on mandate. So again, it's a very strong relationship, and we're expecting it to
be beyond the important shareholding that they have, but also doing business together.

Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.

Adam Quincy Beatty
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to focus in on China a little bit more and your business
there. It sounds like things are going well. I appreciate the breakdown on the flows. Just wanted to get a
sense in terms of the financial contribution, the magnitude and timing that you might be expecting? Also
any regulatory updates and when you might increase the stake in the JV? And finally, any thoughts on the
competitive environment there?

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes. So in terms of the financial, again, I'd point you to our press release, we do provide detail in
the footnotes that allow you full transparency in terms of the revenues and the expenses in our joint
venture. What you've seen is that the margin sort of range somewhere between 40% to 55%. I mean it
moves around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. I think it dipped down a little bit this quarter. But generally,
they're well in excess of the firm's margins and it is a business that has the same kind of very positive
incremental margins you'd expect for something that has generally higher fees and there isn't a lot of
infrastructure necessarily required to support the growth.

So financial, I think it is one that is going to help accrete our margin as we continue to see that business
grow. I forgot the other part of your question.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the shareholding. So yes, we continue to be -- there's a meeting of the minds that will increase
the shareholding. We're not -- we've not come to final terms. But I think a very important point is, it's
less relevant for us than others because the point is we have management control, and we have had
management control of the joint venture. And so we operate in China as really a combined firm because of
that and that's what's unique about it.

If you look at the competitive nature of it, there is estimates that half the flows in the industry over
the next 10 years can come from China. We've been managing Chinese securities since 1992. The joint
venture was 2004, very strong expertise, managed -- of clients in China, $50 billion of Chinese, whether

it be large institutions or the retail business, and we continue to see growth. So it is -- people look at it
as an opportunity. The fundamental fact is very competitive. And to me, my sense is the start-up time to
become successful is quite long tailed. So having the depth of capabilities and tenure and experience is
what we look at as a very important competitive advantage for us.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes. I think I'd also say, just the investment performance of the products that they're managing is
spectacularly strong and so they really do have a wonderful position in the market right now and which
has allowed them to be able to launch products probably more rapidly than others just because they're
seen as being experts in this area when regulators are looking at kind of who's equipped to do these
product launches.

Operator

Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to pivot the discussion on organic growth from AUM to fees for a second. I guess, first, maybe
you could talk a little bit about the fee rates on the $11 billion win you expect to fund in the second
quarter.

And then, Marty, just given your comments around line of sight on positive flows for the year, what are the
fee rates you guys expect to get on that pipeline?

And I guess just taking a step back if you could talk about organic fee growth for 2020 as opposed to
organic AUM growth that would be helpful.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes. So I think as we said, for solutions, it's a solutions kind of typical fees, I think single digits, so it is
not higher fees. It tends to be at a lower fee, which is generally what we've seen. I mean a lot of the
capabilities are going to be in the ETF space as well. So again it's somewhat consistent with the overall
index strategy.

So in terms of overall fee progression, I think we said we're not into forecasting kind of fee rates just
because it is so hard with mix and hard to figure out different things around foreign exchange and market
that moves that around. But clearly, with ETF growth, you'll continue to see some focus on fee rates
coming down as ETFs become a more prominent part of our overall mix. But as Marty mentioned, it's not
margin sort of dilutive. This is very positive margin -- high incremental margins for that growth. So we
absolutely have no issue with sort of our fees coming down due to ETFs growing. The bigger topic has
been outflows in the higher fee product. And so that's the wildcard in terms of predicting this, and then
we've talked a little bit about how quickly can we sort of stem what we've seen around some of those
higher fee redemptions. We're hopeful that we can get there through some of the things we've talked
about, but that's the bigger part to forecast, and it's the hardest one to say how quickly that's going to
happen.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then the second question I had for you guys was just around the non-U.S. growth dynamic,
particularly U.K. and Europe. So clearly, lots of money on the sidelines. You mentioned that, and we'll
obviously see some of that debt as well. As you think about prospect of some of that money coming back
into the investment product, can you share some of the perspective of whether or not you think it's going
to be more of money flowing back into the active product or the passive product? So just some flavor of

17

INVESCO LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

what you're actually hearing from the distribution challenge in the U.K. and on the continent would be
helpful.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'll make a comment and Loren can pick up. So what you saw last year, our ETF flows were sort of
record flows, right? So second largest inflows in Europe into our ETFs. That's going to continue. Look, it's
early days post the Brexit, but the focus on active is actually picking up, and we're seeing that early trend.
And again, I mean, we're not even -- we're almost over January. So I don't want to extrapolate too much,
but there has been a change already.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

Yes. I mean I would just say, I think probably it's going to be a mix, but probably there is going to be
a heavy component of ETFs flowing into Europe. Really, we've seen that, and we don't expect that to
change. What we do think is probably helpful is that some of the active is going to start coming back.
We have some great products that are performing really well. European balance, high income, European
corporate bonds are examples of products that are doing really well from a performance perspective. So
our European lineup on active is actually pretty strong. And so any sort of improvement on sort of the risk
of -- getting more risk on is going to be helpful for some of those cross-border flows coming back to us.

Andrew Ryan Schlossberg
Senior MD & Head of the Americas

And I might just add 2 quick things. One is that initially, the cash balance is being high, the equity demand
has been so depressed the last few years that just a pickup back into equity strategies of low bases,
both active and passive, we expect. And then the other thing I'd mention, which is relevant in EMEA but
also globally that we didn't talk about was we're seeing more demand come into alternative strategies
throughout the world institutionally and emerging retail. So I probably look for flows to return there as
well as people come off the sidelines.

1-year basis. Okay. So it's definitely improved from where it was. So it's not so much that it's going to

better. So that's going to be a big help to the flow story overall.

Andrew Ryan Schlossberg
Senior MD & Head of the Americas

It's a well-established team with high conviction. And as -- again, money comes back also into the
international equity space with some of the headwinds changing or continues to come in with the
performance improvement, we feel better about the redemption rate.

Loren Michael Starr

Martin L. Flanagan

Yes. So the total digital platform, right now, there is $900 billion in assets under administration. So it has
really started to come online the

[Technical Difficulty]

Pretty quickly, you'll see some advancements of clients into Jemstep here in the next little while. The
business -- the continent continues to be very, very strong. This last fourth quarter, we talked about
the model portfolio launch. Clients are starting to come online and that we suspect that would probably
be midyear before you start to see meaningful flows into that. But again, we feel really good about the
strategy, and you'll start to see some good things happening here that we'll talk holistically about it.

Loren Michael Starr
Vice Chairman

I think -- listen, I don't have much more to add other than, yes, so it's a huge opportunity. I think it's less
than 2% of Invesco AUM as a share of the AUA you just mentioned. So it's not material at this point. But
the opportunity that is before us in terms of being able to actually penetrate the AUA is a very real one. So
I think it is a story for 2020 that we hope we're going to be able to tell more fully.

Martin L. Flanagan
President, CEO & Director

And to put that in context of what's the active model portfolios that were introduced in the U.K. about
18% to 20% of that content is Invesco products. And so you put that in the context of open architecture,
any other distribution platform if you had 18% to 20% of the market share that would be -- it's basically 4
to 5x higher than having a successful position in a traditional platform.
