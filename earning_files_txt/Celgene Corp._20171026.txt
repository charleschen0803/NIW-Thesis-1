Thank you, Terrie, and good morning, everyone
The Hematology & Oncology franchise had a solid third quarter, with 10% year-over-year revenue growth
The year-on-year growth number was affected by some volatility in ex-U.S
REVLIMID sales in the third quarter of last year, which I will explain later in the presentation
Our core in-line brands grew across geographies
REVLIMID continued to increase in share and duration in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered robust sales growth with positive performance across all geographies
Our multiple myeloma business continues to demonstrate strong momentum, with significant opportunities ahead of us through our ongoing launches, both in terms of market share, duration, and also through the rapidly increasing use of triplet regimens
We also have a potential transformational asset with bb2121 in the relapsed/refractory space, a patient segment where prevalence continues to increase with the introduction of newer agents
ABRAXANE demand continues to remain stable globally
And IDHIFA was approved in August by the FDA in IDH2-mutant relapsed/refractory AML, and the launch is going well in the U.S
Near-term Phase 3 data readouts for our in-line brands include REVLIMID in lymphoma, POMALYST in second-line-plus multiple myeloma, as well as ABRAXANE in adjuvant pancreatic cancer
In addition to our in-line brands, we've made significant progress with our pipeline
In August, we closed our collaboration deal with BeiGene for BGB-A317, and we are actively working on our clinical development plans to maximize this asset
And we look forward to sharing our A-317 plans with you at ASH
We are advancing the bb2121 BCMA CAR-T program in collaboration with our partner, bluebird bio, and we plan to initiate a pivotal trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma by year-end
The JCAR017 CAR-T program in collaboration with Juno Therapeutics continues to progress, with studies ongoing and planned in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
We continue to advance our luspatercept programs through our partnership with Acceleron as we await results from the fully enrolled Phase 3 programs in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia in mid-2018. We also expect to begin enrollment in an additional luspatercept Phase 3 study in front-line low-risk MDS in 2018. Our plans for marizomib continue to advance, with the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 study in front-line glioblastoma planned for next year
The Phase 3 CC-486 trial in AML maintenance has fully enrolled, and we expect the results in 2018. With CC-122, we now have plans to initiate pivotal registration studies in lymphoma
In September, the IND was submitted for our next-generation CELMoD, CC-92480, in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
REVLIMID third quarter sales increased 10% year over year
, we had 18% year-over-year growth, fueled by continued gains in both duration and market share
We are seeing a positive impact from the post stem cell transplant maintenance launch, and we expect to see continued increases in share and duration in the future from the NDMM and maintenance launches, as well as the use of triplet combinations with REVLIMID
Outside of the U.S
, REVLIMID decreased 2% year over year
As we mentioned on our second quarter call, we have seen some volatility in the international sales patterns for REVLIMID
The Q3 year-over-year growth rate was impacted by this volatility
Recall the revenue for 3Q 2016 was driven higher by the combination of a larger Russian tender and clinical trial purchase, which then affected the year-on-year growth for 3Q 2017. Excluding these factors, year-on-year revenue growth for REVLIMID was 4% for ex-U.S
sales
Of note, year-over-year international volume growth was in the high teens, driven by increases in newly diagnosed myeloma market share and treatment duration in key markets
Today, REVLIMID is reimbursed in many countries for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, including recent reimbursement success in France
REVLIMID reimbursement is also now occurring in the post autologous stem cell transplant maintenance setting with positive uptake
We expect to see continued gains in both share and duration from both NDMM and post transplant maintenance settings
We expect many additional drivers for REVLIMID in the near future
And as I mentioned earlier, we will soon have the results of our R-squared indolent lymphoma trials, including RELEVANCE and AUGMENT
Also, our plans are on track for the submission of an sNDA for RVd for first-line multiple myeloma patients in the U.S
in the first quarter of 2018. All of these potential future launches will continue to drive REVLIMID growth
POMALYST/IMNOVID net sales continued to grow across geographies, with 22% year-over-year growth
, POMALYST net sales grew 32% year over year
This growth was driven by share and duration gains in third-line-plus patients
We are seeing a strong increase in demand since the recent approval of the triplet regimen, POMALYST in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
Just as with REVLIMID, we expect to see additional POMALYST share and duration gains through the use of triplet regimens
Outside of the U.S
, POMALYST/IMNOVID grew by 8% year over year
International volume was relatively stable despite the entry of multiple new competitors in relapsed/refractory myeloma
Finally, we expect the POMALYST and bortezomib-dexamethasone combination from our OPTIMISMM study to provide another important treatment option for patients and potentially lead to increased use of POMALYST/IMNOVID-based triplet regimens with expected increases in both market share and duration
ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall
ABRAXANE net sales grew 8% year over year, and ABRAXANE U.S
sales increased 3% year over year
In the U.S
, ABRAXANE clearly maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and we continue to see stable market share in both metastatic breast cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer
Outside of the U.S
, ABRAXANE grew 15% year over year, with market share gains in metastatic pancreatic cancer
In addition to the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial, we expect the pivotal I/O ABRAXANE-elotuzumab combination trials in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer to read out in 2018. We expect to have a significant presence at the ASH Congress this year, with over 120 abstracts for Celgene brand and pipeline assets
CAR-T will be front and center, with additional follow-up data after the initial presentations at ASCO
We are excited to see updated results of the Phase 1 bb2121 trial, which initially demonstrated very high response rates in very heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma
There will also be five oral presentations covering the safety and efficacy data for JCAR017 in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
And we will also present very interesting combination data for CC-486 and CC-122 in front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and relapsed/refractory lymphoma respectively
And we look forward to sharing more of these exciting data with you at the ASH Congress
In summary, we had a strong quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise
We continue to deliver solid sales growth with many near-term growth drivers
And the momentum of our multiple myeloma business with our in-line brands continues to go very well, with many opportunities still ahead of us
We will have multiple Phase 3 data readouts in our key disease areas of lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and pancreatic cancer for our in-line brands over the coming months
We also expect multiple Phase 3 data readouts for our pipeline assets next year in myeloid diseases
Finally, we continue to advance our other key pipeline assets, including the promise of CAR-T and next-generation lymphoma opportunities
We also continue to advance our solid tumor strategy
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott
Thanks for the question
This is Nadim, so a couple of things
Remember, the 2015 guidance was pre-checkpoint inhibitor space
And so I think if you think about both lung and breast cancer now, where we have more hormonal opportunities, the market has changed quite rapidly since 2015, so that's one
Pancreatic cancer, obviously we still lead there, and this guidance doesn't bake in the I/O opportunity
So for us, that's still potential upside as those studies deliver both in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer
And I'd add to what Mark – in addition to BGB-A317, of course, front-line glioblastoma opportunity with marizomib is another tremendous opportunity for us post-2020. So I think our oncology strategy is coming together very nicely, and we'll update you at ASH, as Mark said
Yes, and I'll add to the question – on bb2121, the short answer is yes, we do plan to expand the development beyond the late-line relapsed/refractory patient pool
And in fact, our 2020 base case currently in the pipeline setting assumes just the relapsed/refractory space
So anything else beyond 2020 is on top of that
I think the team is very excited about having a transformational asset that gives this level of activity in late-line settings, and there are tremendous unmet needs in earlier settings that I think bb2121 could very effectively play in
Thanks for the question
This is Nadim
So the one thing I will point on and remind folks is I think a very good attribute of our multiple myeloma strategy is we don't just rely on one mechanism of action or one class of agent, so we have a multi-modality approach to this disease, which of course then features in the kind of novel combinatorial approaches that you're alluding to, and that's clearly in our sights in terms of our development plans
As it pertains to newly diagnosed myeloma, in addition to the BCMA play that you mentioned, of course, the next-generation CELMoD is an obvious area of opportunity in that setting
So first, we got to make sure we continue to kind of grow today, newly diagnosed myeloma with REVLIMID and relapsed/refractory disease with POMALYST, and the teams we're focusing on that
But beyond that, we're thinking about all of the patient segments that could benefit from our very broad and diverse portfolio
