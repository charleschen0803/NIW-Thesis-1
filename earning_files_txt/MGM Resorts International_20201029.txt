MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference
Call. Joining the call from the company today are Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President;
Corey Sanders, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Hubert Wang, President and COO of MGM China;
and Jim Freeman, SVP of Capital Markets and Strategy. [Operator Instructions] Please also note this
conference is being recorded.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Jim Freeman. Please go ahead.

James Armin Freeman
Senior Vice President of Capital Markets & Strategy

This call is being broadcast live on the internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we've also furnished our
press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.

On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal
securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-
looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. Except as
required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or
otherwise.

During the call, we will also use non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance. You can
find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which
are available on our website. Finally, the presentation is being recorded.

And I'll now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today. I hope you and your families continue to be safe
and well. Over the course of the last several months, we have learned how to respond to the challenges
posed by the virus, and I continue to be impressed by the resilience and the commitment of our team.

We have developed a set of health and safety protocols that have proven effective. Our strong operating
capabilities have helped us effectively adapt to an uncertain environment, and even amid this uncertainty,
we are charting a plan for growth. Respond, adapt and plan to grow has become the philosophy that now
governs everything that we do. We head into the end of the fiscal year with a hopeful but cautious view
of the future. We continue to believe the fundamentals of our business are strong, and that we're well
positioned for the future.

We saw sequential improvements in all of our markets in the third quarter, and our regional properties
have led the pace of recovery with several properties generating record operating performance. While
we saw promising signs of confidence in recovery in the third quarter, we continue to stay focused on the
broader environment.

Our strategies are centered around several key priorities. First, the health and safety of our guests and
employees remains our top priority. We know the success of our health and safety protocols is essential
to building confidence among leisure and business travelers, and we talk about our new Convene with
Confidence health and safety plans for meetings and conventions, entertainment and sporting events,
about which we are very optimistic.

We remain laser-focused on leveraging our operating model to effectively manage costs. Our efforts are
evidenced by our declining cash burn rate, reduced corporate expense and improving in our regional

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

operating margins. We believe that many of these efforts are sustainable. And as we've stated in our last
quarterly call, we identified $450 million of annualized costs when business returns to the 2019 levels, and
we continue to believe this is achievable. Our liquidity position is strong, which we further bolstered earlier
this month through an opportunistic debt offering.

And lastly, sports betting and iGaming continue to gain momentum as states accelerate legalization and
sports volumes ramp up. BetMGM has gained significant market share and has already become a top 3
player in each of our markets where data is publicly available. We remain focused on executing on the
online opportunities while also increasing our long-term presence in Asia.

Let's go into the quarter's results. With the September 30 reopening of Park MGM and NoMad in Las
Vegas, all of our domestic and international properties are now open. Our third quarter Las Vegas Strip
revenues were $481 million, which grew $331 million sequentially from the second quarter.

Our Las Vegas Strip property EBITDAR was $15 million compared to $104 million loss in the second
quarter. On a hold-adjusted basis, our Strip EBITDAR grew $134 million sequentially from Q2 to $21
million in Q3.

In addition, the company extended benefits to our furloughed employees through September 30, and also
negotiated certain union health benefit contributions, collectively resulting in a 21 -- $29 million onetime
expense in the third quarter, of which $21 million was attributable to our Las Vegas Strip properties, not
including CityCenter.

Our third quarter hotel occupancy was 44%. While we continue to leverage our casino database as well
as our transient and leisure segments to help offset the lack of group business, mid-week occupancies
remained challenged at 38%. Our results were bolstered, however, by stronger demand on the weekends
where hotel occupancies were 60%, mostly by design as we continue to maintain occupancy caps for
appropriate social distancing and the quality of the overall guest experience.

While much has been beyond our control, we are focused on what is within our control. As we've reopened
properties, we have aggressively monitor our costs and manage variable labor to closely match demand.
We've also continued to focus on creating a safe environment for all of our employees and guests.

On September 29, Governor Sisolak extended Nevada's mass gathering limitations from 50 people to 250
people, opening the door to restarting meetings and live entertainment. Under the guidelines, we're able
to host meetings of up to 1,000 people as long as they are consistently separated in the subgroups of no
more than 250 people. Just last week, the governor also announced that we're working with the operators
on a plan to increase this further to 50% capacity, hopefully, by January 1.

We have proactively developed a comprehensive health and safety plan for meetings and events and
entertainment and sporting events called Convene With Confidence. We believe these efforts will help
rebuild confidence in safely bringing meetings, conventions and live entertainment back to Las Vegas.
Our Convene with Confidence program is built upon our 7-point safety plan is a comprehensive layered
approach based on guidelines from health experts and addresses the entire guest experience from
ticketing and planning to arrival and food and beverage services.

We are particularly proud of the new COVID-19 testing protocol, which we will be offering as an optional
amenity to our meetings and events clients. MGM has partnered with biometric security identity company
CLEAR to leverage a new health pass technology, including a real-time health questionnaire and COVID-
related test results and temperature checks. This process was utilized in National Hockey League's
successful return to play at the Stanley Cup playoffs in Toronto and Edmonton.

As part of this protocol, MGM is partnering with Q Health to deploy their rapid portable molecular point-
of-care COVID-19 tests that deliver results in approximately 20 minutes and allows the event organizers
to create perimeters for their events and exhibitions. We recently conducted the first pilot at the MGM
Grand Detroit with Detroit Pistons, and they said our testing regime played a "critical role" in their ability
to safely execute their workout program. We've also received encouraging feedback from meeting planners
and existing group customers about our Convene with Confidence program. And in fact, we currently have

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

a group in-house using the testing protocols, and we'll be able to share more of these details in the near
future.

Looking beyond the third quarter, we believe the market will continue to stabilize through -- although
seasonal challenges remain near term. Weekend booking demands remained solid into October, but
driving midweek demand continue to be a challenge without the convention business. We also expect
to see, as we do every year, seasonally lower leisure travel in between the holiday periods in November
and December. As we enter the winter months, we are developing slow period plans for the weekdays to
minimize EBITDA losses.

We are encouraged by the governor's announcement on mass gathering limits with our -- and with our
Convene with Confidence plan as the initial steps to bringing back larger meetings and conventions,
hopefully starting early next year. We also recently announced the return of 7 of our live shows and the
reopening of entertainment venues in Las Vegas. We are very optimistic that meetings and events at scale
will eventually fully return. That being said, we continue to believe that the material recovery in Las Vegas
is dependent on the return of larger scale conventions and entertainment platforms along, obviously, with
significant air travel.

Moving on to the U.S. regional performance, which continued to exceed our expectations and gain market
share. Our regional revenues sequentially grew by $468 million from the second quarter to $557 million
in the third quarter. Our regional property EBITDAR was $146 million in the third quarter compared to
an EBITDAR loss of $112 million in the second quarter. Properties that were open for the entirety of the
third quarter had a 15% revenue decline from the prior year period, but delivered an adjusted property
EBITDAR growth of 7%, with margins improving 768 basis points.

Our drive-to regionals that were open for all of the majority of the greater quarter exhibited particular
strength with margin improvements ranging anywhere from 600 to 1,500 basis points. In fact, MGM
Northfield Park, National Harbor and Gold Strike each achieved all-time record EBITDARs in the quarter,
and MGM Springfield delivered a record third quarter EBITDAR.

Our integrated regional destinations such as Beau continue to ramp throughout the quarter despite
impacting by 2 storms, and the property also currently is closed to the impact of Hurricane Zeta and our
thoughts go out to the team and members and our customers in the region.

MGM Grand Detroit and Borgata are performing well and operating under tight restrictions. And all in
all, we saw an incredible result delivered by our best-in-class regional teams. We believe we are still
benefiting from the lack of broader local entertainment alternatives available to consumers and our
ability to capture an outsized share of wallet. This, combined with our focus on cost, has driven margin
improvements at our regional properties. We are encouraged to see the demand carry into October, and
we will maintain our intense operational focus as capacity limitations eventually ease and the broader
business economy reopens over time.

Turning to Macau, where all the 14-day quarantine measures between Macau and Mainland China have
been lifted and the issuance of tourism visas has resumed, logistical hurdles and testing requirements
have continued to impact the Macau market. As a result, third quarter market-wide GGR was down 93%
year-over-year.

MGM China's third quarter revenues and the adjusted property EBITDAR were $47 million and negative
$96 million, respectively, which improved sequentially from the second quarter. Market-wide daily
visitation has been very steadily improving into October's Golden Week. And since the second week of the
month, we are seeing improved volumes across all segments sequentially week on week. Month-to-date,
we are encouraged that our properties have cross property EBITDAR breakeven levels, led by the recovery
in the premium segments. We expect the rate of recovery will continue to be gradual, driven by premium
mass market, which both our Macau properties are ideally positioned to capture.

We continue to believe in long-term success of Macau, and we'll continue to invest in strengthening our
market position there. Currently, construction of the additional suites in the south tower of MGM Cotai
is underway and will be ready in mid-2021. We've also begun remodeling our MGM Macau villas and the

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

gaming space on level 35. And in both properties, we're also adding food and beverage options focused on
the gaming floors. And longer term, we also have the ability and the desire to build another hotel tower at
MGM Cotai, along with meaningful entertainment assets to diversify our offerings.

In an unprecedented and uncertain operating environment, liquidity remains of utmost importance. Our
liquidity position remains strong. As of September 30, MGM had over $7.8 billion of consolidated liquidity,
which included $1.4 billion at MGM China, $1.9 billion at MGP and $4.5 billion at our domestic operations.

Earlier this month, MGM Resorts opportunistically raised an additional $750 million of 8-year senior notes
at 4.75%, further solidifying our already strong liquid position. Adjusting for this issuance, we had $5.2
billion of liquidity at our domestic operations, excluding MGM China and MGP. And we still also have the
right to cause MGP to redeem $700 million of OP units for cash.

Before we go to questions, I'd like to spend a few moments discussing our position in the rapidly evolving
U.S. online sports betting and iGaming market. Over the past few months, we continue to gain significant
momentum towards solidifying BetMGM as a leader in the space, and we are very pleased with the
results. BetMGM is now live in 8 states, soon to be 9 as of Sunday with our launch in Tennessee, which
we announced earlier this morning, and we expect to be in 11 states by the end of this year. We currently
have market access in 20 states and are actively working to secure more ideally positioning BetMGM to be
front and center of the action from day 1, which is critical as states continue to go live.

From a market positioning standpoint, we believe BetMGM is now a top 3 player in all of the markets that
it's in. In September, BetMGM estimated sports betting and iGaming market share was collectively around
18% in the states in which it operates. We have demonstrated strong operating performance in iGaming
with 23% market share in New Jersey and a growing position in West Virginia, and importantly, we also
grew share in online betting as well and currently estimate our online sports betting market share to be
around 9%. This is exciting, considering we have doubled our market share since January, finally, retail
sports have regained momentum since our property reopenings in Michigan and Mississippi, which are
especially driving great results.

Our partnership with Yahoo! Sports is also starting to pick up steam. Earlier this month, we launched a
streamlined betting experience on Yahoo! Sports, whereby its 50 million average monthly users, including
its DFS users, can direct link now to BetMGM's platforms from their Yahoo! App, register or sign-on and
make a bet. We have more features planned in this near future -- in the near future and remain excited
about this relationship.

We know that an omni-channel customer who plays in the retail casinos, iGaming and sports betting is a
higher value customer of the single channel customer. As such, we continue to believe that BetMGM's key
competitive advantage is its exclusive access to MGM's physical destinations, its broad-based experiential
offerings and M life loyalty program, which is to be leveraged as efficient and effective against customer
acquisition tools as possible.

Through a combination of strategic branding, direct marketing, on the ground brand ambassadors and
hosts as well as the integration of M life with the BetMGM app, we have been aggressively working
to introduce new customers to BetMGM. While we are still in the early innings, we are excited to see
the early proof-of-concept in our ability to acquire higher quality customers at lower costs. On the flip
side, and equally exciting to us is our strong belief that BetMGM will naturally drive expansion in MGM's
customer base as well, ultimately fueling growth in our brick-and-mortar business.

In fact, we are already starting to see cross-marketing opportunities in the near-term and believe this
only get better over time as BetMGM continues to expand its player base. Given the better-than-expected
progress BetMGM is now on track to deliver net revenues between $150 million and $160 million in 2020,
which is an increase from our original $130 million expectation. We continue to believe that this is the
largest growth opportunity in the U.S. gaming, and we think we have what it takes to be a long-term
winner. We're excited -- very excited about our progress, but we know we have more work to do, and we
remain focused on executing.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Again, before I turn it to Q&A, a few closing thoughts. Over the past week, we've been watching COVID
relative trends change across the globe, reminding us all that we're not out of the woods yet. While we
have yet to see any incremental impact to our domestic business, we know we must remain diligent and
disciplined as ever.

I have great confidence in our comprehensive health and safety protocols, which cover all aspects of the
guest experience to which we have strictly and consistently adhered. These protocols and our commitment
to health and safety have allowed us to operate successfully in the last crucial months, and we believe
they will also successfully guide us through the future. While we recognize the near-term headwinds, we
remain confident in the long term. This optimism is driven by our proven ability to react, to adapt and
ultimately to grow.

Despite our challenges, MGM Resorts is a strong company, thanks to an early and unwavering commitment
to the MGM 2020 Plan and a new operating model, an extremely strong balance sheet, a high-quality of
our destinations and path to recovery we are seeing led by our regional operations and of course, our
people who have simply been amazing through all of this, and we'll continue to deliver safe, welcoming
and entertainment experience for all of our guests.

Looking forward to the future, we continue to make progress on all of our growth opportunities,
developing BetMGM as a leader in the U.S. sports betting and iGaming, expanding our footprint in Macau
and ultimately developing a world-class integrated resort in Osaka with our partners and ORIX.
With that, operator, I'll be happy to turn it over to questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question today will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My questions relate to your Las Vegas Strip properties. Bill or Corey, can you talk about Strip EBITDAR by
month and quarter? I'm presuming September exceeded August and August exceeded that of July, really
trying to get to sort of how to think about a monthly run rate of EBITDAR exiting in the quarter. I know
October is not over, but I'm presuming October EBITDAR exceed September. And I guess it almost has to
because those furlough costs go away. But if you can provide some color, that would be helpful.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Joe, I'll kick it to Corey here in a minute. But look, sequentially, yes, there's been improvement. We've
seen that. We mentioned on my comments about a couple of onetime charges, principally around union
benefits that were given the $15 million EBITDAR meaningful to the quarter, the context of performance.
October is doing as expected and done some, but it's a long way to go for the balance of the quarter.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

And Joe, just to give you some color sequentially without giving actual numbers because we won't -- we
usually won't provide monthly results. I would say the trends in all of our divisions seem to be about the
same and getting a little better each month in the occupied rooms in September, as you saw probably
from the statistics from LVCVA have increased in the city.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. All right. Maybe, Bill, can you just provide maybe some additional details or some specificity on
maybe now and maybe you kind of referenced sort of the seasonal lows in November and December, but
how you're managing the strip during different demand periods? And how are you managing this with
labor OpEx, whether you're partially closing some of your properties like what's going on at Encore and
Platinum and others?

And maybe sort of discuss in this context, maybe how much EBITDA delta there is at, say, some of the
properties with the weakest demand in terms of staying open versus being partially or entirely closed?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Well, let me start at 40,000 feet and kind of work my way down. The general notion of being open versus
closed for the quarter provided the company net benefit of about $0.5 billion. So collectively, we are very
happy that we're open for the company, for the communities, particularly Las Vegas and our employees
and for our stakeholders. It's been very beneficial.

We always go through, and we'll do it for sure now recognizing we've got about 29,000 of our employees
back. We will go through a exercise we're doing it now as we speak about what do we keep open and what
do we close? There are certain amenities, there are certain towers, there are certain brands potentially
that will face closure for mid-November prep time frame, give or take, through the holiday season, we'll
see how it goes.

And as we look at the top of the funnel and we think about what's happened within the last week and we
think about what's happening collectively, sequentially, we continue to improve. It bodes well with the

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

understanding that over the next couple weeks, and obviously, recognizing we're in an unprecedented
election season, so we don't know exactly what that's going to bring for the next couple of weeks in terms
of bookings. We're keeping a really close eye on it as we go forward.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Joe, what I would add, I mean, even pre-COVID during slow periods, we would adjust our staffing,
close down towers, close down rooms. We've actually now become an expert at it as a result of COVID and
having to manage midweeks versus weekends. So we're pretty confident that we could be very nimble on
adjusting based on volumes and what's happening in the market. And as Bill mentioned, I think there's
opportunities to reduce towers and reduce hotel rooms in these slower periods.

Operator

The next question will be from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley,.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So you put up really strong margin gains in your regional properties. And I'm guessing it's a mix of
kind of operating efficiencies and then not marketing as much. Can you just talk about -- the color
around the future operating cost controls is obviously very helpful. But can you just talk about marketing
reinvestment spend a bit, just like how much you think you can reset it lower long term?

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Thomas, this is Corey. Yes. Look, I think in general, in the regionals, in particular, there's not a lot of
competition for the consumer dollar right now. But we have really learned and streamlined our marketing
component. And so I think as we look going forward, the cost structure and adjusting our cost structure,
there's some permanent components to that, including marketing dollars. The top -- I guess the bigger
concern is the top line going to be sustainable. And as of now, and what we're seeing, it continues to be.
But I think these properties are well positioned to have margin growth over the prior years.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Helpful. And then you touched on the prepared remarks about, hopefully, Nevada will allow conventions to
reach 50% capacity on January 1. Do you have a sense that demand will be there, if that's allowed?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Tom, look, I mean, obviously, we've seen in the very large-scale things because of pre-planning. We've
seen substantive cancellations. It's not going to surprise anybody into the first quarter. What's relevant
and important is that we hold on to the back half of the year. And so the fact that we can demonstrate
growth, the fact that we can demonstrate that we can execute and do this safely we'll be very comforting.
The back half of our year is holding extremely well. We have ups and downs, but we are where we should
be, where we want to be where we have always been, which is relevant. So I think fundamentally, people
aren't leaving the market. They want to come. Obviously, it's predicated on what the governor ultimately
allows us to do, what the conditions allow us to do. But we feel good about that.

I think the second quarter will be the swing as people stay and/or come or go, will depend on where
we are in the health arena, if you will, in the cure, and they're thinking about it. But overall, the year is
looking -- I think the year is looking as we thought it would a quarter ago. I don't think a whole lot has
changed from what we anticipated to happen. So as we think about '21 and '22, it's holding together,
particularly, obviously, as you focus on '22.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Bill, you just addressed a lot of it and Corey as well, but as it pertains to kind of out year group and
convention business, during this last few months, I mean, have you guys -- or what has the experience
been with respect to groups looking to book maybe in '22, '23 and beyond? And when we start to think
about kind of the days of vaccine and corporates and business travelers getting back on the road, how
quickly are you guys able to kind of ramp up pricing on kind of the group and convention side with a layoff
kind of as long as we've been through right now?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

So I would tell you, September, which was the last time, and we're going to read on October and a couple
of days here, was an exceptional booking month for the future. We -- it's the best booking months we've
had in 7. And so I think the tell is that people are still booking into the future. They're excited to do so.
Sequentially, over the last couple of months, we're up a couple of hundred percent in terms of confirmed
contracts. And so I think that's all affirmative.

I think the essence of it is, in '20 -- anytime '21 second half and beyond, when people are confident that
they can meet, they will come and fundamentally not much has changed. I think we have to get through
this current environment. And then ultimately, in the interim, we have to prove what we do have, we can
do safely, which to date, we've managed to do so. And so beyond '22, we feel strong. '21 will be the year
of -- let's see how this plays itself up.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

What I would add, Carlo, what we're seeing, especially in some of these bigger groups, they're booking
multi-years. They're trying to take space going out to '25 and '26. Rates are going to be -- they're better
than what's in the rooms right now. There -- I won't say they've completely reset, but depending on
demand in the periods, they're booking, it's, I would say, similar to what it used to be in the past. And
these multiyear contracts will have rent escalators.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. That's good to hear. And then just 1 follow-up in terms of some of the cost strategies you guys
have put in place. To the extent you could quantify, what was the exit rate of cost extracted from the
business coming out of September relative to kind of where you went into the 3Q? Just in terms of
expenses you've removed from the system during this period, and that's maybe Las Vegas regionals or on
a combined basis, if you could speak to that?

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

So what I can tell you, Carlo, is as we were about $20 million a day pre COVID. When we closed down,
we went to to $3 million a day. We're about $10 million a day right now, knowing what is still left to come
back, including entertainment and convention, understanding our business better, really understanding
what amenities we will need going forward, ones we won't need, reducing loss leaders. We have a pretty
good idea of the number that we put in our presentation of the $85 million is pretty well-defined and won't
come back into the system.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And maybe another way to quantify it is occupancies are down collectively about 50%, and our payroll is

to have foundationally going forward, I think we've done a really good job controlling those controllable
costs to the point of we've built back half of our business with less than half our -- particularly, our most
expensive cost are payroll cost.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

And the marketing dollars are part of those numbers we've identified.

Next question is from John DeCree with Union Gaming.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Securities, LLC, Research Division

I had, I guess, a bigger picture question, maybe thinking a little further ahead. So you've got quite a
stockpile of cash, and it's a really nice liquidity reserve to have right now. I think hopefully, sooner than
later, we'll be through the pandemic. Wanted to kind of get your thoughts on the other side of this, where
you feel comfortable with net leverage? And how you would think about deploying some of that cash, if
hopefully, you don't need to tap into it.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, John, for going forward. Appreciate it. So look, obviously, we're in a great position. God
forbid, we have to use more of it than we have historically, that we're going to stay and go in the right
direction, which we're fairly confident across the system, we're going to be able to do that. But if we don't,
obviously, we've got the liquidity in each of our markets, including Macau to sustain. And so we're excited
by that.

Getting ourselves back to norm, understanding by this time next year, what looks '22, '23, we'll begin
to think about growth in real terms. We'll begin to think about ultimately, what we need to do here in
Las Vegas to continue to own the marketplace to the extent that we do in some of our assets here. We'll
continue to invest into sports betting. We are sincere about that opportunity.

We've demonstrated clearly that we are a key player in all of the markets that we're in. It's kind of
interesting to me that we are third or better in all of those markets, but in fourth place in all of those
markets, there is individually somewhat different. So there's like no fourth place, clear winner. And so
continuing to invest to that business is critical to us because we think over the long haul, there's an
amazing convergence of customers and activity that's going to be beneficial.

Obviously, we have our eyes on Japan. That's a key prize. We think it's meaningful. It will take -- I don't
know exactly, but between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of real liquidity over 2 or 3 years of a build cycle in
the middle of this '23, '24, '25 time like that. We've got to get there. That opportunity has been delayed,
but we believe in earnest, we're in a great position. We want to continue to pursue that.

And then, look, we'll be opportunistic. We're not overly focused on M&A, particularly here in Las Vegas.
We think we own enough of Las Vegas to be open about it. But there will be other opportunities that
the market presents to us that we'll have to take a sincere look at. But for now, we just love the safety
and security of the liquidity. And obviously, at some point, shareholder return will come back into play.
Obviously, we stopped paying a dividend and other things. And we'll play that out as time comes. But for
now, we like the position we're in.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Securities, LLC, Research Division

It would be a good problem to have with $5 billion almost of cash on the balance sheet. I think you
touched on my second question about M&A and Las Vegas. So I'll shift gears a little bit and ask if you
could provide any kind of color about the occupancy mix that you're seeing, if there's any differences

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

with the customer in midweek in hotel and really getting at kind of relative to historical levels. Database
utilization, OTA utilization, I mean, where are you and if you could share any color on hitting different
levels and if it's kind of trending differently over the last couple of months?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

I think it's a little bit more of same. The operative word is more. It's leaning heavy into casino. Obviously,
our convention business has gone to nil. There's more transient -- interesting drive traffic is up in
September at 8%. So above last year, by the way, when I say it's up 8% above last year. So drive market
out of Southern Cal remains strong. Obviously, transit casino marketing as a percentage of our mix is in
the 30s. Traditionally, it's much lower than that.

And so the RevPARs coming out of that segment are very good. And so they outperformed, so that's to
our benefit. And without other major events to drive things, I think that market mix here through the first
quarter is going to probably sustain. And then hopefully, regrow back into a more normalized basis with
conventions and whatnot.

Operator

And the next question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

You guys talked a little bit before about the seasonal adjustments you might be making in Vegas. But in
addition to that, I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit about what you're doing to better preserve price
integrity at the properties and perhaps improve some of the customer mix you're seeing? I think you've
instituted certain regulations around parking and anything else you're doing to improve the customer
experience at the properties? And maybe it's as simple as just lowering the occupancy, but I'm just
wondering what else you're doing.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Felicia, it's Corey. I'll take that. From the beginning, as we reopened, we were very focused on not
only the safety, but the customer experience. So we have, as we've talked about in the past, constrained
our occupancy on the weekends. Bill mentioned a 60% occupancy level there. On the weekends, we're
very disciplined on our pricing, yielding it probably similar to old times and having price integrity.

On the weekdays, I think it's very similar to any slow periods that the town has always experienced. MGM
does have minimums of the lease amount we will charge for our rooms. And it's a matter of everyone's
going after the same customer on midweek at the 30% occupancy.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And then, Felicia, we've put in universal protocols around parking, admittance into various things in the
building, recognizing some of the challenges we've had over the last couple of months. And I think we're
in a much better spot. I don't want to knock on wood here, but the last several weeks, I think things have
changed. The dynamic feels different, which is important to all of us. And so I think the community, we've
done more than our fair share, but we think the community has risen to help make this a better, safer
environment.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's great to hear. And Hubert, if we could move on to you, we got some details about Macau earlier in
the prepared remarks. Just wondering if you have any sense if the visa procurement and approval process
is getting any easier? And what's your view on the VIP market and liquidity?

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Zhi Qi Wang
President of Hospitality & CFO

Certainly. So in terms of visa application process, it's still a manual process that people have to go to
the Police Bureau to apply for it after they get the online appointment. And -- but we have seen the
application time shortened a little bit. And it's not across the country, in some regions only. So in general,
I think that there's no dramatic changes, still a manual process, no kiosks, but we see a little bit regional
-- region-by-region enhancement improvements in terms of timing. In terms of liquidity in the market,
we really haven't seen a lot of changes or material impact to our business at this time. So we'll keep on
monitoring.

Operator

The next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Hubert, maybe 1 more question for you. Just on Macau. I think in some of those prepared remarks, it was
mentioned that you'd seen some improvement from the second week of October on. I was just curious, if
we kind of compare things to the declines or the year-over-year declines we saw during Golden Week, did
you exit the month of October better than that? Or just kind of -- could you give us a sense of maybe how
the month progressed? And what kind of improvement you're seeing kind of right at this moment?

Zhi Qi Wang
President of Hospitality & CFO

Certainly. I think the Golden Week was pretty -- relatively speaking, pretty strong coming out of the
month end in September, the first week of nationwide IVS reactivation. So the second week of -- post
Golden Week during that week, naturally, the volume dropped down. But I'm happy to say that in the past
couple weeks, we have seen some regrowth in -- across all segments. And that has generated enough
GGR to allow us to be slightly above breakeven.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then as my follow-up, maybe to switch gears to the kind of higher level of strategic question
there. With obviously a very large investment and several board members appointed by IAC during the
third quarter, I was just wondering if you could talk about any contributions that they've made so far as it
relates to maybe the core operating strategy of the company? And specifically, if they had any role in the
kind of new appointment on the COO side for BetMGM?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So Sean, look, they've been nothing but participative and active. Mr. Diller and Joey Levin, both
Board members came out and spent 3 days with us undertaking and understanding as much as they
could, the totality of the business. Obviously, we're leaning heavy at this point with spend into BetMGM.
So there's a keen focus on that. And they've been very active in helping us understand that. And with
that, they've been helpful with us.

We're trying to understand how to raise the bar on our loyalty program and the digitization of it and
what to do and to drive share of wallet. They have a lot of exposure and experience there. And so overall
message is very excited. They've joined, very active and very excited about that. It's been nothing but
collaborative and supportive.

As far as Ryan Spoon, we had sourced Tim, we were -- well, ESPN and BetMGM have had ongoing
conversation for a better part of 9 months when everyone was frenzy to find a media partner. We had
met Ryan, liked him a lot. He thinks clearly about the business. He's extremely strategic. He's a product
guy by nature. And so the actual offering and the app we think he'll bring a lot to all of that, and it'll

help us think about how now to do a media deal, it's simply not an advertising buy and how to get a true
partnership with somebody that's going to be lasting and something different than some of the things that
have happened to date. So we're really excited he joined us.

We did have Joey Levin, of note, talk to him because we wanted to get his perspective and it gives you
kind of an indication of kind of the engagement these guys are actively doing with us, and we're excited
by it. So I appreciate the question.

Operator

And the next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I'm looking through a couple of the pages of the deck as I'm listening to you talking about specifically
about the digital business, iGaming and sports betting. And I'm just trying to hone in on what the 2 or 3
critical reasons for success ultimately should prove to be. Whether that's -- the market access, obviously,
is what it is. But if you could talk more about your technological advantage, you make reference to a
single app and is that sort of a unified app that will be across all states rather than different apps in
different states as some have?

And if you could color in just a little bit more on the relationships with the sports leagues and exactly how
that works, that would be helpful. That's my 1 and 1 follow-up. I apologize.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So look, in the collective, obviously, we have a JV with GVC. And the great news about that has
been, they own the technology outright, and therefore, BetMGM as their contribution owns its own
technology. And so that's a decisive advantage in the context of focus, what we can do with it, how it
presents itself. And yes, we aim to have 1 app. We have won now everywhere but here in Nevada because
of regulatory environment, and we look and hope to change that. And there's motions afoot to do that.
And ultimately, and most importantly, hope to have 1 wallet. Because that's really where you load up,
whether it's here, any other of our casinos, you load up into your account, to the extent you can transfer
that money back home and continue to play and therefore, we can have 365 engagement is essential to
the relationship in the longer run.

So the technology platform is essential, having 1 look and 1 universe for the customer that's both brick-
and-mortar in terms of M life experiences, betting experience and ultimately, digital experiences, both
in iGaming and in sports betting is critical. We do something fairly unique in our little play studio social
gaming. We have a back and loyalty engine that ties customers to loyalty here and get some benefits to
the extent that they spend time on that device. We want to do the exact same thing for this.

And so it's been interesting in the last couple of months, last month of note, 28% of the customers who
signed up with BetMGM came from M life and then the inverse happened. 25% of the new customers for
M life were BetMGM customers. And so you can instantly see and we're just getting going, where there's a
convergence of it. We also identified in New Jersey 167,000 customers in the New Jersey Metro, meaning
our market demo, that haven't been touched yet by us that are now bet MGM customers. So we can go
out. We know 167,000 new people, and we can go out and ultimately offer up our Borgata offering. And so
we think it's meaningful. We think it's going to be the differentiator over time. Because we can tie digital
into brick and more like nobody else. And so we think it's a big differentiator over time.

The second part of the question, the sports leagues have been helpful. Candidly, we got a little over our
skis in terms of time, meaning we jumped in with both feet. We are trying to develop everything from
play games where to get people acclimated and get them going in a league like major league baseball, to
where we have had active engagement in different contests and things and sponsorships with PGA of note.
You probably saw just with the CJ Cup what happened last week at Shadow Creek or 2 weeks ago now.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

And so we continue to nurture those. We think the exposure for the BetMGM platform is unique, and you
probably haven't turned on a TV recently for Monday Night Football, World Series, it's extensive. And so
we're leveraging on those deals to be able to get exposure to that brand in that way.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I appreciate that. If I can seriously sneak in just 1 follow-up, which is, in this environment, we're seeing
a fair amount of spinning and separating, et cetera. Are you comfortable that the digital business can
operate with its own mind and its own cap structure and its own resource set within the auspices of MGM,
which is obviously a large and vast enterprise?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

We've done everything we can not to screw it up, not to touch. No, I'm -- I know the nature of the
question. I get it. And we've hired a guy named Adam Greenblatt, runs the enterprise, and he comes out
of GVC and runs it well. People like Ryan, who have now joined the enterprise. We have a brilliant CMO
and CFO. And so we like what they're doing. We have literally gotten out of their way.

Obviously, regulatories and government affairs is stuff that we can provide access to M life and properties
and retail business is stuff that we know and we provide, but we are trying not to manage that business.
We want to let them manage it and to grow it. And so yes, we're going to provide capital because it's
capital intense, but we are trying to get out of its way.

Operator

Our next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Bill, given you operate a sizable retail Sports Book, how does that inform you of the potential margin
structure for BetMGM longer term? And with multiple peers willing to invest seemingly at a loss, what are
the guardrails that you're thinking about in deciding to defend or even grow your market position?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

So Steve, the first question again, I didn't quite -- I didn't hear it clearly, about the retail...

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

How are you thinking about from BetMGM margins? And how does the retail margins on sports -- Sports
Book inform that view?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Okay. It's kind of interesting. I just looked at September numbers just for Nevada. 55% of the business is
online already. And so it is changing the nature of even how we do retail sports betting. They're no longer
the racing sports books you probably traditionally have known. There are more every place we can go.
We've done this in our regional properties. We're starting to do it in Vegas. They're more lounge.

And so it will help overhead. If people are digital, it will keep people out of lines. It will get embedding
more. And ultimately, once in player comes in play, we think it will really engage that exposure and
experience. But they are unique.

16

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

They're great places to come enjoy a game. They're at scale. There's other benefits, obviously, people can
enjoy in and around them. And so we're uniquely positioned in that regard. And so we're pretty excited by
it.

To the extent we talk about overall investment, I think the one differentiator between us, particularly in
DraftKings is we're not doing a national ad campaign. You will see a lot -- you've seen the thing we do
with Jamie King -- Jamie Foxx. Jamie King is a personal friend of mine. But the thing we've done there is
resonating, but it's only in market. So it's in those 9 -- or actually, we're pushing to a couple new markets
that we're about to launch, 11 markets.

And so while none of this is inexpensive, and obviously, it's not cash flow positive for now, there
are criterias, and there is a collar around what we're prepared to invest to gain new access and new
customers. And we think in the long run, it will be -- it will pay off.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful color. And as a follow-up, you mentioned that BetMGM and M life have seen some
convergence. How do you think about the impact of iGaming on your brick-and-mortar business longer
term?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Well, at top line, I don't worry about it. If that's the essence of the question. It's been the age old
question, we'll try what casinos -- both casinos, well, regionally, et cetera, et cetera. And I think the
industry has manifested away always to benefit from it. So we're not concerned with that. I think we've
-- well, unfair to say, but what limited exposure we had to a growing iGaming share in New Jersey pre-
COVID, we didn't see that it was taking from it. And now in fairness, it's only been 2 or 3 months, and
then we ran into COVID. So I can't tell you. Obviously, we will watch, but we are all in on iGaming, and we
don't view it from the lens as others made that it hurts my brick-and-mortar business. We think if done
productively and promoted correctly, it can help your brick-and-mortar business.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. That was more of the impetus of the question was how are there ways to actually make it help the
underlying brick-and-mortar business. And does that mean that you would be more likely to support
legislation in new markets going forward?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Absolutely supportive. We are not going to let our brick-and-mortar business get in the way of this
business. We want to be smart about it. We've spent a great deal of time energy and money, and I'll give
a good example, Massachusetts. And so we have a footing there.

We think we've -- by the jobs we provided the capital resource we put into a state like Massachusetts,
we want a preemptive leg up. They have a huge stick over us from a licensing -- they have something to
hold over us if we screw it up. And so that aside, we're very active, and we're very encouraged by what
hopefully all this brings.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

And Stephen, this is Corey. I do think it is a customer acquisition tool, as we've seen in New Jersey. There
are unique players online that did not visit a facility. And it's also an extension to their overall gaming
experience, whether they want to do it, analog or digital.

Next question is from Robin Farley with UBS.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Last quarter, you had given us some insight into the fact that all of your properties in Vegas were cash
flow positive, except, I think, at that point, Mandalay. Now that you've got all your properties open, can
you kind of give us a sense of how things stand? Are they all positive cash flow at this point, including or
not including Mandalay?

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Robin, in general, they are flowing positive other than Park, which just opened at the end of the
month. And I think in general, when you look at the third quarter in particular, on the operating properties,
the properties that were open, if you take the EBITDA number, add back the onetime charges in the
hold and back out even what was burning, the number probably would have been around $70 million,
somewhere around there for the whole quarter on operating properties only. Obviously, as we open more
properties, it's going to potentially take some EBITDA from the existing properties. But in general, we like
what we saw in the third quarter. We were able to get -- when you take back out those onetime benefits,
we were even able to get Mandalay Bay positive.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And actually, that's why I was just going to clarify because it sounded like before that you thought
you might not be positive there until convention business came back, but you're saying you actually are
already positive.

Corey Ian Sanders
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. They've been a very attractive property in the summer because of the pool. And so we saw some
pretty positive at least occupancy and RevPAR numbers there.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Right. And then a separate topic, just on the timing of the $700 million in MGP units that can be put for
redemption. Is there -- can you give us any sense of your timing of when you might do that? Or kind of
what would be the trigger for that?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Look, there is -- we have until February of '22 to execute on it. And so obviously, we're going to -- we're
not going to let that go by the wayside. You just saw what we did in the bond market. We thought it was
opportunistic. So it's not about liquidity. It will be about timing and what else to be done with the money
and what else is going on with MGP at the time and what it's trying to structure into. But there is no
definitive time collectively right now other than recognizing. Again, we have until February of '22. And
between now and then, we'll clearly do something. We feel we're in a really good position there. And when
we do it, we need to make sure it benefits both parties.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Right. I wonder if I could ask 1 more that I guess I'm surprised hasn't come up in the Q&A. I know in your
comments, you kind of indicated that you weren't that interested in owning more Vegas assets. But if
there are some significant assets in Vegas that are going to change hands that are going to come up for
sale. How do you think about the impact on MGM if somebody else ends up owning those assets and like
the type of fire that, that might be and what would be sort of good for MGM or less good for MGM?

Look, I'm not going to obviously comment directly on M&A. I assume you're referring to the Sands. Look,
they're good operatives. They're very good operatives. And they -- collectively, we all work well within
the city, particularly of late to help convention business and infrastructure, traffic, et cetera. Whether that
trades or not, I guess the good news is if they get anyone the other $6 billion they're talking about, it
speaks good for Las Vegas fundamentally in the long run.

So I think we're excited by that. They're good competitors when it comes to the convention business. So if
somebody else comes in who is not as strong, it bodes to our benefit. And I'll hold by my earlier comment,
we have enough of Las Vegas right now. So we're going to kind of wait and see and watch.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for 1 more question and that question will be from Barry Jonas with

I presume, Barry, you are talking about COVID environment, correct?

Barry Jonathan Jonas

Correct.

William Joseph Hornbuckle

Yes. There's a great deal of pressure of late from legco, legislative body to have the Chief Executive come
out and begin the process because it is going to be a public process. He speaks in November. I think
Hubert, you might know the date, I do not. To date, they seem to be saying they're on track, which, as
you know, is by June of 22. They've got to give 6 months notice. So '21 will be a very active unless they
delay it a year. Given what's happened with COVID, I guess they could. But as of today, they seem to be
on track. I don't know, Hubert, if you have any more color there?

you're thinking about parking and I guess, resort fees here?

Well, resort fees are part of the overall experience and critical to our revenue stream. So we think we like
them. Full stop. Parking is tenuous. We're not in any big hard to jump back in it with both feet. We think
it's a deterrent right now, given pricing. And so we're going to continue to moderate it. There is -- going

back to the other comment about safety and security and garages that's part of a discussion. And do you
charge to help protect that? And there's things that we're thinking about ways to potentially do something
that's meaningful without hurting our business. Our retail business, whether it's rooms, shows, to the
extent they exist in food and beverage. So we're watching what they have done very closely. And frankly,
