Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Phyllis, and I am your event operator today.
I would like to welcome everyone to today's conference, Public Service Enterprise Group Second Quarter
2020 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 31, 2020, and will be available for telephone
replay beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 11:30 p.m. Eastern Time on August 11, 2020. It
will also be available as an audio webcast on PSEG's corporate website at www.pseg.com.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Carlotta Chan. Please go ahead.

Carlotta N. Chan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, and thank you for participating in our earnings call. PSEG's second
quarter 2020 earnings release, attachments and slides detailing operating results by company are posted
on our website at investor.pseg.com, and our 10-Q will be filed shortly. The earnings release and other
matters discussed during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to
various risks and uncertainties. We will also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings and non-GAAP adjusted
EBITDA, which differ from net income as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. We include reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures and a
disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements on our IR website and in today's earnings materials.

I'll now turn the call over to Ralph Izzo, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PSEG. Joining
Ralph on today's call is Dan Cregg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion
of their remarks, there will be time for your questions. Ralph?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Carlotta, and thank you all for joining us. PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the
second quarter of 2020 of $0.79 per share versus $0.58 per share in last year's second quarter. PSEG's
GAAP results for the second quarter were $0.89 per share compared with $0.30 per share in last year's
second quarter. Our results for the second quarter bring non-GAAP operating earnings for the first half of
2020 to $1.82 per share. This increase over non-GAAP results of $1.66 per share for the first half of 2019
reflects the growing contribution from our regulated operations, effective cost controls at both the utility
and PSEG Power, the absence of 2 extended plant outages that took place in last year's second quarter,
and the favorable settlement of audits covering the 2011 through 2016 tax years which, in combination,
have mitigated much of the weather-related headwinds experienced in the first quarter of 2020.

Slides 11 and 13 summarize the results for the quarter and the first half of the year. We're especially
pleased to report solid operating and financial results at both businesses. Our employees continue to
effectively respond to the challenges and requirements of providing essential energy services under
extraordinary conditions. The statewide mandated closure of most businesses, schools and government
buildings in New Jersey, contributed to a decline of approximately 7% in weather-normalized electric sales
for the second quarter. As the state continues the gradual reopening of businesses and activities, effective
containment of COVID-19 should expand commercial activity and energy usage in the months ahead. New
Jersey has done a very good job of flattening the curve of new COVID-19 cases over the last few months.
But we must all remain vigilant as we see signs of potential increase.

Earlier this month, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities -- I'll just say BPU, authorized utilities in the
state to defer prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 from March 9 of this year through
at least September 30, 2021. PSE&G will file its first quarterly report to the BPU on August 3 outlining its

PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31,
2020

COVID-related costs and offsets for the period ended June 30. And we expect to report our deferral in the
third quarter.

Our utility field crews are at full force and construction work continues on our infrastructure programs. In
May, PSE&G also resumed on-premises customer work using personal protection equipment, PPE, as you
-- as we often referred to it, customer contact screening and physical distancing to ensure customer and
employee safety. Our associates who are able to work remotely continue to do so, and we are continuing
to assess when we will begin a phased return for those employees.

In early June, Southern New Jersey experienced a series of severe straight-line storm systems known
as a derecho, with high wind speeds that topped 93 miles per hour and resulted in 127,000 customer
outages. The extent of the damage to poles and trees plus the ongoing high winds and required physical
distancing restrictions made the storm particularly challenging. PSE&G crews work day and night on
outage restoration and were ably assisted by mutual aid from PSEG Long Island to help restore power in
New Jersey, and we can't thank them enough.

This ability to draw on local mutual aid from New York is especially critical now given the impact on our
work crews of New Jersey's required 14-day COVID-19-related quarantine periods for visitors coming from
states with increasing or still high infection rates.

PSE&G continues progress on its portfolio of capital improvements, including several key transmission
projects. This quarter, we energized the second phase of our $739 million Metuchen-Trenton-Burlington
project and upgraded the transmission circuits between Brunswick Station and Trenton Station. The utility
also expects to complete work on a 6-mile upgrade of 230 kV overhead transmission circuits running
between Aldene Station and the Linden variable frequency transformer station by year-end 2020, having
already completed approximately half of this important project.

On the regulatory front, we're in active discussions with the New Jersey BPU and other parties to settle
several items, including the return on equity related to PSE&G'S Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
FERC, formula rate for transmission as well as the pending $2.5 billion 6-year Clean Energy Future energy
efficiency filing, which restarted in June following the BPU's adoption of a framework to implement energy
efficiency throughout the state. Our proposed program is expected to create 3,700 jobs over 6 years.

The final energy efficiency framework adopted by the BPU in June was an improvement over earlier
versions and supports expanded utility investment in energy efficiency by broadening utility participation
and program offerings by eliminating the ROE reduction applied to energy efficiency investment,
by extending the amortization period to 10 years and delaying any penalties until the fifth year of
implementation, while increasing state's energy savings targets to 2.15% and 1.1% for electric and gas,
respectively.

In addition, the BPU directed utilities to work with BPU staff and rate counsel to establish a conservation
incentive program, or CIP as I'll refer to it, to recover lost revenues or use the lost revenue adjustment
mechanism, also known as LRAM, has the default alternative.

As I said a moment ago, PSE&G energy fines have declined due to the COVID-19 restrictions, but peak
load for the second quarter remained in a normal seasonal range, averaging 5,100 megawatts versus last
year's second quarter average of 5,330 megawatts. PSE&G summer load peaked at 9,753 megawatts in
2019. So far this summer, we experienced a peak load of 9,521 megawatts on July 22, about 2.5% below
last year due to COVID-19, but helped by warmer weather. That said, PJM day-ahead round-the-clock
power prices have remained in the mid-teens to low $20 per megawatt hour most days during the second
quarter.

More recently, New Jersey has experienced several weeks in a row, with temperatures hovering in the
mid-80s to mid-90s. Even with this recent heat wave, average day-ahead prices have only crossed the
$30 per megawatt hour price point in the PSEG zone twice in the last 30 days. This is a reflection of
current market conditions, characterized by reduced loads, sub-$2 per MMBtu natural gas and ample
generation.

PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31,
2020

This market environment is the reality we face at our nuclear stations and as the market is the driver
behind zero-emission certificates, or ZECs. Our Salem and Hope Creek nuclear plants produce over 90%
of New Jersey zero-carbon electricity. These nuclear units are a cost-efficient and necessary component
of the state's transition to 100% clean energy by 2050 as outlined in New Jersey's Energy Master Plan
finalized this past January.

As we begin the second round of the ZEC program by filing our applications this fall, it's important to note
that the financial need for ZECs is more critical than ever. PJM forward prices have declined from where
they were just 2 years ago when forward round-the-clock prices for the PSEG zone were approximately
$30 per megawatt hour. Today, they are just over $25 per megawatt hour.

ZEC payments compensate nuclear generation for the zero-carbon attributes that are otherwise
unrecognized by the wholesale markets and are an essential component to the economic viability of
the New Jersey nuclear fleet. The second ZEC application process is expected to conclude with the BPU
decision in mid-April 2021.

On the ESG front, I'm pleased to report that PSEG is gaining broader recognition for our industry-leading
position. As many of you know, our carbon intensity is among the lowest of our industry peers, driven by
the large percentage of our output from nuclear power plants. And our utility is working hard to reduce
emissions through its clean energy filings and infrastructure programs.

In May, our ESG score from MSCI was raised to AA from A, placing us in the top 20% of all companies
they evaluate on environmental, social and governance disclosure. And in June, PSE&G was recognized
as a trusted brand, ranking first among combined gas and electric utilities by Escalent in the 2020 Cogent
Syndicated Utility Trusted Brand & Customer Engagement study.

Turning to earnings guidance. We are reaffirming PSEG's non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for full
year 2020 of $3.30 to $3.50 per share. Based on our solid results through the first half of the year and our
confidence that we can effectively manage costs across our businesses, continue executing our investment
program at PSE&G and provide New Jersey with reliable sources of electricity. We are on track to execute
our 5-year $12 billion to $16 billion capital plan without the need to issue new equity and our net liquidity
position as of June 30 remains ample at $4 billion.

And finally, as you have all seen by now, this morning, we also announced that PSEG is exploring strategic
alternatives for PSEG Power's nonnuclear generating fleet. Our intent is to accelerate the transformation
of PSEG into a primarily regulated electric and gas utility, a plan we have been executing successfully
for over a decade. PSEG will explore how our potential separation of the nonnuclear assets could reduce
overall business risk and earnings volatility, improve our credit profile and enhance an already compelling
ESG position driven by pending clean energy investments, methane reduction and zero-carbon generation.

We believe PSE&G is among the best utilities in the country and that our valuation should align with that
profile. PSEG intends to retain ownership of PSEG Power's existing nuclear fleet. The nuclear fleet is a
necessary component and enabling New Jersey to meet its long-term carbon-reduction goals, and also
helps to satisfy the state's capacity obligations for resource adequacy with a cost-effective source of zero-
carbon electricity.

Given the relatively small part of PSEG that the nonnuclear business represents, this decision will not
have an impact on the company's current shareholder dividend policy, which will continue to be subject
to approval by the PSEG Board of Directors. PSEG will manage this process, taking into account the
interest of our diverse stakeholders, including our 13,000 valued employees. Any decision regarding the
nonnuclear assets will not impact PSE&G or PSEG Long Island customers, their operations or tariffs, but
would be subject to customary regulatory approvals. Marketing a potential transaction in one or a series of
steps is anticipated to launch in the fourth quarter of this year and is expected to be completed sometime
in 2021.

We're excited to explore the opportunities that will shape PSEG's future. It is a future focused on
advancing our business as a sustainable, customer-focused provider of essential electricity and natural gas

service, delivered by a regulated utility and contracted businesses. I will now turn the call over to Dan for
more details on our operating results, and we will both be available for your questions after his remarks.

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

Terrific. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Ralph said, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating
earnings for the second quarter of 2019 of $0.79 per share, and that's versus $0.58 per share in last
year's second quarter. We have provided you information on Slide 11 regarding the contribution to non-
GAAP operating earnings by business for the quarter.

And on Slide 12, you'll see a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter
in non-GAAP operating earnings by major business. So now I'll go through each company in more detail,
starting with PSE&G.

PSE&G reported net income of $0.56 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with net income
of $0.45 per share for the second quarter of 2019, and that's shown on Slide 16. PSE&G's second quarter
results were driven by revenue growth from ongoing capital investment programs. Transmission results
contributed an incremental $0.05 per share to second quarter net income, which included approximately
$0.02 per share related to 2019 true-ups and lower pension expense.

Gas margin was $0.02 per share favorable, driven by gas system modernization program investments
and weather-normalized volumes. Favorable weather comparisons quarter-over-quarter added $0.01
per share. And while electric bad debt expenses recovered through our societal benefits charge, gas-
related bad debt expense in excess of the amount included in rates, reduced earnings by $0.01 per share
compared to the second quarter of 2019, reflecting higher uncollectibles related to COVID-19.

Distribution-related depreciation and interest expense each lowered net income by $0.01 per share. And
nonoperating pension expense was $0.03 per share favorable compared to the second quarter of 2019.
And lastly, flow-through taxes and other items were $0.03 favorable compared to the second quarter of
2019. That's driven by the timing of taxes and the settlement of federal tax audits for the 2011 to 2016
years.

Weather in the second quarter of 2020 was favorable compared with the second quarter of 2019, but year-
to-date, weather remains a mild headwind. Early summer weather was below normal, but 7% warmer
than second quarter 2019 and weather-normalized electric sales in the second quarter, declined by about
7%, with residential loads up 8%, but more than offset by commercial and industrial sales that were
approximately 14% lower in the quarter. I note that a majority of residential margin is driven by volume,
while commercial and industrial margins are driven by peak demands. So as a result, for the year-to-date
period, the net margin impact of higher residential margin has largely offset the lower commercial and
industrial demands.

On a trailing 12-month basis, weather-normalized electric sales were down approximately 3% and gas
sales were flat, with residential electric and gas usage both up by over 2%. PSE&G's capital program
remains on schedule. PSE&G invested approximately $600 million in the second quarter and $1.2 billion
through June as part of its 2020 capital investment program. The 2020 capital program reflects $2.7
billion in electric and gas infrastructure upgrades to our transmission and distribution facilities to maintain
reliability and increase resiliency. And we continue to forecast over 90% of our planned capital investment
will be directed to the utility over the 2020 to 2024 time frame.

PSE&G has continued the temporary suspension of nonsafety-related service shutoffs that began in March.
And in July, the BPU authorized regulated utilities in New Jersey, including PSE&G to create COVID-19-
related regulatory asset by deferring prudently incurred incremental costs beginning March 9, 2020,
through September 30, 2021. PSE&G is evaluating the order and expects to record a deferral in the third
quarter of 2020. PSE&G's forecast of net income for 2020 is unchanged and at $1.310 billion to $1.370
billion.

And now moving on to power. PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter
of $0.24 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $258 million. This compares to non-GAAP operating

PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31,
2020

earnings of $0.13 per share and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $211 million for the second quarter of
2019. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP operating earnings
measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. The earnings
release and Slide 22 provides you with a detailed analysis for the items having an impact on PSEG Power's
non-GAAP operating earnings relative to net income quarter-over-quarter. And we've also provided you
with more detail on generation for the quarter and for the first half of 2020 on Slides 23 and 24.

Power second quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were positively affected by several items that, in
total, produced results $0.11 per share higher than the year-ago quarter. The June 1 scheduled increase
in PJM capacity revenue moderated non-GAAP operating earnings comparisons to a decline of $0.07 per
share compared with Q2 of 2019. The addition of ZECs to second quarter results added $0.02 per share.
Recontracting and market impacts lifted results by $0.03 per share, reflecting seasonal shape of hedging
activity and lower cost to serve versus the year-ago quarter. Gas operations improved by $0.01 per share
over the prior year quarter. And lower O&M expense was a favorable $0.06 per share comparison over last
year's second quarter, reflecting savings from descoping the plant Salem 2 refueling outage in April, the
absence of last year's Salem 1 extended outage, the absence of cost at Keystone and Conemaugh and
lower fossil outage and maintenance expenses.

Lower pension expense added $0.01 per share versus the year-ago quarter. And taxes and other items
were $0.05 favorable compared to second quarter 2019, driven by the settlement of federal tax audits for
the 2011 to 2016 years. Gross margin in the second quarter was $33 a megawatt hour, approximately the
same as last year's second quarter. Power prices and natural gas prices stayed low as reduced commercial
activity across PJM, New York and Maryland resulted in depressed loads.

Turning to Power's operations, total generation output declined by 3% to total 12.7 terawatt hours in
the second quarter of 2020, reflecting the sale of the Keystone and Conemaugh units last fall. Power's
combined cycle fleet produced 4.9 terawatt hours of output, up 3%, reflecting the addition of Bridgeport
Harbor 5, which was placed into operation in June of 2019. The nuclear fleet operated at a capacity factor
of 91.9% for the quarter, producing 7.8 terawatt hours, up 9% over the second quarter of 2019, and that
represented 61% of total generation. This quarter's higher nuclear output reflects the absence of the
extended Salem 1 outage in the second quarter of last year related to repair of reactor vessel bolts.

Power continues to forecast output for 2020 of 50 to 52 terawatt hours. And for the remainder of 2020,
Power has hedged approximately 95% to 100% of production at an average price of $36 a megawatt
hour. Lower prices for power and lower spark spreads have resulted in a slight reduction in our total
forecasted combined cycle generation volumes in 2021, where we have hedged 65% to 70% of forecast
production of 49 to 51 terawatt hours at an average price of $35 a megawatt hour. And for 2022, Power
is forecasting output of 50 to 52 terawatt hours with approximately 25% to 30% of total output hedged
at an average price of $35 a megawatt hour. Forecast for Power's non-GAAP operating earnings for 2020
remains unchanged at $345 million to $435 million as does our estimate of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of
$950 million to $1.050 billion.

I'll briefly address the operating results from enterprise and other, where for the second quarter, we
reported a net loss of $2 million compared to a net loss of $34 million for the second quarter of 2019. Our
non-GAAP operating results for the second quarter of 2020, a loss of $2 million compared to non-GAAP
operating earnings that was flat for the second quarter of 2019. And the net loss in the second quarter of
2020 reflects higher interest expense at the parent, partially offset by ongoing contributions from PSEG
Long Island. And for 2020, the forecast in this area remains unchanged at a net loss of $5 million.

PSEG's financial position remains strong. At June 30, we had approximately $4 billion of available liquidity,
including cash on hand of about $400 million and debt represented 52% of our consolidated capital.
During the first half of 2020, PSEG also issued 3 364-day term loans, totaling $800 million for an added
liquidity cushion. PSEG has $700 million of floating rate term loans maturing in November of 2020. PSE&G
issued $375 million of 30-year, 2.7% secured medium-term loans in May and has $259 million of medium-
term notes maturing during the remainder of the year. And Power retired $406 million of senior notes in
April and ended June with debt as a percentage of capital of 29%.

Our credit rating agencies published updated research for PSEG during the second quarter, with
unchanged ratings and a stable outlook. And we expect to fully fund PSEG's 5-year $12 billion to $16
billion capital investment program over the 2020 to 2024 period without the need to issue new equity. As
Ralph mentioned, we continue to forecast non-GAAP operating earnings for the full year of $3.30 to $3.50,
and we look forward to moving ahead with the strategic review we reported earlier today.
Phyllis, we are now ready to take questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Maybe if you could help us just size the EBITDA for the nonnuclear generation assets. We're thinking it's
roughly 20% of the total Power EBITDA. Does that seem reasonable? Can you comment on that?

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Durgesh, we have not broken that out in the past and are not going to do that at this juncture. I think
as we continue to go through the process, more information will come forward. But at this point, we're not
going to provide that, and you can pull together your best estimate.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. That's fair. And maybe can we get your thoughts on just in terms of the current market for
just your merchant generation and going into the strategic review, how are you thinking about valuation
for these assets? Just any high-level color on that front.

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

I'd say, Durgesh, our expectations is to conduct an extremely robust process without predetermining or
self-limiting it in any way, and we'll let the market decide what these assets are worth. All highly efficient
and good heat rates, environmentally-compliant in terrific markets. So we're pretty optimistic about it.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And just one really quick one and then I'll jump back in the queue. Is there a regulated to
nonregulated business mix, Ralph, that you are targeting from this transaction?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So what we're trying to do is become as regulated as is possible and whatever remains being as
contracted as is possible to remove that earnings volatility and to have people explicitly recognize the
valuation that PSE&G deserves. So the contracted piece would be things like PSEG Long Island, right?
That's a multiyear contract to operate that system out there. And then to the extent that the nuclear
plants are supported by ZEC. That's not exactly contracted, but quasi supported by public policy and
instrumental in terms of New Jersey's carbon aspirations.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Right. So basically we get to regulated -- get to as high regulated plus contracted mix as you can.

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, that's exactly right. So to get rid of the merchant piece, yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just want to follow up with the strategic process as well. And just wondering if you could give a little
bit more flavor as far as why now versus any point in the past. And I imagine it's sensitive overall the
process, but I didn't know if you could speak at all to what would be the driver for a single-asset versus
multi-asset process in the release, You mentioned in the release, just trying to see what details you can
share here.

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Jeremy. So we have said for quite some time that we eventually thought these businesses would
separate, and we gave certain conditions under which we thought that would happen. And one of those,
I won't bore you with all of them, one of those was a sustained discount and evaluation, which to us, will
be a demonstration that investors were not satisfied with an integrated model. And we have a couple of
things that we're in the process of tackling that seem to us, at least, to be in the market waiting for good
news. So the utility is going to grow at 6.5% CAGR. But CEF is going to add to that. So that's the absence
of a positive. We've been very public about our discussions on transmission ROE. So that's a bit of an
unknown yet, but not a big unknown. And we got good news coming out of the FERC MOPR in terms of
our nuclear plants, being able to bid basically at 0 and clear that market. So the remaining piece is the
discount associated with having the integrated model. And you can't put our current valuation all on the
backs of transmission ROE. You'd just have to make -- forgive me if it's impolite, but some really crazy
assumptions to get PSEG valuations that make sense with that being the only case. So we don't -- we just
said it right, that predetermined factor that we've always been paying attention to, which is a sustained
discount in valuation appears to have manifest itself. So let's pursue acting on that.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. That makes sense. That's helpful. And just...

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

And U.S. also, in terms of pieces or the whole thing, I really -- at the risk of repeating what I said a
moment ago, our plan is to make this process as robust as possible to get the cleanest signal from the
market about how to optimize the value to our shareholders. And if that means one check for everything
or 5,700 -- 6,700 checks for each megawatt, I'm being absurd there, obviously, we'll entertain that whole
range.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And then do you expect any material change to managing the nuclear portfolio
after you divest the other power assets? And how might the sale here impact your financing plans given
the importance of power, free cash flow to funding utility growth?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

So in terms of the nuclear -- I'll let Dan speak to the financing. But in terms of the nuclear operations,
they have largely been separate for their entire existence. Nuclear has its own engineering group, its own
maintenance group, its own operations group, its own supply chain, its own HR support, so that should be
a nonevent from an operations point of view.

Yes. I think from a financing perspective, I think that one of the key uses of proceeds, I think, would be to
pay down debt at Power. Obviously, if you think about the indenture and the structure of that, you've got
the asset sitting underneath Power and to the extent that we see some separation there and sell the cash
that would come in would be used to pay down that debt. So you would also have less interest expense on
a go-forward basis to the extent that, that would end up happening. And also a better business mix and a
better credit profile. So the ability to draw some debt capacity from that as well. So that's how we would
think about it.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So overall, no real impact to future equity needs at this point?

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

That's correct.

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

That's correct.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So following up on Jeremy's question there, can we talk about how you think about the financing on a
go-forward basis? I don't want to get into the proceed expectation, but again, given the backdrop of the
Dominion transaction recently and the repositioning, can you just give us a little bit of a sense on how
you think about financing the business prospectively? And specifically, how you think about equity needs
relative to dividends and specifically emphasis on dividend, if you can?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

So I'll start and then Dan, I'll tell you the real story. I mean the utility earnings, far and away, more than
cover the dividend. And the utility rate base CAGR growth is in excess of our dividend growth over the
past 5 to 10 years. So from the point of view to dividend policy, obviously, reserving the right of the Board
to always make decisions each quarter. We are highly confident that, that's a no, nevermind. In terms of
the financing, the change in the business mix is going to change the potential for the parent to borrow
and the delevering that will take place from the proceeds will -- and there'll be a residual power function
from a nuclear plant point of view, we'll free up some investment capacity there as well. And don't forget,
Julien, our biggest cash generator for the past few years has been the utility. So we've done a bunch of
analysis. And obviously, we'll wait and see how the process unfolds. But we feel pretty good about where
our financing will come from and how we'll be able to support strong utility growth. That's the goal here,
right? Strong, consistent utility growth.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Right. But what -- go for it.

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

Go ahead, Julien.

2020

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I was -- sorry, I was going to say to that point, how do you think about your balance sheet at a
consolidated level? You talked about paying down and if I heard you right, that basically the entirety of
proceeds would be used to pay down Power debt. But from a consolidated basis, how do you think about
pro forma metrics from an FFO to debt perspective, right, given a different risk profile, et cetera? I think
that's probably another angle here, right?

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Whether it's the entirety of proceeds is to be determined, right? I think that it's more likely the
entirety of the debt, and then we'll see what ultimate aggregate proceeds end up coming in. I think that
where you land from the standpoint of overall debt capacity is going to be a function of that business mix,
and it's going to be a function of working with the rating agencies to make that determination. And -- but
undoubtedly, that is going to be an improvement. And undoubtedly, that's going to be some debt capacity
that's going to open up from that perspective. So that's how we're thinking about it. The fine points on
that are ahead of us yet. But I think that's how you think about it. And frankly, Julien, we tend to think
about our overall financing is coming from the utility is being self-funding, the utility with a very strong
cash from operations in its own right. And then ultimately, on the other side, there's a money pool where
you'd have access to the Power and the parent as funding vehicles. And I think that what you're going to
see is just more of a shift in potential to the parent, although the remaining operations that would sit at
Power certainly would have a stream of cash flow and would have the ability to have some financing there
as well.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Cool. Just a quick question or clarification on the release. Timing, do you need to wait for FRR in some of
these cases get resolved before actually completing this?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

No. No. I don't think those are totally independent processes.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Could you give your latest thoughts on the transmission ROE negotiations in terms of what timing you
might be aiming for? And then kind as a follow-on, other ways that you have in mind that could potentially
mitigate some of the EPS impacts from that, whether it be on the equity ratio or cost allocation side of
things?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So thanks, David. The negotiations are confidential, so I apologize for not being able to give you
specifics. But your -- the contents of your question actually gets right to the heart of the matter that this
isn't about a single number, what the ROE is. This is about a variety of issues. What is the depreciation
rate of the assets, what's the equity layer associated with the business, what are acceptable components
of the FERC formula rate filing in terms of cost that maybe had not been captured in the past that could be
captured now.

So what I'd say is both sides are eager to provide relief to customers and eliminate an uncertainty in
terms of where this could end up. However, what matters to us is the overall economics. And I think what

PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31,
2020

matters to the regulators is the cash impact on customers. So what we're trying to do is balance each
of those variables, if you will, to each achieve our stated objective. I'm hopeful we can do it, but I'm not
certain we can do it. And we'll just -- unfortunately, I can't say more than that at this point in time. I
mean the BPU staff is working hard. The consumer advocate is working hard. We're -- we talked, I think,
at least weekly, maybe it's biweekly and they have other things that they need to attend to. But it is an
overall economic assessment that we need to make, and we're not going to agree to something voluntarily
that we believe is more difficult or less palatable as something that we would be able to achieve at FERC.
So to be continued.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. No, that makes sense. And I guess, would there be any change in the timing of the rough
time frame that you've communicated in the past for that?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

No, I don't think so. I mean, it's a question of patience that the BPU staff and the consumer advocate
have, I mean, they could file a complaint tomorrow, and we certainly are not encouraging that, but
we're not going to let the potential of filing a complaint make us deviate from what we know as an
economically reasonable outcome. And it would be a shame if we couldn't reach that outcome because
the fact of the matter is if a complaint was filed, it wouldn't be resolved it for years to come. And New
Jersey is struggling with 16% unemployment and all manner of economic challenges that it would be in
everybody's interest to try to return some rate relief to customers today. But no, I mean, yes, they could
file it tomorrow. I can't constrain that. But we're still trying.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Obviously, lots going on and congrats on it. Interesting steps. 2 questions. One on Power. And why sell
down given the clean attributes associated with it? I know it's small, but why sell down the solar assets?
Or why sell off the solar assets? Why not keep those embedded? And do you see utility-scale solar or not
see it is that an attractive business longer term?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So Michael, on that one, it's 479 megawatts. I think the biggest project is like 40 or 50 megawatts,
and most of them are 5 and 6. They're spread around 17 states. So the scale isn't what we'd like it to be.
And candidly, we'd like to focus more of our green and carbon-free attributes in the mid-Atlantic region.
And as it relates to, particularly nuclear and potentially, offshore wind. Plus, it's really because of its size,
what I'm about to say it's hard to prove. We don't think we were getting proper credit for it in our own
valuation. It's almost never picked up. You put an EBITDA multiple on something that's largely benefiting
from investment tax credits, and that doesn't get reflected in the stock price in a way that it might provide
greater value to somebody who has a different calculus around what -- how to measure economic value.
Yes, I don't know if you want to -- you said you had a second question, Michael?

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I had a second question. When I go back and look at your investor slide decks, and I'm looking at
the capital spending charts in the slide decks from the last few months or so and the CapEx by year for
PSE&G. And this has happened for years with your company is that you forecast transmission CapEx to
just fall of a cliff, kind of gradually every year, year 2 is lower than year 1, year 3 is lower than year 2.
Year 4 is lower than year 3. It actually never happens. Do you have any incremental color about what

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31,
2020

could make 2021 or 2022 transmission CapEx materially different or significantly different than kind of
what you've shown on your latest slide decks for those years?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

No. So what you said about transmission is actually true to the capital program overall, and we try to
point that out in a good old days when we can actually meet face-to-face at an investor conference that
is purely a function of the fact that things are less firm in years 3, 4 and 5 than they are in years 1 and
2. To your specific question about transmission, most of the big projects that came out of the PJM RTEP
are pretty much complete or near complete. And a good part of our effort now is in upgrading our 26 kV
system to 69. That will result in an overall reduction in the transmission spend. But that's fully baked into
that 6.5, the 8% CAGR number that we put out there. The possible -- there is a possibility of increasing
transmission investment as New Jersey continues its pursuit of offshore wind. And we go from 1 gigawatt
to potentially 7.5 gigawatt future. The current project that Ørsted one had a very miniscule effect on the
onshore transmission system. But as you start moving 7.5 gigawatts of power onto to New Jersey, then
that could change. So -- and then last but not least, one of the things that the BPU is talking to all utilities,
not just us, that is the possibility for accelerating some of the infrastructure programs that we want to do
to help create some economic stimulus. And just given the age of our transmission infrastructure, the age
of [ RDS ] infrastructure, that is something that could provide further opportunities for us as well.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Are there any public filings or any dockets or proceedings open, whether at PJM or whether at the BPU
regarding incremental transmission spent over the next couple of years?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

I don't think -- I'm wondering -- there may be -- we can get back to you, Michael. There may be a BPU
docket on how to bid future offshore wind projects, whether they separate the transmission from the
actual wind farm because as you probably know, the first solicitation had those 2 bundled together. And I
thought the BPU was looking at whether or not to separate them, but that may be over. I'm not sure we
can get back to that.

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And the first offshore wind station, Michael, really was it was offshore wind and the line coming into
shore all in one solicitation. So to the extent that there is -- and that's been the only solicitation in New
Jersey to the extent that there are more solicitations and more of an ability to link up projects that are out
in the ocean and then doing it in different ways and maybe carving it up. That's the kind of thing that is
being looked at as a policy question. But what I think that wherever that does land, it sounded like your
question was really nearer term. So for capital deployment really in the immediate term, I wouldn't expect
-- I think your question was '21, '22, that would be on the early end of anything. If anything would happen
by that time frame on what we're talking about. So if that's your time frame, I think, less likely. I think,
as we go out into the future and try to make some longer-term determinations as how to best target the
magnitude of offshore wind that the state is looking for, you may see more into the future.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So I wanted to just sort of make sure that I just want to clarify something here. So the divestiture or the
strategic review, that's purely being basically driven by, if I understand, the stock valuation? There's no
real significant change in market outlook or regulatory stuff that's going on here. This is just basically,

hey, is it worth more to -- the valuation equation basically mean it's a good time to look at it. Am I
understanding that correctly?

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

That's exactly right.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

And then with respect to the FRR, and -- I guess someone else touched on this. There's no change in that
process that you see taking place as a result of this? And do we still -- do you think -- I think you guys
were basically under the impression that we -- it was a very good chance you don't need legislation. Is
that sort of still the case?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

So well, lots of questions there. So we're not driving the FRR bus, right? That's being driven by the BPU.
So that's a totally independent process. And I think the state is still trying to figure out do they want an
FRR that simply secures their carbon-free energy? Do they want to do an FRR that secures all of their
energy? And I don't see that being in any way, shape or form, influenced by our decision to divest of our
fossil assets.

In terms of legislation, that is purely a function of what kind of FRR they design. So if there's a better than
even chance that no legislation is needed, but -- for example, in the creation of an OREC legislation was
required. If there's a similar thinking about any other kind of particular technology, then there might be
a need for legislation. So it's just too early in the FRR discussions to be definitive. What you're accurately
quoting, Paul, is that once upon a time when we thought all that would happen was that our nuclear plants
will be supported by BGS that there would not be a need for legislation. But I think the PJM compliance
filing that shows that our nuclear plants are free to bid and compete in capacity markets has really
diminished the need for anything specific to our nuclear plants at this time.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I think I just want to follow up a little bit on Julien's line of questions. It looks like your downgrade
threshold, according to the Moody's report put out earlier this year, was 17%, and you ended the year,
1% below that. If you were to essentially lose some additional cash flows on the merchant side and use
back leverage to fund utility investment going forward, that could put further pressure on your FFO-to-
debt ratio. So I guess my question is, would you be willing to accept ultimately a downgrade in the credit
rating? Or what would you see as potentially happening on the FFO-to-debt side?

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Paul, obviously, a whole lot of moving parts with respect to what we're talking about and a lot of
discussions yet to be had and ability to work through those things. I think what I would say is if you think
about the overall business mix of enterprise and you think about that business mix without the nonnuclear
generation, I think you have a more stable set of cash flows coming off the business. And I think at the
end of the day, you would have a lower threshold from the standpoint of what that newly designed entity
look like. So I think that's a part of the calculus that becomes important in all this as we work forward and
come to some determinations.

months. And also, as far as we could tell, negotiations are pretty active. We expect either a settlement or
a decision by the BPU in September. So we're...

proceeding.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just a couple of questions. First of all, you have kind of talked for a little while about kind of willingness
to sell the fossil assets. So maybe could you just give a little more color like what is different now versus
what you've already been saying for kind of 6 to 12 months? I think you were worried about getting a fair
price to some degree. So are you more confident on that? Or some color there?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I'd say 2 things, Steven. Number one is getting a fair price given the capacity market uncertainty in
PJM. And that, I think, yes, we don't -- we haven't run an auction, but the rules are pretty clear in terms
of what's going to happen there. But I would say it's just the valuation discount has expanded to the point
where just -- it's not fair, right? It just doesn't make any sense for PSEG to be valued where it is. And you
can't put it all on the backs of transmission ROE without making truly ludicrous assumptions. So it really
was a case of enough is enough. And I do think that unlike the BEC process, where we candidly did a little
bit of a test program, we went out to a handful of people who we thought might have interest. We're not
going to do that. We're going to conduct a very robust process. And we're going to just run it differently
than that probe was run. So I'd say, yes, there's a calming in the power markets and further expansion of
the discount and evaluation that conspire to say enough is enough.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. A couple of just technical questions on it. Do you have the tax basis of the assets that you could
provide us? And also just how should we think about dealing with like dissynergies? Is that something you
can manage?

Daniel J. Cregg
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Steve, we don't have a tax basis number to provide. It's certainly going to be lower on the federal
side, if you think about some of the expensing that's gone on. So I would think about it against the
backdrop of some of bonus has gone on. And there's not a dissynergy number. But obviously, to the extent
that you've got some of the costs that you see getting spread across the various businesses, there will be
some of that, right, that you'll have a smaller entity to be able to spread over. But also as we look at this,
we'll be looking at efficiencies across the business as a whole to try to make up some of that.

Great. And then last question. On offshore wind, is there any -- I may be overreading it, but I kind of
feel like there's a little bit more of a tone of kind of interest in moving forward with offshore wind growth.
Could you maybe just give a little more color on that talking about the future auctions coming up to and --
yes. Yes.

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. No. So certainly, we're still where we have been all along, Steve, from the point of view of trying
to maximize this opportunity that's available to us to learn. We're in a different place, we have learned
more, and we are gaining confidence in the ability to construct and own and operate, probably can't say
the same in terms of the regulatory process, particularly at the national level. And you, I'm sure, aware
that New Jersey has begun discussions about round 2 solicitation, and that's expected to begin, I think,
in a couple of months. So the state is moving, and I do believe all within Governor Murphy's first term,
you'll see solicitations and securing a 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind. So this is becoming more and
more real with every day. And I have no reason to not believe that the state's full aspirations of 7,500
megawatts as well as New York state's 9,000 megawatts and so on, on the list won't be realized. So you
are picking up in my voice that this is going to happen at a scale that I would not have predicted 3 or 4
years ago. But you see it coming along right now.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Can you hear me?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Maybe if I could sneak in a couple of related questions on the power side. So you're keeping nuclear power
plants, and we understand they have been substantially derisk [ BSX ]. And is there, however, a scenario
where you can envision that they may find a different home also? And then another question I had is, is
there any implication -- are there any implications for how much headroom on your customer build you
have on your New Jersey asset divestiture?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

Sophie, in the spirit of you never say never, I wouldn't want to say the word never. But we are not
marketing those nuclear plants. We have every intention and expectation of holding on to them and
marketing the nonnuclear assets to solar source and the fossil fleet. And plus, I just think that the
candidate pool for purchasing is vastly, vastly larger for the fossil assets, right? So again, at the risk of
repeating myself, you never say never, but I think it's -- you put -- that would be in the conjecture and
a mode that is not time well spent. And because I've dabbled on for long, I forgot what your second
question was. What was it?

Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President & CEO

No, not at all. I would think not. No, I mean, your power prices in the forward market, as we've said,
are down from where they were just 2 years ago, and there continues to be pressure on forward power
prices, both because of the abundance of natural gas, the reduction in load and the availability of highly
efficient generation. So we match -- we try to match all of our utility proposed programs to a bill impact of
roughly CPI and we try to do that in a way that includes rolling in of rates every 6 to 12 months. So there
is no price and rate shock to the customer. And of course, we are firm believers that energy efficiency
can be targeted to those customers who are A, either most vulnerable; or B, most broadly, providers of
services to the population at large, and therefore, benefit the population at large by reducing their energy
consumption.

I do think that runs us past the appointed hour, so I would be remiss, notwithstanding all the news and
hopefully really good and exciting news that we shared with you. If I didn't simply say to everyone on the
call that I hope you and your families and friends are experiencing good health and have not been affected
by this horrible challenge that we have in the form of COVID-19. And to the extent that any of you have
friends or families who have been frontline health workers, we at PSEG truly express our thanks to you
and to them indirectly. And please, I mean that, convey that to them.

We had just an amazing, terrific effort by our employees. We've not been untouched by COVID-19. Our
infection rates are about half of the general population. Our employees are managing to work safe and
just produce some phenomenal cost savings, yielding a very strong quarter. I know we had some onetime
stuff, but even if you back that onetime stuff out, I think we had a terrific quarter.

And Dan and I aren't the dancing types, but hopefully, you can hear in our voice the excitement, the
genuine excitement we feel about the pursuit of the strategic alternative and what that means for the
concentrated, focused growth of the utility, especially a CEF that we expect to be resolved by September.
