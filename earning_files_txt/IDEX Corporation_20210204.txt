Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the IDEX Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial Highlights. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your
host, Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you, you may
begin.

Michael John Yates
VP & Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for
IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX fourth
quarter and full year 2020 financial highlights.

Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the
3 months and the year ending December 31, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides
to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com.

Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer.
The format for our call today is as follows: we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of
IDEX's businesses, including a recap of our recent performance and how we are viewing 2021. Eric will
then provide an update on a few initiatives that we believe are key to IDEX's culture before moving into a
review of our order performance and providing our 2021 outlook for our end markets. Bill will then discuss
our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. And we'll conclude with an outlook for the first
quarter and full year 2021.

Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Before
we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to
the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO. Eric?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Mike. I'd like to start by thanking our people all around the world who have risen to the
occasion during such a challenging year. It's been a year full of challenge and change with the numerous
safety protocols and disruptions in the marketplace. In that environment, our people continue to shine. So
to all the IDEX team members listening in on this call, thank you.

Because of the protocols we have in place, the disruptions in our operations have been limited. The
COVID trends across Europe, North America and India have been troubling, and we continue to follow
those developments closely and remain steadfast in providing a safe place for our employees to work.
We continue to deliver solutions for our customers during a challenging year, focusing on the critical
innovation we need to support our long-term strategy as well as producing new products to help the fight
against the pandemic.

Bill will walk through the details shortly, with customer focus, strong execution and our ability to react
quickly to unpredictable events helped us deliver a relatively strong performance in 2020, a true
testament to our resiliency. Liquidity was a primary focus of our management strategy as the pandemic
hit, and I'm happy to say that we were able to drive record free cash flow this year.

As we address the challenges in front of us, we see a path to bullishness for 2021. We have seen a
steady recovery in our end markets, which we will detail in a few slides. The diversity and quality of our
businesses continues to serve us well, ensuring that we can weather any storm and quickly capitalize
when market conditions improve.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

While the pandemic still presents many challenges to solve, we are starting to see a focus pivot back
to core commercial endeavors as we and our customers prepare for a world healed from the ravages
of COVID-19. Our businesses remain focused on operating safely, and we are prepared to leverage our
supply chains and react to increased demands.

A year like 2020 truly test the culture of a company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really
live and believe? If so, you'll be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is that kind of company,
and it served us well in a year none of us could have ever predicted. I'm proud of the culture we have
built at IDEX. It is admired by many, but we can strengthen it still. We leverage our culture and mission to
bind together a uniquely decentralized and diverse company, and our commitment to work even harder to
support diversity, equity and inclusion is tied directly to this important aspect of IDEX differentiation.

Our resiliency, agility and fundamental ability to execute have IDEX exceptionally well positioned to play
off as aggressively as we move forward. We are actively investing to support our best organic growth bets,
and we have ramped up our capital spending to support very exciting initiatives. The M&A markets are
moving again, and we are expanding our capabilities to execute on strategic acquisitions.

In January, we announced an agreement to acquire Abel Pumps and expect that deal to close in the
first quarter. We actively seek to deploy additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses as well as
make some calculated bets in new technologies to bolster our growth potential to further strengthen our
portfolio and enhance our return to shareholders.

Moving to Slide 7. As I just mentioned, the strength of IDEX comes from the IDEX difference, a teachable
methodology where great teams working together in a superior culture, focused on the critical things
that matter with a natural orientation towards the most important needs of their customers. Our culture
is a significant focus and one of my key leadership priorities. To that end, we are making ongoing
improvements based on feedback we received from our employees every day.

Last month, the IDEX Foundation, which was created to positively impact the communities in which we
live and work, took a significant step forward as part of these efforts. IDEX committed $6 million to boost
sponsored activities across the company. The foundation formerly added equity and opportunity as a
lasting and fully funded part of its mission, creating opportunities for underserved, disadvantaged people
of color in our communities. This donation allows the foundation to more than double its annual giving. In
addition to initiatives focused on equity and opportunity, we will continue the great work our people have
been doing in our communities like building homes for the homeless, renovating community centers and
supporting schools and learning opportunities for young people.

This month, we will host more than a dozen facilitative employee focus groups around the world. The
feedback from our employees will help shape our path forward in diversity equity inclusion. Developing
a formal framework and goals for our DE&I program is something we have all deployed at the senior
leadership level making it a top priority. As part of that commitment, I intend to have a Senior DE&I leader
in place reporting directly to me later this year. We will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key
element of differentiation. You have my commitment on that.

Turning now to our commercial results on Slide 8. Broad rebound in order rates we discussed in the
third quarter continued as our fourth quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year.
We entered the quarter with optimism based on the strength of the third quarter improvement, and
that continued into the fourth quarter. Excluding timing on large OEM blanket orders year-over-year, our
monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter.

FMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses,
continued strength in agriculture and recovery in industrial day rate businesses. HST organic orders were
up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and
semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses.

Finally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter. Dispensing saw significant
improvement as retailers began to release pent-up demand for equipment refreshes [ banded ], after a

IDEX CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

strong bounce back in the third quarter, continued to improve based on auto market strength. And Fire &
Safety saw growth in several product lines.

A year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and
what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX. We have proactively taken strategic actions to
address these factors. We then faced the onset of the pandemic, and we responded to it with purpose. As
we close out 2020 and look forward, we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to
pre-COVID levels. The actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well positioned as we move into
2021.

Turning to Slide 9. We provide our current outlook for primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering
Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to tick up in the fourth quarter, further solidifying
the optimism that we discussed last quarter. We see this increase driven largely by OpEx needs of our
customers. We continue to see large capital projects remain on hold. We anticipate that broader signs of
economic stability and higher degrees of certainty on COVID recovery timing is required before capital
projects begin to move again. But the investment discussions are happening.

Our Water business has continued to show resiliency, and we are closely monitoring the toll that 2020 will
take on municipal budgets in 2021 and beyond. The strength in agriculture that we've called out for the
previous 2 quarters has continued, and we expect it to grow in 2021. Energy markets continue to remain
challenged with markets still down compared to 2019 levels. Stabilization of these businesses is largely
dependent on increases in fuel prices, driving new capital investments in oil and gas.

Turning to the Health and Science Technologies segment. As we discussed last quarter, we have identified
opportunities and applications to help fight COVID across each of our segments, but particularly in HST.
We were able to drive approximately $30 million of revenue in 2020 and expect to generate about the
same amount in 2021 related to these initiatives. While some of this revenue is onetime in nature, we
believe the technologies and applications we have developed here will generate recurring opportunities
in 2022 and beyond. So relative to our $25 million to $100 million of opportunities we highlighted, we'll
achieve about $60 million.

AI improved during the fourth quarter and looks to be on the rebound in 2021. In life sciences, we saw
an offset by continued weakness in IVD/BIO as lab capacity is still largely focused on COVID response,
putting on hold other projects and initiatives. The strength in semicon that we mentioned last quarter
has continued. In addition, our ceilings business has benefited from a rebound in automotive. We see
continued recovery in 2021 for the auto market, particularly driven by strength in European car sales in
China and India. Food and pharma has also remained a bright spot as our businesses continue to benefit
from growth in MPT projects and Microfluidics business.

Moving to the Fire & Safety/Diversified segment. We saw continued improvement in most of our markets.
The largest driver was the significant improvement in the dispensing market as large retailers increase
demand for equipment refreshes, combined with order strength in the Asia dispensing markets.

As mentioned previously, the pace of the auto recovery continues to exceed expectations, springing on our
BAND-IT business. Fire & Rescue businesses continued to see strong order performance and we believe
that we are seeing a recovery in the OEM businesses, driving through some of the delays in backlog
concerns we referenced last quarter. As with all our municipal businesses, we continue to closely monitor
the impact on budgets to see if there are any lagging effects from COVID response spending.

As I highlighted in my previous remarks, we are optimistic about the market recovery we are seeing
across most of our markets. And we need to be prepared for potential interruptions, particularly in the first
half of 2021. Our teams have shown the ability to address these short-term shocks proactively. And the
strategic actions we have taken across our businesses has us well positioned to be able to ride the positive
momentum we're seeing as we exit the issue of the pandemic.

With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q4 orders of $679 million were
up 10% overall and up 7% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments with drivers
highlighted by Eric in his previous comments. For the year, orders were down 3% overall and down 4%
organically, with strong organic order recovery in the fourth quarter partially offsetting the 18% organic
order decline we saw in the second quarter at the height of the pandemic.

Fourth quarter sales of $615 million were up 2% overall, but down 1% organically. Our industrial and
energy markets led the decline, but did have positive organic growth of around 60% of our reporting
units, led by strong performance in our ceilings, MPT and dispensing businesses. Full year sales of $2.4
billion were down 6% overall and down 9% organically, driven by the impact of COVID, industrial market
softness and challenges in oil and gas.

Q4 gross margins contracted 20 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable
sales mix, partially offset by price capture. For the full year, gross margins contracted 140 basis points.
Excluding the impact of the FMD inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins contracted 130 basis points to
43.9%, driven by volume declines in sales mix, offset by our continued ability to capture price and drive
operational productivity.

Fourth quarter operating margin was 22.6%, up 50 basis points compared to prior year. Full year
operating margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating
margin was 23.4% for the fourth quarter, up 10 basis points compared to prior year and 22.8% for the
year, down 140 basis points compared to 2019. I'll discuss the drivers of operating income on the following
slide.

Our Q4 effective tax rate was 22.2%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20.6% due to the
revaluation of foreign deferred income tax balances driven by changes in foreign tax rates. Fourth quarter
adjusted net income was $105 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.37, up $0.04 or 3% over prior year
adjusted EPS. Full year adjusted net income was $397 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $5.19, down
$0.61 or 11% compared to prior year.

Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, up 9% compared to prior year and was 142% of
adjusted net income. For the year, free cash flow was $518 million, a record for IDEX, up 9% versus last
year and 131% of adjusted net income, driven by strong working capital performance.

Moving on to Slide 12. We're going to review our full year adjusted operating income. As Eric mentioned,
we faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, but the structural and discretionary actions we took were
critical to lessen the volume impact on our income and margins. Using a similar framework as we have for
the previous 2 quarters, we wanted to walk through the components of our full year adjusted operating
income. Adjusted operating income declined $66 million for the year. With organic sales down around $247
million, we would have expected a negative impact in operating income of $148 million at roughly 60%
contribution margin rate.

The $148 million was offset by $58 million of executed operational actions, $23 million from the impact of
restructuring actions combined with $35 million of discretionary cost control items and $10 million of price,
net productivity and negative business mix. Finally, we had $7 million of reduced variable compensation
for the year. This yielded a better-than-expected flow-through of 34%. Again, organic flow-through is
based on taking reported sales and op income, less the impact of FX and acquisitions, which was roughly
$77 million on the top line and $7 million of profit.

Overall, our team's focused on quickly managing the crisis at hand and effectively managing costs to
mitigate revenue declines and has IDEX well positioned to leverage the recovery we expect in 2021.

Moving on to guidance. I'm on Slide 13. Based on current order rates and expected market recoveries, we
see an accelerating 2021 and expect organic revenue for the year to be up 6% to 8%. This translates to
an EPS impact of roughly $0.75 to $0.95, depending on our top line results. We expect our productivity
initiatives to more than offset inflation, providing $0.04 of benefits. The structural cost actions we have
taken are expected to provide $0.12 of EPS benefit in the year.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

As we move past the pandemic, we will aggressively invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities. As
business recovers, we will loosen discretionary cost controls as appropriate. As mentioned previously, we
expect approximately 2/3 of the discretionary cost to return over time.

Additionally, we will be making investments to enhance our ability to execute and integrate M&A
opportunities as we view this as a critical time to enhance our capabilities as well as continue to fund our
targeted organic growth initiatives. These discretionary add-backs and strategic investments will provide
approximately $0.19 to $0.26 of pressure in our 2021 guidance.

Next, we anticipate $0.08 to $0.11 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp
for the year. Finally, FMD has 1/4 of inorganic results, which we expect to provide $3 million of revenue
but provide $0.03 of EPS pressure. The structural actions we have made to improve FMD's profit profile
based on the situation in the energy market will get FMD back to positive op profit in the second quarter.

Now let's take a look at a couple of nonoperational items. First, we expect an $0.18 headwind from tax,
primarily related to discrete benefits we realized in 2020, associated with equity vesting and option
exercising. Second, we expect a 2% tailwind from FX, providing $0.13 of EPS benefit. So in summary, we
are projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year, and EPS expectations are in the range of
$5.65 to $5.95, a 9% to 15% increase over 2020.

Moving to Slide 14. Let me provide some additional details regarding our 2021 guidance for both the first
quarter and full year. In Q1, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.38 to $1.42 with organic revenue
growth of 2% to 4% and operating margins of approximately 23.5%. The Q1 effective tax rate is expected
to be approximately 23%. We expect a 3% top line benefit from the impact of FX, and corporate costs in
the first quarter are expected to be around $18 million.

Turning to some additional details for the full year guidance. Again, we're projecting full year EPS in
the range of $5.65 to $5.95 with full year organic revenue to be up 6% to 8%, with operating margins
between 23.5% to 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective
tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. And
free cash flow is expected to be between 115% to 120% of net income. Corporate costs are expected to
be approximately $70 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost or
earnings with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. Abel Pump is not included in these estimates,
and we will revise guidance once that deal is closed.

With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Bill. Before questions, I would like to once again thank our employees and stakeholders for their
contributions to what I consider exceptional execution in a challenging environment. We have proven the
resilience of our businesses and clearly demonstrated the impact of the IDEX difference in our operating
model. While we are not completely out of the woods, this is a time for optimism. And I believe that our
businesses are well positioned to focus on the critical priorities that will accelerate our growth on the other
side of the pandemic.
With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Want to go back to your comment, Eric, on M&A and this concept of technology and investing there. Could
you maybe give us a little bit of color on what that means in terms of size or if there's verticals? And then
also, how are you reconciling those opportunities with the historical discipline that IDEX has always held
with M&A?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Well, it's great to talk to you, Allison. Thank you. So look, I -- we talked a little bit here before about,
obviously, we think that the technology cycle is compressed a lot. And no doubt, it was already kind of
flying in a dynamic way. So as we're thinking about that at IDEX, we're thinking about organic bets and
development that we're going to do internally, but no doubt, we're going to have to appropriate some of
this from the outside world.

And I think that -- you can think of that as a range of technologies. I mean for a lot of our component
products, it's probably going to come down to things like sensors and data readouts. From other
businesses that we have, it might be more analytical in nature. So it's going to take some of the inputs
that we're able to provide in a severe duty space and come up to some determinant outcome and present
that to our customers.

So I think it would run the gamut from -- everything from embedded sensors and control elements up to,
frankly, some software pieces that might be out there that would stick and sit very nice, comfortably next
to some pieces of our business. And I just think, ultimately, the call on that is going to be speed, speed
and the ability to impact a solution in a way that we think will give us some differentiated edge.

No doubt, when you're looking at assets, especially on the inorganic side, the economics can often work
in different ways. And so we challenge our teams to think about value creation in a different way as well
in terms of how it might extend our solution, bring us closer to customers, lead to other open doors. So
we're spending an awful lot of time on that as a team; Bill and I and the rest of the senior team and really
putting our heads together and what that will look like for IDEX, but we're excited about it.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Oh, that's helpful. And then I just want to go to your comment on capital projects. It sounds like you're
getting some inquiries or they're starting to increase there. But the balance of that going forward
potentially sounds like it's almost like a reopening kind of theme there. Are you feeling like there's starting
to be sort of this pent-up demand as people look out into the balance of '21? Just any thoughts there.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Well, I think so. As you know, I mean, especially, I'll just take the FMD segment in general. There's a
ton of support there on the day rate side and much of the improvement that we've seen in Q3 and Q4, and
that's where it's coming from. The system is working. People are adding shifts. There's just more output.
And we come along with that.

And then there's an important component of project business that we would need to see to kind of take
it to the next level. And I will say that you don't see a lot of that yet in the actual order numbers that we
have as good as they are. But the discussions that support that, the discussions around spec points and

IDEX CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

applications and problems that we can solve, you can feel that building. And I think that's behind some of
the optimism that we feel coming ahead, particularly as the virus, the course of the virus becomes more
understood.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Eric. So congratulations. You get your first quarter under your belt. And as we look at the results and the
quality of the earnings, it looks just like vintage IDEX and seeing the incrementals come back. But could
you share with us any, like, high-level thoughts here now where do you think you'll be focusing a little bit
differently, where might there be an Eric imprint here as CEO? Is -- I suspected a lot of it is just continued
focus on 80:20 and the IDEX way, but just broad strokes, how you're thinking about that now.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Sure, Deane. Look, I think some of it we touched on in my opening comments. I mean I would
actually start with the cultural aspects. I think one of the reasons we performed as well as we have, we've
been as nimble as we have, I mean, it really comes back to what we built here in terms of a culture and
an organizational mentality that allows us to course correct and really focus on things without, frankly, a
lot of control coming from Bill or I or the rest of the team. So in an environment that probably has even
more of that, going to the next level there is hugely important.

Then I think, partially, thinking back a bit to the comments around Allison's question, technology and how
that's going to layer across the solution sets that we have at IDEX, recognizing we've got a lot of different
states of evolution depending on the companies, that's a place, where I'm spending an awful lot of time
to make sure that we're thoughtful and not, in some ways, kind of overdoing it with a center-led answer,
because that's not really the appropriate response.

And then I would end with, certainly, capital allocation and a lot of focus on how we can frankly put some
more of it to work. The environment's tough, but we're doing some things around focused resources,
focused pieces of the company and a lot of just very iterative thinking as a team of how we can tackle
that and, frankly, capitalize on the engine that we really built over the last 2 years. I mean, I think, we're
uniquely positioned here, even in a difficult environment, to bring that to bear.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's really helpful. And I think you've given some good insight into how you're thinking about the end
markets that Page 9 was especially helpful as was the bridge that Bill walked us through.

So if I could just take a moment and ask for more specifics on your muni outlook, because that came up
a couple of different times where you talked about the toll that COVID is taking. But there's like 2 pieces
to muni. One is water, which tends to be more resilient in Fire & Rescue, a little more CapEx. But what are
your assumptions on muni budgets and spending here on those 2 areas?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean, no doubt, that's definitely an area that we're watching with a lot of focus. As you know, I
mean, those markets tend to lag an awful lot. And so something bad happens in the world, and it takes a
while for it to read through.

And then, of course, if you think of kind of our exposure layered on top of it, particularly the 2 areas that
you mentioned, we're doing very important work that that many times is buffered against some of it. So
on the water side, we're heavily tilted towards the analytical side, analytical services and support. And so

even if a system has to make do with infrastructure, might have to delay some kind of -- lay out a heavy
infrastructure, they often turn to our kind of work to make sure that they're leveraging the system that
they do have.

Frankly, also on the water side, I mean, if we go into an era where the environmental compliance has
stepped up a bit, that's another dynamic that helps us there. So that's against that sort of other trend that
we are watching around budget support and budget assurance. So the 2 things are kind of working there
together, but we see that same resiliency. Fire & Rescue, again, this is one of the most global stories that
we have. And so no doubt, in the more mature spaces, CapEx purchases, considering where the source
of that funding is going to come from is always something that we're thinking about and tracking. But we
are -- we course correct a bit here. And so it's a different story in some of the emerging markets where
we've got great presence and, frankly, a lot of technology and people on the ground. So I think that global
breadth helps us on that side as well.

But no doubt, we're watching the same dynamics that you all are. As we go forward. We're looking to see
if there's backstopping and support or not all over the world and -- but we think we're well positioned.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So let's start on the demand curve here. Obviously, understand the optimism comments. Really good to
hear. Is that -- how is that optimism embedded in the guidance range? How are you thinking about trends
as you work through the year here?

And any commentary on how customers are thinking about what their spend patterns look like and how
much optimism is there in the channel when you're having those conversations? And I guess one more tail
to that, what do you think that means for the next couple of years?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Mike, maybe I'll start off with the first part of your question relative to how we're thinking about pacing
through the year in our guidance, I think it's kind of consistent sequential improvement as we progress
through the year. When you look at the 6% to 8% and where we are in the first quarter, there is kind of a
gradual improvement that we need to achieve each quarter that's reasonable.

When you think about the 6% to 8% between the segments, HST, a little bit on the high end, FMT and
the middle and FSD on the lower side. So generally balanced with small sequential improvements as we
progress. And obviously, we have some targeted growth things that will phase out through the year that
could inflect that plus or minus. But we're not looking for significant growth in any specific quarter as we
progress through the year.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Mike, I just would continue to point to, I mean, in many ways, what we're calling internal is sort of
predictable uncertainty. There's a lot of stuff going on, no doubt, but it's at least found a level where one
of the things we've noticed all around the world is certainly -- we're going to keep the machines on, keep
the factories running, keep the borders open, keep product moving. It might be difficult at times, but that
assurance is there.

And certainly, with some good signs in terms of virus mitigation, that provides another piece of assurance.
And then I think most people recognize there's a lot of pent-up energy, more broadly, that if things
continue to go this way, it would be released at some point. And again, IDEX has such broad exposure. We
think we'd participate in that.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So third question, just maybe some thoughts on supply chains, how they look for you specifically; what
channel inventories look like; and then lastly, how are you thinking about price cost dynamics?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, sure. On -- with no doubt, the supply chain is tricky to maneuver. I mean, we're seeing that as well
as everybody else. I mean, the ports are clogged up and they've got some staffing issues in both of the
coasts. And the containers are in the wrong places, all of that stuff. And just, frankly, there's not enough
aircraft in the sky. So we're not immune to that. However, as you know, we are very localized generally in
terms of our supply, our production and our sell-through into markets. It's a very localized model.

And so I think relative to a lot of people, we probably don't experience it at the same levels. Our teams
now, for quite a while, frankly, even going back to the times where we were talking a lot more about
tariffs and things like that, have been thinking about where we have key sources of supply, how we can
make that, frankly, more flexible. And to this day, every Tuesday, we kind of go around the horn and talk
both about kind of how we're holding up in terms of the virus, how we're navigating supply chains. And
fortunately, we've been able to react and navigate around that, and that's the go-forward assumption for
us.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Can you maybe talk about -- a little bit about the order of cadence you experienced through the quarter?
It sounds like things got better, what you've seen so far in January, and if you wouldn't mind, adding some
geographic overlay to that as well.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So relatively, the order pattern through the quarter, we mentioned it a little bit in the prepared
remarks, our day rate businesses continue to progress as we march through the fourth quarter. We had
some timing of OEM blanket that made the absolute month numbers a little bit choppy. But for the things
that we look as indicator, the sequential improvement was there, and that's continued on to January with
another positive month of broad-based order improvement across all of our businesses.

On the geographic side, I think it was a really strong performance in Asia, in Europe. And North America
lagged a little bit only because of, hey, that's where most of our core industrial and energy exposure is. It
was the only area that was the lowest out of the 3, but again, still sequentially improving.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And then realizing dispensing's a fairly small piece of overall IDEX, it can still kind of bounce around FSD
a bit. I would imagine some of the orders you received maybe for future periods. Is there any sort of
sequential cadence we should be thinking about as it pertains to FSD because of some of that lumpiness
as we fine-tune our models?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It's obviously a strong order quarter for dispensing. I would say it's going to pace out through the
first 3 quarters of the year for the most part, maybe a little bit more heavily weighted towards the first 2
quarters, because we did receive some orders for the full year from several customers.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Eric, congratulations on your first solo quarter. Good luck.

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Scott.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

So I wanted to maybe get a little bit more on your 6% to 8% organic for the year, which obviously
suggests a pretty steady but pretty healthy improvement 2Q, 3Q, 4Q. And maybe specifically in FMT,
where you're kind of saying that's sort of like in the middle, what are the markets that you're looking at in
FMT that are going to be the drivers for that level of growth as the year progresses?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean, as you know, Scott, I mean, FMT is such a broad collection, catch-all of a wide variety of
industrial markets. But it -- honestly, it runs the gamut. So food production is in there. Anything related
to -- starting to work on infrastructure and build-out of highways and buildings and things, we're going to
participate there as well.

So the chemical sector, kind of coming back to life. We've got a significant presence there. I mean, it
really is that sort of broad-based support coming from the industrial sector, largely in kind of our mature
geographic markets that just day rates, that's kind of in the first chapter of it.

I think the projects that we talked about earlier are starting to come on, starting to get funded. You put
those 2 things together, that's sort of what the picture would look like in it. We see it as a pretty steady
march. I mean it's not like a hockey stick out there. We just think the line sort of continues as the world
heals.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Right. Well, you're shorter cycle, so that makes sense. Bill, one for you. Could you give us an idea, I know
you guys have been kind enough in the past to kind of share with us your revenues that are from OpEx,
which includes the day rates versus CapEx. What was the exit rate on that?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

I would say it's more heavily OpEx related. Again, to Eric's comments relative to the larger capital
projects, I think the conversations around those are picking up. We haven't seen a significant increase in
order book relative to those things falling through the unknown.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Would you say, Bill, that OpEx is maybe 70%, 75% of the revenue run rate right now?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, plus or minus. It's around there.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

I wanted to focus on Health & Science Technologies for a second. So you gave some color there on the
rapid tests, coming roughly in line with kind of what you thought revenue-wise. But what are the puts
and takes elsewhere in the business throughout the year? Because it seems -- I'm actually surprised that
life sciences is more stable and analytically, instrumentation, just given what we're seeing with other
companies. I don't know. I guess what are you seeing in 2021 in that segment and how that is going to
ebb and flow throughout the year?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean, look, I think the analytical instrumentation story for us, it's a pretty mature business. It
was -- obviously, it faced some headwinds last year, like a lot of life sciences did related to sort of up and
down the street, medical things and analytical services. We did see a nice bounce back there in the fourth
quarter for AI. I think it kind of returns to its sort of historical rates as we go forward.

The IVD/BIO side, which is also pretty mature, that's the one that's still got the most pressure on it. It's
much more dependent on people going and visiting labs and then has a consumable stream that tends to
be out ahead of capital purchases, and that's kind of where we come in. So consider that a bit of an offset
to the AI story.

And then pretty quickly, we get into the more dynamic pieces of this related to the works that we do in
genomics. And obviously, the rapid test is the most dynamic of them all. So we put all that together. I
think we tried to lay that out here. But I would say in general, look, this is a robust sector. It's obviously
doing work that the world needs right now. We think we're well positioned in all of it. And the single
biggest catalyst for us still remains that, that work we're doing around the testing program.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. Is -- based on your orders, order trends, what -- I guess looking out to 2021 for the full year, is it
safe to say Fluid & Metering probably leads, followed by HST and then Fire & Safety? Or I guess can you
rank order those organically?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

For orders or sales?

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

For sales, I mean.

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. No, I think I mentioned a little bit earlier. I think HST is probably on the higher end, FMC is down the
middle and FSD's on the low end. If you picked...

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. Sorry, I missed that. Okay. And then just one last one. On M&A, you guys indicated a quarter or 2
ago that there were some deals in HST perking up. Anything -- any update there or anything just broadly
on M&A?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Well, look, as I said in the -- both in the comments at the beginning and some of the questions here, I
mean, we've got a lot of work going on in, frankly, all 3 segments. So I wouldn't say that one is tilted
more than the other. I mean we've got good opportunities in all 3. We've got teams associated in and
positioned in places where we're focused in all 3. So I'd hesitate to color it as landed one way or another.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen.

Francisco Javier Amador
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Francisco on for Joe. I wanted to ask, with regards to Slide 9, which is obviously very helpful, your
general thoughts on automotive. We've seen some headlines on potential production cuts coming from the
shortage in semiconductors. How exposed are you to that? And if you can just provide some incremental
commentary there, please?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Well, I mean, no doubt, we've seen the same headlines. I mean this is still a relatively small piece
of IDEX. I mean we have exposure there in a couple of businesses and none of which is related to the
electronics side. So look, I think what we've seen so far, the momentum is the recovery of an industry that
was largely kind of shut down for decent parts of the year.

And then, frankly, most of our growth there is through growth of platforms. The technologies where we're
actually focused, our team has done just a great job of being able to introduce that to more and more
people, more and more players in the market and then secure those wings and then -- wins and we would
see them run out over several years.

So we haven't seen a big interruption. But again, we're not in that sort of same area, the part spend and
we've got really good exposure to the platform wins in a couple of businesses.

Francisco Javier Amador
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And just going back quickly to the M&A topic. Just on the environment, would you say
it's more favorable than it was a couple of quarters ago? I think you guys mentioned at some point that
multiples were still pretty high and people were maybe not as willing to sell. How has that changed in the
last couple of months?

Eric D. Ashleman
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean like the valuation remains certainly high and rich. And maybe because of that and some of
the confidence that we're seeing generally, put those 2 things together, I would say the flow of properties
for sale is better. And it continues to grow kind of with the confidence in insurance, kind of same things
that we're citing here. So valuation was, frankly, high before. We think it's high now. We think it will stay
at these elevated levels as we go forward. That's the challenge for us.

But we think we've got the -- certainly have the firepower to do the work, both in terms of the teams, the
franchises we're thinking of building around and the demonstrated ability to execute and drive value in a
company.

Operator

There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing

Okay. Well, thanks for everybody joining. And I know there's always a lot of IDEX folks that join this call
as well. So I do want to -- once again, I want to thank everybody across IDEX for the really, really hard
work and solid execution in 2020, and frankly, a great start already to the year here. So thank you for
your efforts there.

I think, as you can see, I mean, we're pretty -- we're cautiously bullish. We're leaning forward. We're
generally optimistic about where things are going here. No doubt there's a lot of uncertainty that's still out
there. But I think if we learned anything in 2020, it's how resilient everybody is and how quickly we can
kind of course correct and I think our company does that better than many. So we've got the people in
place. We've got the teams. We've got focus. And I'm just really, really pleased to be here and leading the
