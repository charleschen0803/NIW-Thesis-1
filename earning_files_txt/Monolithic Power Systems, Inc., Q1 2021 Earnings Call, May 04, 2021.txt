Presentation

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Welcome, everyone, to the MPS First Quarter 2021 Earnings Webinar. Please note that this
webinar is being recorded and will be archived for 1 year on our Investor Relations page at
www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining
me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO.

In the course of today's conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections
that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's
current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings
release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ
are identified in the safe harbor statement contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings,
including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, which is accessible through our website. MPS assumes no
obligation to update the information provided on today's call.

We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income,
interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-
GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a
substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table
that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is
included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC.

I would refer investors to the Q1 2020, Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 earnings releases as well as to the
reconciling tables that are posted on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is
being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with
the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

[ Thank you ], Genevieve.

MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $254.5 million, 53.5% higher than the first quarter of 2020.
The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly,
broad-based market share gains resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions.
37% of our first quarter 2021 revenue resulted from new products introduced in the last 3 years. New
product acceptance on this scale has paved the way for accelerated growth.

Looking at our revenue by market. First quarter 2021 revenue from consumer markets of $66.2 million
increased $28.8 million or 77.1% from the same period of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase
reflected a broad increase in overall demand, along with the initial ramp -- revenue ramp from our new
mobile device-charging IC. Consumer revenue represented 26.0% of our Q1 revenue compared with
22.6% contribution in the first quarter of 2020.

First quarter 2021 automotive revenue of $44.9 million, grew 92.5% over the same period of 2020. This
growth primarily reflected continuing sales growth for infotainment, safety and connectivity application
products and first-time revenue from products introduced in the 2021 model year. Automotive revenue
represented 17.6% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.1% in the previous year.

In our computing and storage market, first quarter 2021 revenue of $67.5 million increased $15.5 million
or 29.9% year-over-year, due primarily to higher notebook and storage sales. Computing and storage
revenue represented 26.5% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 31.3% in the first quarter
of 2020.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

First quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $39.8 million increased 57.7% from the first quarter of 2020 and
accounted for 15.6% of our total first quarter revenue. The revenue increase over the first quarter of 2020
primarily reflected broad-based gains in all of our major product groups.

First quarter 2021 communications revenue of $36.1 million, rose $8.2 million or 29.4% from the first
quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected higher networking and wireless gateway
home router sales. Communication revenue represented 14.2% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue
compared with 16.8% in the first quarter of 2020.

Our sustainable above-market growth is based on the following: one, we have and are continuously
investing in expansion and diversification of our supply chain, specifically, we executed ahead of market
demand; two, we accelerated the release of advanced products and solutions based on our leading-
edge technologies; three, we have gained increased acceptance of our solutions with first-tier customers
globally; four, we continue to diversify and support a wider number of end product applications.

Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 55.4%, 10 basis points higher
than the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2020. Our GAAP
operating income was $46.1 million compared with $40.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020.
For the first quarter of 2021, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.8%, 10 basis points better than the fourth
quarter of 2020 and 30 basis points better than the first quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP operating income
was $75.8 million compared to $66.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $95.0 million in the first
quarter of 2021 compared with $88.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP first quarter
2021 operating expenses were $66.2 million, up from the $63.6 million reported in the fourth quarter
of 2020. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for
the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded
deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including
approximately $816,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $28.6 million compared with $23.0 million
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $45.4 million or $0.95 per fully
diluted share compared with $42.9 million or $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. First quarter
2021 non-GAAP net income was $69.5 million or $1.46 per fully diluted share compared with $62.5 million
or $1.31 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end
of Q1 2021 were 47.7 million.

Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $641.6 million at the
end of the first quarter of 2021 compared to $598.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. For
the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $77.1 million compared with operating cash flow
of $79.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $19 million.

Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2021 at $84.1 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, up 4
days from 26 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the first
quarter of 2021 were $175 million, up from the $157.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.
Days of inventory increased to 141 days at the end of Q1 2021 compared with 137 days at the end of the
fourth quarter of 2020.

Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter's revenue. We
believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic
match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory increased slightly to 128 days at the end of the first
quarter of 2021 from 126 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.

I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q2 revenue
in the range of $274 million to $286 million. We also expect to follow GAAP gross margin in the range of
55.1% to 55.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%.

GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $95.9 million and $99.9 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A
expenses to be in the range of $65.5 to $67.5 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation

and litigation expenses. Total stock-based compensation expense of $31.4 to $33.4 million, including
approximately $1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses ranging between
$2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.3 million to $1.7
million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.3 million to
48.3 million shares.
In conclusion, we have paved the way to multibillion-dollar revenue. I will now open the webinar for
questions.

Question and Answer

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen.

Joshua Louis Buchalter
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on another set of solid results. I was hoping you could elaborate on the inventory dynamics.
You're one of the few companies that have invested proactively ahead of the supply issues across the
industry, but you're still not near your 180- to 200-day target. So just wondering how you're thinking
about balancing, rebuilding the channel versus taking business that some of your peers can't serve and
also your share gains.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, as we spend -- continue to expand our capacities, as we said it earlier in a -- as we said it in the
last quarters, and I think that we'll -- we expect that with the current rate of increase, the capacity will
be end of the year or early next year, so we will achieve that type of inventory. So if the demand has not
continued to increase this much.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

And I think it's notable, Josh, that we did increase both in terms of dollars and days, the amount of
inventory we had from Q4 to Q1, which rounds -- runs counter to the capacity constraints that some peer
companies are experiencing.

Joshua Louis Buchalter
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That makes sense. And any more granularity you can provide in the guidance by end market for
next quarter? Any of the buckets moving materially more than the others? Congrats, again.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. I would probably look to computing, where there was a couple of quarter gap in data center that data
center should begin to take off again. I think automotive appears to be continuing to grow nicely, both in
terms of year-over-year performance and sequentially. And also, we're seeing that same continuation in
consumer.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I want to talk about the sustainability of demand. Recently in this earnings season, a lot of semistocks
have sold off on really good numbers, and it clearly looks like the market is worried about double ordering,
those sorts of peak cyclical activities. Can you talk a little bit about how your visibility has changed, if
at all, over the last quarter from the demand side of the equation? And any kind of general puts and
takes about how you view the second half of the year? I know you're only guiding for 2Q, but any sort of

7

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

company specifics or general trends that you'd like to highlight in the second half of the year would be
helpful.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Okay. And of course, we're [ considering the ] double orders, okay? I mean in the past, we said that,
okay, we have rigorous procedures, okay, to prevent that, okay? And we -- partial -- we're producing
partial shipments in the last 6 quarters. And we make sure our customers have a very minimal on-hand
inventories. And at the same time, we're not preventing their line downs, okay, their production line
downs.

So go back to your question, what's the demand, okay? We believe a lot of our demand is sustainable.
The reason we said that -- Bernie said earlier in a script, and that for us, these are greenfield market,
greenfield product line, we started to grow. And as Bernie said, 37% of our products, we grow all from
new products we -- that we released from the last 3 years. And that there is no reason to believe next 2
years and next years' -- I'm not even talking about next 6 months. I'm talking about next couple of years.
These products will continue to grow. And at the same times -- and we -- the product that we released in
the last 2 years, that will continue to turn into revenues in the 12 months later. So we believe our growth
is sustainable.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. I guess for my follow-up. A little more specific on one of your segments. The communications area
has been very, very volatile. I know there's [ bans ] on different customers that can ship at different
points and times. But can you talk a little bit about what's driving the sequential growth that was up so
much in the first quarter, admittedly off of a weaker fourth quarter. And then as this year progresses, how
do you see that market, specifically more of the 5G side of things rather than the networking and gateway
sides?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

We see -- as a matter of fact, my CEO talked to a -- we have a -- communication meetings with top tiers
and non-Chinese 5G makers, okay? And the -- that market segment's that were picking up and we'll
believe -- okay. They believe this year and in the next year, they're on the delinquency, too.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

We believe we're very well positioned, just as Michael said there, because the reach of new customers that
we're addressing the 5G solutions is very broad. So we think that as the market gains momentum, we're
very well positioned to take full advantage of it.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Congrats, again.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Michael and Bernie, congrats again on a very strong quarter. First question, I was hoping you could
talk a little bit about your share gains especially during times when capacity is really tight. So your
solutions tend to be more integrated, especially versus discretes. And a lot of those discretes are in

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

shortage. So I'm just wondering if you are seeing an acceleration in your share gains during this very tight
semiconductor environment.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, it's a -- if examples -- and I can give you a couple of examples, a couple of scenarios, okay? If we're
in a -- if dual sources that came in and our competitors are using -- our customer's using 2 -- dual source
or triple source. If -- and ours tend to be in a lot more -- fewer components than our competitors, and
that is one interpretation why the demands -- and we're gaining so much demand.

And another scenario is for the futures. And we gained a lot of market shares because -- just recently
because for those new product -- their new project, the shippings, they were putting up production for the
next 6 to 12 months. And we have a lot of design win lately.

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And as my follow-up, and you talked about the contribution from the new products. I know you're
not going to give us specific information on pricing. But is it fair to say that the ASPs now of those new
products are considerably higher than perhaps the last year or 2?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. For the gross margins, we stay on our course, and we're not looking for a price hiking -- price hikes,
okay, and that probably is not sustainable. So okay, I think that we predict our models and going the same
trend as before, okay.

And Bernie?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. And just to add to that, yes, certainly, the new products that we're introducing, and particularly those
that are more heavily integrated, the mix of business does favor a higher ASP for those new products.

Tore Egil Svanberg
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes, that's what I thought. Okay. Congrats, again.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist.

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Bernie, you -- I think it was you in the opening remarks, you said something about paved the way for
accelerated growth. We all know Monolithic's done a pretty amazing job with regard to growth relative to
the industry. But should we interpret that as meaning perhaps we stay above 20% for a more protractive
period of time?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I think that's what we're seeing now. And what we're seeing now -- and that can be -- in the -- a year --
or 2 years ago, so like, we only grew like 8%. Again, in the last year, 30 somethings. And this year, so far,
sort of we're in a very high percentage. And so we look at -- this kind of rate will -- it will continue.

9

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. I think that's the message that we've tried to say in the formal comments and Michael added to that
if you look at the reason for our growth, both last year and this year, it has much more to do with market
share gains and new products and having developed our supply chain, than it does necessarily rely upon
just the broader market. And so certainly, in 2019, we had high expectations, and we were -- we're not
immune to downturns in the market. But I think that if we have a more normalized demand that we can
perpetuate this accelerated rate of revenue growth perhaps in excess of the 20% mark.

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And then along these lines, I think a couple of other questions might have even alluded to it with regard to
higher ASP. I think of -- a big driver of that is your transition to selling more of these modules, those types
of more complex, integrated solutions. Is that the case? And I'm hoping you might quantify that for us.
I think in the past, you've talked about growth rates, at least off-line of the module business. Maybe you
can talk about whether this is reaching the -- a size where it makes sense to disclose revenue from that
piece?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. The module business is doing really well, okay? In a -- module/e-commerce business is doing really
well. And I think we're beginning to find a way how to grow that business. By no means this is full-
blown yet. A full-blown business yet, okay? We haven't really break it out. And -- but that business
announced and, okay, I see it in its much higher ASP. And that will start to grow like 2 years out. It will be
a significant difference and a significant contribution to the revenue growth.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

One other aspect to add, Will, is that if you look at certain of our end markets and all -- pick automotive
as an example, much more of what they're demanding is not for a specific IC, they want to have a system
solution. So if you look, for example, at autonomous driving or ADAS, there has to be built-in, fail-safe
redundancy. You have to have system communications throughout in the example I'm using here, that
coordinate the cameras, the sensors and the processor. And so you're buying -- you're creating entire
chipsets for a dynamic solution. And just by the natural consequence of how you're designing those
solutions, they have significantly higher ASPs.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And to elaborate on that -- and that these are not restricted to only a semiconductor that we
designed. And we offer entire solutions, and we design it, okay? MPS don't produce anything. But MPS,
okay -- including semiconductor, we design the semiconductor. At the same time, we design other
components. And well, now, as Bernie said earlier, even in the automotive business, we're selling solutions
rather than in the past, we're selling a single piece of silicon. And in 2 or 3 years later, I don't know how
you -- how can you specify is MPS a semiconductor company, but we are solution providers. And we sell
solutions much higher ASP.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question comes from David Williams of Loop Capital.

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to touch on the capacity expansion. And you had mentioned this earlier,
but how is that progressing? And I guess is it moving at the same pace as you would have expected? Just
kind of given some of the tightness that we're seeing within the industry, is there -- maybe is that moving
at your -- the pace you expected and maybe the pricing of that, anything surprising there?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Capacity expansions that we mentioned about 6 quarters ago, okay? So -- I mean with steadily an
increase. In the last years, we did some extra works, okay, to increase the capacities again. And from now
on, probably pretty continuous kind of an increase, okay?

And so Bernie, you can comment on it. Okay.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. I think that we've been clear that in 2020, we brought up a 12-inch fab and now we're continuing
to qualify parts on that in 2021. We're midstream and bringing up an 8-inch capacity. We're continuing
to qualify parts. One of the underreported stories here is that we have existing relationships with our fab
partners that date back as long as 15 to 20 years. And they're excellent relationships, and we have been
able to manage, both in terms of when there's undercapacity and overcapacity, where we have very even-
handed relationships. So even within our existing foundation or base, that -- they've been encouraged and
been very positive contributors to helping us add capacity as well. So I think the important point here,
as we said in our earlier comments, is that continuous investment has always been a part of MPS, it's a
differentiator. And that we see it as being able to expand over the next several years in order to keep up
with the increased demand that we're anticipating.

David Neil Williams
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just on the leverage, you think that -- that's remaining in the model here.
Obviously, there's quite a bit that's embedded. But how -- when we're thinking about gross margin at the
upper end and maybe even the operating margin, where do you think those could go to as you really start
to hit on all cylinders and get the revenue acceleration that you've mentioned?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Well, as a revenue acceleration, we need to continue to invest. And obviously, we can't grow out of thin
air, we said it many times, okay? And as long as the growth rate there -- okay, we see the growth rate in
the next 12 years -- oh, I mean, next 12 months. And once we see that, we will invest.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer.

Richard Ewing Schafer
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I'll add my congratulations as well. I had maybe a couple of questions by end market. I guess the first
one's automotive. I think you guys outgrew SAAR by 35%, 40% last year. And I know tight component
supply is kind of curbed first quarter auto production, didn't seem to hurt you guys too much. I know your
auto business, I think, was up almost 100%. So I guess my question is, I mean, do you see that as an
ongoing risk or something that could impact your auto growth? I'm curious, you almost doubled it this
past quarter, I mean could it have been better if it weren't for components, supply constraints out there,
whether they're direct or indirect? Or I guess any signs of things -- are things getting better yet in that
auto food chain?

MONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Whether as a -- our growth is restricted by the shortage of a component from our customer size
and again, we don't really know, okay? I mean -- but on the other hand, where total market share is
addressable market, where MPS is so small, so teeny, tiny and so we will notice it. And all these greenfield
product growth, okay -- and these are new demand. And right off the bat, okay -- of a -- and this product
is just taking off.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

I'm sorry. Just to add one more quick comment. We have seen nothing at this point to indicate that there's
necessarily been a slowdown in ordering in automotive. So again, as Michael said, we can't make a guess
as far as whether there is a limit on demand, but we see continued strong numbers of our backlog.

Richard Ewing Schafer
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. And maybe just a follow-up then on hyperscale. You highlighted, Bernie, I think you've mentioned
hyperscale spend kind of picking up or data center starting to show signs of life. So I'm curious, just
with the launch of Ice Lake and things are -- we are picking that -- hearing that elsewhere as well, that
hyperscale's getting better. How do you see, I guess, QSMod data center? How do you see that ramping
this year? I mean is it relatively linear from here? Are we going to see a second half inflection of some
kind? Does that kind of build some inertia? And I'm also curious, I think last quarter, you talked about 48
volt a little bit. I don't know. Is it still much too small to kind of break out or talk about? Or can you give
us a sense of what kind of contribution a 48-volt QSMod is now?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Sure. So let me start with the 48-volt question. I believe that there is significant growth opportunity for us
in 48 volt. I think we're very well positioned as far as both GPUs and down the road in the eventual...

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

AI.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes, AI applications, and there are even automotive applications that we're positioned in.

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

These are -- if it's not in the 6 months, probably 9 months, where the revenue will be significantly up.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes.

So then turning to your other point, the point of inflection for QSMod and remember, just for everybody
else's benefit, that's our dynamic power management for the CPU processor. That really, we see good
growth in what we refer to as VR13.5. But it's when it goes to 7-nanometer VR14, which is expected for
next year, that, that's where we might get much more of an uplift market share gains.

Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I offer my congratulations. Michael and Bernie, I guess my first question is I think you've sort of said
2020 and 2021 would be investment years, which would somewhat constrain your operating margin.
Here in the near term, it looks like your revenue is coming stronger than expected. And so even with that
investment, your op margin is expanding. And if I'm doing my math right, it looks like op margin will be
over 31% in June. How should we think about your level of investment as revenue continues to come in
better than expected? Will you continue to invest? Or do you think you'll drive further operating leverage
going forward?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I think that up to -- for now, we see the growth opportunity is even higher than the last -- than 3 years
ago. And so we will continue to invest, okay, as long as we see that, okay, as long as we can keep up that
kind of growth rate. And if not, we're definitely slowing down, okay, and until we regroup, okay? So far, we
see too much opportunities.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

There's no such thing.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I guess that's a good problem?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. Quinn, I do think that there are further opportunities for operating margin expansion. But I think that
we've tried to be clear on this during the -- particularly the last 18 months, that we see that there's more
value to our shareholders in being able to accelerate the rate of revenue growth. And that's really where
we've been putting most of our emphasis on.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then the second question is I think you touched on some of this with your disclosure that new
products were 37% of sales. But obviously, as the investment community worries about how much double
ordering may be going on given the overall industry tightness, I guess I'm wondering, do you guys have
a figure you can give us for the percentage of your products that are either sole-sourced and/or new
products because I think where the threat of double ordering may be would be on older products that are
dual sourced? And so I guess I'm trying to figure out, what percent of your revenue today might be from
older products that could have alternative sources?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Let me put it that way, okay? We have 37% of our products, okay? We have 4,000, 5,000 products.
Just think about it, okay? And these 37% that came of our product in January, all these revenue is -- a
portion of our revenue is still relatively small and still in the ramping stage. And those products, they are

mostly single source. And as you said, these are legacy products, okay? And once the production volume
ramps somewhat and just stabilize it and that they will have a second source. And of course, we -- clearly,
we experienced some urgency for -- and/or even double ordering, okay? And as we said, we try to it keep
very, very minimal. So -- okay? I mean just prevent them -- the line down at the same times. And we
prevent them to have a -- carry too much of the inventory. I don't know if I answered your questions.

Maybe Bernie, you can.

Nathaniel Quinn Bolton
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes -- no, that's helpful. I guess last quick one for you, Bernie. Do you expect to increase your absolute
inventory dollars on hand in the June quarter?

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Yes. Currently, that's what we're modeling, yes. Now again, Michael is careful to add that this is -- the
supply chain, we have pretty good visibility on the demand, we have to continually try to test and make
sure we understand that. So on the supply chain, we are looking at continuing to increase the dollar value
of inventory, sequentially in quarters. And demand, we just have to continue to reassess. But as Michael
also said, our time horizon has more to do on the demand front over the next 15 to 18 months as opposed
to anything that we're concerned about in the next quarter or 2.

Genevieve Cunningham
Supervisor of Marketing Communications

Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt.

Kevin Garrigan
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Let me echo my congratulations on the quarter. Just a quick one for me. You alluded a little to it before,
but I was just kind of wondering how your MPS now service an e-commerce business did -- this quarter
and how that compares to last quarter, which I believe also had some pretty strong growth. Then just kind
of looking a little further out, as things start to open back up, do you think that business will take a pause?

Michael R. Hsing
Founder, Chairman, President & CEO

I don't think it's the business taking a pause. I mean -- and we just started. That would be very upsetting
if the business is taking a pause. All right. And if we're taking a pause, okay, I mean, we probably -- well,
at this time, we're still learning. It may take a pause, okay, and that's something we haven't really figured
out, okay? I mean -- but so far as in the last 3 -- last 4, 5 quarters, and I mean -- and the measurements
that were in place, okay, and -- that we put in place, and okay, they are -- keep going up. And orders
and the interactings and the demand creation, the value for -- of the index for demand creation keep
increasing. And I think they are turning to our revenues, okay, and they're turning to much bigger
revenues.

Bernie Blegen
VP & CFO

Kevin, if I could add to that a little bit is the e-commerce and the MPS now are just 2 legs or 2 aspects
of the much larger story of how we transition from an IC company to a solutions provider that also
includes providing fully complete reference designs and a broad array of solutions in all of our different
end markets. So this is really proving the longer-term model. And while we are still learning and the
numbers are still relatively small, we're in the early innings of this, everything is very encouraging. That
we're headed in the right direction on to something that is very sustainable.
