Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to CBRE's Q4 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this
conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kristyn Farahmand, Vice President of Investor
Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.

Kristyn Farahmand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Finance

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor
Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with the presentation slide deck that you can use to follow
along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results
for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our
fourth quarter results and expectations for the future. After their comments, we'll open up the call for
questions.

Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve
a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding
CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations,
market share, capital deployment, financial performance, including profitability and margins and the
effects of both cost savings initiatives in COVID-19 and the integration and performance of acquisitions
and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these
factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to
reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors may
affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these
forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these
forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual
and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of
adjusted EPS; adjusted EBITDA; fee revenue; certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our
remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in
the appendix of the presentation slide deck.

Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our fourth quarter 2020 and full year financial results.

During the fourth quarter, total revenue and fee revenue fell about 3% and 7%, respectively, driven by
constrained transaction activity in Advisory Services. Lower revenue was more than offset by prudent cost
management and the continued benefit of transformation initiatives that improved both our cost structure
and operational agility.

Overall, adjusted EPS grew nearly 10% to $1.45. GAAP EPS of $0.93 includes around $0.28 of
transformation initiative costs. Importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.67 tax
benefit, primarily from legal entity restructuring. Excluding these unusual items in both periods, GAAP EPS
would have been up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.

Now for insights on results and our longer-term strategy, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to
Bob.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone.

As you've seen, we ended 2020 on a high note, with adjusted EPS for the quarter reaching an all-time
high and adjusted EBITDA growing 9%. This capped a year of significant challenges stemming from
COVID, but also one that brought to the forefront CBRE's competitive advantages, our ability to capture
often overlooked industry opportunities and the resiliency we've built into the business over the past
decade. This resilience has allowed us to offset the steep decline in sales and lease transactions and the
pandemic's unique effects on the office market.

Today, CBRE is more diversified than ever before across 4 key dimensions: property types, lines of
business, geographic markets and clients. A few examples will bring definition to this. While office remains
an important property type for us, its negative effects have been tempered by our large and growing
presence in industrial, data centers and multifamily. Leasing is a key line of business for us that has been
under pressure. However, other lines of business, such as GSE financing, investment management and
facilities management have all continued to grow. Geographically, New York, London and San Francisco are
key markets for us. But our presence in Asia is robust and growing, and our significant activity in Europe
and second-tier U.S. markets has held up relatively well. We serve many clients that have been negatively
impacted by COVID, but do a huge amount of business with technology, life science and other clients that
have thrived over the past year.

Reflecting how large companies increasingly rely on CBRE, nearly 90% of our 100 largest clients
purchased 4 or more services in 2020, up from less than 1/4 a decade ago. Our broad diversification
across these 4 key dimensions has served us well compared with prior downturns. Adjusted EPS fell 12%
in 2020. We expect earnings to rise to near peak profitability this year, the second year of the downturn,
and continue up from there. By comparison, during the great financial crisis, we suffered a more than 80%
peak-to-trough decline, and adjusted earnings per share did not return to the prior peak for 8 years.

We're exiting the worst of the COVID crisis in great shape. Our strengths include a leaner operating
structure, significant financial capacity and a strategy squarely aimed at the many opportunities unfolding
in our industry, including those with secular tailwinds.

We've built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure due to
a lasting increase in remote working and occupiers' needs for greater flexibility in space obligations.
This is reflected in our base case forecast, which, nevertheless, expects us to achieve a minimum of low
double-digit average annual adjusted EPS growth through at least 2025, absent a recession. This forecast
is driven by organic growth and deploying capital, notably in M&A and real estate investments, with
meaningful upside potential from additional capital deployment. We expect to achieve this strong growth
while continuing to evolve our business as we reduce contributions from lower secular growth business
lines and increase our focus on areas that have higher secular growth profiles.

One growth area we are particularly high on is flexible office space. We identified this sector as an
opportunity 3 years ago and have been building our Hana business expressly to meet rapidly rising
demand from occupiers and investors. Our investment in Industrious now aligns this with an exceptional
operator and outstanding leadership team that is executing a great strategy. With more than 100 units
in 50 markets, Industrious enables us to participate in the flex space opportunity at scale and contribute
meaningfully to Industrious' expansion.

Now Leah will discuss the quarter and our outlook for 2021.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 8. Our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA
declined about 13% and nearly 8%, respectively. These declines are mostly attributable to continued
weakness in high-margin sales and leasing businesses. This was partially offset by disciplined cost
management and strong performance by the rest of our advisory businesses, which, in combination, grew
revenue nearly 11%. Overall, our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 120 basis points

5

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

compared to a year ago. This margin benefited from cost optimization efforts and 210 basis points from
substantially higher OMSR gains than in last year's fourth quarter.

Global leasing revenue declined about 28% as occupiers around the world continued to defer leasing
decisions due to the pandemic. For the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K., which together comprise
about 78% of global leasing, revenue decreased 36%, 18% and 6%, respectively. The U.K. again
benefited from particularly strong industrial activity in the quarter, which helped offset subdued demand
for office space. The continued growth of e-commerce drove industrial leasing revenue increases of 20%
globally and 24% in the Americas. We're also seeing greater resilience among U.S. leasing transactions
generating less than $1 million of revenue, which were down just 25% versus a decline of over 60% for
those over $1 million. Advisory sales improved notably from Q3, but remained 15% below Q4 2019 levels.

The Americas and APAC regions saw sequential improvement, paced by the U.S., where advisory sales
revenue fell just 5% in Q4 compared with nearly 39% in Q3. Strength in the Americas reflected both
U.S. market share gains of 90 basis points to nearly 19% and relatively strong industrial and multifamily
transactional activity.

Looking more closely at our activity with office assets underscores the benefits of our geographic
diversification. In the Americas, office sales and leasing revenue fell over 50% compared to declines of
around 30% for each in EMEA and 17% for sales and 20% for leasing in APAC. Commercial mortgage
origination revenue rose 49% in the quarter, reflecting a surge in GSE lending, particularly targeted at
affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and loan sales
activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio grew 17% to $269
billion, while servicing revenue grew nearly 25%. Valuation revenue grew about 4%, reflecting increased
assignments for investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific.

Finally, Advisory Property and Project Management together declined about 4%. Property Management
fee revenue grew just over 1%, while advisory project management declined 12%, as demand from U.S.
public sector and industrial clients partially offset a steep decline in office. Notably, we completed 18%
fewer projects than in the last year's fourth quarter, while the margin on these projects improved. We
expect Project Management to benefit from pent-up demand as economies reopen and business activity
normalizes.

Turning to Slide 9. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment posted 3% fee revenue growth as a 7%
increase in both Facilities and Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transactional revenue.
Despite limited transaction revenue in the fourth quarter, our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded
over 350 basis points to nearly 18%, marking our third consecutive quarter of record profitability. GWS
margins continued to benefit from lower discretionary spending and structural changes to the cost base.

While our new business pipeline remains solid, COVID restrictions continue to hamper new GWS client
onboarding. We expect GWS growth to gain momentum in the middle part of this year as the economy
continues to reopen. Despite these recent operational challenges, we expect our GWS business to continue
benefiting from greater diversification across client sectors and property types. For example, our focus
on specialized services for life sciences and health care assets resulted in a 240 basis point increase in
revenue contribution from these clients in these sectors in 2020. In addition, our data center services
business delivered notably strong revenue growth in 2020.

Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment achieved $110 million of adjusted EBITDA, a
$68 million increase from the prior year Q4. Investment Management adjusted EBITDA rose over 228%
to nearly $53 million. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached
a new record at nearly $123 billion, driving 15% growth in asset management fees. Importantly, just
20% of total AUM is invested in office, while industrial and logistics comprise our largest investment.
Additionally, carried interest surged to $31.5 million versus just $9.7 million in the prior year quarter,
primarily as a result of the disposition of a retail property portfolio in South Korea.

Development adjusted EBITDA rose to over $67 million, reflecting an elevated level of industrial asset
sales in the quarter. Our in-process development portfolio continued to grow, driven by strong demand
from industrial clients, reaching a new record at $14.9 billion. Importantly, fee development and build-

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

to-suit projects comprise more than half of this in-process portfolio, offering greater visibility and
predictability into our future development earnings.

Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of over $10 million was slightly more than that in Q3. Hana's results
were impacted by the pandemic and the cost of building out new units. As Bob detailed earlier, we expect
demand for flexible solutions to ramp up as the pandemic recedes and occupiers act on their desire for
optionality in their real estate portfolios. Our investment and partnership with Industrious positions us to
capitalize on this opportunity.

Turning to Slide 11. We've ended 2020 with record free cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet
and considerable financial capacity. During 2020, free cash flow increased 68% to nearly $1.6 billion.
This was partially driven by lower working capital required by our GWS business as new client onboarding
slowed from a particularly strong pace in 2019. We expect this to modestly reverse as client onboarding
accelerates. Nevertheless, we will benefit from improved cash management processes and our cost
optimization efforts, which generated savings of around $120 million in 2020. Structural cost changes
are expected to deliver over $100 million of incremental savings in 2021, even after accounting for the
reversal of certain actions that were temporary in nature. These changes will enable us to pursue OpEx
investments to enhance growth while preserving strong profitability.

We managed our balance sheet prudently heading into the downturn. This, coupled with the strong cash
flow generation, enabled us to end 2020 with a net cash position and $4.6 billion of liquidity.

Turning to Slide 12. While considerable uncertainty remains, we expect our business' resiliency
and the world's continued progress in mitigating the pandemic to benefit our 2021 results. While
transaction revenue has been weak, we have fared much better than in prior downturns due to the
broad diversification of both deal sizes and property types. During 2021, we expect continued growth in
industrial and multifamily transactions as well as a modest rebound in retail leasing to offset continued
pressure in the office market. Within office, we anticipate quicker leasing improvement outside of the
Americas. Overall, we expect transactional revenue growth in the mid to high single digits for the full year
2021. From a sequential standpoint, we expect the sales and leasing revenue decline on a combined basis
in Q1 relative to prior year to be similar to the pullback we saw in Q4 of 2020. The transactional revenue
should begin to rebound in Q2, particularly since, by then, we will be comparing against the depressed
levels of the pandemic's first month.

Across the rest of Advisory, we expect high single-digit revenue growth, with Property Management and
mortgage origination leading the gains. We expect modest margin improvement in advisory this year,
reflecting this revenue growth and the full year effects of cost optimization, partially offset by the reversal
of some temporary cost savings measures we imposed during the depth of the crisis as well as select
investments.

Moving to GWS. We expect revenue to rise in the high single-digit range this year, with slightly better
growth in adjusted EBITDA. The relaxation of COVID restrictions should enable faster client onboarding
and catalyze GWS growth across Project Management and Facilities Management. Because of this, we
expect sequential improvement in our GWS growth as we move through 2021, with the rate expected to
accelerate to low double digits by year-end. We believe this growth rate can be sustainable on a multiyear
basis.

Looking at REI. We expect this segment to build on its record-breaking adjusted EBITDA contribution
in 2020, with both investment management and development poised for compelling performance. In
Investment Management, we expect revenue to approximate 2020's $475 million level, with continued
increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect adjusted EBITDA to rise in
the mid- to high single-digit range compared with the $125 million contributed in 2020. This reflects some
operating leverage as well as some incremental operating expense investments to enhance future growth.

We project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid single-digit range from the $142
million generated this year. Our in-process portfolio continues to grow, reflecting increased appetite
for warehouse and distribution space. We also envision targeted investments this year to expand our
geographic reach, deepen our position in growth sectors and accelerate future growth, including a new

initiative to launch an industrial and logistics development capability in Continental Europe. We are seeing
tremendous demand from U.S.-based capital partners and occupiers for logistics facilities across Europe
and are assembling an experienced team under the highly regarded Trammell Crow Company brand to
meet this exploding demand.

For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as COVID
restrictions lift. As a result, we are forecasting this business to produce around $15 million more in
adjusted EBITDA than the $3 million contribution it generated in 2020. All in, we expect our 2021 adjusted
EPS to approach our pre-pandemic peak achieved in 2019, with some potential upside from our capital
allocation activity.

Turning to Slide 13. Our track record over the last decade, and notably over the last 12 months, has
proven the resiliency of CBRE's business and provides the foundation for enduring average annual
earnings growth, about a minimum low double digits through at least 2025, with meaningful upside
potential from additional capital allocation. We expect to further enhance our organic earnings growth
through a combination of investments and capital returns to shareholders.

Given our diversified business mix, we expect strong organic growth in key parts of our business to more
than offset lower demand for office space as hybrid work models result in smaller corporate footprint.
We see growth opportunities through increasing broker recruiting, digital and technology investment and
principal and co-investment activity in our REI segment. A good example of this is our co-investment
through CBRE Global Investors into private infrastructure programs, which is an area we expect will
benefit from secular growth tailwinds. Initiatives like the SPAC sponsorship and Industrious investment,
which partners us with an industry leader in flexible workspaces, can further jump-start our growth while
offering younger, developing companies the benefit of aligning with CBRE's extensive platform capabilities.

Finally, we intend to dynamically allocate our capital while preserving our investment-grade credit rating
to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To this end, we view our shares as an
attractive investment if we are unable to identify enough strategic acquisition opportunities at attractive
valuations. We intend to resume our programmatic repurchase program, and we'll seek to repurchase
shares as our financial capacity and valuation allows. We will provide progress updates annually as we
pursue this multiyear growth framework.

With that, please turn to Slide 14, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some closing remarks.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Leah. Before we take your questions, I want to briefly touch on CBRE's approach to
environmental, social and governance issues. We know from our interactions with you that ESG is
extremely important to our shareholders as well as our clients and our people. CBRE is determined to
set the pace for our sector on ESG issues, particularly sustainability and diversity. Making measurable
progress is one of my personal performance objectives for the year.

When it comes to diversity, CBRE's commitment begins at the top. Our 12-person Board of Directors
includes 3 women and 4 diverse men. Of the 13 executives who report to me, 5 are diverse. These direct
reports include Tim Dismond, who is named Chief Diversity Officer last year. We have just expanded
Tim's role to Chief Responsibility Officer and are bringing together all aspects of ESG, environmental
sustainability, workplace safety and well-being, philanthropy and public affairs as well as diversity and
inclusion under his leadership.

One notable commitment is the use of our massive supply chain to advance diversity by spending $3
billion annually with minority- and women-owned businesses by 2025. Accelerating our progress with
recruiting and developing diverse team members remains a core focus. We're making steady progress
as reflected in our earning a place on both the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights
Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in late January.

We've also been recognized for our leadership in sustainability. For example, CBRE is the only commercial
real estate services provider to land on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We are determined to

make further gains. Late last year, we committed the science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets with
the goal of cutting our emissions by more than 2/3 by 2035. We also pledged to make similarly ambitious
reductions in the properties and facilities we manage for clients. As the world's largest manager of
commercial properties, CBRE can play an outsized role in helping to limit the rise in global temperatures,
improve the efficiency and sustainability of building operations while benefiting our shareholders given
the heightened demand for sustainability services. This is not only good for the planet, it is simply good
business practice.
With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Leah and Bob, I was just wondering if you could maybe touch on -- and I guess it's on Slide 11, the
second bullet point where you talked about sort of accelerating future growth and rebalancing the
portfolio. I'm just trying to get a little bit more sort of understanding. Is that sort of code for leasing and
sales should come down sort of as percentages of the overall business and things like REI and GWS should
be growing? Are there other things we should be thinking about as you talk about rebalancing?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Steve, this gets back to the notion of us operating in a huge industry and having flexibility across 4
dimensions to adjust where we allocate our capital and focus the energies of our management team. So
to repeat those 4 dimensions, it's product type, for instance, industrial versus office, et cetera. It's line of
business, for instance, leasing versus Project Management versus Facilities Management. It's geographic
spread. And of course, it's client type.

We have done a ton of strategic work over the last year in response to COVID. And the crisis has caused
us to really get focused on what parts of our business are going to be accelerated given the current
circumstance and the likely circumstance over the next few years and what parts are going to be under
pressure. We've got a management team that's very well equipped to adjust focus, and we got a balance
sheet with lots of capacity to help us drive that adjustment to our focus. And yes, we believe that we'll
be moving in the direction of elements of our business across those 4 dimensions that have secular
advantage or at least neutral as it relates to being resilient. And Leah can talk to you more about that. But
we've really doubled down in thinking that way as it relates to our balance sheet and using the $4 billion
of capacity we have. Leah, you want to add to that?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

No. I would just add, Steve, that from my perspective, this is really about ensuring that we're seeking
to achieve the best total return from the investments that we make. And as we think about that, we
will continue to evaluate our capital deployment strategy along the lines of ensuring that the returns
that we seek are at or better than those presented by simply buying our stock back. So ensuring that
we're investing in areas where we'll accelerate growth for the business. And as Bob just outlined, that is
certainly aligned around our 4 dimensions of diversification as well as areas of secular tailwinds.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess the second question sort of maybe piggybacks on that last statement just about
the capital deployment. Because I think you said in your comments that you'd also look to maybe
reinstitute a more programmatic share buyback, but I know you didn't buy back stock in the fourth
quarter. So just given the surge in the stock price, but obviously, earnings are clearly trending in the right
direction. I guess, how are you weighing the investment opportunities versus kind of the share buyback?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Absolutely. We have a programmatic program. We have about $350 million remaining under our existing
authorization. We will resume programmatic repurchases in the first quarter, subject to meeting our

10

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

valuation targets. And we look at that as the fact that we're currently in a net cash position, and we
believe we have ample liquidity to pursue both our M&A pipeline as well as begin returning capital back
to shareholders through our share repurchase program. So we feel we're in a very good position to be
able to do that today. And given our view on the long-term growth of our business, we believe that it's an
appropriate time to do so.

Operator

The next question is from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question is on Industrious. Can you talk about their specific business model, whether it is currently
in a profitable state or money-losing state? Or like what that impact will be on CBRE in the near term?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes Tony, we'll only say, with regard to Industrious' financials, that we expect that acquisition to be
accretive this year, not in a major way, and then grow from there.

But as it relates to their business model, it is so overlapping with what we've been trying to do with Hana.
It was the perfect flex space operator for us to invest in. They have an asset-light model. That means that
they provide flex space as a service -- as a service to landlord, as a service to tenants. They are not taking
long-term leases and then turning around and doing short-term leases with occupiers.

They are very, very riveted on client service. We were super proud of Hana's client service, and they beat
us. They topped us. They were the one operator in the marketplace that had better client service. They
have a footprint of 100 units. It will be well over 100 with Hana and growing nicely from there so that
there'll be some scale to offer our occupier clients. And if you were to talk to Jamie Hodari, their CEO,
he would tell you that one of the things he was excited about our ability to bring to the table is deep and
broad relations across the occupiers around the world.

So we think that strategically, Industrious is the right company for us to invest in and partner with in a
sector that we believe is going to have really nice dynamics over the next several years because these
occupiers, as they rethink their space utilization, are going to want flexibility all over the place. They're
going to want to be able to get in and out of space relatively quickly. They're going to want to be able to
take smaller spaces away from their headquarters so their people can not have to come into CBDs in some
cases or come into other areas of the CBD where the headquarter isn't. So we think they were the perfect
partner for us, and we love where we've ended up there. And I think if you talk to Jamie and their team,
they would comment similarly on the situation.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And does CBRE's $200 million investment, does that provide enough capital for that to achieve
a much larger scale over time? Or I don't know if the business model -- if it put up CapEx or how that
works.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Tony, it's a capital-light model. They put in -- it will provide them with some capital, but they are not
spending a lot to expand that business. They're not taking on long-term leases. They're not putting them
most of the tenant finish. So they have the capacity to expand that business. We feel very good about
that.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

Okay. And then on the M&A side, more broadly, you'd mentioned a few times the pipeline there. Can you
talk a bit more specifically on just whether you're seeing larger types of transactions or not, just given the
financial capacity that you have?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me remind you how we think about M&A. We start with -- and by the way, M&A and investments
that we make, for instance, the Industrious investment, which clearly wasn't M&A. We, first and foremost,
think about improving our ability to serve our clients, bringing something to the table that we didn't
have before because at the core of our strategy is delivering outcomes to our clients they couldn't get
elsewhere. We look across our business, all 3 segments. So Advisory, GWS or outsourcing and REI, and
we look for places where we can buy businesses to fill out our capability set. Of course, we're not going to
do deals that don't make sense, that don't achieve the hurdle rates we establish, so on and so forth. Right
now, we think there are some very good opportunities out there. We're being very thoughtful about where
we go.

You know, Tony, we've talked about it so much over the year. There are certain parts of our business, we
think, have better growth profiles than others. So we're a little more oriented there when we do M&A. But
we think we can find M&A opportunities across all 3 sectors. And I'm going to highlight one that surprised
everybody 1.5 years ago when we did the Telford Homes acquisition in the U.K. That was an area where
we came in. We realized that there was a real need for institutional quality, multifamily housing in London
that wasn't being fulfilled. We had the opportunity to buy that business. We love the long-term profile of
that business, and now we're using our presence there to -- and Leah commented on this, to expand into
industrial development in the U.K. and Europe and very consistent with the model. That will be more of an
organic expansion. But we think there's going to be opportunities across all 3 of our segments, some infill
and some larger.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then last question, maybe for Leah. I don't know if you explicitly mentioned margins -- EBITDA
margins for 2021. I may have missed it. But it seems like from all the brackets you've provided on the
business lines and so forth, it's pointing to margins being higher in '21 versus 2019 and 2020 full-year
numbers. Is that a fair assessment? Or is there anything missing that could be an offset?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

We -- correct, we did not speak specifically to margins. However, we have said that we do expect growth
in GWS EBITDA to slightly outpace that of revenue as well as some slight margin improvement in
Advisory. So we are -- we do expect slightly higher revenues that are pass-through in nature in our REI
business related to Telford that will create a little bit of margin pressure in REI. But net-net, I think it's fair
to say that we expect flat to positive operating leverage for the year.

Operator

The next question is from Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs.

Richard Wynn Skidmore
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just to follow up on the 2025 framework, Bob. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what that mix
of organic versus, call it, inorganic growth might be that's embedded in that low double-digit growth rate
expectation?

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

Yes. I'm going to make a broad comment on that, Rick, and then I'm going to let Leah comment more
specifically. But to get to that double-digit average growth rate between now and 2025, that threshold
will be dominated by organic growth. It will include some capital investment in our REI businesses, co-
investment, et cetera, and some M&A. But there's other capacity available beyond that, and I'm going to
let Leah speak about that.

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Bob. So the way we think about the base case is that we're effectively adding our organic growth
from both the existing business we have and the benefit of a substantial portion of our free cash flow.
We still have our investment capacity, given where our balance sheet sits today with a net cash position.
And we think about leverage, the current position we are with respect to the cycle. We think we can
operate around a 1 turn leverage through deploying capital as it relates to M&A. And if we saw a strategic
transaction, we would potentially take that to 2 turns, but would quickly delever from there back down.
So that's how we're thinking about the base case, the opportunity for additional capital deployment as it
relates to investments as well as capital return to shareholders.

Richard Wynn Skidmore
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then just a follow-up on that. The comment about the projected decline of office, what's the
base case assumption for how office demand changes over time and the impact on the business?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So we've taken a hard look at what we believe to be the impact to office for our business. We certainly
expect that to create some headwind from the secular decline. Today, our base case assumes a 200 to 300
basis point decline across our EPS CAGR as a result of that decline in office. And we are still able to offset
that and achieve -- we expect to be able to achieve a low double-digit EPS growth rate even given that
headwind.

Operator

The next question is from Jade Rahmani from KBW.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

On the M&A side, would you characterize the opportunities you're seeing as within those 4 silos you laid
out in your outlook? Or are there areas potentially in logistics, infrastructure, business services that you
might consider to further diversify the company?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Jade, we always are open to M&A that would be adjacent to our business, not far adjacent but near
adjacent to our business. And I'm going to highlight again that Telford multifamily deal in the U.K. 1.5
years ago. But for the most part, we want to stay within the things we do because we have so much
headroom for growth in the areas that we're already good but could be better at. We think that's the
preferred place to deploy our capital. We think that's where the highest odds of success are. But we will
look at things that are adjacent.

I think you remember 3 years or so ago, we did an -- in our investment management business, we did an
infrastructure investment acquisition that we're very happy with. And I think that gives us opportunity for
expansion. But we try to stay within our footprint for the most part when we do M&A.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

And thematically speaking, are you looking to strategies that would be considered more asset-light type
businesses? Or would those -- would the majority of opportunities include balance sheet capital-intensive
businesses such as the Telford?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, Telford is not particularly an asset-heavy business. We'll have small co-investments in that, like
we do in the rest of our development business. We have $14 billion or so of development in process. And
Leah, how much

capital do we have invested in that?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Into Telford?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

No, in our total development, $200 million roughly? So Jade, that is not a capital-intensive development
model that we deploy.

However, I will say that across our REI business, we generated such strong returns on our co-investments.
For instance, in our development business over the last 8 years or so, over 30% compounded IRRs on
capital invested. We will look to put a little more money into the development business. We will look to
put a little more money into co-investments in our REI business where we've generated strong returns.
But for the most part, when we buy services businesses, they will be asset light. As Leah said in her
prepared remarks, when you buy GWS or outsourcing businesses, you need some working capital to fund
the growth of those individual client relationships, but we're mostly pretty asset-light. And I'm going to
say it again, one of the things we like so much about Industrious, very asset-light.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And how much is the cumulative investment in Hana thus far?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So in terms of Hana, we have invested approximately -- I'll have to get you the exact number, Jade. But in
terms of the current year, we had a loss of about $40 million related to Hana. And I'll get you the balance
sheet number.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Do you anticipate any internal reaction from the leasing broker sales force with respect to the
Industrious strategy? What do you think the implications are for the sales team?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Well, we have two areas -- you're talking about the leasing team that would either help the flex space
operators get space in multi-tenant buildings or fill their space, right? Is that the group you're talking
about?

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Yes.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So the bottom line is we do not think this will impact that much at all. We serve some really good
flex space operators out there, help them find space and help them fill their space. They'll still be very
anxious to have us do that. And of course, we're going to continue to do that with Industrious and look for
ways to do some creative stuff on the services we provide to occupiers with that Industrious partnership.
We don't think it will have a big impact on our broker's relationship with others. It's just the nature of the
business. It's a very large opportunity.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

On the transaction outlook, I'm curious as to why you would only expect mid- to high single-digit growth
in transaction revenue. I assume that's a blend of what you're anticipating in leasing, which would
probably be at the lower end or perhaps below that, and capital markets, which would probably be at the
high end or above that range. Is that why you're saying mid- to high single-digit growth?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. That is -- that's exactly correct. I would also note that you mentioned capital markets, but the
transactions is just leasing and sales. So we do expect sales to be above that level, and we do expect
leasing to be below. That does not include our debt and structured finance business, which we do expect
to grow at a healthy clip.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And just lastly, the transformational expenses, $120 million. Can you give what the full year number
was? And is it possible to group that spend in categories so that we have a more specific understanding of
what those initiatives relate to?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely. So we had really 2 types of costs this year -- or in 2020 related to our optimization of our
cost structure.

First was workforce optimization. That was early in the year. It was really meant to address the immediate
needs to respond to the changing demand environment as that was presented by COVID. We spent about
$38 million on workforce optimization.

We then turned our sights on transformation initiatives that were specifically targeted at changing the
shape and the structure of parts of our business that are effectively positioning us to be more agile going
forward. We invested about $176 million into those transformation initiatives. We expect that the total run
rate benefit from the $214 million of investment will be around $369 million of cost. That's being offset in
'21 by the resumption -- or we had some temporary costs that were cut in 2020 that will come back. But
net-net, we think there will be about $100 million of incremental savings in 2021 from the full work that
we did in 2020 related to cost management. And this is spread across all 3 of our segments. Advisory was
the largest. We estimate about 60% of our cost takeout was from Advisory, with about 30% in GWS and
the rest in our REI and corporate functions.

The next question is from Stephen Sheldon from William Blair.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

Great to hear about the continued trend and large customers purchasing more services from CBRE. I
guess how much opportunity is there for CBRE to continue expanding relationships with these large
customers? And how much does that factor into your confidence and the solid multiyear profit outlook?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

It factors massively into our confidence. We do work of some nature for virtually all of the Fortune 500
companies in all of the comparably large companies around the world. But we only do most of the real
estate work for a very small handful of those companies. And there's some we don't do any for at all. And
as I commented in my prepared remarks, if you went back a few years, we -- 1/4 of our clients, we were
doing multiple services for, for more services. Now it's 90%. It's gone up dramatically. And that's generally
a trend when we take on work for these clients. We get in the door. We prove to them we can save them
money or we can execute for them better on some basis than they've been getting on their own or from
a myriad of providers, and we tend to grow those relationships. And it's been a powerful growth driver for
us, and there's plenty of headroom for that to continue.

Stephen Hardy Sheldon
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. And I guess, maybe related to this, what view do you have into how COVID and the issues of the
last year have influenced the trend of customers slimming their vendor list? Is that -- could it create any
acceleration that it has and could continue playing into your benefit as you think about the next few years?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

I would say one thing COVID has been to everybody is anything they can do to streamline their business,
make it simpler, cut cost is front and center for them. And generally speaking, working with fewer vendors
is a benefit in that regard, and we're benefiting from that. That's been going on for years, by the way, but
I think it's been accelerated by COVID.

Stephen Hardy Sheldon
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then last one for me. I Just wanted to -- with the high investments and with
the Industrious announcement, I guess, how do you envision companies utilizing flexible workspace in
their broader real estate strategies over the next year or so, during this period of uncertainty with remote
working and then longer term?

And what client conversations have you been having there, I guess, in recent months? Are you seeing
them more frequently considering, including flexible workspace? Just any detail on the demand trends that
you're seeing?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, we've had a huge amount of -- one of the things that we've just worn out during COVID is
interfacing with these occupier clients about what their expectations are about going back to the office. So
first of all, I want to start with what we think in general.

In general, we believe that on kind of a weighted average basis, clients will go back to the office at about
85% of where they were before. In other words, their weighted average headcount will be down maybe
15%. Of course, we're all going to learn a whole lot more about that once COVID's over and there's not
that kind of psychological overhang of making those decisions while we're in the midst of COVID. We also
know that most of the occupiers are going to want to have some remote capability for their people to
come into the office. A lot of them are doing that now, but they're going to want to make that a formal
part of their portfolio.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

So historically, when we work with these big clients, they had 2 types of components to their portfolio.
They had space they own and space they lease in a traditional long-term way. They started to get into the
flex space as a third option toward the end of the last cycle. And now they're saying that's going to be a
more pronounced part of their portfolio of space going forward. So we think that means for companies like
Industrious, in particular, Industrious, who has a offering that's very high-quality, data security oriented
towards corporate users that there's going to be big demand for what they do.

They're not going to be the only ones. There's other providers that can do good work in that regard, too.
But we think that this will be a permanent piece in a bigger way of the portfolio of these occupier clients,
and that will serve right into the heart of the Industrious strategy.

Operator

The next question is from Michael Funk from Bank of America.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

First, maybe related to an earlier question about market share gains. What type of market share gains are
baked into your 2021 revenue estimates?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

So, Michael, when we look at our forecast each year, we do factor in our recent performance as it relates
to recruiting as well as market share. So from our perspective, we continue to focus on taking #1, #2
positions in really across the key markets in which we operate, and we'll continue to allocate capital
towards those key recruiting initiatives in 2021.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then I think in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that you're going to be reinvesting
some of the savings from 2020 into OpEx in 2021. Can you quantify that investment for us?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. We're not -- I'm not going to get too granular because we're not giving quantitative guidance for
'21, but I would say a key part of our transformation initiative and the principle behind that was to ensure
that we were reducing costs in certain areas, however, that we were -- that would preserve our ability
to maintain industry-leading margins as we invest into the opportunities and the secular tailwinds that
we see presenting themselves as a result of coming out of COVID. So we believe that even with the
investments that we're making, the cost takeout that we executed in 2020 will allow us to preserve those
margins.

So it's really across all 3 segments. We're investing across the business. It's across the key dimensions
that Bob laid out. It's all in response to the intense strategy work that we took on throughout the course
of the year. And we feel really good about how those investments are going to position us throughout '21
to really capture the long-term opportunities presented in the market today.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then clearly, property sale is very strong in industrial, data center multifamily throughout 2020. Are
you seeing a thawing though in other property types as there now appears to be some glimmer of hope
for a reopening? Or is there a greater interest in other property types?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

17

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

We're certainly seeing a glimmer of hope. I think the vaccine news in late 2020 was certainly a catalyst for
investors to begin to come back off the sidelines for investment property sales. However, I think industrial
and multifamily continue to be the real winners in terms of asset classes or property types in the market
today, but we are seeing liquidity around other asset classes, and we'll continue to monitor that in '21.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

And do you think that would be additive to the activity on the standard property types? Or do you think
that would somewhat cannibalize that activity as capital moves to other property types?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

I don't see it as being cannibalistic. I think given the level of liquidity that's currently available and dry
powder that's available in the hands of investors, I think that it will provide a nice uplift for sales in 2021,
and that's reflected in our expectations.

Operator

The next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Can you provide any commentary regarding CBRE's thought process for sponsoring the SPAC?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

We can, Patrick, and it's very much tied to that broad base of business we do across those 4 dimensions
and the fact that we see an awful lot of opportunity out there when we do our M&A work to do business
with companies that we can help and can help us, but they simply aren't the type of company, for one
reason or another, that we should be buying in whole. So maybe it's a company that's super entrepreneur,
needs to have an ability to serve us and our competitors has a culture that's best independent, et cetera,
et cetera; a brand that's best independent, but they can be really helpful to us, and we can be really
helpful to them.

When we contemplated doing the SPAC, that's what we had in mind. We would make an investment
in those kind of companies. We would establish some kind of operating alliance with those type of
companies. But we wouldn't buy them outright because of the reasons I just articulated. And we think
that, that formula is going to work very well. We're seeing a bunch of companies that we think could be
good candidates in the construction services arena, smart buildings, data centers, all kinds of things that
serve buildings. We're quite confident we're going to find a good target for that SPAC, and there'll be
follow-on SPACs behind it.

We're very differently situated than most SPAC sponsors. We've not really thought of as a financial
sponsor. We're thought of as a strategic sponsor. And the way the SPAC is financially structured where
our upside comes only when those -- the company that we would "de-SPAC" grows in value speaks to our
confidence that we can find a target partner and help them grow their business.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Great. That's helpful commentary. And then for my follow-up, to what extent is existing facilities
management clients reducing their office footprints, posing a near-term headwind on GWS segment fee
revenue?

Leah C. Stearns
Chief Financial Officer

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

18

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

So near term, Patrick, that's not a concern. We certainly are staying close to our GWS clients. They are
looking to us for our expertise around workplace design and solutions. What it's really created is a pause
in their decision-making because for them to make significant outsourcing decisions that are long-term
in nature, they need to have a clear understanding of how the footprint of their real estate needs will
evolve over time. And so it's not about a diminution or reduction of our existing revenue. It's more about
a delay in our pipeline. And what's important to appreciate is that we have significant diversification across
the clients that we serve within GWS. So we're not just serving their office footprint. We're also serving
their data center needs. We're serving their -- for life sciences clients, we're serving their research facility
needs. And so there's a lot of other opportunity out there across other property types and through our
client diversification where we see significant opportunities for growth as well.

So given the overall market size of integrated outsourcing, we currently think we have about a mid-single-
digit market share in a $1.6 trillion market. I think a $200 billion market of the total FM market, which is
about $1.6 trillion, I think there's still tremendous opportunity to grow that business and ensure that we're
doing it aligned with our clients' needs.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to
turn the call back to Bob Sulentic for closing remarks.

of the first quarter, I'm sorry.
