Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Q1 2020 Zebra Technologies Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.

Michael A. Steele
Vice President of Investor Relations

Before we begin, I need to inform you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking
and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

During this call, we will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business

Temptime and Profitect businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation is being
simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com, and will be archived there for at least 1 year.

Now I'll turn the call over to Anders.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I would like to say that
our top priority at this time is the health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners. We
are grateful to all of the frontline workers, especially those sacrificing their personal safety so that all of
us can continue to live and work safely through this challenging time. Those on our customers' frontlines
are heroes, serving in hospitals, grocery stores, delivery vehicles, warehouses and other parts of the
essential supply chains that help keep our lives as normal as possible. Many Zebra employees are also on
the frontline, supporting the build and repair of products and solutions that are essential to our customers
doing their jobs safely and efficiently. To all those heroes, we say thank you.

The financial results we published this morning reflect a challenging first quarter environment. We realized
a net sales decline of 1%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.1%, which contracted by 200 basis points, and
non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.67, a 9% decrease from the prior year. We had a strong start
to the year, and January and February generally played out to our expectations. However, late in the
quarter, as COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic, we experienced significant supply chain disruption,
including product manufacturing delays, restrictions on transportation of goods and the temporary closure
in late March of a key distribution center supplying the Americas. We took extraordinary steps to produce
and supply our mission-critical products to customers around the world. Our team was agile, pivoting our

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

resources quickly to closely monitor the situation and take bold action. For example, we chartered plans
to expedite product delivery from China to North America and Europe to meet customer commitments.
Despite best efforts, we were unable to completely fulfill our order book in the quarter, resulting in a high
backlog as we entered Q2. Production in China is now returning to normal, and we have stabilized our
global supply chain through mitigating actions. In addition to the supply chain challenges, we saw softer
demand through the channel globally, and China sales were very weak, with COVID-19 exasperating
trends that had already been soft due to trade tensions.

However, in any environment, enterprises worldwide utilize our solutions to address the evolving needs of
their customers. In this changing environment, our solutions have become even more necessary for our
customers. I would like to highlight a few notable Q1 wins supporting critical use cases in omnichannel, e-
commerce and health care.

One of the world's largest mass merchants purchased 40,000 of our ZQ6 series mobile printers to address
a number of front of store use cases, including online store pickup, pharmacy fulfillment and shelf tagging.
Additionally, we deployed several thousand TC5 series mobile computers to a large e-commerce player
in Asia. This follows our competitive takeaway win last year of their printing and scanning business. With
COVID-19, this e-tailers demand is growing exponentially. They have been hiring staff, and we are working
with them on additional solutions.

In health care, we supported the NHS Nightingale temporary hospital in the U.K. We provided an installed
solutions supporting the identification and flow of COVID-19 patients. Nurses at NHS have also been using
our TC5 Series health care mobile computers to arrange virtual visits between patients and their loved
ones.

As expected, transitory effects of tariffs and expedited shipping expenses weighed heavily on Q1 gross
margin and EPS. We have taken decisive actions to mitigate this impact, which drove operating expense
leverage despite lower sales volume. We continue to remain agile and take appropriate action as results
are pressured due to the challenging macro environment.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q1 financial results and discuss our outlook.

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Anders. Let us walk through the P&L on Slide 6. Net sales declined 1.3% in the first quarter,
less than 1% on an organic basis before the impacts of currencies and acquisitions. The COVID-19
pandemic caused supply and demand impacts to our consolidated sales growth of approximately 7
percentage points. Despite our sales decline, we believe that we generally outperformed in the market
globally.

Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales was most impacted by the COVID-19 disruption and
sales decreased 2.9%. In the larger supply chain impact was the temporary closure in North American
distribution center that Anders referenced, which delayed shipments of mobile computers into the channel.

Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment sales increased 3.2% in with relative strength in printing and zebra
retail solutions. We saw solid growth in managed and professional services across both segments of the
business, primarily driven by solid attach rates on increased product sales over the last 12 months. Our
locations solutions business was lower due to a pause in project spending.

Turning to our regions. In North America, sales were flat. A decline in mobile computing due to COVID-19
supply chain challenges was offset by growth in all other major categories. The EMEA sales increased 7%
with relative strength in mobile computing, printing and services. We saw particular strength in Central
Europe.

Sales in our Asia Pacific region declined 21%, driven by COVID-19 impacts on top of continued softness
in China due to trade tensions. China was down 35%, driving most of the regional sales decline. Latin
America sales declined 11%, led by lower mobile computing sales, largely impacted by supply chain
disruption.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Adjusted gross margin contracted 200 basis points to 45.2%, driven primarily by List 4 tariffs and
expedited freight as well as unfavorable large order mix.

Adjusted operating expenses declined $5 million from the prior year period and improved 10 basis points
as a percentage of sales. This improvement was primarily due to prudent cost management and lower
incentive compensation, partially offset by the inclusion of expenses from recently acquired businesses.

First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1%, a 200 basis point decrease from the prior period, driven
entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.67, a 9% year-
over-year decrease, inclusive of $0.17 negative impact from the transitory effects of tariffs and expedited
freight expense.

Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $95 million of free
cash flow in Q1. This was higher than the prior period, primarily due to lower use of working capital.
We repurchased $200 million of shares in Q1, leaving $753 million of remaining capacity under the
authorization. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at a modest 1.5x net debt-to-
adjusted EBITDA ratio.

Turning to Slide 8. We are well equipped to navigate the unprecedented global environment that we are
facing. As I just mentioned, our balance sheet is in excellent shape with low debt levels and $740 million
of capacity under our revolver. We deliver mission-critical solutions, increasingly diverse end markets.
Our capital-light business model as a highly viable cost structure due to our outsourcing of product
manufacturing and driving the vast majority of our sales volume to third-party distribution. We also have
a strong free cash flow profile with a flexible cost structure and capital expenditures, typically less than
1.5% of sales. We also have a track record of preserving profitability and cash flow in challenging times.
We use a playbook to take appropriate actions in various scenarios, preserving capacity for investments in
the business that improve our competitive position.

Let us turn to our outlook. Given the low visibility due to COVID-19, we are withdrawing our outlook for
full year net sales, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We now expect these 3 metrics to be lower
than last year, which would we address through cost actions to enhance our profitability and cash flow.

Q2 and Q3 are expected to be particularly challenging quarters based on macroeconomic forecast,
independent market research and feedback from our partners and customers. In this freed environment,
we have done extensive scenario planning and identified many operational and financial levers that we
can pull. It is imperative that we stick to our principles of acting swiftly to preserve profitability while
doing no harm to the business through reinforcement of our culture. This enable us to prioritize strategic
investments so that we emerge stronger than the competition as the market rebounds.

As Anders mentioned, we entered the second quarter with a strong backlog, driven by temporary supply
chain disruptions from the pandemic. As the virus spread, end market weakness is affecting all of our
major geographies across the globe. The impact is more pronounced in our run rate business through the
channel, as third-party distributors are recalibrating inventory levels.

Given these pressures and elevated uncertainty, we expect net sales to decline in Q2 between 11% and
17%. This outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point positive impact from recent acquisitions and
an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency changes.

We believe Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin will be between 18% and 19%, which assumes lower operating
expenses and a lower gross margin, reflecting a $5 million impact from List 4 tariffs and approximately $9
million of cost to mitigate supply chain disruption from COVID-19.

Collectively, these transitory items, I expect it to impact margin by approximately 150 basis points and
EPS by $0.22. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.50.

Please reference other 2020 modeling assumptions on Slide 9.

On Slide 10, we provide an update on the anticipated impacts to Zebra from Section 301 tariffs on
products imported to the U.S. We are generally on track to diversify our global sourcing footprint by

mid-2020, despite some modest delays due to COVID '19, particularly in our Malaysian facility. In
Vietnam, we have been ramping our expectations. This initiative is expected to mitigate our geographic
concentration risk. It also adds the immediate benefit of substantially mitigating List 4 tariffs that became
effective last September, impacting our mobile computers and printers.

We continue to work with our contract manufacturing partners to replicate production lines in order
to move most of our U.S. volumes to broader Asia. These actions are currently expected to result in
approximately $20 million of onetime pretax charges in the first half of 2020, plus approximately $10
million of capital expenditures.

In the first quarter, tariffs negatively impacted gross profit by $7 million. We expect this impact to decline
to $5 million in Q2 as we launch alternate sources of supply outside of China.

With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and end
market trends.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Thank you, Olivier. Slide 12 highlights how we are enhancing the value proposition for our customers. Our
solutions are even more critical today than ever as we give the frontline and edge by empowering them
with technology to do their job most effectively. Industry-leading companies trust Zebra to equip their
workers and facilities with the solutions that bring their mission-critical operations to the next level. We
are uniquely positioned to address this challenge because we have a deep understanding of workflows and
unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base. We can address big global
problems such as ensuring food safety across the supply chain or a broad range of more localized issues
like increasing bed turns in the hospital, modernizing distribution centers to satisfy e-commerce demands
or ensuring that retail associates and store inventory are optimized to maintain product availability.

We have been bringing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision to life for our customers. We are doing this
by enabling them to identify their assets through barcode, RFID and computer vision. Locate their assets
with our vertical-specific solutions and understand their condition, such as temperature, trailer capacity
and device security, so that their frontline workers can take the best next action in real-time.

Methods for sensing, analyzing and acting on operational data from the frontline of business have
undergone massive transformation in past years as the on-demand economy has taken hold. Inefficient
manual processes have evolved into workflows that are augmented and enriched by purpose-built
technologies, including hardware, software and intelligent edge solutions that bring it all together.
Businesses are now demanding information about what is happening at the edge of their operations so
that they can run their entire operation smoother, safer and smarter. They generate large volumes of
data and are uncertain how to take all those disparate points of information and effectively put it to work
in near real-time. We have been investing in software solutions and services that help our customers
leverage real-time data to better orchestrate their workflows and gain a performance advantage.
Investments in advancing our capabilities in this area remain a top priority.

On Slide 13, we highlight the primary vertical markets that we serve. Exciting longer-term growth
opportunities remain and new ones are evolving as customers in these markets are pressured to improve
their technological capabilities in an increasingly on demand economy. That said, we are seeing mixed
trends in this challenging environment, depending on the subsector. Many of our customers are deemed
essential businesses, while various others may be temporarily closed for business.

In health care, the pandemic dramatically increases the need for additional acute care capacity, which
is the primary area that we serve. Our suite of purpose-built health care solutions are enabling pop-up
hospitals, drive-through testing facilities and labs to scale quickly and provide safe and efficient care.
Other parts of health care have seen a slowdown as government mandates in many locations have paused
noncritical care and elective procedures until further notice.

Approximately 2/3 of our business in retail is the mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers who are serving
essential customer needs. Many retailers rely on our technology to execute their omnichannel fulfillment

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

effectively. E-commerce and Buy Online Pick Up In Store transactions have increased as more consumers
navigate purchasing from their homes. However, social distancing and stay-at-home orders are further
impacting department stores and certain apparel retailers who are heavily reliant on in-store purchases.

In the transportation and logistics space, increased online purchasing from households is driving
significant incremental parcel volume and delivery, which drives increased demand for our solutions.
Conversely, government-mandated restrictions are severely pressuring passenger airlines, rental car
providers and certain segments of the distribution industry.

The manufacturing sector has been challenged with global trade tensions and is facing additional
challenges today as stay-at-home orders have deemed many discrete manufacturers, such as auto,
aviation and specialty goods, nonessential. That said, some of these customers have been created
with their idle operations by producing medical equipment like ventilators, utilizing our solutions. Many
segments within process manufacturing, such as food and pharmaceutical companies, remain essential
and are less impacted.

In closing, we are confident that our business fundamentals and strategy are sound and that this crisis will
not last. By focusing on serving our customers' needs and continued investment in innovation, we expect
to extend our market leadership position as the market rebounds.

Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike.

Michael A. Steele
Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

I wanted to touch on your Q2 sales guide. You had a good backlog into the quarter, and it seemed as
though your Asia -- your North America sales seemed to be okay this quarter. So I'm wondering, is this
just a function of your backlog? And beyond that, is there a concern you just haven't quite seen the effect
of this hit other regions outside of Asia?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Andrew, we have, today, a lower visibility of the business due to the impact of COVID-19. And we are
basically pegged as a business to the economy. And a lot of what we see in Q2 is a question mark on
the length of the stay at home and also the impact of the various stimulus packages, either current or to
come. And if you study the company over the recent past, we have an history of rebounding quickly when
the economy restarts. Now when it comes to Q2, specifically, what we see today is obviously the impact
only due to COVID, we believe we are in a strong competitive position. We believe that, for example, in
Q1, we have gained shares. We had a strong backlog entering the quarter. And we see today from a top
line standpoint mainly an impact being more pronounced on run rate, which is part of the business going
through distribution. And we have seen our distributors, partners adjusting the level inventory. So this is
what we see today going on. But we believe we have a strong value proposition, which works well in good
and bad times, and we're going to be ready to manage this downturn, Andrew.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. And then your guidance for EBITDA margin. I think it was a bit ahead of where some people were
expecting. Directionally, is this a function of your gross margins being up sequentially? What's really --
what's behind that margin guidance? That's -- sort of ballpark.

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

So if you look at -- of course, so if you look at EBITDA, at the midpoint, the EBITDA margin will decline
year-on-year by about 270 basis points, so 270 basis points. 1.5%, so 150 basis points is due to one-
off items, either associated with tariffs or associated with the management of the pandemic, mainly
impacting our freight expense. And then the balance is a point of margin being lost due to run rate mix.
So if you look at today, if we disaggregate the revenue between bid and run rate, run rate margin is much
higher than bids, and we have seen the run rate of revenue declining. However, the margin profile for run
rate and bids have been increasing sequentially now for a few quarters. So what you see at play in the
profitability is a margin impact and largely -- large proportion of the margin impact being due to tariff and
C19. From an OpEx standpoint, we believe we're going to be able to retain the OpEx as a proportion of
revenue constant or relative to last year.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Paul Coster at JPMorgan.

Paul Coster
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I've got 2. The first one is, can you give us your latest thoughts on the USPS projects? And I know as we
throw the second question in now and that is, it sounds like you expect the channel to destock. Is that a

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

2Q phenomenon in the guidance? Or do you think it will take more than 1 quarter for them to do that?
And can you quantify that in any way?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes, Paul, I'll take both of these ones. First, on USPS. USPS contract continues as per our expectations. As
we've talked about before, this is a multiyear contract. We're certainly very proud of it, the biggest in our
history. I think it highlights the strength of our value proposition and the strength of our relationships. Our
teams -- our respective teams, the Zebra team and the USPS team, they continue to work very closely
together. Both sides are very engaged. So there's no expectations or signs from our side that this will be
pushed out in any way. As we said in our last quarter call, we do expect to begin ramping up in Q2 -- or
ramping deliveries in Q2. And we do assume or expect that the majority of all the orders will be deployed
by the end of 2021 as the back end is kind of gated by the -- when the U.S. carriers stop 3G service. And
at that point, USPS will need to have moved off to new devices.

We have received new orders beyond the current orders, so some new use cases but within the same
framework for an additional 30,000 units. So the business with USPS for us continues to be good, and we
certainly look forward to starting to deploy in earnest.

And then the other one on destocking in the channel. At the moment, I'd say, on a global basis, our
distribution partners who are the ones who hold inventory are holding a normal days on hand inventory.
We don't see it being high or low, particularly. It's going to be within the band that we consider to be
normal. What we tend to see early in the downturn is that when sales out goes down, from a disti
perspective, they adjust their days on hand, which means they don't have to buy as much in the short
term. And then that tends to be more of a 1 quarter type of activity. So here, we are assuming that
there will be a reduction in the run rate for our distis and partners, which will cause some level of lesser
inventory or maintain -- to maintain the same level of days on hand inventory.

Operator

And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Anders, you're one of you guys that's been around since the Great Recession back in 2008, 2009. Can you
just give us some of your thoughts in terms of how, I guess, your customers are responding now? And is
there that same level of fear now that you had back then? I think we understand how your business has
changed. But what was your interpretation of how the customers are reacting?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

I think the -- obviously, there's a very different drivers for this crisis versus the 2009 crisis. So I'd say our
customers today are probably not as -- well, back up and say, it very much now depends on which kind
of vertical or subsegment of the business you're in. I think in 2009, every customer had concerns about
liquidity and so forth. Here, we have a bit more of a have and have nots. So if you're a mass merchant,
a grocer, e-tailer or in health care, some of the delivery businesses, you're doing very well. They are
super, super busy. And if you're more of a brick-and-mortar retailers selling apparel, you might be having
shut down all your stores. I think from a customer behavior perspective, I'd say when the -- kind of the
orders around work from home started to be enacted, it probably took 2, 3 weeks for our customers to
kind of scramble and get themselves organized to adapt to the new kind of working environments. They
were very focused on just making sure their operations were continue to run. But in the last month, I'd
say, they've started to come back and start engaging with us on both current and more future-oriented
projects. And we're trying to be -- make sure we make good use of video conferencing to continue to
engage and have the sessions with our customers. And I don't perceive that our customers overall are
maybe as concerned with how long or how they're going to come out of this recession, maybe it feels like
they have a bit more confidence.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Got it. And then I think I heard some of this in your script, but can you clarify again, like what percentage
of your business do you think has done to essential customers?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

We didn't talk about it from the entire business. But if you look at retail specifically, which is our largest
vertical, 2/3 of our business there goes to mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers. And those are all
deemed essential. We've seen some interesting trends there that as people are adjusted to buying from
home, not necessarily visiting the store as much. So Buy Online Pick Up In Store has become much
more popular. Grocery volumes have gone up materially, but Buy Online Pick Up In Store has gone up
exponentially. And I think that's consumer behavior that is unlikely to revert back to what it was. I think
consumers have now learned a new way of all shopping that they like.

Then if you move -- look to health care, there we have, I would say, the majority of our business is tied to
essential activities, acute care, specifically. And we have been part of pop-up hospitals, drive-through test
facilities and just scaling existing health care facilities to be able to take care of the number of COVID-19
patients that come in. But obviously, there's parts of health care that has been deemed nonessential,
which -- but that's a smaller part of our business that do elective care and so forth.

Within transportation logistics, that's a -- I can't really have -- I don't have a good percentage number,
but it's a good part of that business is obviously also part of the essential economy, moving -- making
sure that the essential supply chains work all the way from pharmaceuticals to food to e-commerce. I'd
say here, for us, the last-mile delivery -- so many more deliveries to households today, and the last-mile
delivery drivers tend to have our type of devices. And so that's been helpful. But on the other hand, we
see other transportation logistics businesses like aviation, auto, rental car companies and so forth that are
under a lot of pressure.

And lastly, manufacturing, there, I'd say, a lot of the discrete manufacturers, aviation and automakers,
are not essential. They make up less than 5% of our total revenues, while most, I would say, process
manufacturing companies like food and pharma are deemed essential for us.

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

An additional point, Keith, as well, which we think is important. We think that the current situation will
actually accelerate the secular trends we are serving. E-commerce, tracking, digitization of workflow, we
believe that those trends are going to be even more important going forward.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. I think that to that point, we see that our solutions have become more necessary for our customers
as we really do empower the frontline workers across all the end markets. So these are the people
who cannot perform their duties from home. They have to be in a hospital, the grocery store delivery
truck. And so I think the crisis is helping to accelerate trends around digitization, automation across our
industries.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

A question on -- Anders, maybe I just wanted to go back to your comment about the haves and have nots
and that Slide 13, where you talk about some of the essential parts of the business in terms of vertical

channels. Is it fair to say that the essential components, whether it's retail, e-commerce, health care, that,
that's been -- you're anticipating that as a net benefit in the first half of the year? Or put another way,
would you expect that, that potentially, if we've seen increased investments in those areas, that falls off in
the second half in addition to the recessionary pressures that you're seeing in the traditional markets? I'm
just trying to get a sense as -- I think you can't give guidance for the full year. But I'm just trying to get
some feel for how that essential business might change from Q2 to Q3. I think you alluded to Q3, Olivier,
being a particularly challenging quarter.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. So we're going to stop short of trying to give real color or guidance on the full year here. But I'd say,
for us, we do -- our expectations is that this is not a long-term change in how we operate and the world
operates, but more of a several quarter activity. So we certainly expect it to impact Q2 and Q3. And then
depending on how quickly the world rebounds, we will follow. I'd say, for us, one of the benefits we have is
that we have a very robust business, a very diversified business across product lines, vertical markets and
geographies. And our value propositions tend to work in good times and bad times, right? Good times, our
customers are expanding, they're investing in their business, and they use our equipment to help them do
that. In tougher times, they tend to trade OpEx for CapEx, so they try to use us to get more efficiencies.
In the -- say, right now at the eye of the hurricane here, we are seeing, obviously, the -- many of the
essential business being very busy, busier than they had been before. And I think how they are behaving
today is that they are generally very focused on just making sure they can scale up their operations and
scale up the use of technology, but not necessarily having the bandwidth to think very creatively about
how to leverage new solutions. I think that will come when the world settles down a little bit more.

Customers that are not operating today, say, people who have had to shut down their operations, we are
talking to them still, though, to make sure that we stay engaged and figure out how can we help them
drive more of the digitization and automation of their businesses as they come back. So we feel that we
are -- we want to engage with all the customers that we have. But the -- obviously, the ones that are
essential are much more active in both running their businesses and looking to figure out how to scale
them.

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Let me add something, if I can. This is Joe Heel speaking. The concept, Jim, that you mentioned about
the haves and the have nots that Anders described earlier, also applies to a certain extent within the
essential customers. So for example, in health care customers, you have, of course, COVID-related
activity, which is, at the moment, receiving a lot of attention and funding and therefore, also activity from
us. But you also have elective procedures, which are being put off and corresponding investments that
hospitals are making are being postponed. Within retailers, you see a lot of things around Buy Online Pick
Up In Store, but for example, automation activities, like we showcased with our robot solution that we
introduced earlier, those are being paused. Now the good news is that we're not yet seeing a drop-off in
confidence among those customers. The customers are still engaging with us remotely on those longer-
term solutions. And so we expect that, that have not part will continue even in those essential sectors in
the future.

And our next question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.

Erik Taylor Lapinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Erik on for Meta. Maybe just staying on the question of kind of conversations with customers. It
sounds like for the most part, you've seen maybe a pushing off of projects. But can you help us, I guess,
contextualize, like how much could the reason potential just scaling down of maybe the size of some
orders? Or have you seen any potential cancellations from maybe customers most impacted?

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

So today, we've only seen a limited number of push outs. We have not seen any cancellations or any
scaling down of orders, as you put it. I think -- and the customers that have pushed out tends to be the
ones that are not operating today at all.

Erik Taylor Lapinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just changing gears a bit. On share repurchases, understanding you
kind of capitalize on the lower share price in the quarter. Like how should we think about the pace moving
forward? Would you continue to be opportunistic? Or should we kind of expect maybe more focus on cash
flow preservation just looking at the uptick there?

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

So we feel strong about the cash flow generation of the company. As we said, as I said, we believe we can
protect the majority of the free cash flow of the company even during this downturn. Now the priority for
cash allocation is going to be to invest in the business either organically or inorganically. We bought $200
million worth of shares. So it's about 2% of our shares outstanding. So at this stage, we are going to be
mainly investing in the business and buyback would not be a priority. Now it's not going to be totally off
the table, but not a priority.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Could you perhaps -- Olivier, could you perhaps just expand a little bit on the supply chain issues that
you had in the quarter? And maybe just speak to this Malaysian facility, which I'm assuming was a
subcontractor facility, had some closure and some downtime. Is it up? And do you -- could you just kind of
give us a sense of how much revenue that may have impacted the first quarter?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

I think I'll start with this, and then Olivier can help fill out some details. So if you go back until our Q4 call,
we highlighted that COVID-19 would have an impact on our supply chain, but there was on the supply side
of things. Since then, the China has largely returned to normal, it took a little longer than expected, I'd
say. And there was dependent partly on where our contract manufacturing partners were located. So they
had to return workers through 2-week quarantine periods and so forth. But by the end of the quarter, our
Chinese contract manufacturing partners were, I think, all working within -- at over 90% capacity. So I
think it came back a little slower, but it came back.

We also then, in the quarter, tried to ramp up both our Vietnam and Malaysia facilities. And timing was
a little more challenged as we were supposed to do that the Monday after the Lunar New Year. And
obviously, no Chinese people were allowed to travel there to help set it up and to teach people, but we
were, I think, quite agile and creative. So we set up video facilities so that we have people in China sitting
and watching via video what people in Vietnam and Malaysia were doing to teach them as well as we
could. And the Vietnam facility has come up very nicely. It manufactured the same number of printers that
we had expected, while the Malaysia facility started off a little slow, but then it got shut down based on
the Marshall Law that Malaysia implemented. But we're using the same techniques to get that facility up
and running.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

The impact on Q1, I think, was very modest from that perspective. We have diverted and tried to make
-- get as much out of China as we could. It had similar impact on tariffs as we now have to manufacture
everything in China or more -- the vast majority of our products in China, instead.

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

And going forward, we expect that the supply chain issues are going to be largely behind us. And what you
see reflected in our guide for Q2 is mainly some demand pressures.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. Actually, I think I call out to our supply chain is in order. They've done an excellent job of being agile
and working in a very dynamic situation to make sure that the -- all these issues had minimal impact on
Q1 and Q2.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then just as a follow-up question, are there any receivables or credit issues that you are watching
within -- the virus don't hold a lot of inventory, but are there any credit issues so we -- that you're
watching carefully?

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

So we're spending a lot of time on working capital, obviously DSO, most particularly. So far, the answer
is no. And the way -- again, we feel strong about our balance sheet, we feel strong about our free cash
flow and we feel strong about our working capital. And we want to use, in selected cases, the strength
of our balance sheet to increase the competitive position of the company. So from a credit standpoint, so
far, no particular issues, and we want to help our partners to navigate through this difficult time using our
balance sheet.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

And one more thing, maybe just to add some color on this. One thing that I think benefits us here is that
our partners, they -- their business is to resell our products. So if they are cut off from supply of our
products, if they can't get access to our products, their business goes away. So there is a strong incentive
from our partners to pay us to make sure that they can stay current and continue to do business.

Operator

Our next question today comes from Brian Drab at William Blair.

Brian Paul Drab
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I was wondering, first, if there's any way that you could help us by trying to quantify the backlog that
you're entering the second quarter with and maybe compare that to a typical quarter. Do you typically
enter a quarter with, say, 2 or 3 weeks of backlog? And now you have double that, or can you talk in some
terms like that to give us a sense?

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

So the size of the backlog entering the quarter was not out of the ordinary. And this size was slightly
higher due to some of the dispatch center issues we mentioned. So we had to shut down for about a day
at the end of the quarter one of our dispatch center and that was about $20 million. So that would be part
also of the opening backlog, but nothing out of the ordinary.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

You can think of it as the business continued to do well through the first quarter. So order flow was
normal. And the one additional thing was that the $20 million that we couldn't ship out of the North
America or the Americas distribution center that flipped into Q2.

Brian Paul Drab
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. That seems smaller than I would have thought. So that's, I mean, like 2% of revenue. So that's
enough for you to call that out. There's no other source of additional backlog entering 2Q?

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

Nothing of significant out of the ordinary.

Brian Paul Drab
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. And then I was just curious, it was -- why did that facility -- if you can talk about this, why did that
distribution center have to shut down? Was that a state-driven decision? Or was there an illness there?
And do you think that this is a -- potentially a risk in the -- going forward with other distribution centers
and facilities?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

So this was an outsourced facility, and there was a case of COVID-19. So they shut down for 36 hours and
came back in slower. We -- even before then, we had started to take some pretty dramatic drastic actions
in making sure that we had team A, B, C and so forth that we had put out more spacing between people,
taking a lot of actions to make sure that if anybody were to get infected, it would impact as only a small
team and not the entire facility. So if something like that were to happen again, I would expect it to have
much less impact than it had in the first quarter.

Olivier C. Leonetti
Chief Financial Officer

Another one, which is of size also, the quarter was very back-end loaded for obvious reasons, right? The
supply chain started slowly at the start and ended up strong. So we had to ship a lot in the last few days
of the quarter, and a day of shipment was worth much more than ever before. But we're confident that,
today, largely the risk from this distribution center standpoint is going to be mitigated going forward. We
have very good plans to mitigate those risks now.

And our final question today comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

You mentioned briefly the 3 acquisitions that you've made, that were not part of the original discussion.
Could you just update us on whether or not investment in them is going forward? And if they -- if so, what
role have they played or could they play later on in the year and into 2021?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

So I assume you talked about Temptime, Profitect and Cortexica. These are acquisitions we did last year,
yes. So I'd say all 3 are performing well. Temptime was the first one we made in the beginning of 2019.
They design and manufacture visual time-temperature monitoring solutions. It goes on -- a lot of them

goes on vials of vaccines in the developing world. Obviously, great -- it's very topical today, although we
don't have a vaccine yet for COVID-19. But that's…

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Kind of why I'm asking the question.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. Okay. So we're obviously in contact with WHO and others to make sure that when that happens, that
we can offer our solutions to ensure that the transportation of that vaccine can be temperature-controlled
and quality controlled.

Profitect was the second acquisition we did in June of last year. That is the -- they do the prescriptive
analytics, taking lots of different data inputs from a variety of sources, primarily in retail, and using
machine learning, AI to detect anomalies. And I'd say that's even more critical today as retailers are trying
to figure out what they have on the stores, what errors they have and how to quickly be able to assess --
rectify that with -- and being less dependent on having a physical presence in the store to be able to do
this.

And lastly, Cortexica, which was the computer vision company we acquired at the end of last year. This
is a smaller business, mostly focused -- our intent with that is to really leverage the competency of that
team, less so the kind of the product or the revenue stream. So they are very -- been very active in
engaging with building out our computer vision capabilities around our EMA robot, particularly, but also
solutions. And they've been a great addition to our team. They have great skill sets.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Okay. My follow-up will be quick. It has to do with your partner program. You mentioned that some of
your partners are essentially, if you don't provide them product, they have nothing to sell. The question is
about have you made any tweaks in that program during this period of time as you've seen ebbs and flows
in your supply chain and going into through the channel that increases for some folks and decreasing for
others? And what have you been doing with your partner program too, if you want to call, to make it more
efficient for both them and you?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. I think this is an excellent question for Joe Heel.

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. So in our partner program, we've had a lot of requests from partners that we help them both
technically with training, but also financially and with the program terms, in particular, like many of the
programs, we have some elements in the program that are -- or you can think of it like a frequent flyer
program, where you have to reach certain levels. And we have already announced that we are adjusting
those program terms. We're essentially extending it for an additional year. We're also adjusting some of
the thresholds that partners need to reach in order to earn their rebates. These are the typical things that
you would do in response to a changing business environment when the partners can't earn their targets.
And I think so far, it's been quite well received because it means that the partners will be able to operate
their businesses at the different levels and still achieve their targets.

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference
