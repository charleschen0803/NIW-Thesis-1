CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and
Webcast. [Operator Instructions].

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Please go ahead.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Phyllis, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter
2021 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will make forward-looking statements based
on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial
measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in this morning's earnings release.

Our results for the second quarter 2021 reinforced the positive theme from our first quarter results, with
a significant increase in realized prices year-over-year driving exponential growth in our financial metrics.
Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.26 per share, which represents over a
fivefold increase in adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year period, driven primarily by a 35%
increase in our realized natural gas prices. During the quarter, we also delivered positive free cash flow
of $64 million, our 18th quarter of positive free cash flow over the last 21 quarters, resulting in a $127
million improvement in free cash flow relative to the second quarter of 2020.

During the second quarter, we returned over 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders through our base
quarterly dividend as we continue to emphasize our strategic focus on returning a majority of our free
cash flow to shareholders. We continue to improve on our industry-leading cost structure during the
quarter as demonstrated by a 2% year-over-year improvement of all-in operating expenses to $1.41 per
Mcfe, excluding a $6.2 million of expenses during the second quarter related to the pending merge with
Cimarex Energy, our unit cost improved by 4% relative to prior year period.

Production for the second quarter of 2021 was 1% below our guidance range due to a longer-than-
anticipated maintenance-related midstream downtime primarily resulting from one of our third-party
providers compression station and operational delays during the quarter that pushed the timing of certain
wells down on production to later in the second quarter and into the first part of the third quarter.

Our production volumes for the third quarter to date have averaged approximately 2.3 Bcf per day, a 4%
increase relative to our second quarter production levels. We incurred $166 million of capital expenditure
during the second quarter, a 5% reduction relative to the prior year period. Our capital for the quarter
was in line with our prior guidance for higher activity levels in the second and third quarters, which are
expected to result in sequential production growth during the second half of this year, primarily during the
fourth quarter in anticipation of higher realized natural gas prices and the in service of the Leidy South
Expansion Project.

We also drilled 5 more net wells and completed 121 more stages than originally planned during the second
quarter, highlighting continued efficiency gains in our operations. Our balance sheet remains as strong as
ever with less than $900 million of net debt as of quarter end, resulting in a net leverage ratio of less than
1x trailing 12-month EBITDA. We expect to continue to reduce our absolute debt levels during the third
quarter through the repayment of $100 million tranche of debt maturing in September.

On the pricing front, our bullish thesis for natural gas prices entering this year has continued to
materialize, resulting in significant year-over-year gains in natural gas prices across North America.
Through July 2021, NYMEX prices have risen 61% compared to the same time frame in 2020, while Leidy
prices have increased by 43% over the same period. Despite transitory pipeline maintenance and outages

that resulted in wider regional basis differentials during the second quarter of 2021, we have recently
witnessed forward prices and cash prices across Appalachia's sales locations beginning to compress and
trend back to their historic pricing relationships.

We have updated our full year differential guidance of $0.50 to $0.55 to $0.70 to $0.75, primarily as a
result of the impact of higher anticipated NYMEX prices relative to our fixed price sales agreement and to a
lesser extent, wider regional basis differentials.

Our prior differential guidance from our first quarter earnings release in late April was based on a $2.75
NYMEX for the year. While our updated guidance is based on an average NYMEX price of approximately
$3.35 implied by actual year-to-date and the future curve for the balance of the year. At the midpoint of
our updated guidance range, our pre-hedged natural price realizations are now expected to be 18% higher
than our prior year guidance from late April and 60% higher than our actual 2020 price realizations.

Third quarter 2021 differentials are expected to widen relative to the second quarter with a tightening
expected in the fourth quarter. We are extremely encouraged by natural gas prices for the balance of the
year, where the current NYMEX futures are averaging over $4. Despite wider differentials in the Northeast
during the second quarter, we are optimistic about a strong improvement in local in the second half of
the year, driven by our expectation for continued strength in regional gas demand, flat production profiles
across the Appalachian basin and a significant reduction in east storage levels, which are currently 17%
below 2020 levels and 8% below the 5-year average.

Of equal importance, we are very optimistic on the impact of the Leidy South Expansion Project that is
projected to be placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2021 and will deliver 580 million cubic foot
per day of Northeast Pennsylvania production volumes to the Mid-Atlantic market area, while further
improving Cabot's realized pricing.

Additionally, the PennEast and Regional East Access expansion projects are projected to be in service
between 2022 and 2024, which will move even more supply out of the basin and into growing demand
markets. As we look forward to 2022, we are extremely encouraged by the improvement in the Cal '22
NYMEX futures to approximately $3.50 or 34% increase since the beginning of the year. We are currently
unhedged in 2022, providing significant exposure to a strong natural gas price environment that supports
an improving cash flow profile. In this morning's release, we reaffirmed our full year stand-alone 2021
plan to deliver an average net production rate of 2.35 Bcf per day from a capital program of the $530
million to $540 million.

Our capital guidance range for the year remain unchanged despite the increase in our expected net
well drilled -- net wells drilled from 80 to 85 resulting from our continued drilling efficiencies. We also
provided our third quarter 2021 production guidance range of 2.275 to 2.325 Bcf per day. The third
quarter guidance range implies sequential production growth of 4% relative to the second quarter at the
midpoint, while we anticipate approximately 10% of sequential production growth from the third quarter
to the fourth quarter coinciding with higher winter natural gas prices and the in-service of the Leidy South
Expansion Project.

Third quarter capital expenditures are expected to decrease relative to the second quarter with a greater
sequential decline anticipated in the fourth quarter, driven by lower activity levels as we enter the winter
season. Operationally, we continue to execute our program in line with guidance, while financially, our
outlook for 2021 is much stronger as a result of higher expected realized prices. Based on current strip,
our stand-alone free cash flow for the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 2x our first
half free cash flow, excluding the impact of merger-related expenses.

I also want to provide a brief update on our pending merge with Cimarex as we are excited as ever about
the compelling strategic and financial benefits of our merge, and we continue to make progress towards
closing the fourth quarter of 2021. As I noted, when announced the transaction in May, we carefully
studied the long-term benefits of expanding geographically beyond the Marcellus Shale and adding more
scale and balance to our operation. The pending merge will accelerate our strategy and create an industry-
leading operator with geographic and commodity diversity, scale, financial strength to thrive in today's
market and over the long-term across the commodity price cycles.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

With the addition of Cimarex oil assets in the Permian and Anadarko basins to our natural gas assets in
the Marcellus Shale, we will be a more resilient company with scale and strong positions in the premier
oil and gas basins in the United States. Together, we will have top-quality assets and the lowest cost of
supply profile relative to our upstream peers, which will facilitate free cash flow generation, shareholder
value creation and an accelerated return of capital to shareholders. With our increased footprint, we
will have complementary oil exposure with low-cost, high-margin assets, and we'll be positioned to
capture opportunities from both near-term oil demand and long-term natural gas transition fuel demand.
Compared to Cabot stand-alone, the combined business will be able to return substantially more capital to
shareholders, especially in light of the improvement in natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, oil prices
since the deal was announced in late May.

This best-in-class capital profile return will be driven by a high-quality portfolio that delivers significant
free cash flow through cycles, a very low cost of supply through consolidation of Cabot's and Cimarex's
top-tier teams and assets and a reduced cost of capital due to increased scale, a strong balance sheet
and increased liquidity. In short, combining the Cimarex (sic) [ Cabot ] with Cimarex will create a clearly
differentiated energy company with a strong financial foundation and the right assets, exposure and
capital allocation flexibility to deliver peer-leading capital returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

As a stronger, more resilient company, we will be well positioned to generate substantial free cash flow
through commodity cycles, facilitate best-in-class capital returns and deliver enhanced shareholder value.

I would like to acknowledge the incredible work and dedication of our employees. I believe we have the
best employees in the world, and I have been inspired by their commitment over the last year. To our
Cabot employees, you have my deepest appreciation. Looking ahead, we remain on track to close the
transaction in the fourth quarter of 2021 shortly after receiving shareholder approval. We look forward
to continuing to engage with our shareholders in the weeks ahead regarding the benefits of the pending
merge. This transaction builds on and accelerates the strategy we have been executing and I hope you will
share our excitement and enthusiasm for the future. Together with Cimarex, we intend to deliver superior,
long-term value creation for our shareholders and other stakeholders.
And Phyllis, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I was hoping you could talk a little bit to the mechanics of the 10% production increase in the fourth
quarter. It seems like a really big jump here. Just trying to get a sense of whether or not maybe there
have been some volumes held back here in 3Q or 2Q just on the wider diffs. Just trying to get a sense
mechanically if you're just opening up the wells a little bit more or maybe a lot of this is timing of turn in
lines, but just kind of help us get to that 10% in 4Q.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Leo. I appreciate the question. With the cadence that the North Group has set up and Phil Stalnaker
is here with us this morning. But with the cadence that had been set up for our 2021 program, which was
done certainly a while back, the timing of just when we bring on those locations is what enhances that
fourth quarter production growth. And keep in mind, it's by design somewhat to be able to take advantage
of the anticipated fourth quarter increase in pricing. But it was also designed in anticipation of the Leidy
South coming online and commissioning.

So by design, but keep in mind, when we have just so few pads that we bring on during the year, we're
-- and you've seen it in the past how -- if you delay 3 or 4 or 5 days bringing on a big pad, it can either
enhance your production on any given quarter or slightly reduce your production on any given quarter. But
it is a very, very narrow period of time that, that's disruptive one way or the other. But this fourth quarter
increase was somewhat by design on the cadence of us accelerating our capital this year upfront and kind
of dissipating a little bit towards the back end into the winter months.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just to follow up on your expectations there. So can you just update us
on kind of when do you think that the Leidy South Expansion comes on? Is that going to be earlier in the
fourth quarter, maybe a little bit better? And can you talk a little bit to the benefit that you're expecting in
terms of local pricing around that? And then lastly, you mentioned you're still unhedged for '22 despite the
ability to hedge it, I guess, to $3.50 right now. So maybe just provide any thoughts around that.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Very good. I will just mention first the hedge kind of out of the way. I'll let Jeff weigh in also on the
Leidy South. But we're looking at market. We're looking at the macro environment. We keep a close eye
on the storage. As we mentioned, storage levels up in the east are drawn down significantly from last year
and below the 5-year average. That's all constructive to a 2022 pricing. So we're keeping a close eye on
that.

Do I think we'll have some hedge volumes in 2022 at some point? Yes, I do. And our Hedge Committee
meets on a fairly regular basis to have that discussion. We've been bullish for the reasons we're all
aware where natural gas prices have been going. We're also aware that the capital constraint that is
being demonstrated by industry is constructive to the macro environment. And we look forward to that
continuing certainly for Cabot.

With that, Leidy South, Jeff, I'm going to let you talk about and what your expectations are.

Senior Vice President of Marketing

Okay. Well, thank you, Leo. Leidy South, as you know, has been on the drawing board for a number of
years. And for Cabot, it's an incremental 250,000 a day out of the in-basin area. For Seneca and the other
shipper on the project, it's 330,000 a day from the western side of Northeast PA. For Cabot, the expansion
involved a couple of new compressor stations and some expansion of existing stations. Those projects
are pretty much complete. A little bit of testing to be done and some regulatory approvals to wrap that
up. We do anticipate a full hand service on December 1. However, there could be some volumes available
prior to that. We will likely find that out sometime during August. For the rest of the project that includes
some pipe replacement, it's on schedule. We do have bimonthly updates with Williams and Transco and
everything is on schedule.

So incrementally speaking for Cabot, it does move quite a bit of volume out of in-basin pricing down
to the Atlantic -- Mid-Atlantic area. For the most part, we've already secured markets. We have some
opportunities and some options yet they're going to wait and see on. So we'll pick up primarily the
difference between Mid-Atlantic pricing and in-basin pricing, although our expectation is in-basin pricing
will materially improve with the low eastern storage levels and other fundamentals.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe a follow-up to Leo's question kind of on Leidy South. Dan, can you give us maybe your thoughts on
how this would influence your views on differentials in 2022 when you get that expansion? And also just
wondering if you can maybe remind us of the transport costs on that pipe.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I'll just make a color commentary, Arun, and then I'll let Jeff follow up. But my view of the
differentials is it is going to be very constructive. We realize the reason for this and having higher
differentials is just the gas on gas competition and exasperated by too much production too little
takeaway. 0.5 Bcf -- greater than 0.5 Bcf a day into other markets and out of the basin and essentially
just right out of our neck of the woods is going to be constructive, and we feel very good about it.

And I think we'll see improvements and you're already seeing out there some improvements from today
as you move out. So we're constructive and look forward to the other -- in my commentary, we look
forward to the other pipelines into -- in between the 2022 to 2024 period also to be constructive for the
differentials up in the Northeast.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Great. And just my follow up. Dan, we are getting, call it, a near-term kind of price signal on
natural gas, but the back end of the curve still kind of remains below $3. Obviously, it's maybe a different
decision with the Cimarex merger, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on what type of price signal
would you need to think about adding a little bit of growth to the market? Because obviously, the prices
today are well above your -- call it, your hurdle rates in terms of getting an adequate kind of rate of
return.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We have a program that's lined out, and we've -- as we've discussed in the past as pretty close to
maintenance of very low growth. And right now, our plan is to stick with that. You can look at a -- you
can look at impacts on differentials and you can look at the program, and it makes sense for us to deliver
into a market that is well tuned on supply and demand versus one that's oversupplied. We think that

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

makes more sense. We think it is of more value to the shareholders, not moving as much gas out of your
inventory, your asset base for a better price point than moving more gas out of your inventory for a less
price point.

So we're pleased with what we're -- how we're programming going forward. The increased price is
not going to be the driver. We look at the dips, the realizations. And more importantly, we look at the
takeaway that's coming and then measuring its effect on the dips going forward. But I'll let Jeff make a
comment also.

Jeffrey W. Hutton
Senior Vice President of Marketing

Yes. So back to your first question. We'd not argue that the fundamentals have driven the -- or at least
the differentials to a point where in shorter months and with other factors, they've done a little bit
disappointing this year. I spoke earlier about the pipe replacement on the Leidy system or the Leidy South
Expansion. That was a huge issue in May of this year, did not affect Cabot operationally but in the basin,
we saw the differentials drop from about $0.80 down to $1.80, not really for any good reason, but the
markets did not anticipate the duration of the pipe replacement by Transco.

All that said, as -- back to your original question, the rate is $0.50 per MMBtu for Cabot on our end. If
we get out of the basin down to the Mid-Atlantic market, that compares to a $0.65 rate that we currently
have on the Atlantic Sunrise project, which was the -- of course, the original foundation pipeline.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Thanks for your color and congrats to your team for not hedging. That looks to be a good call
today.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research.

Joshua Ian Silverstein
Wolfe Research, LLC

I just wanted to talk about the stock price and the forward curve. Your stock is down 12% over the past
year, while the 2022 curve is now up about 35% over that time period. I want to try to get aggressive
given that dislocation that you've had that's out there right now, buy back your stock, try to really take
advantage of this environment as it seems like that's probably the only way to get this to close right now
given some of the uncertainty around the transaction. So just curious around that.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Josh, I'll let Scott respond to that. We still have all the arrows in our quiver. And we are also certainly
been disappointed with where our stock range is. But I'll let Scott handle that.

Scott C. Schroeder
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Josh, I think it's a very good point. And I think under normal circumstances, what I mean by normal
circumstances would be Cabot stand-alone, that would be higher on the discussion list, particularly it
would have been this week in our Board room and our Board meeting, especially with math modeling,
looking at the fact that we're looking at double the free cash flow generation in the second part of the
year. Our stand-alone commitment to return 50% in cash, still plenty of availability to make that.

What changes that dynamic is the announcement of the merger, but also all of the things that we've laid
out in anticipation of the closing of the merger, the special dividend and those aspects. We want to make
sure and manage our capital in this transitionary period so that when we come out together by the end
of the year, early fourth quarter close, but by the time we report at the end of the year, we're still as rock

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

solid on the balance sheet. This, as Dan said, will still be an arrow in the quiver. We have had a couple of
shareholders talk to us about this in investor calls more recently. As you know, when you look back at us,
it has been part of our dynamic and will continue to be part of the dynamic going forward. As you know, in
the announcement, I am still in the same chair in the combined organization. So I appreciate the question.
Not the right time at this moment but get past all the noise of the merger. And I think it's definitely on the
table for a big discussion.

Joshua Ian Silverstein
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. Yes, and I agree. I mean, I think could be higher without the uncertainty of the transaction there.
And then just on the free cash flow estimate that you've outlined for -- between now and 2024, the $5.7
billion. Can you just talk about some of the assumptions behind that? How much comes from the Cimarex
asset base versus your asset base? Or what are the assumptions around it? Are you guys basically in
maintenance mode in Northeast PA. Just any sort of assumptions around that would be helpful.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Josh, our free cash flow, as we mentioned, I think in the second half of the year is going to be say,
double our first half of the year. And it's just looking at what our capital program allocation is and looking
at what we anticipate the realizations are going to be. And -- it's -- and I know your models out there
are starting to pick up on that also. We still have a -- certainly a significant unhedged volume and rolling
into '22. Looking at our forward curve on the 2022 free cash flow, which from our internal models is
significantly better than we had started looking at it earlier in this year. So -- but right now, our cash flow
is designed on -- or our expectation is designed on the macro and our capital program that we've given
guidance for.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Dan, I've got 2 questions. The first is one is on takeaway capacity. You kind of laid out, albeit a month
post date the merger, but you've laid that in there for your input to the strategy, I guess, but you've laid
out the takeaway capacity expansion you expect over the next couple of years. Does that move Cabot
back to expansion mode on the stand-alone assets? And if so, what would you think -- what would you see
as your...

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

I'm sorry, Doug, let me interrupt you 1 second, if I could. Your phone, and I'm talking to Phyllis also, your
phone is cutting in and out, and I am having a very difficult time receiving your question.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

All right. I've picked up the phone. Is that any better, Dan?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Let's try that.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Okay. I'll try but my headset is obviously playing up today. Sorry about that. So my question is on
takeaway capacity. What it means for Cabot's longer-term plateau production level? What do you think
you can get to, albeit even with -- you're obviously not going to be in the chair longer term and a lot of
that is online, but what do you think the ultimate takeaway production capacity could be for Cabot longer
term? That was a simple part of the question.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

The ultimate production?

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. With the line of sight you have on takeaway capacity today, what do you think you can get to over the
next couple of years?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'm not going to speculate out that far. We have enhancing takeaway capacity in the basin by the
Leidy South and the PennEast and the regional access. So we're pleased to see additional takeaways
there, Doug. We have a long, long runway of premier locations out in front of us. We've managed
our program right now to glide on a maintenance capital in light of the macro. And so right now, the
shareholders like to see a significant amount of free cash flow. They also like to see a strong balance
sheet. We're able to deliver both of those, but I would only be speculating as far as maybe the timing of
those lines when they would be commissioned and what the macro market is way out in front of us to
answer that.

I can say this if you just wanted to drill wells and drill them for a long time and bring in the equipment and
frac crews to be able to get that done to increase production, it could increase significantly from where it
is today. And I mean, significantly. But I'm not going to speculate on the amount where it might go in the
next couple of years.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Matt's done a pretty good job explaining how you guys kind of led the charge on capital discipline during
your tenure, Dan, so I congratulate you on that. My second question, if I may, is really on the merger.
And again, for Cabot, this has clearly achieved a lot of things. The S-4 is now out. We can all see what
happened. But I'm just curious to the extent you can share from the discussions you've had with your
shareholders, are you at all concerned about the pushback from Cimarex shareholders that are going to
own a much gassier company and as the selling company did not run a process, are you concerned that,
that could get in the way of this closing. I'm just curious on your perspectives on that.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I am kind of constrained somewhat on the details of the merge, but I will say this, that we're
combining these companies for the reasons that I outlined in my comments. It's going to be a much
stronger company, more resilient company and positioned to drive a significant free cash flow across
the cycles. We're seeing cycles right now where natural gas is having it another day in the sun and it's
enhancing the cash flow of Cabot. And I think it's a benefit to both Cabot. And in a combined world, it
would be a benefit.

So long term and you look at the natural gas as a dynamic energy product of the future. I don't know how
you cannot embrace a combination that creates the resiliency and the type of company that we're going to
have going forward with an extremely strong balance sheet and with a disciplined objective of delivering
significant free cash flow back to shareholders. So I don't know how any shareholder could not be excited
about the future of this combination.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. I think the issue is a lack of industrial overlap, Dan, as I'm sure you know because all of the above
could have been achieved with a lot more synergies, I think, is the issue. But I appreciate your comments,
and thanks so much for the answer.

Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just wanted to follow up on some of the slides as following the announcement of the acquisition. You
talked about a variable dividend that you put out a reasonable P50 estimate of what you think the
special or -- dividend could be. Can you talk about as you look at the forward curve into 2022, give us an
estimate of what you think that variable dividend could look like next year?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I would say this. I think the variable dividend is going to look very good in particular, compared the
way it looked at the beginning of this year. However, I'll let Scott give it some color also.

Scott C. Schroeder
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean thanks, Neil. Remember, the variable dividend we call the supplemental in ours was to return
at least 50% of the free cash flow in cash back to shareholders. And that is memorialized going forward
in the new company. So obviously, in the new company, going forward with the broader base, the broader
commodity mix, obviously, the higher realizations on the oil side, it's going to be fairly robust in terms of
not only what's part of the variable, but the increase in the base dividend to the $0.50 level. It's also been
preannounced for the transaction. So again -- but we've got to come together, put the models together,
put combined guidance out in the new year, but I think it's safe to say that remember, the key point in
that message was a minimum of 50% of free cash flow being returned in cash.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then the follow-up is just on the Henry Hub gas market here. As you think about overall
gas flat price, if we do have a cold winter, you can start to really design some real upside scenarios. Can
you talk about what you ultimately think creates a ceiling on natural gas and that scenario historically,
we've thought about gas to coal substitution as the balancing item but with as much coal-fired capacity
having been shut as it has that mechanism might not be as pronounced, but you also have the potential
for Canadian gas flow, for example, or shutting down the LNG arm. So how do you think about what is
the mechanism that -- on the natural gas side that can offset the potential demand impact of a very cold
winter?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Neil, and I'll turn that to Jeff, our gas expert.

Jeffrey W. Hutton
Senior Vice President of Marketing

Yes, Neil, that's an intriguing question because we have -- we thought about that here, too. The impact
of the demand across the country currently with record exports in Mexico and obviously, a very robust
LNG export market that is fairly consistent day in, day out, you have a few hiccups here and there with fall
and maintenance and things like that. But it's been fun over the last couple of years to watch this demand

increase. Even in the Pacific Northwest, you mentioned the Canadian imports it's been interesting to watch
as we see hydro up there and the commission that's in more exports from Canada head in that direction
and then to the upper Midwest. That's actually influenced the storage levels in the upper Midwest. I think
they're somewhere well over 100 Bcf flow this time last year, same as the east storage levels.

So your question about how high can it go is a good question. And in our Hedge Committee meetings,
of course, we think about that or we've done a wish about that. And it's -- fundamentally, we're set up
for good year-over-year capital that's put in place. And yes, we had a good winter in certain spots of the
country this year. It will tax the system, and there will be price increases. We're prepared to producing to
our commitments with our customers. Storage levels will not get to where they were at this time last year.
It's a well-known fact. So how high can it go is relative, particularly in the New York market, the Boston
market, the Chicago market and other areas that do like the amount of storage that we had last year. So if
I was a gambler or a speculator, I don't know if there is a cap necessarily for $4, $5, $6, we have seen $8
in non-New York market in the past. So I think it's all on the table at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Pickering Energy Partners.

David Martin Heikkinen
Pickering Energy Partners Insights

I wanted to make sure that I'm thinking about one of the synergies of the merger correctly. So for
stand-alone Cabot, we had your cash taxes increasing over time, just given where you were and now
particularly with the increase in commodity prices. Just wanted to get some of your thoughts on deferred
tax percentage. But then once you're merged, you get the benefit of the Cimarex NOLs. And if you could
talk a little bit about how cash taxes change in the Cabot stand-alone. And then the new company, that'd
just be helpful to kind of quantify that benefit to you all.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I have both Matt and Scott here and we have all kinds of modeling run on all that, getting into the
details, David, we can do once we get the -- all the shareholder approval but I'll let...

David Martin Heikkinen
Pickering Energy Partners Insights

Maybe what would your cash taxes have been just stand-alone would be helpful then certainly I'll like to
talk about the post merge.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Okay. Thanks, David.

Matthew P. Kerin
VP of Finance & Treasurer

David, it's Matt. Yes. We're currently 30% deferred this year, 70% current. And that continues to be the
case even with this higher NYMEX environment that we're looking at today. As we roll forward to 2022
and beyond, if we were stand-alone, we would see that number, deferred start ticking down a little bit,
especially in the $3.50 environment. I don't know if that's 20%, 25% next year, something along those
lines of $3.50. But it's obviously going to be very sensitive to movement in pricing. And obviously, what
we're doing on the capital front is where we're able to take advantage of IDCs.

David Martin Heikkinen
Pickering Energy Partners Insights

Yes, this moving commodities makes this deal even better for you all as you get that benefit. So I was just
trying to quantify it. That's helpful.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan
Dinges for closing remarks.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Phyllis, and thank you all for tuning in. We look forward to the future for Cabot, its
shareholders, and we're extremely excited about the combination with Cimarex, the quality of people
they have, the asset quality they have. It's a bright, bright opportunity for the future for both shareholder
groups. And we are certainly committed to be able to deliver all that we've represented to deliver, if not
more, once we obtain the shareholder approval and get closed in the early fourth quarter. So thanks again
for your interest, and we look forward to the next meeting we have. Thank you very much.
