Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Aptiv Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tracy, and
I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Elena Rosman, Aptiv Vice President of
Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.

Elena Doom Rosman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining Aptiv's Third Quarter 2020
Earnings Conference Call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at
ir.aptiv.com. Today's review of our actual financials exclude restructuring and other special items and will
address the continuing operations of Aptiv. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures
for our third quarter financials are included at the back of today's presentation and the earnings press
release.

Turning to the next slide. You can see here a disclosure on forward-looking statements, which reflect
Aptiv's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual
performance for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings, including uncertainties posed
by the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficulty in predicting its future course and impact on the global
economy.

Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Aptiv's President and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice
President of Business Operations. Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, and then Joe will
cover the financial results and outlook for the remainder of the year in more detail.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 3. Our strong third quarter results reflect our
culture of continuous improvement, which has created a more sustainable business that thrives in any
environment. Our portfolio of safe, green and connected technologies has translated into year-to-date
revenue growth which is 10 points over underlying vehicle production, and our optimized cost structure is
a competitive advantage, positioning us to withstand the 50%-plus reduction in this year's second quarter
volumes and remain EBITDA breakeven.

Our culture of flawless execution has allowed us to ramp up production to meet the rapid rebound of
customer schedules while managing through the challenges related to labor availability and a tightening of
the global supply chain, with zero customer disruptions in a quarter that we experienced a 60% sequential
increase in vehicle production.

The proactive portfolio and cost structure actions we've taken over the last few years to strengthen our
business model have positioned Aptiv to outperform in any environment with more sustainable earnings
and cash flows, a disciplined and proven approach to value creation and the flexibility to accretively deploy
capital. I'm proud of how our team has performed during this challenging year, and I'm grateful for their
commitment to our culture that drive continuous improvement, ensuring Aptiv can outperform in any
environment.

Moving to Slide 4. The strong rebound in vehicle production, combined with solid operating execution,
contributed to strong financial results in the third quarter. Revenues increased 3% to $3.7 billion,
representing 7 points of growth over vehicle production. EBITDA and operating income totaled $581
million and $389 million, respectively, and adjusted earnings per share reached $1.13.

APTIV PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Looking at each region. Government fiscal policies and improved business conditions boosted vehicle
production 11% in China, and OEMs in North America and Europe are aggressively restocking vehicle
inventories, resulting in the strong ramp-up in vehicle production, which translated into a year-over-year
decline of only 1% and 8%, respectively, during the quarter. The increase in COVID-19 cases during the
quarter, especially in Mexico and Eastern Europe, created supply chain disruptions principally related to
Tier 2 and Tier 3 electronics and component manufacturers, which resulted in volatile customer schedules,
leading to some operational headwinds.

We're closely monitoring the more recent spike in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and North America
and the potential impact on the global supply chain and customer schedules, but have not reflected
incremental disruptions in our outlook for the fourth quarter and 2021 global vehicle production. Joe will
cover our fourth quarter and full year guidance in more detail shortly.

As shown on Slide 5, third quarter new business bookings totaled $4.6 billion, representing a more
normalized run rate for new business awards. Year-to-date bookings reached $10.5 billion, benefiting from
a meaningful increase in new business win rates, partially offset by the day-to-day operating challenges
related to COVID-19.

Advanced Safety and User Experience segment new business bookings totaled just over $2 billion year-to-
date as a handful of customer awards initially planned for this year have been pushed to 2021. And new
business bookings for our Signal and Power Solutions segment totaled more than $8 billion year-to-date,
including $1 billion of high-voltage electrification awards driven by the increased demand for electrified
vehicle platforms.

For the full year, we now expect new business bookings in the range of $16 billion to $17 billion, roughly
flat to 2019 levels when adjusted for our current outlook for lower global vehicle production. The
cumulative amount of our new business bookings over the last few years gives us tremendous confidence
in our ability to sustain strong above-market growth across both of our business segments, validating
the strength of our portfolio of market-evolving technologies, aligned to the safe, green and connected
megatrends.

Looking at our business segments in more detail, beginning on Slide 6 with Advanced Safety and User
Experience. As the need for more complex software, hardware and systems integration expertise
increases, our unique ability to offer highly functional, scalable and optimized solutions across the active
safety and user experience domains has driven continued strong revenue growth over market despite
the decline in vehicle production over the last few years. And our increasing capabilities in software
development and data analytics positions us well for future high-growth, high-margin opportunities in new
markets. These industry trends and our unique capabilities underpin our outlook for 8 points of growth
over market in our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment this year, reaching roughly $3.5 billion
of revenues.

Turning to Slide 7. Our OEM customers continue to launch advanced safety solutions across their vehicle
platforms and democratize these features across their vehicle lineups to meet increasing consumer
demand. While at the same time, Europe and China NCAP standards are accelerating the adoption of
advanced safety solutions. Several OEMs have decided to make automatic emergency braking as well as
other ADAS features standard equipment in the U.S. by 2022, all of which translates into a significant
demand from OEMs for Level 2 and 2+ ADAS solutions, seeding the next big wave of market penetration,
even as the industry experiences lower vehicle production volumes due to COVID-19.

Our unique first-in-industry approach to compute centralization and scalable satellite architecture has
strengthened our competitive position and sustained our strong revenue growth and is validated by the
fact that we now provide OEM customers with more than 6 million radars annually compared to only 1
million just 5 years ago. And our satellite architecture solution will be deployed across 10 million vehicles
over the next 5 years. As such, we're confident that we will continue to grow our active safety revenues at
a compounded rate of 25% per year over the next few years, reaching over $2 billion by 2022.

APTIV PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Importantly, our Gen 2 ADAS platform will further increase our competitive moat, with the deployment of
next-generation perception systems and a higher level of software abstraction that will deliver even more
consumer value while enabling new business models for Aptiv and reduce investment for OEM customers.

Turning to our Signal and Power Solutions segment on Slide 8. We're leveraging our industry-leading
position in vehicle architecture to become the partner of choice for both our traditional and new emerging
OEM customers. By integrating our broad portfolio of low- and high-voltage solutions, including the
conductor, connectors, electrical centers and cable management systems, we're able to reduce the weight
and physical size of the electrical distribution system by up to 40%, thereby reducing costs for OEM
customers.

We are also leveraging our expertise in harsh-environment electronics to penetrate adjacent markets such
as the commercial vehicle, data telecom and industrial sectors. Our momentum in our Signal and Power
Solutions segment gives us confidence in delivering revenue growth of 9 points over vehicle production
this year, reaching $9 billion of revenues.

Moving to Slide 9. We continue to see an acceleration of powertrain electrification driven by both more
stringent CO2 regulations, principally in Europe and China and increasing consumer demand globally.
Our complementary high-voltage distribution and connection systems as well as cable management
solutions leverage our low-voltage core competencies that include vehicle architecture optimization,
system-level expertise and global manufacturing and supply chain management to enable the acceleration
of powertrain electrification by significantly reducing the weight and mass of the vehicle architecture
through smarter, more efficient design, perfectly positioning Aptiv to benefit from the twofold increase in
addressable content on a high-voltage electric vehicle.

Our unique holistic approach to designing, developing and manufacturing system-level solutions for
electrified vehicles make Aptiv the partner of choice for OEM customers and has contributed to continued
strong new business awards with both traditional high-volume OEMs, where we've recently been
awarded new business on a series of conquest pursuits, including with a leading major European OEM
for innovative, long-range electrical vehicles that will begin launching in 2022, and with nontraditional
battery-electric-vehicles-focused OEM customers, where we've increased our share of wallet with an
industry leader who's been expanding both their vehicle offerings and their global reach. As a result, high-
voltage electrification continues to be our fastest-growing product line, with revenues increasing at a 40%
compounded rate for the next few years, reaching roughly $1 billion by 2022.

Turning to Slide 10. Never has Aptiv's mission of enabling a safer, greener, more connected world had
more meaning than it does today. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a much broader perspective on how
the global community views safety both inside and outside of the vehicle. We've all become more sensitive
to our environment and have had a glimpse of a greener world with fewer cars on the road and planes in
the sky. And every day, we're all reminded of just how connected the world is and how much more it could
be as more of us work remotely.

We are proud of the progress we've made this year in our enterprise-wide commitment to corporate social
responsibility, which can be explored in our 2020 sustainability report that was published in September
and includes our sustainability framework, new 2025 commitments for each of our foundational pillars,
which include people, product, planet and platform and newly adopted GRI and SASB reporting standards,
which supplement our adherence to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Our ability to meet these commitments on sustainability is built on a cultural foundation of always doing
the right thing the right way. We believe that our long-term success and ability to create value for all our
stakeholders are directly linked to building a more sustainable business and a directly related positive
impact we have on our people, our portfolio and our planet.

I'll now hand it over to Joe Massaro for an overview of our financial results.

APTIV PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. After a challenging second quarter, global automotive
manufacturing has continued its recovery in the third quarter against the backdrop of improving customer
schedules and increasing launch activity, resulting in the strong financial results shown on Slide 11.

Revenues of $3.7 billion were up 3% over last year as vehicle production declined 4%. Due to the benefits
of our flexible operating model, adjusted EBITDA was $581 million, roughly flat compared to the prior
year, reflecting robust sequential improvement in production volumes, strong cost management and cost-
reduction activities, partially offset by the ongoing operating costs associated with COVID. In light of the
stronger recovery and need to ramp capacity quickly in the third quarter, we concluded our short-term
austerity measures implemented earlier in the year, resulting in less than $5 million of benefit in Q3.

Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.13 and reflected lower operating income, promotional JV
results and increased share count as a result of the June equity issuance, partly offset by favorable tax
expense. Operating cash flow was strong at $559 million, reflecting working capital management and cash
conservation efforts, partially offset by higher cash restructuring costs. Lastly, capital expenditures were
$117 million, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of roughly $50 million.

Looking at the third quarter revenue in more detail on Slide 12. Globally, we benefited from both stronger
vehicle production as well as increased demand for active safety systems and electrical architecture. North
American revenues declined 3%, primarily due to year-over-year program launch timing. We continue
to see demand for core SUV and truck platforms and expect to return to strong growth and growth over
market in the fourth quarter.

In Europe, the trend of strong double-digit market outgrowth continued as the production rebound
benefited from active safety and high-voltage electrification programs. And lastly, China growth outpaced
the market and our expectations as a sharper recovery in sales led to production upside with our major
customers.

Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety and User Experience revenues increased
3% in the quarter, reflecting 7 points of growth over market with all product lines contributing. AS
& UX EBITDA declined 24% driven by the costs associated with new launches and the inefficiencies
associated with lower vehicle production volumes as well as price declines in the quarter. As a reminder,
for comparability purposes, the automated driving spend that is now part of Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai
joint venture, is excluded from the prior year results.

Turning to Signal and Power Solutions. Revenues were up 2%, reflecting 6 points of growth over market.
Strong growth across the segment, particularly in Europe and China, was driven by new launches,
increased electrification and industrial end-market recovery. EBITDA in the segment declined 2%, which
included the additional COVID operating costs as well as costs associated with launches and production
ramp.

Turning to the next slide and the outlook for the rest of the year. Looking at the fourth quarter specifically,
we expect continued variability in customer schedules and operational inefficiencies related to volume
absorption similar to what we saw in the third quarter. This is reflected in our outlook for vehicle
production in the fourth quarter of down approximately 3% year-over-year and does not assume any
meaningful extended COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns.

North America and Europe are both expected to be down low to mid-single digits as inventory rebuilds
and improved levels of demand support current production rates. And in China, we expect the pace of
underlying demand to continue, with modest production growth in the quarter. As a result, we now expect
2020 global vehicle production to be around 76 million units. But despite improved visibility in customer
schedules, the threat of plant closures and potential customer supply chain disruptions remain.

Turning to Slide 15. Based on these improved customer schedules, we are reintroducing and providing
guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. Starting with the fourth quarter on the left, we expect
revenues up 3% on an adjusted basis at the midpoint, similar to what we saw in the third quarter; EBITDA
in the range of $575 million to $625 million, reflecting a 16% EBITDA margin at the midpoint; operating

APTIV PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

income of $385 million to $435 million is expected to yield a 10.9% operating margin at the midpoint; and
EPS in the range of $0.85 to $1.

Moving to the full year, that translates into revenues in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.7 billion, down
approximately 11%, reflecting the shutdowns in the first half and 9 points of growth over market, with
equally strong contributions from both segments; EBITDA in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion,
reflecting a 12.2% EBITDA margin rate at the midpoint. This includes over $100 million in COVID-related
operating costs and approximately $150 million in austerity saving measures, which helped to mitigate the
impact of lower first half volumes.

Operating income in the range of $775 million to $825 million, and EPS is expected to be $1.65 to
$1.80, reflecting a 10% to 11% effective tax rate for the full year. Operating cash flow is now expected
to be almost $1.1 billion and includes approximately $200 million of restructuring cash as we continue
to rationalize our fixed costs in light of the lower production environment. And CapEx is $600 million,
consistent with our post-COVID revised estimate for the year.

Turning to the next slide. Looking ahead to 2021, our sustained focus on shareholder value ensures we
continue to execute our long-term strategy consistent with the financial framework we have previously
communicated. Despite the very challenging first half and lower production environment overall, we have
demonstrated our ability to deliver on this framework.

Our industry-leading growth portfolio has sustained strong above-market growth, while the work we have
done in the last several years to optimize our cost structure and improve efficiency has positioned us to
mitigate the effects of lower industry volumes and grow earnings going forward while effectively deploying
capital and enabling further growth in the recovery. While it is still early in the planning process for 2021,
we are confident in our ability to outgrow the market, which, as of today, we assume the market will be up
approximately 10% in 2021, taking global vehicle production to 83 million to 84 million units.

To put this into perspective, this is roughly 10 million units less than what we saw in 2019 and reflects an
8-year low at levels last seen in 2012. However, the long-term secular growth drivers remain intact, which
will once again contribute to growth over market in the range of 6% to 8%. As a result, we would expect
to return to double-digit operating margins in the range of 10% to 11% driven by higher volumes year-
over-year and the assumed absence of COVID-related shutdowns and our relentless focus on optimizing
our cost structure to adjust to lower industry volumes while balancing our overall capacity utilization as
the recovery unfolds.

In addition, we will continue to effectively deploy capital with a focus on value-enhancing M&A
and investments to add scale and leverage to key product lines and further position the company
for accelerated growth and margin expansion. The consistent execution of our strategy is a major
differentiator for Aptiv and an important lever for shareholder value generation going forward. We will give
our official 2021 guidance when we report fourth quarter 2020 results.

With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Joe. I'll now wrap up on Slide 17 before opening it up for Q&A.

Despite the challenges we face in 2020, we remain laser-focused on further enhancing our track record
of outperformance and long-term value creation as we execute our strategy and deliver on our vision
of the company, to leveraging our unique position at the intersection of the safe, green and connected
megatrends that are transforming our industry. The sequential strong increase in third quarter revenue,
earnings and cash flow reflects the flexibility of our business model and the execution capabilities of our
team.

As we look ahead, our ongoing efforts to provide technology solutions that solve our customers' toughest
challenges, improve our revenue diversification to have a more predictable revenue growth profile, further
optimize our cost structure to increase the flexibility of our business model, expand our profit margins to

generate more earnings which can be efficiently converted into increased cash flow and maintain a strong
balance sheet and smartly deploy capital creates a more sustainable business and delivers meaningful
shareholder returns as the recovery continues to unfold. Our confidence is underpinned by dedication and
commitment of our employees, our greatest asset. I'm grateful we have an organization that is focused on
proudly serving our customers while creating value for all of our stakeholders.

With that, let's open up the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Thanks for that commentary on, directionally, the 2021 margins. That is really helpful. I had a couple of
questions on that. In the past, at least in active safety, you've made the judgment that it made sense
to add a bit more R&D spending in the short run because there was a payback in the longer term. I was
wondering if you can give us some comments on how you see that progressing as you look out to next
year. And do you see kind of a similar dynamic with the electrification pipeline growing? Does that require
additional R&D spending in advance of the big ramp you see in the years ahead?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Rod, it's Kevin. So we feel as though, as we've said, we continue to feel and actually feel even more
strongly now that we have very, very strong competitive positions in areas like ADAS, in areas like smart
vehicle architecture and even, more recently, increasingly on the high-voltage electrification space. And
those are areas that we're going to continue to invest in to further widen our competitive moat. Those
investments are reflected in the outlook that Joe's given both for the fourth quarter as well as next year.

We think, if we continue to invest, we're uniquely positioned based on our capabilities, software,
perception systems as well as connectors, cable management and wire harness capabilities on the vehicle
architecture side to really: one, significantly accelerate revenue growth; and then two, expand margins.
So that's something that we will continue to do. But again, that incremental investment is reflected in the
outlook that Joe has provided.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. So there is some incremental spending, but it's something that you're managing here with the
growth that you've got?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes, there's incremental spending, but I think it's balanced. I think it's relatively balanced. And again, it's
reflected in our outlook.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And just secondly, I noticed that pricing looked like it ticked up to just a hair above 2%, which is, I
think, the upper bound of what we've seen in the past couple of years. Correct me if that's incorrect. But
any comments or color on what actually is driving that and how you're thinking about that going forward?

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes, Rod, it's Joe. That's a fair observation. And I would attribute that to a little bit of just some of the
lumpiness we saw in the commercial side of the business over the course of the last couple of quarters,
just -- it's similar to bookings, just when things got signed, when deals got done. So not a long-term
change to our view that we're right around 2%, but it did run a little bit hotter in the quarter just as a bit
of a backlog of agreements got completed.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

I think if you look -- Joe, correct me if I'm wrong -- first half of the year, pricing was significantly below
our typical sort of pricing range. So I think we'd say, Rod, it's a bit more of just a normalization for the full
year.

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes, that's correct.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.

Adam Michael Jonas
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just first, kind of a -- Joe, just a quick one for you. The $150 million austerity measures, as I'm thinking
'20 to '21, how much of that you think is sustainable? I know a lot of companies made these very, very
aggressive, nobody travels, cut everything, cut everything discretionary. And some of that maybe isn't
repeated. I don't know if you can give some color on that delta as we run numbers of the $100 million
COVID, maybe, God willing, not repeated, how much of the austerity continues on the other side. You
follow?

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes, yes. No, I got it, Adam. Thanks. Yes, listen, what we were able to do, for the most part, the big pieces
of austerity, the furloughs, the TLOs, obviously we brought those costs back in as we started to ramp. We
really had to. Those were the vast majority of the sort of north of $100 million of that -- of those austerity
measures. We do have things like travel and others, which you would expect at some point in 2021 to
come back, but I would frame those types of costs more in that sort of $30 million to $40 million range.

The other thing we're starting to see, and Kevin has mentioned it, I mentioned it, there are some
inefficiencies obviously just working with customer schedules, working with this environment in addition to
the COVID cost. So we're working through those. But to Kevin's comment on engineering, those are -- our
best estimates of those are in that margin outlook for Q4 and for next year. But at this point, I'd expect
sort of the turn-back-on-type cost in that $30 million to $40 million range.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes, and one thing, I think, just to underscore, I think it's important just to reiterate, over the last couple
of years, we've reduced overhead costs in this business by close to $400 million. And so we've been
aggressively attacking the cost structure over the last several years. I think one of the questions we
wrestle with right now, just given where vehicle production is and given where capacity sits, how we think
about kind of fixed cost structure, facilities, as an example, in light of an 84-million-unit global vehicle
production estimate today, balancing that, though, with -- if you look at our outlook for next year, call it,
mid-teens revenue growth.

So although vehicle production is at a significant low relative to where it's been in 2018, 2019, you look at
our revenue growth rate, knock on wood and assuming COVID stays under control, you should see fairly
significant revenue growth and kind of working into capacity that was put in place when we had a more
robust outlook for global vehicle production pre-COVID.

APTIV PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Just a next one, please. There's an argument that as suppliers roll off ICE legacy and then bring on new
EV, that it's a zero-sum game at best, maybe a less-than-zero-sum game. Are you at a point where, as
you see that transition from some ICE rolling off and being, at the margin, replaced by higher voltage,
that, that is margin-accretive or balanced? And maybe give some color.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

It's margin accretive to our SPS segment. So it's -- from a content-per-vehicle standpoint, it's over 2x
content-per-vehicle opportunity relative to ICE and it's margin accretive.

Adam Michael Jonas
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Even at this level of scale? Even though scale is still pretty darn low?

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes, yes. Yes, I know. It is today, Adam. Part of it is just -- if you think of the nature of our high-
voltage portfolio, it's so complementary to the low voltage. So there's a lot of leverage of the existing
infrastructure within SPS. I mean we've historically said our product lines breakeven between $350 million
to $500 million of revenue, which was the case with active safety and sort of gets to segment margins by
$750 million to $1 billion.

Our high-voltage portfolio basically was sort of at segment margins out of the gates. And as we march
towards sort of this $1 billion of volume by 2022 to 2023, we believe it becomes more accretive. So -- and
it's, again, it's really just leveraging that very strong low-voltage business, the same engineers, the same
equipment, that type of thing.

Adam Michael Jonas
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's a helpful dynamic. If I could squeeze one more in on Mobility and Services. I know it's small,
but what is the year-on-year growth for that business, for example, in the quarter? It's getting a lot of
investor attention, even though I know you've said it's well below $100 million kind of revenue right now.
But remind us, where is this revenue coming from? Who's paying it?

My understanding, Joe and Kevin, is that it has the potential to be regular and recurring revenue coming
off the data derived from your fleet customers. Perhaps right now, it's more one-off service revenue. I
don't know if you could just give a little color on the growth and then where it's coming from. That's it.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Well, maybe we'll -- I'll talk about it and Joe can comment on growth. So today, it's regular recurring
revenue. It's below $100 million. It's regular recurring revenue. Revenues were certainly impacted this
year based on the impact, I'd say, more of COVID, quite frankly, than vehicle production.

Most of our revenues today sit without global OEMs on a preproduction basis. We have some business
that's postproduction. And we have a significant focus on growing our position, not only within automotive
but have made progress outside of automotive in the commercial vehicle and fleet markets.

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes. It's, again, lower dollars. I'd call it flattish, Adam, this year. And part of that is because a good
percent of that business is preproduction. So they're using the technology in the plants. So obviously,
the shutdown, the global shutdowns had a significant impact on that business. They just weren't using
necessarily that tech while they were shut down for that 8 to 9 weeks. So to Kevin's point, it is sort of
disproportionately impacted by the shutdowns versus vehicle production.

We will now take our next question from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I wanted to follow back on, on some of the high-voltage business. I mean now that there are more
programs launching and certainly more programs being quoted, do you have a sense of whether your win
share on those programs is higher than maybe on low voltage? And the reason I ask is, it seems like the
larger players like yourself that are able to sort of really -- have been able to invest in that business are
probably better-positioned than maybe some of the fringe players that exist on the low-voltage side.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So Joe, that's a great question. So we should start -- from a high-voltage strategy, we're very focused
from a pursuit standpoint. So we very much focused on OEMs who have a strong market position, strong
global position and a reputation for technology and a real commitment to building out a high-voltage
portfolio. And that's both on the traditional OEM side as well as on kind of the newer battery-electric-
focused OEMs. So we've made sure that we're positioned to carve a nice position in those -- with those
OEMs, grow as they grow their product lines and as they expand geographically, to make sure that we can
grow with them.

When you look at opportunities quoted, call it, roughly 15, just a couple of years ago. This year, we'll
quote on probably close to 40 opportunities. And we have a win rate of north of 70%. Now some of that,
again, I think, is attributed to we're very focused in terms of where we're allocating it and dedicating those
resources and making sure that we're positioned with those OEMs who we really feel are going to drive
volume in the future.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. Joe, maybe just one on the fourth quarter guide. So at the midpoints, it looks
like $410 million of operating income on sales of a little bit over $3.7 billion. I mean if we adjust last year
for the GM strike and the movement of the JV, the sales are at about that level, but it looks like operating
income was about $100 million higher. And I get that there's COVID costs on a year-over-year basis of
$30 million, D&A is higher, maybe $15 million and there's some higher R&D as well. You haven't given that
number, but I don't know, maybe it's $20 million, $25 million. It still leaves a hole. And I was wondering if
you could help us understand what some of that other delta might be.

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes, Joel, listen, I think you're -- it's that engineering investment, although we are starting to lap that, to
some extent. Remember, we started putting those costs in, in Q4 last year. It's really around COVID. And
it's around some of these launch costs. We're seeing a significant uptick in launches in the fourth quarter.
We had sort of a bit of a trough here in Q3 of launches. You can kind of see that in the North American
numbers and getting ready for sort of Q4 and Q1 launches next year.

And then as both Kevin and I mentioned, these schedules are choppy. So there is some inefficiencies
around the customer schedules. Whether you want to call them customer schedule inefficiencies or COVID
inefficiencies, they're sort of all intertwined at this point. But I would say we're doing a very good job
of operating, but it's probably not as efficient as it was in a prior -- in, call it, a year ago, outside of the
strike. So you've got some of that dynamic as well. But again, pretty happy with where we are in terms of
coming back to strong incrementals and where the business is performing, given the challenges we have.

APTIV PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Yes. Joe, if I could add, just to underscore Joe's point on operating with COVID, at the same point in
time and we made the decision to make sure that we allocated excess resources. We're in the midst of
launching C1XX, F-150, S-Class for Daimler, Bronco early next year. So those are launches that we don't
want to be in a position where we impact the customer based on things we control.

So to underscore Joe's point, balancing what's going on from a supply chain standpoint today, plus the
importance of those platforms for those OEMs and a successful launch, we've made the decision we're
going to allocate incremental resources to make sure that we deliver on them.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Chris McNally from Evercore.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Two questions. One, just on the short term and one for medium term. On the short term and orders, I
think you mentioned some of the shortfall for the full year. If you adjust it for production, you'd be roughly
flat. Can I just get a clarification? When you're booking those orders, are you making forward production
assumptions of a return to normal? Because I imagine, on the lifetime value, you would use some more
normalized forward production assumptions.

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes. Chris, we basically -- and we're sticking to the methodology just to make sure we have sort of apples
for apples over multiple years. So we use IHS basically when we strike the deal. And we don't adjust prior
bookings. Kevin talked about sort of, if you did look at 2019 bookings, what the impact would be, but
obviously we haven't sort of restated any bookings. So we use IHS at the time. It's an outside service.
It's -- it allows us to make sure both internally and externally we have some consistency and can sort of
explain changes going forward and we've continued to do that.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That's great. And then I can even look at second half where the run rate, depending on Q3 or Q4,
is back to that sort of $20 billion to $24 billion as obviously IHS is -- has come up. Okay. So that's super
helpful.

The second question -- thanks so much for the '21 framework. So much seems like it will be based on the
rate of positive change at ASUE's margin, which is still obviously well below your sort of adjusted target
of 10%-plus. Could you just give an idea, in that 10% to 11% for next year, should we make a pretty big
jump on the ASUE margin year-over-year? Or is it going to take longer because of the investments?

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

No. Listen, I think it's -- I would -- and obviously don't want to get into too much detail. That was
certainly a framework, not guide. But I'll go back to sort of my comments, we continue to be on the
longer-term trajectories we talked about. Kevin mentioned the $2 billion of ASUX revenue you get into
2022. We did put additional investment into engineering this year in ASUX. But as I mentioned, we're
starting to lap that. Some of that start to go in the back half of this year.

So we haven't -- have not revised long-term margin expectations for that business. Again, I'm going
to be hesitant to sort of provide specifics until we work through. And there's a lot going on. To Kevin's
point, some of those launches, where we're staffed up are on the active safety side. So there's still a lot of
moving pieces for 2021, but certainly comfortable with the framework we talked about.

APTIV PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

To start with, I was hoping to pick your brains on LiDAR. Obviously, quite a bit of noise around it with a
few of the leading start-ups there coming to market. But from your perspective and in your conversation
with the automakers around sort of like Level 2+ and higher levels of autonomy, how prominent, how
important is the -- how often is LiDAR a part of the solution that you're invited to sort of supply? And
how are you essentially dealing with it? I know you had struck multiple agreements with different LiDAR
companies in the past. And as part of this all, what was the thinking around working with others rather
than sort of like developing some of it yourself?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. From a LiDAR standpoint, where you begin to see the need for LiDAR, and we believe it's necessary
from a technology standpoint, are on Level 3 solutions and higher, Emmanuel. We have not seen any as it
relates to Level 2+, Level 3-, Level 2. So a solid place in Level 3 and above.

Having said that, as a radar technology company, we're working very hard to advance our radar
technology, pushing to see if we can advance the technology to the point where you minimize the need
for LiDAR technology on Level 3 solutions. So advancing that technology forward. What's driving that is,
quite frankly, the desire from an OEM standpoint to bring down costs of that technology or of that solution,
providing that Level 3 solution.

Why we decided not to invest in LiDAR? We have strong capabilities in radar. We've not previously worked
on developing LiDAR solutions. There were others out there who were further along. So from a capital
standpoint, we made the decision to partner with those who are already in the business and have the
capability.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That's very good color. And then second question, a follow-up on 2021 margin outlook. How should
we think within that incremental margins as volume recover? Obviously, you're assuming about 10%
recovery in global production. If you were to think more like 14% or 15% like IHS, then what would that
do to your margin outlook for next year?

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes. Emmanuel, as I mentioned to Chris, we're not going to go into too much more detail on 2021. I
think that framework is -- we've got a lot of work to do. I think that framework, hopefully, is helpful to
folks. I do think, as you look through incrementals in the back half of the year, I think those are certainly
indicative to what we think the business is capable of doing. But again, I'm not going to get too much
more specific on 2021. We've got lots of work to do to finalize those numbers.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Itay Michaeli from Citi.

Itay Michaeli
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just on -- one more on incrementals. I know in the past, you've talked about sort of a low 20s long-term
incremental margin. Joe, any changes to your thinking around kind of that long-term incremental?

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

No. No. No. I mean, listen, you've got to work through when you really clear all of the collective COVID
noise. But as we've said a couple of times, the longer -- we've seen nothing at this point, other than this
short midterm disruption, nothing that's changed our longer-term thinking about things like growth over
market or the long-term profitability of the business.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Itay, I think one -- yes, one thing we're sensitive to, I think we want to just make sure that everyone
understands. We're dealing with a lot of COVID noise. The supply chain is tight as it relates to managing
through COVID. And that has an impact on cost. And our focus -- our priority is keeping our employees
safe and serving our customers. So that does add incremental cost to the system. And that needs to be
factored in when you think about incremental margins, incremental and decremental margins. So...

Itay Michaeli
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Absolutely. Just a follow-up on active safety. Could you quantify the market share gains you discussed
on Slide 7 and maybe talk about your win rates? And then Kevin, I think you alluded also earlier in your
prepared remarks to kind of new business models within active safety. I'm wondering if you can expand on
that as well.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure. Win rates on active safety for us are running at north of 70% on active safety solutions as
well as components. We're developing our second-generation ADAS platform, so the advancement of the
satellite architecture program, where you'll have further domain centralization. You'll have more compute,
more advanced perception systems. So the ability to scale the number of radars that are used in the
system and the ability to extract software from hardware.

So in a position where we can provide the full platform, we can provide a portion of it, which could be
anywhere between the perception system or the hardware or just the software solutions, whether it's the
underlying central fusion, the underlying software or a portion of the features, all or some of the features.
So it's providing our OEM customers -- Itay, the target is with a lower-cost solution with more flexibility for
them as well as more flexibility for us.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Brian Johnson from Barclays.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

A couple of questions. So first, a semi-housekeeping, semi-strategic is, what are your thoughts on capital
allocation going into '21 and '22 and specifically on what you might do in terms of -- or recommending to
the Board around the dividend?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

So I'll start. Joe, get into specifics. I mean we continue -- we're -- we've done a great job from a cash flow
management standpoint this year. So obviously, continued focus on increasing cash flow. Our priorities
continue to be: first, organic investment in our business, whether that's high voltage, whether it's the Gen
2 ADAS platform that I talked about, advancing our perception system capabilities, certainly smart vehicle
architecture.

APTIV PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

As we talked about back in June, we have a very deep funnel of M&A opportunities in and around the
engineered component areas, both within automotive as well as outside of automotive. That certainly is
a priority. I think as it relates to dividend and share repurchase, we'd like to let the dust settle a little bit
more on COVID before we finalize our recommendation and bring it forward to the Board.

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes. No, I'd agree with that, Brian. I think our -- again, like many things we've talked about, our long-
term strategy remains intact. That included a very deliberate capital allocation policy. We would expect,
at some point, to get back to that, but it's really a matter of timing and when we really feel comfortable
we've cleared the trees here from a broader COVID and impact perspective.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Second question, a little bit more strategic. You had a blog post earlier, a week or 2 ago, around
new cybersecurity standards. You're now breaking out connectivity and security as a -- as one of the parts
of your pie. But similar to the LiDAR question, at least I'm not aware of a cybersecurity unit within Aptiv.
Is this something that either: a, you're happy with a bunch of solutions on the market and you're bringing
it to OEMs as an integrator; or b, you have some internal capabilities and we haven't heard a lot of them;
or c, in terms of adjacencies, this is an area you might be looking at?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I -- so cybersecurity, obviously given -- and I don't need to tell you this, Brian. Just given connectivity
in the vehicle and in the various systems, cybersecurity is a bigger area of focus for OEM customers. To
support our product development capabilities, we have, I don't know, 25 or 30 cybersecurity engineers
focused on product, focused on our product and focused on the integration of what we develop as well as
what we integrate into our solutions from other providers.

We view cybersecurity, quite frankly, as table stakes. We don't view that as a commercial business. So
we tend to do work internally as well as use outside parties that, more often than not, are directed by the
OEM. So I hope that answered your question.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So that's not a capability you think about making an acquisition for?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

No. It's a capability we have. We don't view that really as a viable commercial business for a player like
ourselves. We view it as a necessary requirement, and it's included as a part of the solutions we provide
our customers.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I'm going to beat the dead horse on margins here. I appreciate the 2021 framework. But I mean is there

No, nothing.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

That's great. Okay.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Again, I think it's important, Joe highlighted this. We're dealing with, round numbers, $30 million
of COVID-related cost per quarter, right? And at the same time, dealing with supply chain choppiness or
disruptions related to Tier 2, Tier 3 electronics and component suppliers who probably are dealing with
labor availability challenges and other issues. And our focus is on making sure that we deliver for our
customers. So that's something that, as we deal with COVID, we're wrestling through.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Makes all the sense in the world. Just a second question. When you think about diversification. I'm just
curious if you could talk about the non-auto business in the quarter because the other verticals, and
particularly on the commercial vehicle side, are not quite strong as what we're seeing in the light vehicle
side. In the short term and then over time, just kind of remind us where you're trying to go with that and
what that potentially can mean for margin 1 to 5 years out.

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Yes. No, those businesses continue to be, again, relatively small. We'll finish the year with about 15% of
non-auto, non-light vehicle revenues, so commercial vehicle and industrial. Those businesses continue
to perform well. They're accretive to both the growth over market and the margin and we expect them
to continue to be. There's a couple of areas within what I'll call some of that non-auto business around
telecom, where we've seen really strong growth both through the addition of gabocom, but also on an
organic basis and well above market.

The military business on the interconnect side continues to be very strong. We tend to be more heavily
weighted towards mil aero versus commercial aerospace, so that's been helpful overall. But again, as you
think about that Engineered Components business, Winchester, HellermannTyton, continue to be accretive
to growth rate and margin and would expect them to continue to be so. That's certainly where we've --
where we're focusing those investments, both organically and inorganically.

or after November 3?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We watch it. We're watching it closely, John. Obviously, it sounds like one administration would be
more focused on clean energy here in the United States that could have an impact on our sale of high-
voltage solutions. We feel like we're well positioned and could benefit from that. Obviously, a lot of the
growth that we're experiencing is in Europe and China. With those OEMs, in under either -- scenario that
either party were to win, our view is you'll still have a certain amount of regionalization of the supply chain
due to ease on tariffs and trade. Some impact, not a huge impact.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes, yes, yes. Not like '16.

We will now take our next question from David Kelley from Jefferies.

David Lee Kelley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Kevin, Joe and Elena, I appreciate you squeezing me in here. A couple of questions. I really appreciate the
active safety slide. Just curious if you could talk about semiautonomous, maybe what you're seeing there,
customer interest in the space, things like on-the-highway autonomous driving would be great.

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So L2, L2+ is, today, the fastest-growing area from an ADAS standpoint. We've actually seen, I'd
say, a bit of a pause on L3 given cost and given the reset on volumes due to COVID. So I wouldn't say
cancellations, but delay of programs with those OEMs who were allocating resources against it.

But the fastest-growing area from an ADAS standpoint, again, tends to be that L2+, L2++ sort of area.
Active safety helps OEM customers sell. When you watch advertising for vehicles today, now it tends to be
about active safety solutions. Consumers are demanding it. OEM customers make money off of it. So it
continues to be a major area of focus for OEM customers.

David Lee Kelley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And maybe just a follow-up on that point, Kevin. Is that -- is L2+ -- should we see driver
monitoring solutions and that sort of solution set? And is that something you're doing in-house as well?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes, yes. So we've won a number of driver monitoring programs as a part of our active safety Solution
set. Obviously, it gets more advanced when you head to Level 3 solutions where you need to reengage the
driver. And certainly, even more enhanced when you think about L4, L5, but it's a product area we've been
in for roughly 5 years and have a number of program wins.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

First, just can you maybe provide an update on Motional? It's been live for a couple of quarters now. Just
where is the progress? Can you just get a sense on the progress? And I think when you announced the
deal, you were talking about plans for commercialization or to have your platform ready by 2022. Is that
intact? And what's the update on customer discussions on uptake of that?

Kevin P. Clark
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's going extremely well. So our Gen 1 platform is launching this year. Gen 2 is on track to be
launched in 2022. The integration or -- the integration of the joint venture, so bringing together the
Hyundai organization and the former Aptiv organization is going extremely well. We've opened office in
Seoul. We're expanding our technology center in Singapore. We've moved into a new facility in Pittsburgh.
A significant amount of hiring has taken place over the last 9 months. And most importantly, from a
technology development standpoint, everything is on track.

We've -- after COVID hit, we stopped our Las Vegas pilot with Lyft. That's been restarted. We announced a
partnership with Via, a city to be determined. But that will happen over the next 6 months or so. We'll pick
a city. And actually, we'll be providing rides with them. They're integrated into the public transit system
in a particular city. And then continue to have commercial discussions with several different ride-hailing
companies and we'd expect to be able to announce something in the not-too-distant future. So all on
track.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then just a second -- just a follow-up on the broader concept of just restructuring. And I think
when COVID started, you mentioned the potential to take some deeper restructuring. And obviously,
what we've seen since then is a much better recovery on the end markets than what most of us would
have anticipated, so maybe probably less footprint reduction required than what would have initially been
anticipated. So question is, where do you stand on, I guess, post-COVID restructuring?

And one of the issues in the past, I think, was challenges on being maybe too proactive on responding to
the end markets with taking staffing out and not having enough staffing in place for a volume snapback.
Is that inefficiency at all a risk? Or do you have ample sort of staffing personnel in place for a volume
snapback? So just...

Joseph R. Massaro
Senior VP of Business Operations & CFO

Dan, it's Joe. Let me take that. So we certainly, as I mentioned, we sort of ended the austerity programs
as people came back so -- and we needed people to come back to work in Q3. We have started to look
at the people side of things, think the overhead functions and such and have taken some incremental
restructuring. That benefit will flow into the back half of the year, call that sort of a $45 million number,
sort of on a full year basis, maybe a little bit more. Those plans are in place.

And as I talked about in my prepared comments, Kevin has mentioned, I mean, really what we're looking
at now for 2021 is how best to balance some of those footprint decisions and take longer term -- do you
take longer-term restructuring actions versus where do you think you're going to need capacity. And for
us, that's an effort over the next couple of months really based on where we see very strong continued
outgrowth of that 6% to 8%, plus 10% vehicle production, how quickly do we get back to sort of where
we were capacitized to pre-COVID. And I think those actions will be directly related to how fast we view
ourselves as getting back.

So that's in process. But I think we did a good job in the first half of the year with the austerity. We're
looking at opportunities for additional savings going into next year on the people side, as appropriate. And
then a longer-term, what I'll call, sort of infrastructure-type decisions will really be based around where
we see capacity. And I would just remember, and I'm -- try not to be sensitive to this, but we didn't need

COVID to tell us how to run our business more efficiently. As Kevin mentioned, we've really spent the last
3, 4 years very aggressively going at overhead costs and how to improve the overall profitability of the
business and how to fund some of the initiatives. So I think we've done a really good job over the last few
