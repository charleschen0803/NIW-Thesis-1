WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Western Digital's First -- Fiscal First
Quarter 2021 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.

T. Peter Andrew
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Shannon, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief
Executive Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements,
including product portfolio expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on
management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.
We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on
Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially.

We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-
GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that
are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.

With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Thanks, Peter, and thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss our fiscal first quarter results. I hope that
you and your families are staying healthy and safe.

Before we dive into our results, I'd like to take this opportunity to provide some color on our new business
unit structure, which we announced in September. I have strong conviction in the market opportunity
from rapid global adoption of the technology architecture built with cloud infrastructure tied to intelligent
endpoints and connected by high-performance networks. The value and urgency of data storage at every
point across this architecture has never been clearer. Customers need solutions that can best address the
requirements across a variety of use cases and end markets. The ability to capture this opportunity at
every stage highlights the criticality of having a broad portfolio of both flash and hard drive products. We
have the best and most comprehensive storage platform in the industry. And I believe over the coming
quarters, we will continue to see the compelling benefits of this strategy.

In particular, there are significant operational and go-to-market synergies with our integrated flash and
HDD portfolios, which are important competitive differentiators for WD. There is also a great deal of
customer overlap between our flash and HDD businesses. And we believe our long-standing, deep and
collaborative customer relationships will be a key factor in achieving strong performance over time. A
great example is that following the acquisition of SanDisk, we built on our strong HDD customer base
to drive impressive adoption of SSD solutions on the client side. As a result of our established trusted
relationships, our HDD customers then turn to us to also provide them with flash solutions. In fact, we
now equip all of our top 20 customers with both flash and HDD products.

Our demonstrated ability to support our customers by providing a breadth of options that gives us
confidence that we can do the same in the enterprise SSD space in the years ahead. Ultimately, we
understand our customers' needs, and we can work with them to address their evolving and growing
storage ecosystem to provide them with a wide range of solutions.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

At the same time, there are technical dynamics between flash and HDD that are very different. While
we develop innovative compelling technologies in both areas, each requires separate dedicated focus on
product development, technical strategy and execution on our road maps and product commitments.
To that end, one of my first observations when I arrived at WD was that we could do a better job of
capitalizing on these dynamics. So to help us accelerate our strategy, we have created flash and HDD
business units, each with a dedicated general manager. This new structure is designed to accelerate
growth and drive agility, sharper focus and business accountability throughout the organization.

Within each business unit, engineering and product management teams will be responsible for driving
product strategy, roadmap and pricing with overall P&L responsibilities. The GMs of each unit will work
with their peers in operations, memory technology, sales, finance, legal and human resources to drive
their businesses with accountability for results.

As part of this reorganization, Rob Soderbery joined WD in September as Executive Vice President and
General Manager of the new flash business unit. Rob is a 30-year technology industry veteran with
outstanding experience leading enviable product franchises at scale and has deep technology and product
management expertise.

Earlier this afternoon, we announced that Ashley Gorakhpurwalla is joining us as Executive Vice President
and General Manager of our HDD business unit. Ashley brings 30 years of technology experience to the
team and has spent the majority of his career at Dell Technologies and many different engineering and
business leadership roles focused on complex data center infrastructure. Most recently, he was President
and GM of Servers and Infrastructure Systems, where he had full P&L responsibility for a $20 billion
business and a global team of 4,500 technologists. We are thrilled to have both of these exceptional
leaders on board.

Now turning to our financial results. In the first quarter, results were at the upper end of the guidance
ranges we provided in August. We reported revenue of $3.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share
of $0.65. Results were strengthened by retail where we are executing a compelling innovation story
reinforced by our powerful brand recognition and reputation for exceptional performance. Encouraging
economic and market dynamics supported this performance as COVID restrictions eased during the period,
while consumer flash pricing stabilized.

In addition, continued work from home and distance learning trends drove some upside in hard drive
demand for desktops and notebooks.

In general, some of the uncertainty we saw last quarter is starting to dissipate. For example, we have
better clarity today on geopolitical dynamics, Huawei concerns and stability in consumer flash pricing. We
are also seeing positive indications around the progression of the 5G ramp and the growth of potential
gaming -- the growth potential of gaming. However, some near-term headwinds remain. Demand trends
continue to be mixed, and there have been recent COVID-related lockdowns and upsurges in several
countries. While we are not out of the woods on these macro impacts, we are more optimistic than we
were last quarter on some of these issues abating in calendar 2021.

Turning to a recap of performance in our flash business. Our broad flash product portfolio, technical
leadership, deep customer relationships, extensive distribution channel and a low-cost architecture
continue to differentiate us from our peers. Product highlights in the quarter included: within retail, we
refreshed our entire SSD product line, including introducing the ArmorLock Security Platform. ArmorLock
is a data encryption platform featuring state-of-the-art security technology and ease of use in enabling
secure storage. The first product to leverage this technology is the ArmorLock-encrypted NVMe SSD. The
initial reaction to this product has been terrific, particularly with professionals and content creators in the
media and entertainment industry.

As we enter a seasonally strong quarter, we are well positioned in the retail space and expect the fiscal
second quarter to be another growth quarter in retail. Our WD Black product line has been expanding and
continues to add innovative solutions for gamers, including the recently launched WD Black SN850. This
is our first SSD to feature next-generation PCIe 4 technology, and early reception has been very positive.
In fact, over 850,000 gamers streamed our Twitch launch in early October. Our comprehensive portfolio is

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

enabling us to provide flash products directly into consoles as well as provide leading flash and HDD retail
solutions for the broader consumer gaming market. In total, gaming represented about 10% of our flash
revenue this quarter. Gaming continues to be a promising growth area for us, and we are excited about
the future of this end market.

We continued the enterprise SSD momentum we discussed last quarter, having now completed over
100 qualifications of our second-generation NVMe products. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect to
start qualifications at additional cloud tightens in one of our largest OEMs, which will further expand
our addressable market. We have large cloud and OEM partners. Having large cloud and OEM partners
complete a qualification cycle can be a multi-quarter process with deep commitment and investment
from both parties required, but they typically lead to high-volume purchases. We are well versed in this
process, having undertaken thousands of qualifications over the past several years, which are inevitably
successful. The enterprise SSD market has immense untapped potential and remains a key area of focus
for us. I'm also confident the recent organization changes we've made will further sharpen our execution
in this critical market.

More broadly, our successful 20-year partnership with Kioxia continues to be a strength of the business.
Our joint memory technology road map remains strong with impressive BiCS4 and BiCS5 yields and
associated strong cost improvements underpinning our entire portfolio. We also regularly work with Kioxia
on future facility planning. To that end, this afternoon, Kioxia announced the construction of the shell for
Fab7 in Yokkaichi, which is expected to commence in the spring of 2021. We expect to continue our joint
venture investments for Fab7 and look forward to our ongoing successful partnership.

On the HDD side of the business, we continue to align our product portfolio towards growth markets,
particularly in cloud and smart video. These end markets demand high performance, high capacity drives,
and we are continuing to innovate in head and media design, firmware and mechanical suspension to take
advantage of this opportunity. We achieved important HDD business and product milestones in the quarter,
which highlights our commitment to innovation and our focus on sharpening execution.

First, I am pleased to announce that we reached our goal of producing over 1 million energy-assisted
drives. We are seeing strong engagement with customers as we build on our capacity to aggressively
ramp this platform. We have completed nearly 100 qualifications, including with 1 CloudTitan and have
an additional 125 qualifications in process, including with 2 more CloudTitans. We're excited about the
progress we've made and expect the 18-terabyte capacity point to be the sweet spot in the industry.

Second, on Monday, we announced qualifications have been completed on the 20-terabyte platform,
and we have already started shipping for revenue. You may recall, several years ago, we committed to
delivering a 20-terabyte product to our customers by 2020. Reaching this critical milestone is a significant
achievement and testament to our ability to deliver on our product road maps.

Finally, in our OEM and retail end markets for HDD, we saw upside in demand, driven by the work from
home and distance learning trends and expect this to continue through the current quarter. I'm very proud
of the team for the focus and commitment to achieving these important milestones, and I'm excited about
how we are positioned for success moving forward.

I'll now ask Bob to share details on our first quarter results before I talk about what we see going forward.

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, results for the first quarter were at the upper end
of the guidance ranges we provided in August. We continued to make a number of long-term structural
changes in the way we're running the business to accelerate growth and drive agility, focus and business
accountability throughout the organization. We are evaluating whether any changes are needed to our
already comprehensive disclosure as a result of the new business unit structure that Dave described.
Today, however, I will focus on our traditional disclosures.

For the first quarter, revenue was $3.9 billion, down 9% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Recall the
last fiscal year period was a 14-week quarter.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Looking at our end markets. Client devices revenue was $1.9 billion, a bit better than expected, up 2%
sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Within this end market, client SSD revenue declined sequentially
from a record level as our customers digested some excess inventory, and we faced lower flash pricing.
Notebook and desktop hard drive revenue declined sequentially as the market continued to transition to
SSD-based products. But demand was better than expected due to work, school and game-from-home
trends.

Smart video demand was better than expected as this market started to recover. Gaming revenue
experienced very strong sequential growth as we increased our shipments in preparation for the upcoming
new game console launches. And finally, mobile flash revenue grew on a sequential and year-over-year
basis, driven by demand from several China-based customers and new 5G product road maps here in the
U.S.

Moving on to data center devices and solutions. Revenue was $1.1 billion, down 33% sequentially
and 26% year-over-year. Both capacity enterprise hard drive and enterprise SSD revenue were down
sequentially due to digestion at both cloud and OEM customers.

Next, Client Solutions revenue was above expectations at $847 million, up 23% sequentially as brick-and-
mortar stores continued recovering and online and curbside pickup trends continued. Client Solutions was
down 5% year-over-year.

The work, school and gaming-from-home trend benefited both hard drive and flash-based products. Again,
highlighting the powerful go-to-market synergies of this channel.

As Dave mentioned, flash pricing in retail has been fairly stable. Traditionally, this has been a leading
indicator to pricing trends in other portions of the flash market.

Turning to revenue by technology. Flash revenue was $2.1 billion, down 7% sequentially, but up 27%
year-over-year. Flash ASPs were down 9% sequentially on a blended basis and down 6% on a like-for-like
basis. Bit shipments were up 1% sequentially. Hard drive revenue was $1.8 billion, down 10% sequentially
and down 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total exabyte shipments were down 7%. While
the average price per hard drive decreased 9% to $79, reflecting the digestion we noted for our capacity
enterprise drive products.

As we move into costs and expenses, please note all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP results
unless stated otherwise.

Gross margin for the first quarter was down 2.6 percentage points sequentially to 26.3%, slightly above
the midpoint of our guidance range. Flash K1 startup costs were $66 million. COVID-related costs were
$28 million, essentially all attributable to hard drives, down from $96 million in the prior quarter. Our flash
gross margin was 26.4%, down 4.1 percentage points from last quarter as pricing was down more than
anticipated. We continued to achieve good cost reductions, which helped to partially offset the decline in
pricing.

Our hard drive gross margin was 26.2%, down 1 percentage point sequentially due to product mix and
costs associated with the early ramp of our next-generation energy-assisted hard drives. COVID-related
costs represented about 1.1 percentage point on our hard drive gross margins.

Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.65. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $363 million, and
free cash flow was $196 million. Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and
equipment, and activity related to flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was a cash outflow of
$167 million.

In the fiscal first quarter, we reduced debt by $213 million, including an optional debt payment of $150
million. Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $3 billion in cash
and cash equivalents and our gross debt outstanding was $9.5 billion. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio
was 4x in the first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.4 billion,
flat sequentially, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.8x. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $980

million in depreciation add-back associated with the joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow
statement.

Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details.

Moving on to our outlook. As Dave mentioned, we are optimistic that conditions will improve next calendar
year. However, our visibility remains limited in the near term as a result of the uncertainty of the pandemic
and global economic contraction. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to execute effectively and build on
our strong foundation of great products, deep customer relationships and large and growing end markets.
We are working on a number of substantial product transitions that will set us up well for the long term.

By technology, we expect hard drive revenue will be up and flash revenue will decline. During the fiscal
first quarter, we experienced a pull forward in demand due to geopolitical dynamics. The most significant
was from Huawei, which represented mid- to high single-digit percentage of sales. We are now planning
on 0 sales to Huawei in the fiscal second quarter.

With all these factors in mind, our fiscal second quarter guidance is as follows: we expect revenues to
be in the range of $3.75 billion to $3.95 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin to be between 24% and 26%.
This range includes approximately $30 million in costs associated with COVID and $50 million in costs
associated with the K1 fab. We expect the fiscal second quarter to be the final quarter in which we incur
meaningful period expenses associated with the start-up of the K1 fab.

We expect operating expenses to be between $680 million and $700 million. Interest and other expense
is expected to be between $70 million and $75 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 21% and
25% in the second quarter. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.40 and $0.60
in the second quarter, assuming approximately 306 million fully diluted shares.

In summary, we are managing well in an uncertain environment and positioning ourselves in both the
flash and hard drive markets for the significant long-term growth opportunities that are ahead.

Now I'll turn it back to Dave.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Thanks, Bob. Heading into the holiday season and into calendar 2021, we are optimistic about what lies
ahead. As the technology industry evolves and grows and data becomes more critical and valuable, we
will be positioned for success by continuing our history of innovation, delivering on our product road map
across flash and HDD, building on our strong customer relationship as a trusted storage provider of choice
and continuing to sharpen our execution across the business. The recent organizational changes will be
integral to accelerating and enhancing our ability to address and capture major opportunities in front of
us. I consider change a catalyst of opportunity, and I am very excited about the future of Western Digital.

We will continue to think strategically and act thoughtfully with the best interest of our shareholders,
customers and employees in mind.
I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Joseph Lawrence Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the NAND pricing that you saw in Q3. You talked about 6% like-
for-like declines. It seems like the markets that are more observable pricing like solid-state drives were
down more than that. So a little surprised that was kind of benign, and then maybe a little bit about how
you see NAND pricing in the fourth quarter.

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Do you want to start or you want me...

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Go ahead.

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Joe, it's Bob. I'll go ahead and start. So yes, I mean, we obviously still saw pretty significant price declines
during the quarter. We were fortunate we were able to offset some of that with pretty good cost reductions
during the quarter. And we think we're going to continue to see some price pressure going forward. As
we said in our comments, in the retail channel, things seem to have stabilized. From an OEM perspective,
prices are down in the December quarter, but we're hopeful that they will begin to stabilize as well.

Joseph Lawrence Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And are you guys seeing solid-state drives be worse than like at a component level NAND sale? Or is it the
same?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I don't know that we want to get to that level of detail. I'd say it's roughly the same. I don't think
there's a big difference between the two.

Operator

Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

You mentioned that you saw a pull forward in the quarter and you sized Huawei as sort of a mid-single-
digit to high single-digit customer. I was hoping you could quantify how big the pull forward was, not just
from Huawei, but from, I guess, all your customers, particularly in China? If you do have a number? And
I guess maybe related to that, your inventory was up a little bit on a sequential basis. Was that mostly on
the NAND side? Or was it across both your businesses? And then, sorry, one more. How would you assess
your -- how would you assess customer inventory levels as of today, both on the NAND side and HDD
side?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

CEO & Director

I'll start, and then Bob can add on. So I think the pull forward, we did see some. Clearly, I think it was
fairly modest, maybe 1% to 2%. So -- and then, of course, once the commerce department rules hit, that
all stopped. The second question...

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

About inventory.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Inventory. Do you want to start with inventory, Bob?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the -- you're right, the inventory was up quite a bit sequentially. And some of that was really due
to particularly low levels of inventory in the June quarter. And most of it is on the hard drive side. And as
we have talked about this year, it's been a very disruptive supply chain. So we really are taking actions
with inventory to assure that we have the components that we need to build the products. We also are
trying to have enough inventory so we can ship on the ocean rather than in air. As you probably know, the
airfreight rates are very high coming out of Asia right now. And then finally, we are in a very significant
ramp with our 16, 18 and 20-terabyte products. So all those factors play into the increase in inventory.
And we're confident, obviously, it's mostly our newer products, we'll be able to sell that inventory.

And then I think your other question was with respect to customer inventory levels. And I would say, first
of all, in the channel, retail and commercial distribution, we think inventory levels are very normal. I don't
see any issues there. From an OEM and from a cloud perspective, we're definitely seeing some customers
who still are in the process of normalizing their inventory levels. So their inventories are still a bit high.
But again, we're hopeful that, that will get normalized in the December quarter.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. Just to reinforce one thing Bob said there. I mean the ramp on the 16, 18 product is the fastest ramp
we've ever done to a new capacity point by a significant amount. So we are getting prepared for demand
for that product as we go forward. And so yes, that's been an impact on the system as well.

Operator

Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.

Karl Fredrick Ackerman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Two questions as well, please. The first question I have is, your OpEx outlook of $690 million, I think,
is very impressive. But what are your thoughts on OpEx from that level, considering the new change in
organizational structure and initiatives on enterprise SSDs and energy-assisted nearline drives?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. So OpEx is something, I mean, clearly, we've been focused on. I mean, especially given the market
we're in. But I think the new organization structure gives us more focus to make sure we're spending
our OpEx on the most valuable thing. So I view the fact that we've got to highly experienced general
managers coming in to drive the business as continuing to drive that focus to make sure we're investing in
the right places.

So Bob, do you want to say anything in addition?

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I can just add. I mean I think that the second fiscal quarter is going to be unusually low in terms of
OpEx. We've got some seasonal factors there that are benefiting us. As we move forward, I would expect,
as we get -- as business ultimately gets back to normal, we'll start having more employees in the office,
more travel, I would say OpEx will probably go up a bit. But we are pleased with the cost controls. And I
think the new structure will give us a lot of focus.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. Somewhere we're going to keep a very close eye on.

Karl Fredrick Ackerman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Understood. For my follow-up, some investors are concerned or have been concerned that NAND
profitability will remain subdued next year as some Korean peers ratchet up NAND CapEx, despite soft
demand. I guess what sort of initiatives have you taken to respond to such a scenario? And then similarly,
because NAND prices are dictated by supply and demand, do you think it's going to take several more
quarters for NAND inventory to burn off and reach demand equilibrium? Or I guess, are your earlier
comments indicative that pricing will be more benign?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Well, I mean, so first of all, the -- I mean the market requires a lot of ongoing investment just to keep
up with the 30% demand increase in bit supply. I mean, clearly, there's -- we're working through an
oversupply situation. But we continue to have a point of view that for the most part, the industry has done
a pretty good job of being vigilant with CapEx. We're certainly -- we invest with our partner in Kioxia. So
together, we're a very big player. And we're -- we've been very much on top of CapEx, and we've really
got a tight process around that to make sure that we are investing appropriately.

On the demand side, we do see a lot of things ramping up. I mean we see -- we talked about gaming
in our prepared remarks. It was 10% of our business this past quarter. We obviously have a 5G ramp
starting now. We're hearing from our customers in '21 on the cloud side that -- I think we can all -- we all
would agree that coming out of COVID that the demand for the cloud keeps going up, and we're seeing
that. So we -- it's hard to call that to a specific quarter, but we feel better about 2021. Bob, anything you
want to add on top of that?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

No. I agree. I mean I think there's definitely some exciting trends in 2021 as 5G starts to take hold in a
more significant way. And we aren't as big in mobile. But that our competitors will be serving that market,
and that will consume a lot of bids. So I think overall, 2021 is shaping up to be a good year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess I have to ask 2 as well. So I guess the first question, if you could help us unpack the gross margin
guide of 24% to 26% in this current quarter between the NAND business and the hard disk drive business.
And relative to the HDD business, I can appreciate that you're ramping the first generation of the energy-
assist drives. But how do I think about the progression back to, call it, 30% gross margin? What needs to
happen there? And I do have another follow-up.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

So I'll take the second one first. I mean it is about the business shifting to the higher capacity points,
right? I mean we're in a big transition now to a new platform. So as that transition starts to ramp, that will
be accretive to gross margins. I think on pricing, we're getting more disciplined on pricing as well. I mean
it's a very important technology and making sure we keep our eye on that side as well is very important.
But we certainly see a path to increasing gross margins as we drive through the ramp of this capacity
enterprise product. Bob, you want to...

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And what are you assuming in the quarter, the current quarter guide?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

What are we -- I'm sorry, we're assuming on what?

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

NAND versus hard drive margin.

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes, I'll do the unpacking on hard drives. So obviously, it benefits us quite a bit as the
market shifts to capacity enterprise. And we do expect to have, over time, significantly better gross
margins as the enterprise becomes a bigger percentage of the total. In the December quarter, it turns out,
we're seeing a lot of strength in retail. And so that means the mix is unfavorable in the December quarter
from a hard drive standpoint. And we do expect that to recover as we launch the new products going into
next year. So I think on the hard drive side, we'll definitely see recovery.

On the flash side, it's really a matter of how things go with pricing. As we mentioned, we're seeing some
stabilization in the more transactional markets. And we're obviously a couple of months away from
negotiating for next quarter with the OEMs, but we're hopeful that we'll start to see the pricing situation
improve on the flash side as well.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, can you tell us just housekeeping wise, what the nearline capacity
shift was either sequentially or year-over-year growth?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We don't break that out specifically on a quarterly basis. I'll try to see if I can dig up an exabyte
number on a year-over-year basis.

Operator

Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess, first question, can you speak to how you balance the obvious need to lower your cost and
increase layer count with the fact that, that adds bits to the market? So would love to hear kind of your
philosophy today, given this persistent oversupply that we're in.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. So I think there's a number of -- I mean there's a number of levers there. I mean first of all, we're
always driving the road map forward -- the memory road map forward so we can drive the cost down,
so making sure that we keep the innovation up there is very important. And again, I've spoken about
this many times. I think that's where our partnership with -- our JV partnership, we have a lot of cloud
collaboration with Kioxia on the R&D side of this business as well, which is super helpful to driving the
best cost position. And then we want to drive that, and then there's the mix in the fab of how we -- how
fast we transition to the new nodes as far as the amount of supply we're going to get. And some of that
is based on the products we're putting it into and are those products ready to take the new nodes and
just making sure we've got that mix all right and then making sure we look at that whole equation and
understand where the industry is at on bit growth and where -- how much CapEx we're going to invest in
those transitions to the new nodes to make sure that we keep the balance right and get the cost in the
right spot.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Very helpful. And as a quick follow-up. Can you talk a bit about, I guess, where you stand in terms of
visibility to cloud recovery? Any green shoots there?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. I think as -- I think coming out of COVID, and we -- there's no doubt that there's been more adoption
of the cloud, and we're hearing good things for our customers going into '21. I think as Bob said, we see
the HDD market is kind of slightly up next quarter. And then into '21, we see greater recovery. So we're
hearing good things from our customers about demand in the cloud.

Operator

Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

You articulated 1 million drives in energy-assist currently. Where does that need to be for HDD margins to
turn back higher? And would that incremental demand for you be more on the cloud side or on-prem side?
What are you expecting to see first? And I have a follow-up.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

I think -- well, we see -- I didn't -- can you expand on the second part of the question, incremental
demand for...

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

For the high-capacity drives on cloud or on-prem.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. I think we see some softness in the on-prem market. But the cloud -- on the cloud side, we see very
good demand there. So I think that's where you'll see incremental demand. As far as what does it need to
be, I mean we're going to ramp very quickly on that platform, and we're always using that to drive yields
up across the -- especially the head yield. So we just keep driving that as high as possible, and that will
help drive the gross margins on the product. I don't know if that exactly gets to your question. But if not,
we can follow-up.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And as a follow-up, your cash CapEx for this year is -- fiscal year is projected at $1.3 billion. Your
free cash flow is not tracking to that level, at least as of yet. Should we assume that there won't be any
meaningful other progress on either reducing debt or on capital return for this fiscal year?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Well, first of all, you're right, I mean our cash CapEx will be about $1.3 million. And we're going to --
every incremental dollar of free cash flow, we're going to use to reduce our total debt. So I'm not going to
give a cash flow forecast for the year. But it's -- after investing in the business, it's the #1 priority.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

I have 2 follow-ups -- 2 questions with no follow-ups. I understand the rationale behind separating the
flash from HDD. You have highlighted key strategic rationale, which mostly focus is on the top line and
generating revenue synergy. I'm a little bit not sure about the cost synergies. It seems to me that you
would require -- you will be required to invest more in each sector before they become self-sufficient. So
any color on cost or cost synergy or cost increase per business division would be very helpful.

And then my second question has to do with the mix, hard disk drive 18, 20. It is interesting to me how
you and your peer highlighting 20-terabyte samples and high-volume manufacturing into next year.
But we'll just begin to start with the 18 terabyte. Is that simply reflecting the competitive nature of the
nearline? Or how should I think about 18 versus 20? Because to me, one could cannibalize the other. So
any insight here would also be great.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Okay. So first of all, on the flash and HDD side, it's about focus on the road map and execution in different
businesses. I mean there -- I mean, obviously, they are different businesses. They're sold to the same
customers. I think that's kind of to summarize.

And I mean, what we're doing from an organization point of view is getting what I think is the best of
both worlds is the fact that we've got 1 customer relationship and we got focus on 2 different portfolios.
And that's going to lead to the best, I think, the best allocation of our resources into the portfolio. It's
going to -- I think it's going to lead to better execution. I think when I got here, this was one of the things
that I saw that if we could use more precision execution. We had -- there's just too many people that
were thinking about 2 businesses at the same time as far as how you build them and drive the road map.
And so getting that separated, yet keeping the customer-facing pieces together is the strategy from an
organization perspective.

I think from a cost perspective, they each have R&D costs associated with them. This is about getting the
most focus on that and getting -- making sure that, that investment is going into what is going to be the
highest return from a portfolio perspective.

On 18 versus 20, the 20 in is an SMR product. So it's a little different technology, and that's where you
get the additional density from. So some customers have adopted SMR and some haven't. So they're not
really -- I wouldn't really think about that as a substitute there. If you've adopted SMR, you're going to
get better density on the product. Some customers have adopted it. Some are looking at it. And it's just
another technique we can use to drive density in our products.

Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Mehdi, if you're looking at that from a volume and a revenue production basis, it should really be the
AT&T that will be the leader there.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. There's no doubt about that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.

Shannon Siemsen Cross
Cross Research LLC

First of all, David, I just wanted to say Ashley is a great hire. We've met with them several times during
his -- covering Dell, and he has a really good reputation within the company. So I'm just curious, looking
at the HDD business, what do you think are the first sort of key initiatives or area of focus for him coming
in from his server background? And then I have a follow-up.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

So first of all, thanks for the comments. I'm really, really happy that he's joining WD, and I've been super
impressed with them as we've gone through the process to identify a leader. I think the issues around
the HDD business are kind of some of the things that we've been talking about here. It's a tremendous
business. It's got -- it's pivoting from this what was a big client business into capacity enterprise. Capacity
enterprise is going to be a growth business for the foreseeable future. We have -- essentially, anybody
that's building a public cloud is going to be using HDDs, and there's not going to be a substitute for a long
time. There's going to be complementary technologies of enterprise SSDs. But there's a very, very big
difference in my mind in the SSD space, wherein on the client business, you have 2 technologies which are
essentially substitutes. And then in the cloud space, they're complementary technologies.

So Ashley is going to focus on is how do we make that -- making sure we drive through that transition and
we can deliver on, first of all, the enormous growth that our customers are asking us to deliver on. The
growth rate in the public cloud is, I think we would all agree is huge scale and stunning growth. And our
storage portfolio is the foundation of that, make sure that we can drive through this transition and return
this business to growth and that we can meet that demand and then we can also focus on the profitability
side of the equation and make sure we're delivering a high-value solution to our customers and that we're
also delivering the right value to our shareholders as well and getting that balance correct.

And I think very, very focused leadership on that by somebody that has been in the data center
infrastructure business for a long time and understands the dynamics of the architecture and comes in and
looks at the industry with a fresh perspective is something I'm very excited about.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So I have 2 questions. The first question is on hard drive. The unit number, the 1 million unit energy-assist
drive that you talked about, is that a production number or shipment number? And then how quickly does
your production capacity could go up in the next few quarters?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Yes. That's a production number. We had an aspirational goal to ship that many. We didn't quite make it
on the shipment side. We're probably several hundred thousand short of that. We still shipped a pretty
fair number. We expect to ramp that number into many, many millions over the next 2 to 3 to 4 quarters.
Like I said, this is the fastest ramping capacity point we've ever had in the company that anybody can
remember. I won't say in the history of the company because I haven't been here that long, but I talked
to a lot of folks who've been here a long time, and the pace at which we've gone from 100,000 units to
1 million units is like 1/3 of the time of the previous capacity point. And as we talked about, as we look
into '21, we're hearing from our customers good demand trends that are going to drive adoption of that
product. And we're happy where the product is. We're working through the qualifications on it at really big
customers, and it will ramp quite quickly.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So what I wanted to jump on really quick is just Intel divesting their NAND business. I realize it's new,
but you guys probably had a chance to at least look at it and get an idea for what do you guys think. So
how do you think this impacts Western Digital's NAND business going forward? Do you have any sort of
comments you can make on what that divestiture does to the industry?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

I guess what I'll say is we have a -- I want to go back to what I, a little bit, talked about earlier. We have
an unbelievably productive JV relationship with Kioxia that makes us a scale producer in the industry. And
I can imagine if I was in a position where I didn't have those scale benefits, I would be looking for how to
get them. And so it doesn't surprise me at all. And I think we'll take it from there. It's pretty new, but it
doesn't surprise me that there is some consolidation in the industry.

Operator

Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.

Steven Bryant Fox
Fox Advisors LLC

Two quick questions from me. First of all, on the Fab7 launch, when that gets -- when that starts in terms
of their ramp process there, should we expect some extra cost to be run through your income statement?
And then secondly, Dave, thinking about the new structure, you threw out a lot of different benefits to
it. If we look at, like, say, 12 months, what would be the key things that you would like to accomplish or
metrics that would say that you've had a success in terms of splitting up the business this way?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

It will be around execution and really clear road map fidelity that the road map we have in place and
where we have our engineers focus is going to deliver the best value for our customers. And then that
will, in turn, show up in our financial results. I'll let Bob talk a little bit about the cost. One thing I will say
about Fab7. It's very different than K1, first of all, in the fact that it's an expansion of an existing site. I'll
also say it's something -- in this industry, in this market, we have to continue to invest. And so it's in that
vein. And it's also just starting to build the shell of the building. So I think it's going to be a while before
we get to the details of spending. But Bob, do you want to say a little more?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Yes. I think you hit the key points, Dave. I mean we're still understanding the details of how it's going to
evolve. It looks like the shell will be coming online somewhere in the spring of '22. From our standpoint,
like Dave said, it's very different. It's an additional fab on a major site, and there will not be nearly the
incremental costs that we saw in Kitakami. So it will be pretty modest. And that's what we saw with Fab6
there as well. So it won't be anything like what we've experienced with K1.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.

Ananda Prosad Baruah
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Two quick ones, if I could. With K1 costs coming off, Bob, I think you mentioned this quarter, December
quarter will be the final quarter. Is it as simple as for -- going forward, starting March quarter just
removing the $50 million from the P&L for the balance? Well, I guess, just sort of ongoing, which is
about $200 million a year. And then I'll ask you -- ask my follow-up. It's pretty short, too. In your
prepared remarks, you made mention, I think, just sort of -- and I want the context on this, expect the 18
terabytes to be the sweet spot in the industry. Can you give us a time frame on that? And really, what I'm
asking is, is that what you think for an indefinite period of time. I just want to be clear on that. So those
two things.

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. So on the second one, yes, we do expect that probably a couple of quarters out. We see all of the
big customers interested in that capacity point. I mean, obviously, at different points in time, but we're
engaged with lots of customers on that capacity point. But it will be a quarter or 2. Bob, on the K1.

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the K1, I think most of the $50 million will either be going away as it'll go out as part of the COGS
on products we're shipping or it'll be in inventory. But you're going to have a lot of dynamics between here
and the March quarter in terms of what goes on with cost of sales.

Operator

Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.

Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

David and Bob, just a couple of questions here. When you look at the NAND side, I think you had said in
the past, BiCS5, [indiscernible] gives you a much better cost on the NAND side. So just wondering what
the mix was on that side now. And how do you see that into first half?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Do you want me to take that?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

BiCS5 is still a very low percentage of the total. I mean mostly shipping into retail right now. And that will
be the case through at least the first half of the calendar year. And then I think you'll start to see more
BiCS5.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

I'd like to hear your thoughts on whether you need further HDD capacity footprint optimization.
Essentially, I want to understand if nearline demand recovery and the ramp-up of energy is just the only 2
factors that preclude you from gross margin recovery on the HDD side?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Yes. I think I mean there's a couple of things. Bob talked about a couple of things. One is COVID
expenses. We're still incurring some relatively significant COVID expenses. I hope for all of us, those are
transitory, and we get back to normal as soon as possible. We have some mix issues in there. Retail has
been strong. I think we started talking about retail being strong back in June, and it's continued. And so
that drives some demand and some mix, which is not as good as capacity enterprise. But then -- and
again, but the big picture is there's a large shift going into capacity enterprise. And as that starts to be --
as that continues to be more and more of the portfolio will drive the margins higher.

Operator

Our next question comes from James Suva with Citigroup Investment Research.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And Bob, it's probably a question for you. And I only have one question because I'm just a very simple
guy. Why aren't gross margins stronger in the quarter out? Is it due to K1 or other things? Or why aren't
margins stronger? What are the puts and takes?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

When you say the quarter out, you mean December quarter?

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

December. Yes.

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Well, again, I tried to talk about it on the hard drive side, the mix is not that good right now as we're still
seeing digestion with capacity enterprise, and we're seeing retail stronger, which tends to be a lower-
margin business. So that's kind of the story on the hard drives. But I think we're getting ourselves very
well positioned for next year there. And then on the flash side, again, we saw some stabilization in
pricing in the transactional markets, but we're seeing pressure this quarter from the OEM customers. And
hopefully, that'll start to get better from a price perspective as we move forward. But those are really the
major dynamics for the December quarter.

Just a simple question. With your new business unit structure, how does the customer see changes for
Western Digital?

David V. Goeckeler
CEO & Director

Primarily, our customers see our company through our go-to-market teams. And I think that's a part
of -- again, I've talked about this in the best of both worlds. The go-to-market team is still integrated.
They represent the whole portfolio. So I think from the -- for the most part, the customers will see the
company the same way. However, really good general managers spend a lot of time talking to customers
to make sure they really understand the market, they understand where the market is headed. So I think
customers will see 2 very experienced, very talented general managers that are talking to them about
where the portfolio is going and where their needs are going and making sure that we have those 2 things
aligned.
