Presentation

Operator

Greetings. Welcome to CBRE's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.

[Operator Instructions]

Please note, this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the conference over to Kristyn Farahmand, Vice President of Investor Relations and
Corporate Finance. Thank you. You may begin.

Kristyn Farahmand
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Finance

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results which is posted on the Investor
Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow
along with our prepared remarks as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.

Separately, we also announced some changes to our leadership team, appointing Emma Giamartino as
Global Group President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Vikram Kohli as Global
Group President, Business Intelligence.

Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements
that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations
regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth
framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and
investment activity; financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and
the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID pandemic; the integration and performance of
acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.

We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the
information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that
these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements.

For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements,
please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively.

We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-
GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures,
together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Our agenda
for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I'll provide an overview of our quarterly financial results.

Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, will provide insight on our Q2 performance, the recently
announced Turner & Townsend transaction and today's senior leadership changes. Following Bob's
remarks, Emma will discuss the quarter in detail, along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our
capital deployment activities and broader investment strategy. Then we'll open up the call for questions.

Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our second quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about
20% to a new second quarter record of nearly $6.5 billion, while net revenue grew 31% to $3.9 billion,
partially driven by a strong rebound in property builds and to a lesser extent, leasing as well as favorable
foreign currency effects.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

The quarter also saw tangible benefit from last year's transformation initiatives, which have improved our
cost structure and operational agility. Adjusted EBITDA grew 169% to $718 million, surpassing Q2 2019's
total by 53%.

Overall, adjusted EPS grew 291% to $1.36, while GAAP EPS rose 437% to $1.30. Compared with Q2
2019, these metrics were up 68% and 98%, respectively. Both adjusted and GAAP EPS in the prior
year second quarter included a $0.10 headwind from incremental COVID related costs and a terrible
contribution to COVID relief efforts. Additionally, certain venture capital investments contributed $0.02 to
GAAP and adjusted EPS this quarter.

The fact, all key financial metrics significantly surpassed Q2 2019 levels is a testament to the resiliency of
our business and the actions we have taken to create a business primed to deliver scalable and enduring
growth.

Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide 6 for Bob's remarks. Bob?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from the results Kristyn just summarized,
CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset
type, business line, client type and geography. We've moved decisively to capitalize on this opportunity
and are making investments and driving organic growth initiatives that will continue this trend.

Overall, Q2 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew at a better than 20% compounded rate from Q2 2019 with strong
growth across all 3 business segments. Each segment experienced significant margin expansion over
this 2-year period due to our disciplined expense management, along with the benefits of diversification.
Thoughtful investments, shaped by a well-developed strategy, will play a central role as we continue to
grow and diversify our business across asset type, business line, client type and geography.

Our balance sheet was very strong going into COVID and has strengthened further as we emerge from the
pandemic. We are putting some of this balance sheet capacity to work with a particular focus on investing
in secularly favored companies that enhance our ability to provide clients with customized solutions and
will benefit from a relationship with CBRE.

You saw this earlier this year when we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Industrious in the flex
space arena. And again, this month with our SPAC's sponsorship of Altus Power in the commercial and
industrial solar energy sector. On Tuesday, we announced a $1.3 billion purchase of a 60% stake in Turner
& Townsend, a global leader in project, program and cost management. This is a great brand and great
management team operating in sectors with favorable long-term growth profiles.

Turner & Townsend will advance diversification across the 4 dimensions of our business that we've been
discussing. For example, across asset types, Turner & Townsend brings us capabilities in infrastructure and
green energy where they can help support our efforts to meet our clients' carbon reduction goals. They
are the global leader in cost consultancy, a line of business where we have a small practice now.

Geographically, they move our project management business into new markets in Asia and the Middle
East, while we can help them grow in the Americas and elsewhere, and they add an array of new clients
around the world, most notably in the government sector. We look forward to hitting the ground running
with Turner & Townsend when the transaction closes later this year.

Before concluding, I'll briefly comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Over the
past several years, we've evolved our senior leadership team dramatically, identifying our most compelling
executives and putting them in roles where they can have the greatest impact on our business.

The elevation of Emma Giamartino and Vikram Kohli to Global Group President roles represents another
step in this direction. Consolidating our capital investment and finance functions under Emma reflects the
growing importance of capital allocation to the long-term growth aspirations that we outlined at the end of

last year. She has proven to be an accomplished investor of our capital, who has an exceptional ability to
work effectively with our leaders around the world to execute our capital strategy.

Vikram has rapidly emerged as a leader with a unique ability to harness data and insight from across our
business as well as from external sources. And like Emma, he has excelled at working across our global
platform. Adding our strategy and digital and technology functions to his mandate will create a business
intelligence capability that will better enable us to make powerful fact-based decisions as we guide the
company's growth.

Vikram is the first CBRE executive from outside the U.S. to ascend to this level in the company. We expect
to elevate other executives from outside the U.S. into senior global leadership roles as we continue to put
our best talent into key positions. Leah Stearns will remain with us through year-end to ensure a smooth
transition of financial leadership responsibilities.

I want to thank Leah for her vision in initiating the transformation of our finance organization, managing
finance through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis and together with Kristyn taking our Investor Relations
program to a new level, including articulating the financial framework for our long-term growth
aspirations. We wish Leah continued success.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Emma.

Emma E. Giamartino
Global Group President, CFO & Chief Investment Officer

Thanks, Bob. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging
with you in my new capacity as CFO.

With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new
second quarter records rising 47% and 130% versus Q2 2020. Notably, they surpassed our previous Q2
2019 peaks by 3% and 18%, respectively. While leasing revenue climbed 33% compared to the prior year,
it was about 18% below Q2 2019 levels, mostly due to subdued Americas office leasing.

Overall leasing revenue rose year-over-year by 26% in the Americas, 61% in EMEA and 40% in APAC.
Americas performance was about 28% below Q2 2019, while EMEA and APAC were about 21% and
14% above. We are encouraged to see recent improvements in Americas leasing with July thus far up
significantly compared to both 2020 and 2019.

As expected, property sales improved markedly with revenue growing 152% from the prior year period.
Americas, EMEA and APAC property sales revenue surged 158%, 132% and 151%, respectively. All
regions eclipsed our Q2 2019 levels with total property sales revenue about 27% above Q2 2019.

The macroeconomic backdrop is supportive of real estate investment and global capital migration
continues to steadily improve. Rising property sales also helped to catalyze strong growth in commercial
mortgage originations, which climbed to 61%. We saw particularly strong demand for acquisition and
construction financing and recapitalization.

Our loan servicing portfolio grew 20% versus prior year and 3% sequentially to over $294 billion, partially
driven by strong retention of loans brokered and originated. This led to loan servicing revenue growth of
over 15% compared to Q2 2020. Valuation revenue accelerated over 37% as transaction-related work
picked up. Activity is particularly strong in the U.S., where valuation revenue increased nearly 47%.
Finally, Property Management net revenue increased over 6%. EMEA and APAC grew strongly, while
Americas lagged due to previous decision to exit some low-margin contracts.

Moving to Slide 9. Global Workplace Solutions continued its long record of resilient growth with net
revenue rising 11%. This reflected strong growth in project management up 15% and Facilities
Management up 10%, driven by elevated local facilities management and data center assignments as well
as the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Segment operating profit rose over 33%, reflecting solid top line growth, disciplined cost management,
the benefit of a mix shift to higher-margin work and the impact of last year's transformation initiative,
which more than offset increased medical expenses.

Even accounting for about $17 million of transitory COVID-related expenses in last year's Q2, segment
operating profit growth was up 18%. Importantly, our new business pipeline continues to be strong and
well diversified with a high concentration of life sciences, logistics and technology companies, along with
new data center activity.

Turning to Slide 10. Our Real Estate Investments segment generated over $153 million of segment
operating profit, surpassing its previous quarterly high by $38 million. Impressive development operating
profit of nearly $120 million was fueled by large office property sales that commanded strong valuations
due to the high quality of the assets and tenancy.

Importantly, our pipeline and in-process portfolios both set new highs this quarter, rising to $9.6 billion
and $15.2 billion, respectively. This growth was largely driven by fee-based office and industrial work for
blue-chip occupier clients. Investment Management revenue grew 35% to $139 million fueled by a 29%
increase in asset management fees, higher acquisition and disposition fees, carried interest and favorable
FX translation.

Assets under management rose 18% versus the prior year to a new record of more than $129 billion.
Stepping up the growth of this business has been a strategic focus, and we're pleased with our progress.
The strong top line growth, coupled with careful expense management, drove operating profit growth of
38%.

Lastly, Hana's operating loss narrowed sequentially to $9 million. We expect a further narrowing of this
loss going forward as all Hana sites are now operated by Industrious, and all Hana sites except for 4
legacy units are now owned by Industrious. The future financial impact of our Industrious estate, which
will be mark-to-market as the value changes, will be reflected in Advisory.

On Slide 11, we'll look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. We now expect full year Advisory sales
and leasing revenue on a combined basis will likely approach 2019 levels with sales likely to moderately
exceed prior peak and leasing likely to be roughly 15% or so shy of peak.

We anticipate year-over-year sales and leasing revenue growth rates will likely moderate as we move
further into the second half of the year when year-over-year comparisons will be tougher than in Q2 when
activity last year was at a virtual standstill.

As noted previously, Q3 leasing is off to a strong start, and we continue to monitor the potential Delta
variant impact on transaction volume. We've learned over the past 15 months that office leasing is highly
correlated with companies returning to the office. Given this, as we started to see some U.S.-based
companies modestly delayed return to office states, we believe there is a potential for this to impact the
strong recovery we've seen quarter to date.

Across the rest of our Advisory business, we expect revenue to rise in the low double-digit range versus
the high single-digit growth we anticipated previously. We also expect our more robust Advisory revenue
projections will flow through into incremental margin expansion relative to our previous expectations.

Moving to GWS. We are modestly raising our expectations for segment operating profit while maintaining
our revenue forecast in the high single-digit range. Net revenue is expected to slightly exceed this range.
We're benefiting from a shift in service mix and exemplary cost discipline. As a result, we now expect GWS
segment operating profit to grow at around the high teens rate this year, a slight improvement from our
previous expectations.

Our updated GWS expectations include some incremental operating expense investments in the second
half and do not include any benefit from our announced Turner & Townsend transaction. Looking at REI,
we expect this segment nearly double 2020's record high profitability.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

In Investment Management, we expect revenue to surpass $500 million and profit to rise at least at a
high teens rate from the $140 million achieved in 2020. We project development operating profit to more
than double versus 2020 and to roughly triple its 2019 contribution of $122 million. We are developing
products in strong markets and sectors with supportive fundamentals, and have a solid pipeline for asset
monetization.

This is expected to translate into Q3 operating profits that are likely to be at least as high as Q2. Given the
robust pipeline and in-process activity, we are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business
and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth.

Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue should significantly exceed the level achieved in
2019, even though we expect a modest uptick in corporate expenses as compared to that year. The return
of high-margin sales revenue, the effects of last year's transformation initiatives and strong development
gains are drivers of the improved outlook.

Overall, we now project our 2021 adjusted EPS to surpass our 2019 pre-pandemic peak of $3.71 by a
wider margin than we expected at the end of the first quarter. As usual, we will realize more than half of
our earnings in the second half. But given our year-to-date performance, those earnings will be slightly
more weighted to the first half than they have been in most years.

Flipping to Slide 12. Over the last year, we've allocated about $2 billion in total, including about $1.9
billion for capital expenditures, investments in sponsorships and partnerships and M&A inclusive of
our pending Turner & Townsend transaction while returning cash to shareholders by buying back
approximately $88 million of shares.

Still, net leverage remains modest at just 0.2x pro forma for the expected closing payment of the Turner &
Townsend transaction. We have significant capacity to invest in growth and diversification using our four-
pronged investment approach consisting of sponsorships, partnerships, acquisitions and building our own
resources and capabilities.

Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strategic moves we've made over the last year and market
leading position give us great confidence that we can deliver compelling and scalable growth for years
to come. Looking ahead, we believe we are firmly on track to achieve the growth aspirations we outlined
in February, at least low double-digit average annual earnings growth through at least 2025 absent a
downturn with a meaningful upside from incremental capital allocation.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question is just to clarify a comment you made about first half versus second half earnings. Is that
to mean that the first half of 2021 will be greater than what you think second half will be or just that the
split is a little bit more even? I just want to make sure I understood the comments.

Emma E. Giamartino
Global Group President, CFO & Chief Investment Officer

It's that the split will be a little bit more even. So the first half comp for 2020, obviously, is much easier
than the second half. So we're expecting the shift in our earnings to be more weighted, to move more
towards the first half, but we still expect the majority of it to be in the second half.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Understand. And then on the leasing side, I guess that that's not picked up as much as capital
markets, but just interested in maybe your view as to whether it's just capital markets activity a surprise
from the upside or if leasing is maybe underperforming expectations?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Tony, I would say it's both. Capital markets is doing quite well. There is a huge amount of capital
interested in commercial real estate, obviously, aimed at certain asset classes, for instance, anything
related to industrial distribution, multifamily, data centers, there is a lot of capital aimed at those assets, a
lot of trading going on. And obviously, we're big in those arenas.

So it's coming through in our numbers. As it relates to leasing, it's what it has been. There's real
uncertainty about how and when companies will go back to the office post COVID. And as long as that
overhang is out there, decisions will be made more slowly than they have been historically. Now as you've
seen over the past few months with the vaccination, more people were back in the office, more decisions
were being made, commitments were being made.

But we're -- I would say we can be certain about 2 things. We probably won't go back to where we were
pre-COVID. But we'll definitively go back to a level that's far beyond what it has been in the past 15
months, right? The decision-making process around office space has just been extremely muted, and
that's not going to sustain once we get to the other side of COVID.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Do you have a sense as to where your office leasing revenue ran in the second quarter versus, say,
2019 levels? Because it seems like a lot of the other areas are above.

Emma E. Giamartino
Global Group President, CFO & Chief Investment Officer

So office leasing revenue came down to 47% of our total leasing revenue globally. And 2020, it was 54%,
so it came down 7%.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Okay. Got it. And then just last item for me on the investment activity, you've announced or completed
so far this year, in particular as it relates to Turner & Townsend, can you give a sense as to like what the
aggregate EBITDA contribution is likely to be there?

I know you gave some numbers with Turner & Townsend, in terms of their trailing. Just trying to
understand if like you anticipate cost saves or forward growth. Just trying to understand like what the
pickup is likely to be for you all from the capital being put out the door?

Emma E. Giamartino
Global Group President, CFO & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. So historically, Turner & Townsend has shown very consistent mid-teens growth, both to net revenue
and EBITDA. And through 2021, you probably saw the revenue was pretty flat. They only dropped 3% and
EBITDA was up significantly. So going forward, we're expecting them to continue to hit those mid-double-
digit revenue, mid-teens revenue and EBITDA CAGR.

But I will say that for 2022, we're expecting EBITDA to be in line with 2021 as costs come back in post-
COVID even as revenue increases.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And anything substantial from the other investments you've made in terms of EBITDA contribution?

Emma E. Giamartino
Global Group President, CFO & Chief Investment Officer

No. We've done a few infill acquisitions for Industrious. We have not revalued that investment because it
was the reason. We expect to do that later in that year. So you won't see any impact from Industrious this
year.

Operator

Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Welcome Emma. I guess first question, maybe for Bob. When you sort of looked at Turner & Townsend,
I'm just wondering, can you sort of talk a little bit about how the contracts that they have are structured,
maybe more from just the length of contract and maybe contrast that to the contracts you have in the
GWS business?

It looks like that our EBITDA margin is much higher than what you have in GWS. But I'm just trying to
understand maybe the length of contract and the cyclicality of that business?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Well, that business has not been cyclical. As Emma said, they've been a steady double-digit grower on the
top and bottom line for the last decade. The nature of the projects they work on -- and one of the things,
Steve, that was so attractive about them are really benefiting from secular tailwinds.

So they're doing stuff in the green energy arena, in the infrastructure arena. They're doing very large
complex projects for corporates that span several years. So the decision-making that underpins those
contracts with corporates on about what's going on in the current cycle, there about what their long-term
needs are.

So we expect this to be an acquisition that contributes to the resiliency of our business. They operate at a
different margin level because they don't have the same level of pass-throughs we do. For instance, one
thing they don't do is principal contracting, which we do, which, of course, has big pass-throughs.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

But they're doing some massive projects around the world. Give you an example. They're doing the
hydro project in New South Wales in Australia that will be the largest renewable project in the country of
Australia ever. They're doing the -- they're working on the Virgin Hyperloop that's so well known in India
that's going to connect the big cities in India. That will go on for years and years and years.

My guess is their role in that will grow over time. They're involved in the program management and the
ongoing cost management when they take on projects like this. So they're very resilient and they are a
high-margin company and they're a real grower.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. So is it fair to say the contracts are at least as long, maybe longer than what you would typically see
in your GWS business?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Well, yes, big complex projects like that last for years and years. I'll give you another example. They're
working on a $6 billion redevelopment at the Toronto Airport. Any of us that have gone to airports have
seen these projects. They just -- they go on for a long time. So yes, those contracts are very long term.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then when you just sort of look at the balance sheet capacity that you've got, obviously, very
underlevered and you're looking to deploy capital. I mean do you expect to sort of find other deals like
Turner & Townsend? Or do you expect to do more small tuck-in acquisitions in, say, the Advisory business
or on the development side? I'm just trying to get more of a strategic sense for where you'll deploy kind of
the next large chunks of capital? Or is it more into buybacks? How do we think about that?

Emma E. Giamartino
Global Group President, CFO & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. So we still have a very strong M&A pipeline, and we're going to look to do more deals like Turner
& Townsend. We'll also continue to do our programmatic M&A through infill. But I think you'll see a mix
of those. And our real focus is on finding targets that can really help push our strategy forward. Our
diversification strategy across asset types, business lines, client types and geographies that Bob has talked
about with all of you many times.

And so we're going to look for strategic M&A. We're not going to force it. If we can't find the right
opportunities, we'll obviously look to return cash to shareholders.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

To what extent do you think that the surge in capital markets reflects prior transactions that perhaps
either were postponed or put on hold, took longer to close, things of that nature? Just getting questions
from investors about sustainability of the capital markets growth that you're seeing.

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Jade, there was some pent-up demand that came through in the marketplace. But when you ask
about capital markets in the commercial real estate sector, you have to look at the alternative places
capital can go. And as you know, there is a lot of capital around the world and prices are high in most
asset classes, stocks, et cetera.

CBRE GROUP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

And so real estate has proven to be a much better asset class over the last decade, and there are certain
portion -- certain assets within real estate that appear to be particularly strong. And we've talked about
them over and over, multifamily, data centers, anything industrial.

Anything, by the way, in the office arena that are new high-quality buildings with great tenants, especially
tech tenants. There's a lot of capital for those buildings still. And so what you're seeing is a lot of capital
out there in general. A considerable portion of it, this concluded the commercial real estate is a good place
to be and then some asset classes within commercial real estate that appear to be performing extremely
well with lots of headway to continue to perform well. And so yes, there was a little pent-up demand
coming through, but our view is that this is going to sustain for years.

Jade Joseph Rahmani

And can you talk to the mix perhaps across the overall revenue profile of CBRE today by property type?
How much would be derived from office? How much would be from those other sectors that you've
mentioned?

Emma E. Giamartino
Global Group President, CFO & Chief Investment Officer

So on the -- I gave some of the stats on leasing before. We're at 47% office globally, 32% industrial. On
the sales side, office is down to 18% and industrial is at 28%.

Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

The Advisory Services margin improvement was notable. I was wondering how much you think reflected
the increased capital market mix? And how much do you think relates to some costs that perhaps are
running below normalized levels, such as marketing spend, T&E, things of that nature?

Emma E. Giamartino
Global Group President, CFO & Chief Investment Officer

I think it's a mix of both. We have some higher margin revenue coming on. And then we do have
some costs that are onetime in nature and will come back. But we think the majority of that margin is
sustainable.

Our next question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I was just wondering if you could help on Trammell Crow and just the development business, if there's a
way to put some sort of rule of thumb or guidepost around. You build something for your clients. It gets
monetized and you produce $1 of profit. How much of that goes back on average to CBRE? And then of
that amount, how much goes into EBITDA after you pay your people?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Tony, I'll talk about that and it's very relevant to the structure we put in place, by the way, with
Turner & Townsend. So the Trammell Crow Company model generally works the following way. When we
generate earnings, there's 2 levels of compensation commitment that go to our developers and those who
manage our development business, and that totals around 40% of the total profit that then gets -- the
other 60% goes into our earnings.

That's the way that works. So when you look at this Turner & Townsend model that we've now just
executed on or we will close on later this year, very, very similar structure. One of the reasons we're

so excited, Trammell Crow Company has thrived subject to this structure. We think Turner & Townsend
will drive subject to the structure, very motivational to the professionals in the business, very aligning
between the company and the professionals in the business.

And you've seen the results, you've seen our profits now in Trammell Crow Company are over 6x what
they were pre-financial crisis when we bought that business.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So just to make sure I understand that. So like, for instance, if Trammell Crow builds building for $100
and sells it for $130 and you get this $30 of profit, let's say, your institutional partners, they get the bulk
of that? Like what piece of that do you think goes to CBRE, is it like 20% or?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Well, it differs on -- some development deals we'll do on balance sheet, not many, but some we will,
particularly if they have a user identified. And then we have various kinds of structures. But for the
most part, if you look at the total project profit that comes out of a deal, maybe 30% of it comes to us,
sometimes more than that. And then we apply those splits that I just described between the company and
the developers.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. So that $30 then the $40 goes to the people and $60 to the EBITDA?

Robert E. Sulentic
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, I will say this, when we do build-to-suits or we do fee deals, those are 100% company-owned
projects.There's no third-party capital associated with those typically.

Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I see. Okay. Great. That's helpful to frame it with -- given that you've laid out size of what's under
construction of the pipeline. So that's really helpful.

Operator

We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back

Thanks, everyone, for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of the third
quarter.

Operator
